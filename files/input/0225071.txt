[{"Title":"A *Good* Bad Movie","Date":"11 June 2005","Score":"87 out of 99 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" If you're a hard core movie fan, you learn to appreciate good Bad Movies. There are movies that go so far off the tracks in terms of one or several essential features of film art -- casting, script, sets, pacing, editing, lighting, coherence -- that there is no way that you could, being honest, recommend them without qualifications to an unsuspecting viewer.Movies that go off the tracks in these essentials and offer no redeeming features are just plain Bad Movies. You you make fun of them, and then you forget about them.But some Bad Movies offer, amidst the badness, unique moments of grace and truth. You allow yourself to be sucked in, and you studiously ignore or forgive all the screw-ups that went into making them Bad Movies. Angel Eyes is a *Good* Bad Movie.Why Bad? Genre incoherence is the biggest problem here. Angel Eyes was marketed as a supernatural thriller that offered spooky, scary insights into fate, love, danger, and perhaps life after death. Ads, and the first portion of the movie, hinted at a weird alternate identity for one character. Was he a ghost? An angel? A devil? Would Angel Eyes be another Sixth Sense or Wings of Desire? That's all just smokescreen. I'm not revealing any spoilers by saying that no one in the movie is a ghost, an angel, or a devil; that conceit from the ads is jettisoned pretty quickly.There is a subtext of fate, destiny, love and death, but that isn't worked really hard, either. That whole subtext could have been skipped and you'd still have pretty much the same movie.The movie you get is a movie about traumatized people finding love and rebirth. And that is one great theme.Another problem with the movie is its misunderstanding of how quickly people can recover from trauma. But, hey.I say but, hey, because this movie has a lot going for it, and it's worth seeing for what it has going for it.Jim Caviezel is an underrated actor. He's not wooden; he's subtle. It's tragic that we've gotten to an era where audience's eyes can't appreciate a quiet actor in the Gary Cooper mode.Caviezel is a worthy inheritor of the Gary Cooper mantle. He's stunningly handsome, has a big, gorgeous body -- he's a former basketball player, and it shows -- and he possesses Cooper's quiet masculine tenderness and humility.All these qualities have allowed him to strike the perfect note of a very male spirituality in a number of films, from Frequency to Thin Red Line to Pay It Forward to The Passion to Angel Eyes. In his early scenes, when the movie doesn't want you to know quite what he's about, he is perfect as a perhaps ghost-angel-devil-weirdo homeless bum-savior.He's equally good, later, as an entirely corporeal lover.He plays a wounded man, and Caviezel has the gifts to convey his character's inner pain. You believe that he cares as much as he does about what wounded him; you believe that his wounds could have done to him what the movie wants you to believe they did to him.Jennifer Lopez is equally good. Face it -- Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress. Yes, she appears on tabloid covers. Yes, she made Gigli. Yes, she poses in naughty clothes a lot. Yes, she is a Puerto Rican from the Bronx.And you know what? She's a fine actress. Don't let her non-silver-spoon pedigree keep you from appreciating what she can do on screen.Lopez is as good as a cop here as she was in the more celebrated film, Out of Sight. She's winning, charismatic, natural, and lovely to look at. Even in a white t-shirt and navy blue cop uniform slacks, she is beautiful.Like Caviezel, Lopez plays a wounded character ready to be reborn by love. She's equally as good as he, but she conveys her different wounds in a different way. One wounded person retreats; another lashes out in violence. It's interesting to see which party picks which method.Sonia Braga is in this movie. Any movie with Sonia Braga in it can't be all bad.Victor Argo, in a very small part as a very flawed man, is JUST PERFECT. 100% believable and heart-wrenching. I'll never forget his moments locked in silent misery, a misery he causes and a misery he feels.Finally, there is a not-to-be-missed scene between an abused family member and the abuser. A character speaks into a video camera at a family reunion and ... the scene just took my breath away. At that point I wanted to cry and surrender my full respect to the movie, in spite of everything it had done wrong so far.Don't let bad reviews prevent you from seeing this movie. Nothing's perfect. There's enough heart and beauty here for the discerning viewer to appreciate.

It's a film with a lot of misplaced evaluations. For instance, Jennifer Lopez was nominated for a Razzie award but the film shows a very fine effort from the lady. Again some comments on the photography infer the late cinematographer Piotr Sobocinsky has done a shoddy job because obvious Toronto landmarks appear in a film set in Chicago. This again is a fault of the Director and editor, not the cameraman who was one of the finest in his business (Kieslowski's Dekalog and Three Colors--Red). An intense viewing of the film affords the viewer to appreciate the opening shots, the alley shots, and the corridor shots that evoke feelings. It is quite different from the typical Hollywood camera-work.There are flaws in the film. The film jumps to situations without a build up--Catch appears on a life saving situation, seemingly out of nowhere; two beers appear on Catch's table in the restaurant, without him ordering the second; no mention is made of why Catch chose this name; etc.Yet despite those faults the film sails through as fine entertainment because of fine believable performances from Caviezel, Lopez, Sonia Braga, and Shirley Knight. The casting of these four was perfect (thank you Lopez for insisting on Caviezel!). The film is great entertainment because the film refrains from sex and promotes fine values--including family values, reconciliation, dealing with bereavement and doing good to make a better world. How many films are brave enough to deal with such subjects today without depicting sex and violence?The film touches on subplots that could have been fleshed out--Catch's lonely neighbor who invites him share a pizza, Catch's friend who recognizes him at the restaurant but Director Mandoki clearly steers clear to present the two psychologically wounded persons and their healing by coming together through a sheer accident. The film may be very Christian in character but it presents a very secular, humane scenario that will uplift any viewer. Though unevenly woven, the film has several sequences that show Mandoki has fine capabilities. One only wishes he took greater care of details.Flaws apart, the film is above average cinema that the publicity has shrouded by misplaced evaluations. "},{"Title":"Absorbing, human, and very good characters. *** (out of four)","Date":"12 June 2001","Score":"40 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  ANGEL EYES / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French	Luis Mandoki's Angel Eyes begins as a melodramatic tragedy that feels as if it's missing something. Its centerpiece is a love story between an unlikely couple who save each other's lives under different circumstances. At first, the film plays with interesting ideas about fate, love, destiny, mystery, and the past, but does so with stunning blandness. The male lead, James Caviezel, plays Catch, a mysterious character with an absorbing, revealing past. But his inceptive existence switches back and forth between two negative impressions Catch is either a balmy character, or Caviezel delivers a boring, uninteresting performance. To my pleasant surprise, however, by the time the movie reaches its emotionally effective climax, it proves these original perceptions to be wrong.  	Jennifer Lopez stars as a tough Chicago cop named Sharon Pogue. She patrols the crime-ridden South Side of Chicago with her police buddies, including her partner and friend Robby (Terrence Dashon Howard). In the same neighborhood lives Catch-who sleeps in an empty apartment and delivers goodwill to many around him. He wanders around the area as if he is in some kind of existential daze, thus some believe him to be a lunatic, but for most, he appears to be a peculiar but harmless figure.	Both of these characters have undergone deep emotional struggles. The vast majority of the conflict in Angel Eyes lies inside the characters. I do not want to give away any of the movie. Therefore, I must be terse in my explanation. Experiencing violence early in her childhood, Sharon has taken a stand against her father's abusive ways and is still paying the price; her entire family disowned her. However, her parents have invited Sharon to an upcoming marriage celebration. Should she attend, forcing her to come to terms with inner demons and face her father for the first time in years?	Angel Eyes provides no easy answers for its characters. Sharon's private and public lives are well developed and intriguing. The film gives her a lot of dimension-I especially like her family related aspects. I will not reveal any more information about Catch; based on the advertisements, his different people will have different expectations of his identity. By explaining anymore about him, I risk giving away a large portion of the movie. Although the film does not contain startling identity twists or surprising ninety degree turns, it is very deliberate about what information is revealed at what time-thus the lack of information in the beginning. Angel Eyes deserves to reveal itself on a full scale, rather than me giving its plot away right here and now.  Luis Mandoki has a certain knack with directing love stories that disclose their plot at the perfect moment. In 1999, his film Message in a Bottle examined another troubled soul coming to terms with his future. He does the same kind of thing with Angel Eyes. He's keeping a lid on his demons as Sharon does with hers, explains Mandoki about the character's behaviors. It's only when they fall in love and then risk losing that love that they are forced to examine who they really are, present and past.	Screenwriter Gerald DiPego creates character's who connect with the audience. The story is about the conflict between isolation and connection, says DiPego. We become isolated because we're afraid of opening up to each other, especially these days. On the other hand, there's a longing inside of us to connect. I think our salvation lies in keeping connected. 	As Angel Eyes concludes, each of the two character's has come to terms with their troubles and past. What they discover, I will leave up to you to find out. This is an uncommonly absorbing picture because we believe these characters live in our world, not in face their most private and deepest fears, and, although nothing is truly solved by the end of the movie, for Sharon and Catch, for better or worse, their problems become a different, more fulfilling internal battle. some movie fantasy. So often movies end with a fluffy, soft attitude for their characters-but not in Angel Eyes.

When in fact, this movie is a great love story. Jennifer Lopez plays Sharon Pogue, a tough female police officer, who is still recovering from an abusive childhood. Apparently when she was seventeen, she called the cops and got her father (Victor Argo) arrested after he beat her mom (Sonia Braga) up. She hasn't been in contact with her family since then; until now, when the family reluctantly invites her to a ceremony renewing her parents vows. The there is Catch Lambart, played by Jim Caviezal. He is a wanderer who lives in an apartment equipped with about three items - a bed, a light, and a table. Catch never smiles; however, he does walk around looking for good deeds to do. The two emotionally torn people meet when Catch tackles Sharon's assassin who is seeking vengeance of the death of his brother. The two quickly fall in love. But now Sharon wants to know about Catch's past, which he wont say a word about. And basically the rest of the movie is about the Sharon trying tragicly dealing with her abusive childhood, Sharon trying to find out more about Catch, and Catch knocking down the wall he built around his past. I can honestly say that Jennifer Lopez delivers one of her best performances surrounded by the character of Karen Sisco in Out of Sight, and her should-have-won-an-oscar performance in Selena. Jim Caviezal also did a great job, keeping it real. But Jennifer Lopez is the major power-hitter in this movie. Jennifer never had to belch an emotion out, it was natural for her. Guys, ask a girl on a date and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

I spotted Jim Caveizel (or however on earth you spell his name) and put down the remote as he is an actor that I admire and respect.  Of course JLo then came into the scene and my instinct was to pick up the remote and flick the channel but I didn't and I am glad that I made that decision.  Not being a fan of JLo I have never seen Angel Eyes and had no reason to seek it out either on video or on the TV but hell when you are in a motel with limited cable options you don't have alot of choice right?  Nevertheless, I was thoroughly delighted that I left the remote where it was and watched this movie because in the end I loved it.  I loved it more for the subtle points than the big hollywood this is a romance you better weep points.  Hang up and I'll call your machine in this day and age how relevant is that? how many people (if they would be honest) would much rather talk to a machine than the person because it is impersonal and they can save face?  The teeny tiny aspect of him playing the notes of the trumpet on her back as they were dancing... okay so I am married to a musician so that resonates with me but it spoke volumes, no matter how much he had tried to block it out, his soul was still there, and in his soul was his music.  I thought both leads played their roles with skill and conviction.  I was never quite sure (until the end of course) if Catch was a good guy or a bad guy, and I liked the fact that it kept me guessing.  As I said I am not a JLo fan, in fact I could be described as quite the opposite but in this movie she played her part beautifully, with conviction and totally believably.  Jim Caveizel as always was understated, calm and played his role with a sympathy that is rare to see.   Loved this movie, and cannot wait to see it again.  I will agree with everyone however about the advertising hype that surrounded it, they ended up portraying it as a psychological thriller, if they had stayed true to the story and advertized it for what it was, a beautiful romance, I think it would not have died as it did.  Shame on the publicity people for burying such a fine film.

This is probably the biggest reason why nobody went to see this movie when it went to the cinema. Only when it hit the video stores, did people start wo watch.

Secondly, she's very good in this film. The film opens at the scene of a car accident and a female police officer (Lopez) is telling the survivor who is all banged up that everything will be okay and to look at her. Then the film shifts to a year later and Officer Sharon Pogue is a Chicago cop who doesn't relate well to others except other cops and hates the whole dating process. While in a diner with her fellow officers she notices a man (James Caviezel) across the street looking at her and then suddenly a car drives by and starts shooting the place up. Sharon takes chase after the car crashes and chases a youth down into a secluded area when she is ambushed and the youth gets her gun and is ready to kill her when out of the blue the man who was staring comes out and saves her.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Later in a bar she meets him again and talks to him. She asks him his name and all he says is Catch. She's intrigued by him and he says he likes her but he says very little about himself. He wanders the streets a lot and also helps a handicapped woman named Elanora (Shirley Knight) with groceries. Meanwhile, Sharon has family trouble and her parents (Sonia Braga and Victor Argo) are going to renew their vows and she's not sure if she should go. When she was a young girl she called the police on her abusive father when he was beating her mother and after all these years he still has not forgiven her.This film was directed by Luis Mandoki who also has shown in earlier efforts that he has a good flair for portraying relationships with believable emotional attachments. The problem is the area of the story surrounding Catch. We know right from the get-go who he is and what he's hiding. The film goes just a tad too long and of course there is an upbeat ending. I think it would have been totally appropriate to have a more open ending with some questions on the future of the characters. But the film is enhanced by a very good performance by Lopez. Not only is she believable as a tough cop but we can understand her emotional problems dealing with others. Its a performance that rings true and reminded me of why so many people are intrigued by her. Her character is the core of the film (not Catch) and she does a terrific job of balancing her emotions between the tough cop and the lonely and vulnerable woman. This isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination but it is an underrated one. One of Lopez's shining moments.

It's an early chance to see the guy who was later to play Jesus Caveziel. The director creates a touching scene when they are at the relative's graveside. Lopez plays a woman alone in Chicagio with no real friends until the shy man (Cavaziel) comes into it. They form a rapport over their shared insomnia. They start a disastrous relationship as it is afflicted with a cat and mouse game with both playing hot and cold. Because of their isolation and loneliness, the film is concerned with the need with forgiveness of self and others, reconciliation and redemption through a relationship. This is demonstrated through Cavaziel's previous secret life which he is running away from like the Lopez character. I can recommend this movie as I really enjoyed an intelligent and psychological work that had the courage to direct Lopez in something more challenging than popcorn liked Anaconda. Prior to this the most convincing thing I'd seen her in was in a couple of sketches by the actor Stephen Armourae and that was just pencil, paper and pastel. I hope she continues to be cast in these more demanding roles.

It's a shame the producers chose to use perhaps the worst marketing ploy in the history of film.Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is a lonely woman in Chicago with no real life to speak of.  She is estranged from her family, has problems with insomnia, and her only friends are the people she works with.  Enter Catch (Jim Caviezel), a shy, quiet man who saves Sharon's life.  They both seem to have problems with insomnia and reclusive behavior.  They start a cat and mouse game - she brings him to her apartment, he seems to want to leave, he wants to come back, she tries to kiss him, he doesn't want to be kissed.  She stands him up, he gets upset, then he doesn't seem to care; so, she follows him into his apartment, etc.  It seems like it would get repetetive, but the story is actually quite good.Lopez gives a good performance, probably second only to her portrayal of Karen Sisco in Out Of Sight.  Caviezel is good at these sort of parts, and seems to be in danger of being stereotyped as the guy that weird stuff happens to.  People often complain that the two of them have no chemistry together, not realizing that this is the whole point - their relationship is made intentionally akward by director Luis Mandoki, most likely to make it seem all the more impressive that they still want to be with each other.I have one big problem with the advertising, and two smaller problems. They tried to make this seem like some sort of cop thriller - it is not. You'd think by watching the trailer that Catch is a menacing person, the opposite of what the character really is.  They should have made this film out to be what it really is - a chick flick about an unlikely couple with no chemistry who love each other enough to stick with each other anyway. Consequently, the film only brought in about $24 million.Which brings me to my second problem, the budget.  Why did this take $38 million to make?  I noticed that this was released by Warner Brothers, and distributed by two different production companies, internationally.  That was unnecessary.  They could have easily made just as good a film for a lower budget.  Even with Lopez's $9 million paycheck, the rest could have been shot for $5 million, putting the total budget at $14 million.SpoilerAlso, Catch seems a bit too spacey.  There perhaps should have been more attempts to humanize him, which could have been done without killing the aura of despair around him.  I also didn't get the sex scene - the character didn't seem like the type to have sex with someone after only a few weeks.End spoilerDespite these last few problems, I rated this film very highly, as it is one of my favorites.  I just noticed the bad parts from watching it so many times.  Don't be fooled by the advertising - is it worth seeing.

But for some reason, I stayed through the whole film during the third viewing, and I'm glad I did. Now, the problem with 'Angel Eyes' is the incoherence during the entire first hour. The story unfolds into something different each time while not staying within the frame of the main story. It's confusing. It's misleading. That works for some movies but not for 'Angel Eyes'. The reason why I had walked out earlier was because at some point the movie really drags but once the characters confront their own pain, the conflicts are presented and somewhat resolved. I appreciate Mandoki's attempt in telling the story of two lonely characters One who is traumatized by a past event that changed his life and the other who has been neglected (almost disowned) by her family because she did the right thing. In spite of the mess in the beginning, he gets most of it right towards the end. The confrontation scene between Sharon and her family at the 'vow-renewal party' and the scene where Catch visits his wife and child's grave are very well executed. I liked the chemistry between Caviezel and Lopez. James Caviezel delivers a quietly subtle performance. It seems as though the part was made for him. Jennifer Lopez is a mixture. While she was terrible in some scenes, there were some shining moments of excellent acting, especially in the beginning and the latter half. She also carries off the copper role very well, just like she did in 'Out of Sight'. So, I guess it wasn't such a bad watch as I had thought earlier. Just needed some patience.

Rather, it is the story of a romance between Sharon and a mysterious stranger named Catch, which begins when he saves her life while she is confronting a violent criminal. Catch is a strange figure who lives alone in a deserted building and who wanders the streets performing acts of kindness to strangers. Sharon finds herself emotionally drawn to this baffling young man, who appears simple-minded but gentle, fey and vulnerable yet nonthreatening, and the two begin a romantic relationship. As the film progresses, we realize that Catch had a previous life very different to the one he leads now. We learn, for instance, that his real name is Steven Lambert and that he is a talented jazz musician. There are also hints of a secret in his past which has left him with an overwhelming sense of guilt; we eventually learn what that secret is, although I will not reveal it here. Sharon also has psychological problems arising from her difficult relationship with her family, particularly with her abusive father, which started when she reported him to the police because of his violent behaviour towards her mother. The main themes of the film are the need for forgiveness- of oneself as well as of others- reconciliation and redemption. We see how Sharon and Catch deal with the shadows of the past which are threatening to destroy their chances of happiness. Unlike some, I did not see Catch as a Christ-figure (possibly those who did were influenced by the fact that the same actor, Jim Caviezel, also played Jesus in Mel Gibson's recent 'The Passion of the Christ') or the film as an overtly religious one. The themes of forgiveness and redemption are capable of being understood in a secular way as well as a religious one. It is, however, possibly a spiritual film, and certainly a poetic one. Certain scenes- such as the one where Catch and Sharon realize their love for one another while swimming in a disused quarry and the one in the nightclub where Catch rediscovers his love of jazz- struck me as having a particularly haunting quality. I was also impressed by the two leading actors. This was the first of Caviezel's films that I had seen, other than 'The Passion', and I was touched by his portrayal of the lonely, guilt-ridden but kindly Catch. As for Jennifer Lopez, I was pleasantly surprised. On the previous occasions I had seen her in films- such as the truly appalling 'Anaconda'- she struck me as being not so much an actress, more a singer who had wandered into the movie business because someone - probably her accountant- had told her it would be a good career move, without her having much idea of what would be required of her. In 'Angel Eyes', however, it seems that, by and large, J-Lo has at last realized what this acting thing is all about. Although some of her lines are occasionally indistinct, the overall impression is one of emotional and psychological truthfulness. That, in fact, can be taken as my overall impression of the film as a whole, not just Miss Lopez's performance. 7/10  "},{"Title":"Not 100% but nonetheless captivating","Date":"28 August 2006","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I found this movie really engaging, even though it's imperfect directorially.

Audiences under age 30 may classify this brooding, lethargic, romantic mystery with Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel as downbeat, impersonal, and tiresome. Neither Message in a Bottle director Luis Mandoki and Sharkey's Machine scenarist Gerald DiPego cater to neatly tying up all the loose narrative threads at fade-out nor pander to erratic attention-deficit style editing to ingratiate audiences with their lachrymose cops & lovers yarn. Instead, every scene in Angel Eyes portrays life as an experience where people sometimes cannot resolve conflicts. Mandoki and DiPego dole out plot details like bread crumbs to string us along, and this piecemeal strategy maintained my attention.Angel Eyes will either intrigue you or will infuriate you entirely with the way they draw out the inevitable. They give their characters room enough to develop, and a gifted, first-class cast exploits every opportunity. Admirably, much of this provocative, above-average, but uneven 'chick flick' springs from the characters and their reactions to the obstacles thwarting their desires. Unwisely, Mandoki and DiPego rely on some plot contrivances that undercut credibility but deepen dramatic impact.Angel Eyes opens in Chicago at the scene of a tragic traffic accident. Windy City cop Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez of Maid in Manhattan) comforts an accident victim until the paramedics arrive. Mandoki and DiPego create an intriguing aura of mystery early on in the story, because the victim remains anonymous. Cleverly but effectively, they capture the action from the perspective of the injured passenger. A year elapses, and the main plot gradually begins to unfold. Angel Eyes depicts Sharon Pogue as a tough, resourceful, fearless police woman who can handle anything that the criminal element can dish out. She tackles one big hoodlum, body slams the dastard against the hood of her police cruiser, and the cuffs and stuffs him. Later, at the precinct house, the thug gives her lip and grabs her. Pogue roughs him up without a second thought, only to have her partner Robby (Terrence Howard of Iron Man) reprimand her. Don't bust my balls, Pogue complains irritably as if she were a guy.Indeed, shunning her glamorous pop diva persona, Lopez delivers a persuasive, rock-solid performance as a dedicated but lonely, insomniac cop with a woebegone past who prefers the graveyard shift. Basically, Sharon jailed her abusive father Carl (Victor Argo of The Yards) ten years ago for beating up her mother Josephine (Brazilian actress Sonia Braga of The Rookie), and bad blood has existed ever since between them. Essentially, her father disowned her after his arrest. Surprisingly, her mother invites her to attend a ceremony where they plan to renew their marriage vows. Sharon's working class brother Larry (Jeremy Sisto of The Suicide Kings) isn't overjoyed about seeing his hard-nosed sister. Eventually, Larry batters his own wife Kathy (Monet Mazur of Mystery Men) in a fit of rage. Arriving at the scene, Sharon slugs Larry in the mouth in front of her own brothers-in-blue! The cops refuse to arrest Sharon when Larry cries police brutality.Later, Sharon is hanging out with fellow cops at a diner when black gunmen in a car wheel up and unload a fusillade of bullet at them. The fleeing gangstas wreck their car, and the cops chase them. Sharon pursues a lone gunman, and the suspect ambushes her. Shooting her twice in the chest, he takes aim at her face when a mysterious stranger intervenes. This unshaven Samaritan knocks the assailant off Sharon and saves her life! When Sharon recovers, she learns that her dark-haired hero in a trench coat calls himself Catch (Jim Caviezel of Frequency) and just happened to be across the street when the gunfight erupted. An awkward relationship blossoms from their chance encounter. Catch behaves as if he were suffering from amnesia. Despite Sharon's attempts to draw him out in conversation, he refuses to talk about himself. Aimlessly, he wanders the streets at night and performs good deeds at random. For example, Catch spots a car with its headlamps burning. Opening the door, he reaches inside to switch them off. Just as he does, the angry owner accuses him of stealing. Catch decks himself out in a wardrobe like the Nicholas Cage character from director Brad Silverling's City of Angels, but he is a flesh-and-blood entity, not an angel.Eventually, Sharon and Catch date. At a state park on a picnic, they frolick in the lake, then get intimate on the beach. Unlike most citizens who ask Sharon how many people she has shot in the line of duty, Catch praises her for her unselfish sacrifices. Their oddball but believable relationship endures its share of ups and down like most real relationships. Specifically, Sharon comes clean about herself with Catch, but he retreats into silence or anger about himself as if he were playing hard to get.Angel Eyes rarely strays from the issues at hand. This character driven drama deals with sudden death, dysfunctional families, and spousal abuse, but it offers no facile answers. Like Mandoki's earlier effort Message in a Bottle, Angel Eyes shows that life gives those a second chance at love that wants to take it. Like his even earlier movie When a Man Loves a Woman, Angel Eyes shows that some of life's problems lay beyond our reach to resolve them. Wow, how many movies seize life by the horns anymore? The romance between Sharon and Catch has depth with occasional interludes of comedy. Lopez and Caviezel share a chemistry that makes their affair seem not only credible but also interesting, too. They don't behave like brainless, sugar-coated, naive lovers. Pop tunes don't blare on the soundtrack while the principals ride around in product placement sports convertibles. Indeed, Angel Eyes takes itself seriously and gets away with this sober attitude more often than not. Only when the coincidences seem really contrived, such as when Catch jumps Sharon's assailant, does Angel Eyes blink.

The writer, and maybe the director, must've had more than a vague idea of where they were going with this film. Some scenes cause me to tear up, which is a rare commodity for any simple romance made in the last... 10 years.Jennifer Lopez is asked to play more here than the typical pretty girl who makes her way up, in one way or other, like the movies she normally lands. This took quite a bit of insight and understanding on her part, possible even an emotional connection to the movie to nail the part. Keeping all that in mind, the male main character seemed to get an even better idea of what's asked of him. The way he carried himself was almost dead-on, though possibly even overdone at times (but I blame the director for that).That said, what worked even more is the chemistry the two had going on. Never before have I seen Lopez's eyes light up the way they did with James. It seemed like they'd truly sunk into their roles, and the interaction between them felt chillingly real.What was truly underdone, however, is the family abuse issues that Lopez's character's family was going through all through the plot. This didn't seem like a movie about civil issues, and therefore the parts where they went into detail about family violence seemed a bit... off- the-wall to me. At the very least, if there was a serious connection between violence and maybe the reason Sharon became a cop in the first place, they sure failed to show it.This movie, hands down, I believe, needed more insight and more beyond-the-surface conversations. It needed less words and more visuals. It was mostly well-written, but needed some touch-ups. The transition of Catch from his old life to the estranged new one was very meekly done. There could've been more about his family, how good a father he was could've been shown, even in flashbacks. More details for the backgrounds of both characters could be in order.But mostly, though this film is very underdone, and some parts made me laugh at them more than with them, I end up seeing it again and again, and it still acts as a tear jerker to me. I'll say it again - Lopez seemed to find herself in the right place here, where much more than her natural charm was put to the test. Give this movie a try, it's.. not like the rest, not like many movies made today.

I've never seen J-Lo look so beautiful ever in a movie than this one, and for that alone this movie scores high marks.

Other typical Gen-X elements are found like troubled characters (both Jim and J has family problems), small comradely of special interest groups (the guys J hangs out with), and a bit of street gang violence. The focus of this movie is of course Jim and J, and this movie wouldn't have worked if the two main characters weren't able to carry the entire movie. But they do. And brings reality to this drama.

Perhaps, you will be surprised to find what a solid and impressive drama Angel Eyes is.Jennifer Lopes is notorious for a bad choice of films she plays in with her rather limited acting ability. But this movie is a nice exception. Here, she is very comfortable in the role of a slightly boorish and internally disturbed policewoman and, with this performance, she really hits the mark. Her co-star James Caviezel also gives an excellent portrayal of a man who is recovering from the loss of his family.The storyline itself is well-rounded, consistent and believable, leaving no blurred moments or gaps. Although the assumptions of the film may seem too melodramatic, in fact the film is not in the least cheesy or mushy. On the contrary, what we see is a very realistic and uneven development of a relationship between two complex characters with an open (not sleazy happy) ending. The message of the film is also very sound and clear - life is not a smooth simple line and you never know what will take you to your destination.The film delivers this message softly and is, definitely, worthy of your attention.

She is well cast as a tough Chicago female cop. I once had a friend who was a female cop in Washington, DC, I hung out with her cop pals sometimes, took part in their banter about their latest arrests, was even taken to see them in the cells, and all of that sort of thing is completely accurately portrayed in this film. This is obviously very much Lopez's own natural element street life and all that goes with it. I can actually believe that she could have become just such a policewoman. She should play more such roles with true grit, as they suit her better than normal romances. She actually looks completely natural when she is punching people in the face and laying them out cold. (I hope she doesn't do that at home.) Apparently she insisted that the mysterious man in the film must be played by Jim Caviezel, which was the perfect choice, and her instinct was spot on. Caviezel does a wonderful job, and his mysterious eyes are just right for someone who does not actually know whether he is dead or alive, and could be either. The deeper purpose of this film is to show the dark, swirling psychological whirlpools of Lopez's family story on the one hand and Caviezel's tale on the other hand. Lopez is superb at conveying her searing emotional turmoil, which is constantly erupting above the surface as rage. Both her father and her brother are uncontrollably violent wife-bashers. She did the right thing as a girl by calling the police when he was beating up her mother, and had him arrested. Not only did the father never really speak to her again, but the mother could not forgive her either, which is of course typical of many battered wives, who suffer from the psychological sickness of not wanting to put a stop to it, and who have married these men on purpose (subconsciously, of course); the sister-in-law is another one who is just the same. Really, there is nothing more annoying than a battered woman who secretly wants it. The irony is that Lopez herself, in going 'to the side of the law' and becoming a policewoman, ends up using her fists a lot herself, but this time to stop crime, not to beat up a spouse. This shows how violent impulses can be turned away from the bad and be used for the good sometimes. (However, special forces soldiers, who are an extreme version of this, generally end up as psychological wrecks, and I know some.) Caviezel's dilemma and the coincidence of their double meetings border on the supernatural, and talented director Luis Mandoki and equally talented writer Gerald di Pego (they earlier collaborated on the excellent 1999 film 'Message in a Bottle') stress all the most mysterious angles in this tale, which makes the whole film more profound than it might otherwise have been, without ever descending into affectation. Shirley Knight gives excellent acting support, and the whole cast are good. This is a highly worthwhile film, which takes a star who often does superficial films and puts her into something real, with excellent results.

The relationship between the two is very realistic and never too cliché. The love-scenes are cute and the ending makes you happy.

After watching 'frequency' -- which I also loved --, Caviezel also got in the list of actors I hate. He was so... slow, apathetic. But in 'angel eyes', he's just perfect! J. Lo doesn't get it right yet, but Caviezel played Catch just the way he should be. You actually feel that Catch could only act like that, look like that and react like that. The whole time he seems perfect. So it bothered me that everyone only commented about J. Lo and completely forgot about someone who did a great performance in this film.

It cured him, but he never forgave her. She comes upon a bad wreck, the mother and son die, but the father, Catch, she coaxes to hang on, he fades in and out, all he remembers are those Angel Eyes looking at him, he thought he was dying.  A year later, he sees Sharon, is attracted to those eyes but doesn't quite know why. Meanwhile, although she has a great guy relationship with her police buddies, most who are married, she is lonely and unhappy because she has no special person and she misses her father.Sharon and Catch seem like an unlikely pair, but somehow they get along, do things together, go swimming in their skivvies, and more! One night, he is attracted to a club, doesn't know why, inside he is mesmerized by the music, then he walks onstage, picks up a trumpet, proceeds to play. An old friend calls him by his real name, which he denies, but Sharon looks it up, finds photos of the wreck, remembers being there, presses Catch to come to terms with his loss.Dad never does come around to forgive Sharon, but she accepts that, she and Catch go off together, he drives.  A few words, like mine, cannot in any fashion describe how fine this film is. The dialog and acting are well-done, treats real personal loss issues without tying everything up in a neat package. Lopez continues to show us what a fine actress she is, seemingly able to play any character. The DVD is basuc, Digital Dolby 5.1 sound but with no signifucant extras.

Excellent acting and directing.","Date":"20 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  `Angel Eyes' is an excellent character study that is not likely to have much mass appeal.  It requires a very patient viewer due to its deliberate pacing and subtle presentation.  The great majority of viewers want to be actively entertained when they go to the movies and this is not that sort of film.  Viewing this film is more like trying to navigate a ship through a fog.  You have to stay alert and try to figure things out as you go.The story by Gerald De Pego is well written, presenting two very flawed characters that spend the entire story struggling to overcome a considerable amount of emotional baggage.  I give director Luis Mandoki extremely high marks for his presentation.  Mandoki takes his time and unfolds the story gradually with great nuance.  He takes great care to make sure to avoid being obvious.  Despite the fact that it is readily apparent that Catch (James Caviezel) is the same man that Sharon (Jennifer Lopez) helped in the car wreck in the opening scene (no spoiler here, they almost spoon feed this to you on the movie jacket) everything else needs to be discovered. Mandoki artfully introduces characters in a consistently nebulous way.  When we meet a new character we are not exactly sure during the beginning of the scene to whom we are being introduced and why he or she is important.  It is as if we are overhearing a conversation between two people and we are trying to figure out how they know one another.  The viewer is forced to think (a risky concept with today's fast-food-cinema mentality).  Mandoki constantly supplies us with vague information, forcing us to ask ourselves, `Okay, how does this fit in.'  It makes the film much more intriguing.My only criticism of Mandoki is that he tries to do too much with Sharon's family relationships. He makes it a full blown subplot that bogs down an already convoluted tale, taking us away from the real story which is about Catch and Sharon.  The entire party scene after the renewal of vows is completely superfluous.  The scenes of Sharon and her partner having soul searching conversations should also have been cut.  Another annoying detail is that Sharon and Catch are constantly driving around wearing no seat belts, which seems to me to be terribly incongruous given that one is a cop and the other a serious auto accident victim.The acting is terrific.  This is the best performance I have seen to date by Jennifer Lopez.  This part tests her talent with its breadth and she delivers a full ranging performance. Sharon is an extremely complex character filled with self doubt, anger and misplaced aggression.  Lopez plays her flawlessly with a delicate combination of toughness and emotional vulnerability, which is a difficult balance to achieve.  Her love scenes are tender and sincere, and her banter with fellow cops is smart and feisty.I was impressed by James Caviezel's performance in `Frequency', but I enjoyed this role even better.  Catch is an enigmatic character drifting through a period of anomie.  There is a duality to him, defeated and despondent, yet with a hint of seemingly inconsistent strength that emerges occasionally from his listlessness.  Caviezel's performance appears uneven as we watch it, yet it is perfectly presented and fits the character completely once we learn the whole story about him.  It is a marvelous interpretation of a complicated and puzzling individual.This film is a wonderful character study that is likely to be grossly unappreciated for its intricacy and strong direction.  The character development is masterfully done and the acting is superlative.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is an intelligent and sensitive story for the refined viewer.

The trailer clearly attempts to market 'Angel Eyes' as a thriller.  It is not.

In fact, the movie is character-driven, emotional and ultimately gentle. Despite its violent action and hints of the occult, this is essentially a love story, about two people - police officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) and solitary drifter Catch Lambert (Jim Caviezel) - finding each other, coming to terms with their respective pasts, and getting ready to move on. But this isn't the only loving relationship in the movie, there are several other love themes, though one or two are hardly hinted at.It's a little difficult to accept Lopez as an ass-kicking cop tackling guys twice her size. But she has a sure touch in her scenes with Sharon's fellow officers, with her dysfunctional family, and with Catch, when she convincingly conveys the insecurity of a woman trying to hide her inner hurt under an aggressive shell. Dark and handsome Caviezel is well cast as the mystery-man, also trying to hide his past as much from himself as from other people. Like many fine humanist films, not all the loose ends are neatly tied by the close, but the ending is definitely upbeat. (Personally, I think a note of bathos is struck right at the very end, but to say what would give too much away.)Incidentally, like Moulin Rouge, the film features the 40s hit tune, Nature Boy, by Eden Ahbez, but in a solo trumpet version, without the somewhat corney words.

And I'm not going to give away his character, since the truth about Catch doesn't completely unfold until the third act.  Angel Eyes is an interesting film that doesn't take the melodramatic path.  In fact, it's amazingly character-driven.  What ropes the audience in are the interactions between the characters.  It's a movie about humanity.  About family.  About facing your fears.

Jennifer Lopez plays a troubled cop who gets involved with a troubled victim, and their troubles united to lift them both. At times, it seems that the film is trying to escape its formula, and do a bit more-- and at times, it succeeds in doing a bit more.

It drops the same hints as the Sixth Sense-- The man is killed in the opening scene, we flash forward a year later- he never changes his clothes-- he runs into a kid with highlights in his hair-- and the color red keeps reappearing in his presence. --But, unless your a pre-teen with no attention span, you will never for a moment think he may be dead-- or wonder if Catch is the same guy from the accident. -Oh by the way-- in the opening scene we never see his face--why?? -- This comes off more like cornball tricks, than it succeeds in adding any interest. --I suppose that some thought was given to this script, and it is true that Jennifer Lopez is a far better actress than I would have thought her capable of.

It will be boring for you and you won't get it.  If you want a movie to watch where you won't be able to figure out everything from the first few minutes, the two main characters are real people with flaws and hard lives, and the love story has problems, this is the movie for you.

And from that whole list, there is probably one that stands out-- that one `special' moment, or the most significant-- one that was so good you'd like to relive it over and over again, or so bad that you'd like to erase it from your memory forever.  In `Angel Eyes,' starring Jennifer Lopez and James Caviezel, director Luis Mandoki takes a look at the effects of such a moment in the life of Chicago Police Officer Sharon Pogue (Lopez), and again with a man who calls himself `Catch' (Caviezel); unrelated moments from their past, that are destined to play an even more significant role in their future, when circumstances bring them together on the streets of Chicago.A drive-by shooting at a restaurant puts Officer Pogue in pursuit of one of the assailants, but as she chases him on foot, he gets the drop on her and pins her to the ground.  He has a gun to her head and is about to kill her, when another man comes out of the shadows and tackles him, saving her life. Afterward, Sharon meets with him, but he turns out to be rather evasive, identifying himself only as Catch, while refusing to say anything about what he does beyond the fact that he likes to walk the streets.  Sharon, nevertheless, is somehow drawn to this gentle, enigmatic man, and a relationship begins to develop between them.  But it's the personal issues with which each of them are dealing at the time that ultimately has an impact on what happens between them.  In Pogue's case, it's anger and frustration; but with Catch, it all remains a mystery.  And after a fellow officer takes it upon himself to check out Catch's past, all that Sharon knows about him for sure is that there is no record of him in any data base; according to the files, he doesn't exist.  As her friend puts it, `He's a ghost.'The mystery surrounding Catch is what drives this film, and Mandoki does an excellent job of presenting it.  He creates an atmosphere that cloaks Catch in shadows, yet keeps him elusive, rather than sinister.  Catch seems to float through life, calm and strangely prepossessing, yet detached and ambiguous.  He performs random acts of kindness which he takes in stride, and the only clue you have to any of this is an automobile accident which occurs during the opening credits, which leads you to believe that it had something to do with Catch, especially since Sharon Pogue was one of the officers on the scene.  At the same time, Sharon is attempting to sort out some very private matters concerning her immediate family.  And as the story unfolds, Mandoki reveals the pertinent pieces of the puzzle very gradually and paces it perfectly, which maintains the suspense and amplifies the mystery.As Sharon, Jennifer Lopez gives arguably her best performance since 1998's `Out Of Sight,' in which she also played a cop.  After her turn in `The Cell,' which wasn't bad, and the forgettable fluff of `The Wedding Planner,' it's good to see her in a challenging role, something she can really sink her teeth into.  Which she does, and beautifully.  It's tough for an actress to make a character like this believable (Tyne Daly came close in `The Enforcer,' Jamie Lee Curtis was a disaster in `Blue Steel'), but Lopez pulls it off and proves that there's more to her than just a pretty face.  She makes Sharon a very real person, entirely three dimensional, emotionally complex and a woman who seems very capable of doing what she does for a living.  She's beautiful and tough, but sensitive as well, and most importantly, Lopez makes it convincing.As Catch, Caviezel gives a memorable performance that really captures the essence of who this guy is.  And his success with this character lies in the fact that he plays him straight, making him exactly who he is supposed to be rather than trying to shade him with some kind of `dark side' to enhance the mystery ensconcing him.  He makes Catch a person you can readily embrace, who though perceived by others as enigmatic, is really only a man coping with a terrible secret and living his life as best he can.  Catch is a unique character, in that he is cryptic and accessible at the same time; and Caviezel captures his spirit with astounding acuity and nuance.  It's an honest portrayal, devoid of any pretentiousness or falseness-- quite simply an excellent piece of acting.The supporting cast includes Sonia Braga, Terrence Dashon Howard, Daniel Magder, Jeremy Sisto, J.J. Evans, Alfonso Arau, Victor Argo, Monet Mazur and Shirley Knight.  Extremely well developed and delivered, `Angel Eyes' is a story of loss and love, and redemption; but more than that, it's about `Time'-- how much we're given and how we use what we have.  Call it a reflection on mortality; it's a film that will make you stop, think and consider-- about the way things are, and perhaps how they could be-- if you'd only take the time to make one of those `special' moments that last forever.

IT is billed as like a Sixth Sense, but the only similarity is that there is a beginning and end to the movie. Don't get me wrong...this is NOT a bad movie. This is actually a good date flick/romantic drama that can bring tears to your eyes, but you're waiting for the big twist or surprise the whole time, and there are none. This is simply a straight drama about a female Chicago cop who is torn by her damaged relationships with her family, and her love interest, a nice guy who walks the streets of the city without prupose, mainly because he's in shock from the death of his wife and child a year ago. That's it.....then the rest of the movie is how they get over their internal conflicts together. Case closed. one thing I did admire about this movie, outside of the likability of both actors, is that J-Lo's character DOESN'T rectify her differences with her family. It makes for a more believable story instead of a sappy ending, BUT...the way Caviezel's character comes to grips with his internal conflicts is way cheesy, with far too much exposition to himself at a gravesite.

Angel Eyes is a very good example of the dangers of being blatantly misleading and dishonest in hopes of drawing a wide scale audience.  I for one was going to see this movie no matter what,  but I'm a bit disappointed in the way Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a ghost story or a supernatural romance a la GHOST,  THE SIXTH SENSE,  CITY OF ANGELS,  etc.  The fact that Jim Caviezel roamed the streets in a black trenchcoat unshaven seems right out of CITY OF ANGELS. Also,  why did they feel they had to include a scene where he claims that the dog he found in an alley and adopted (I thought the dog was adorable by the way) told him his name was Bob???  I didn't see any necessity in that, except as part of the marketing ploy!!! That's a shame.Because,  all gripes aside,  I really LOVED Angel Eyes. It was not a ghost story but a human story about lonely,  isolated people who have been through personal tragedy and have lived through it.  Anyone from a dysfunctioning family (and who among us isn't???) can relate to Angel Eyes,  and if you are not afraid of a movie that deals with dysfunctioning families,  I strongly recommend Angel Eyes to you.  If you liked American Beauty,  you will more than likely enjoy this. But rather than dark humor and cynicism,  Angel Eyes presents this issue in an earnest,  almost hopeful light.  The cast sparkled with life.Jennifer Lopez portrays Sharon Pogue,  a tough talking Chicago cop who spends the days taking down huge,  tattooed,  filthy-mouthed thugs and the nights alone in bed,  wide awake.  In a frantic,  violent moment she meets a stranger who calls himself Catch (Jim Caviezel) and they begin a strange relationship filled with love and joy,  yet frustration and suspicion. Like Sharon,  Catch is a haunted soul living with personal pain.  But unlike Sharon,  he refuses to open up about his past and would rather start from scratch.As for Sharon's inner skeletons,  she has been ostracized from her family because she had her father arrested for spousal abuse a decade earlier.  So much realism abounds in this movie.  Instead of being grateful to her daughter,  the mother,  wonderfully played by Braga,  is hurt and continuously makes sorry excuses for her husband's behavior.  When she discovers that her brother Larry is hitting his wife now,  the devastation is brilliantly displayed on Lopez's face.  Larry was once the go-between, literally putting himself between his dad's fists and his mother's body. Although Jeremy Sisto did not have as many scenes as I would have liked, he was excellent as Larry and gave him a face that was permanently sad, frightened, angry, ugly and damaged.  As Catch,  Jim Caviezel was marvelously poignant,  and I saw all the deep seated pain he lived with in his beautiful eyes.  Through most of the movie Caviezel looks like he is about to cry.  I don't understand critics who saw him as a dirty-looking creep who had no chemistry with Lopez.  True he is tired and unshaven most of the time,  but the chemistry they have is spiritual and emotional;  they are bound by mutual circumstances.  The physical chemistry comes later at the side of the lake.  That was one of the classiest love scenes I've ever seen.  No overt nudity,  just a very sweet and sexy shot of the two of them embracing.  I think Caviezel is very appealing as a leading man because he's tall,  handsome and has a great body as well as being a superb actor.I must comment on Jennifer Lopez as well.  A lot of people didn't like this for one reason  They don't like her.  Well,  I for one am no fan of her music,  but I really liked her in Angel Eyes.  To be honest,  I believe many actresses could have pulled off this role,  and many actresses might have done a superior job to Lopez's,  but I am compelled to say that the devotion and sincerity in Lopez's performance really impressed me.  She wanted to be in this movie,  she loved this story,  she believed in this story,  and she gave it her all.  She really made an effort to make Sharon Pogue a character you would love,  relate to and cry with,  and she succeeded.  Angel Eyes is powerfully honest,  cathartic and genuinely moving.

Here, Lopez' empty life is changed forever when she's rescued from a near-fatal confrontation with an armed criminal by handsome stranger Jim Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ), who seems to come out of nowhere. Grateful for his intervention, Lopez is unable to resist their subsequent friendship, which quickly blossoms into something deeper, until she discovers they have met before under very different circumstances...Both central characters are blighted by past misfortunes (Lopez is at odds with her family over an incident which occurred ten years previously) and both are wary of romantic involvement, which leads to the inevitable complications Lopez' hard-bitten cop is unwilling to lower her defences, while Caviezel is the angelic loner whose refusal to confront the past renders his life meaningless. There are no melodramatics and no great visual statements, and the ending swaps bombast for sentiment at every turn; Caviezel's climactic graveside soliloquy is an acting tour de force.

She cannot seem to find 'love' and instead puts her effort into helping others through her job.Catch is a lonely man who also wants to help people and, when he sees Sharon he falls for her. A drive-by shooting on a café where Sharon and her colleagues are eating at sparks a chase where Sharon finds herself shot and about to be killed when Catch saves her. Despite his weird, semi-vagrant appearance, Sharon is intrigued by Catch and the two become close very quickly.I had no idea what this film was about when I sat to watch it as I have never been a real fan of Jennifer Lopez and generally wouldn't bother to go to the cinema to see it and get put off by all the hype that seem to come with anything of hers. In a way my fresh eyes may have helped me with the start because I was interested in where the film was going and was intrigued by what appeared to be a pair of very damaged lives. This interest continued for the first hour until the writing proved itself not to be good enough to keep this up and falls into more simplistic romantic fare. The connections become convoluted, the romance unlikely yet obvious, the complex lives become summarised and glossy and all the time my interest just waned away as we approached an ending that felt like it has no relation to the opening 30 minutes. Of course it would be easy to dismiss the whole film but the first hour was interesting &#150; the sentimentality and unlikeliness of the 'couple' was kept at bay by interesting threads and downbeat writing. However as these were just forgotten as the film sinks into a romantic drama.What manages to just about keep it going (and makes the first hour so interesting) is two very good leads. Lopez is more diva than actress at the moment and, looking at her ability at times, it is a shame that her fame has overtaken her actual talent. Here she struggles a bit because she is far too sexy to be alone and far too savvy to fall for what is basically one step from a homeless guy. However she is appealing and sympathetic and it is not her fault that the material gives her nowhere to go from a good start. Caviezel is a good actor given the chance and he manages to make good work of such an unlikely character and keeps him interesting until the mystery is removed and the emotionally shutdown person becomes a great solid guy after all. The background to the characters are interesting but they are not used well and instead of being open wounds they are loose ends that the film just ties up with little problem. The lack of logic is also a pain as neither of these people would really be in the situations we find them. Support is interesting from Sisto, Howard, Mazur and Braga but they are given far too little of value to really work with &#150; and Argo in particular is just wasted.Overall this is a film of two halves. The first half is interesting and the characters, lives and acting all combine to keen the cloying sentiment at bay &#150; but it can't last and the second half falls into obvious cliché, simple answers, happy endings and sentimentality. It is a shame because it did interest me at the start but it gradually falls to bits and, by the end, I simply had stopped caring.

I also thought it about time that since Selena Lopez is finally playing a character with Latina roots.Not that there's any Latin music; the blues and jazz choices are nice, but make the inconsistent use of pop jarring.The movie probably would have worked better as a small indie, and with a lot less uses of the F-word.(originally written 5/20/2001) "},{"Title":"Somber and Beautiful","Date":"2 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I really thought the overall mood of this film was haunting.

And while these types of movies are not released at the rate of one every three and a half hours, they're often just as clichéd--they're nothing more than ho-hum expressions of mediocrity which provide as much excitement as picking scabs from your toes.Jennifer Lopez plays a hard-boiled cop who has a much stronger penchant for pummeling down crooks than listening to common sense.  By a twist of fate, or a disappointingly imperious plot point, she is rescued from death by James Caviezel, a passerby who simply calls himself Catch.  Catch likes to be benevolent towards people he turns off the lights of parked cars, alerts neighbors when they leave their keys in the door, and delivers groceries to incapacitated ladies.  Officer Lopez, on the other hand, likes to shout out expletives during the most comical or romantic scenes of the movie.The two find that they have something in common they don't like talking to people, and they prefer leaving messages on the answering machine rather than speaking to one another face to face.  By hiding behind this veil of anonymity, it becomes quickly apparent that they both have problematic inner demons to contend with, and the movie's focus is split between the romantic affair and said dissonance.Unlike the majority of all romance movies, Angel Eyes attempts to add its own idiosyncratic intellectual property by switching from one to two major problems that interfere with the relationship.  But these problems are so ineptly handled at the end, thanks in part to the incredulously colorless acting, that it shatters all the previous efforts of the movie.  The characterization, the metaphors--all are rendered useless when the film decides to mire in its own melodrama.It's at this point that you begin to shift in your seat and feel the eyes on your back accusing you of being a fool for expecting anything more than mediocrity.6/10 "},{"Title":"Sappy, stupid, awkward & hopeless","Date":"20 May 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Jennifer Lopez, portraying a Chicago cop, is able to grab 200+ lb. street-types who eat nails for breakfast, and rough 'em up good, slamming their heads against cars and walls at will, no problem.

Likewise, James Caviezel who appears to have found a niche playing introspective stupefied strong silent types. Together however they sparkle their interactions are fluid, natural and completely believable.  This chemistry enhances the many humorous scenes in the movie as well as the intimate ones. Unfortunately, these alone can not sustain the movie.The plot is filled with most of the conventions typical of the genre (a fated meeting, characters who overcome dark pasts and learn to love again.), the pacing, although initially brisk and smooth, hits a brick wall half way through the film and the Cops style bouncing-camera-schtick eventually becomes distracting.   In addition, the lengthy monologues and surprises that aren't further undermine the film.What begins as a promising love story, ultimately degrades into a lackluster exercise in mediocrity.  Wait for the video or catch it on cable.

She comes from a home in which she walked out on, from domestic violence. She doesn't get chummy with family, and her friends are only the work colleagues from the Chicago Police Department.Jim Caviezel plays Catch, a mysterious man who at first, looks like a stalker as he follows Sharon, only to have him help her apprehend a crook and saving her life in the process. Sharon starts to fall for Catch, and vice versa, but both of them have a past in which they build a wall around, and try as they want to open up to each other, they can't.However, from the minute go, you'd already have a rough idea of who Catch is, just that the director Luis Mandoki, prefers to stretch that mystery for a tad too long. You know what had happened from the circumstances, and that might irritate you as the movie plods along with the fairly obvious.And that's what the whole premise is about - 2 people trying to love and find each other, but first, have to let go of their past. Sharon has to make peace with her family, while Catch has to reconcile his, and move on. It's so simple, it makes you want to cry. The acting's deliberate, and there are minor plot points thrown in to spice up the story, but fact is, it isn't working. Perhaps for the sake of finding out exactly what happened to Catch's past life, that you might want to sit through the entire movie.Code 3 DVD with no frills attached, rent it at your own peril.

First off, when I first saw the previews for this movie I thought it was going to be some murder/mystery suspense type of movie. That is what the trailer implied, nonetheless we get stuck with a kind of destiny type love story. Don't get me wrong i'm all for a good love story like other moviegoers, but don't have me expecting one thing, and get something else in return. Second thing, it was really hard to convince me that Jennifer Lopez was playing the character of a cop. She just couldn't pull of the mentality that goes along with being a cop. I should know i'm dating a cop right now, and even he said the same thing...who the hell is she fooling? Jim Caviezel though has great potential in the film. I think it was just the film itself that dragged him down with it. Guaging from his past performances he's going to be an exceptional actor of this time. As for Ms. Lo she needs to do the Mariah thing and stick to one thing...singing. If I had my choice for casting in this movie I would have chosen someone like Angelina Jolie, or even Jodie Foster.

I understand Catch was supposed to be depressed after what happened, however by walking around like a zombie and not being able to carry a conversation in a logical direction he came across as just weird.  He reminded me a lot of the villain in the movie Psycho (the original version).Anyways, maybe his mannerisms would be understandable to Sharon if she knew about his past, but for most of the movie she didn't.  And yet, she was all to willing to let this (crazy for all she knows) guy into her life.  Sure she prodded him for information at times, saying she needed to know about him to continue the relationship, but when he didn't provide any the relationship continued anyway.  At these points most sane people would have put a stop to it, for some reason she did not.  Then at one point she told her partner that Catch is harmless.  Harmless?  The way he was acting I'd have leaned the other way personally.She was supposed to be intrigued by Catch - well I didn't buy it.  I may have if Sharon's interest would have been due to knowing she had seen him somewhere before.  If she had only said to her partner I can't let him go, I know I've seen him somewhere before, but I'm not sure where.  That would have made her interest in him much more credible in my opinion.  (Note I watched this film on TV.

Jim Caviezel, who I thought was excellent in FREQUENCY, fails to save Jennifer from looking terrible. ANGEL EYES is a pure bomb, with nothing special to remember. Walking into a theater with only ten people waiting for it to start on opening night, I did not expect much. Walking out of the theater that night with five people left, I should have expected less. It took me a long time to recover from such an awful movie experience as this month's pick of the litter I chose. ANGEL EYES, WHAT WOMEN WANT, MISS CONGENIALITY and ENEMY AT THE GATES (the latter being the worst). Finally recovering and finding the notes, I give you the synopsis.Lopez plays Sharon, a Chicago cop partially recovering from a terrible accident she witnessed a year earlier and still battling her family problems. One day she's saved from a passerby that sort of caught his fancy from the beginning. The name's Catch and from the moment they talked, they shared a lot of things in common until they grow to love each other. Together, they battle their inner demons.For ANGEL EYES, a movie with Lopez as a star attraction, there are plenty of faults. Technically in Chicago, you can see many of Toronto's main attractions (The CN Tower, Honest Ed's, Sam the Record Man in the window reflection). Sharon also claims to need no makeup, yet as soon as she looks in the mirror after a long day of work you can see it clearly. There is no need to say that Jennifer Lopez 's acting is what drove the movie into the dirt. To be fair, the overall production did half of it, Jennifer just made it easier to point the finger at. Her unbelievable acting job of handling the perps and fellow co workers would have Ed Wood Jr. 's standing ovation. Do not waste your time on ANGEL EYES.

The plot basically suggests that the two characters have met previously or known each other in the past. Catch is basically a nice guy. He delivers groceries in his spare time to a disabled woman played by Shirley Knight. Both Sharon and Catch share the same characteristics both in personality and lifestyle. Neither have much of a personal life and of course, two very attractive people such as these two characters find a connection in each other. The plot basically revolves around Sharon's own personal crisis' involving her estrangement from her parents and Catch's shady past and whether the two can put these things aside to be as one.Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is not very convincing as this character. She does not rub off as someone who can ignite sparks on the big screen whether it be as a love interest or as a comedienne (ie. The Wedding Planner).

J-lo was already starting to fall off in my opinion at this point after the cell and the wedding planner but this put the icing on the cake! the funny thing is that i kind of think that this movie is better then enough but thats not saying much at all!

I know she's pretty but why does she insist that she can act and sing.  She obviously can not.  I didn't believe a word she said in this movie.  She shows no emotion in her words, and acts almost robotic.  Terrible.  Obviously the only part she was good at was taking off her shirt in the park (but I guess she's used to doing that).

Real movie fans,listen up; don't waste your time with this movie. The plot I'll leave toother reviewers with much more time and patience on their hands, I'lljust say this; it doesn't make a lot of sense. But the good thing is,you don't care, because you're busy doing your laundry and making phonecalls while the movie drones on. There is no chemistry at ALL betweenLopez and Cazivel. Not one bit. There's no good camera work, and themusic is bad too. Don't bother with this one.

Jeremy was fine, but I didn't get to see him much. I saw JLo toooo much. It would've been fine without her. I got the sense that she wasn't connecting with her character the way she was supposed to. This is a deep emotional film that required range. I didn't sense it from her at all. I hear lapsing of an accent from the Bronx from a character who shouldn't have one. She simply needs more training. One day she might be able to do this. However, today ain't the day. Jim was startlingly in touch with the emotions and depth of feeling his character required. He seemed to be between the world of the living and the dead. The acting was good, but the movie sucked. The plot was a misfit for some reason. They were trying to make this movie something it wasn't. It belonged on tv like a Lifetime movie or something. I couldn't imagine sitting through this in a theater. They tried to convey a man's sense of loss, but in the end, YOU were lost. It was too grim and gray to make any point. But watch for Jim though.

I mean, damn!  That girl got it going on in every way possible, the total package no doubt.  I mean, just check out the way her lower back curves into her butt and I guarantee you'll have to cross your legs.Oh, too bad the movie's TERRIBLE.  God, J-Lo needs to stop making movies and go into a business where she can keep her mouth shut and display her obvious assets.  But it's not Just her fault.  Caviezel, who I thought was incredible in Frequency, is simply awful here.  Yeah, we get it, he's disturbed, traumatized, but does he have to be so annoying while he's doing it?  I felt no compassion or sympathy for his character the whole movie.  Maybe he should stick to playing Jesus in every movie.  2/10, just because JLo's hot.

It is so boring. Nothing happens.  The pace is way too slow.  And it is so silly how they have Jennifer Lopez throwing around guys twice her size as she is arresting them.  No way do I believe she is a cop.  You keep expecting some cool plot twist at the end, but you get nothing unexpected.FINAL VERDICT  If you haven't already guessed, I say skip this film.  The only thing you will get out of it is a quick way of falling asleep.

Somewhat convoluted picture wants to be too many different things cop drama, character study, love story. Despite some strong sequences, it just doesn't gel. Every now and again Jennifer Lopez surprises her critics by turning up in eclectic, non-commercial films, and this one probably looked strong on paper. But as a film, it doesn't come together, and one is left unsatisfied by the changes in tone and plot development. As for Lopez, she's only adequate here, but this may be due in part to the direction, which is weak. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Absolutely awful","Date":"19 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  This one really has no redeeming features whatsoever.  None of it makes sense.  The ludicrous characters are played by some of the worst actors alive.  It's patronising, cheap, boring and insulting to the intelligence.  Jim Charisma By-Pass Caviezel plays this mysterious geezer in a long coat, who owns a massive apartment but doesn't seem to do anything that would enable him to afford it.  Turns out his wife and kid died in a car crash.  He survived and was rescued by Jennifer Lopez's plucky, spunky, no-nonsense cop.   It gets worse.  There's a hilarious sex scene by a lake.  There's a dreadful scene where loads of cops get shot in a diner, which is both exploitative and boring.  There are kids.  There are family issues.  There is a fantastically bad shot of Lopez where it looks as if the camera was stuck on the end of her gun while she waves it around.  There is even - please, no! - a scene in which poor Jim feels strangely drawn to playing the trumpet in a nightclub and everyone is overcome with emotion.  Turns out he used to play the trumpet!    Jim also goes around doing good turns for people at the start of the movie, but this is soon forgotten.  Perhaps the writers realised it was unbearably naff and quietly dropped it. Avoid this film.  It is bloody awful.

I`m sorry if I`ve forgotten her character`s name because if you`re watching a movie starring Jennifer Lopez you`re not watching a character actress playing a role you`re watching a singer and sometimes actress trying a career move . Did anyone else think she was a rather unconvincing policewoman ? Does anyone else believe there`s no such thing as a beautiful policewoman ? There`s also many other unconvincing scenes in ANGEL EYES . Take the scene where J-LO and her black colleague arrest a violent peckerwood ( Peckerwoods are members of violent racist skinhead gangs who differ from their neo Nazi brothers in that drug taking and excessive drinking are permitted in their subculture ) , strange that this peckerwood upon being arrested by a black man and latino woman spouts a lot of sexist insults but never EVER says one racist comment ! I guess the ridiculous above scene emphasises the fact that this is a chick flick and the producers didn`t want to upset or alienate its intended audience and no doubt the intended audience will be taken with Jim Caviezel`s smooth and handsome role . Talking of Caviezel watch the scene ( And it`s another ridiculous scene where no one gets the door slammed in their face like they do in real life ) where the woman is told she`s left her keys in the door and there`s a massive painting of Christ in the background . If you`re confused as to what Jesus Christ has to do with Jim Caviezel it`s obvious you don`t watch enough movies    "},{"Title":"Uninteresting and predictable","Date":"16 July 2004","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  This mediocre made-for-TV-style thriller (that got a theatrical release due to Lopez) is dull, boring and very predictable. It features extremely bad acting (Jennifer Lopez was nominated for a Razzi) and an incomprehensibly silly plot.I don't know how this got greenlit, to be honest. It's basically about a mysterious man (played by Jim Caviezel, a.k.a.

If this movie isn't on `Lifetime' before Memorial Day next year, it will be a miracle. Ebert and Ropert must have been on estrogen pills, when they reviewed this one. J. Lo plays a cop. An angry cop. She has issues with her father, her mother, her sister -in-law, her brother, her fellow cops. She is an abusive cop. She beats the hell out of guys on her beat. A strange guy is following her around. What does she do? She invites him up to her room for sex. Then she's p***ed because he won't tell her anything but his first name or is it just a nickname? Attempted tear jerking scenes and resolution of most issues. Puke! My favorite thing in the whole movie besides the underwear ad by J. Lo; the movie starts with a multiple car accident with death and injuries. The movie ends with the happy lovers (I won't say who) drive away without their seat belts on. I'd rather watch a Snoop Doggy Dog video.

All I can say is that by the end of the film you wish they were both dead. I just don't get how somebody can be a street tough cop and still look as good as Jennifer Lopez does in this movie. This makes the movie even harder to swallow. She comes home from a date and takes off her make up and gets ready for bed. Yet when she lays down, she looks like she has more makeup on then when she started to take it off. And she sleeps in her bulletproof vest? Why doesn't she go on dates with it? Too many questions to ask about such a lame ass movie.
