I wasn't disappointed. In this era of cheap computer effects it's really refreshing to see a movie where the special effects are done the old fashioned way. For some bizarre reason I really like Vampires. The plot is somewhat clich√©d, the acting is nothing special and yet... I find myself watching this movie over and over again. Somehow the idea of a secret military force funded by the church, dedicated to fighting vampires is thrilling even though I'm not a religious man. I suppose it harkens back to the day of witch hunters. James Woods is great as the grim, dedicated man sworn to destroy all vampires and as the true shocker, the generic Baldwin appearing in the movie does a really good job as well!

Why do I give the date in that manner? I was (un)fortunate enough to see this movie in the uncut version (as shown in France), in the US version and just a few weeks ago in the German one.But first things first -- I am female and I have read so many reviews and comments telling me, that I, as a woman, should feel disgust at the alleged misogynous undertone of Vampires. I am sorry, but in none of the three versions I saw did I feel, hear or see anything which might support this allegation! Crow hated practically everyone except for Montoya and the first priest, Montoya -- while quipping left and right -- behaved quite kindly towards Lee's hooker except where she directly caused him to react violently and none of the other oneliners warrant, IMO, even a raised eyebrow regarding that special topic.Let me add that I also am not religious, with my own perceptive view of enough past wrongs done by the Catholic church, so that any of the soi-disant hate directed at that church is in my opinion well-founded given the plot. Callan's explanation of how he views god, as well as several other references by Crow and Montoya underline the basic belief of the vampire hunters while maintaining their no-nonsense attitude.With that back to why I liked the movie so much it is in its own way as stark and streamlined as the best samples of its genre; the cinematography is just perfect with the right mixture of visual and non-visual storytelling; the dialogue is engagingly humorous throughout, feels real and allows each character his or her own voice; there are several deeply moving scenes, either visually or characterwise moving, which will stay with the audience; there are enough novelties incorporated to make this rendition of the vampire theme fresh and quite frankly, I liked Carpenter's score a lot too.What wins me completely over is the very obvious fun all the actors had with their roles. James Woods was perfect as sardonic, illusion-free Crow and his brushing campiness with the tip of a finger, yet withdrawing just in time, is priceless. Daniel Baldwin makes the most of his character's arc, nicely underplaying his role, while he still manages to convey Montoya's journey by minimal changes of expression or voice. The final scene couldn't have been done any better. Sheryl Lee gives what I consider one of the strongest supports I've seen in quite a few years, whether by male or female actors, especially when you count in the scarcity of means she's handed over. Ian Griffith had several fine moments and the entire supporting cast was refreshing in their non-Hollywoody realistic, natural look and acting. The overall impression was of people enjoying what they're expertly doing.An advice to the German audience,  I noted while watching the dubbed release that the translation killed practically every single punch line and nearly all of the humor. And it *could* have been translated properly. The voice actors dubbing for Woods and Baldwin did so without recreating even a tenth of what both actors put into their voices in the original version. I do think that some of the disappointment expressed there is due the extremely low quality of the translation and dubbing. See the movie in its original language. I also can't see any reason for the loss of those scenes which were cut out of the US release when compared to the French one. The movie loses quite some strength this way.

This is one of the best scenes of the movie and sets the viewers up to think, Hey, these guys know what they're doing. They're some rough-and-ready characters.But, lo, where is the master vampire? Not to worry, he'll have his chance at revenge...later that very night, as the trained vampire hunters go to the nearest town, lay down their weapons, and begin drinking and whoring. And they knew full-well that a master vampire, whose subjects they'd just fried, was still lurking about! How stupid can you be???!!!The movie marches on, showing carnage and betrayal as the plot is advanced. (And, frankly, it's not a bad plot). But there are many holes, many questions that are not answered, like, Why was such an mysterious and important item (a cross that would permit a vampire to walk in the sunlight) guarded by such a inept group of robe-clad nincompoops, who, according to their own harried screams, knew The day has arrived!? If they knew that a particularly horrific day was inevitably going to arrive, why, then, did they lack even a modicum of defensive capability. Why were they caught frantically scampering around like a herd of panty-clad Dr. Smiths (from TV's Lost in Space...Oh the pain, the pain of it all...). Oh well, we'll never know, and they're too dead to tell us. Be that as it may, this movie does have some good dialogue, interesting characters, a unique idea or two, and an actual plot--which makes John Carpenter's Vampires stand head and shoulders above most of the horror movies that are out today.

I don't know how to answer this other than what I love about it James Woods! Vampires is a movie brought to us by horror mastermind John Carpenter who almost gave up film making because he became disgusted by how Hollywood got so greedy. I'm so glad he decided to make Vampires because if not for his touch, I think this movie could have been really bad or bland. I'm very sad to say that Vampires seems to get overlooked or shadowed when people bring up great vampire movies a lot. I think because Blade was also released the same year, so it just got lost in 1998. However, I still love this movie, it's a western horror fright film that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat. A lot of people complain about James Woods being too camp in his role&#x85;since when did that become such a bad thing? He's so awesome in this movie and really makes it exciting.Mercenaries led by Jack Crow rids an abandoned house of vampires in the middle of New Mexico. The sun sets and, as the Slayers leave, the Master bursts out of the ground outside the house. The slayers stay at a motel in the middle of a desert, getting drunk, smoking and partying with women as they celebrate their victory. One of the prostitutes is a young woman named Katrina. When the master vampire, Valek, turns up at the motel, he bites Katrina and massacres the slayers and prostitutes. During this attack Valek sees Jack and calls him by name which astonishes Crow. Crow and his partner, Montoya, run outside and grab Katrina, take a pickup truck and drive off. Narrowly escaping from Valek, they keep on driving for a few more hours until dawn. While Crow goes back to the motel to deal with the remains of the team and prostitutes, Montoya takes Katrina to the nearest hotel. Meanwhile, Montoya has gotten another hotel room and he tells Katrina that she has been bitten by Valek and that she too will be one soon if they cannot find and destroy him. She now has a telepathic link to the Master. They are using her to find out his real plans and why and who set them up.I think between John's touch to the film it was the cast who really made this something special. James Woods brings a lot of fun to the film, being almost an extreme Rambo. Not since the Frog brothers in Rambo have I seen such passion to kill vampires. I love when he walks away from the explosion at the hotel that's a few feet behind him, I always have to say Yeah, I know there's an explosion behind me. What; you think I don't see explosions? I do; every day! They bore me now!. Daniel Baldwin plays off James very well and did great being the sidekick who does stand his ground when pushed too hard. Sheryl Lee, very chilling performance at times, she doesn't do much in the film but when she does have powerful scenes, she pulls in very well with great screams. Tim Guinee, the replacement priest with no experience whatsoever, I adore him playing off James Wood's tough exterior. Him trying to stand up to James but he knows he can't win with him, however when put to the test, he really comes through for the guys and turns into Arnold Schwarzenslayer. And the final star of the film and a very haunting performance with Thomas Ian Griffith as the vampire Vallek. Great performance by him and he is a very savage vampire who reminds you that not all vampires are romantic with cheesy accents. I love the whole style of the film, it feels raw and like you're riding with the cowboys. A lot of beautiful colors of the sunset and the shadows to give you a chilling feel. This film may just require a certain taste, but I think most people do enjoy this film and I'm sure somewhere down the line, it will get the appreciation it deserves. Much thanks to John Carpenter giving the film industry one more try and bringing us a great vampire movie.8/10 "},{"Title":"An often overlooked Carpenter gem","Date":"1 November 2009","Score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Judging by the ratings this film has (34% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, 5.8/10 on IMDb), I guess it's safe to say that this could be a guilty pleasure of mine. I love most of John Carpenter's work and I really enjoyed his take on vampires. Jack Crow is certainly reason alone to sit through this and although the character originated in John Steakley's novel, I feel Crow is just as strong of a character in Carpenter's world as Snake Plissken from Escape From New York. Even though he's basically a mean spirited SOB, you can't help but sympathize with the character as the film moves on. Considering all that's happened to him in his lifetime, he seems to be a decent guy deep down underneath that extremely thick and rough exterior. His dialogue was also a lot of fun. Gems such as him asking Father Adam Guiteau if he had wood after the fight they just had or when he's explaining the true mythos behind vampires and to forget whatever you've seen in the movies was just classic.Other than Jack Crow, I actually really enjoyed the storyline which seemed to be a breaking point for a lot of people. A vampire seeking a black cross to finish a reverse exorcism, so he can walk in daylight without turning to dust. Only Carpenter could pull something like that off. Their methods of killing vampires were also a bit more original and unorthodox compared to other vampire films of the past. Jack Crow would shoot an arrow from a crossbow, which would be attached to a wire on the bottom of a jeep that would be reeled in by Daniel Baldwin's Anthony Montoya that would drag the vampire into the sunlight where their body would burst into flames. Maybe it's considered cheesy to some, but it was refreshing to see something different for a change. As big of a horror fan that I am, I don't really think of myself as a fan of vampires. I'm not sure if it's because I'm picky or because it seems like everything is being recycled when it comes to story lines in horror films these days, but I like to think when a vampire film does make an impact on me that it says more than the average horror film containing vampires.John Carpenter, the master of horror, delivers a refreshing and interesting take on vampires with the aptly named Vampires. It also dawns another strong lead character in a Carpenter film in the form of Jack Crow and contains some of the most witty and enjoyable dialogue of any horror film from the late '90s. The storyline is also magnificently peculiar, which is a definite plus in my book. This would definitely make my list of favorite vampire films, if I ever decided to make one. If you're a fan of John Carpenter and haven't seen this gem, I highly recommend doing so. Or if you have, maybe it's time to dust it off and give it another watch.

And, just for the record, the movie IS better than the book. MUCH better. Carpenter manages to evoke a sense of time and place that seems to capture the FEEL of the southwest.

But in his latest films, I've noticed somewhat of a clumsy way he directs his films. It's almost as if the films were rushed and some scenes or even shots, just weren't filmed. He fades between all of his scenes... Sometimes, leaving us wanting more, but he just fades to the end of it. Sometimes, the scenes he uses could have been completly cut out and not used with the fade-technique whatsoever.Anyway, I just had to get that off my mind. Off to the plotJack Crow is a Master Slayer, meaning that he kills vampire for the catholic church, and has been doing that for his entire life. After he cleans out a nest of Vampires in New Mexico, his team gets ambushed my a powerful vampire named Valek. Valek kills the entire team of slayers, except for Jack and his friend Montoya. They also manage to bring a hooker along with them, who got bitten by the vampire. Using the hookers telepathic link with her master, the two try to hunt down Valek and find out what he's up to.This film is gory. Really gory. Most likely John Carpenters goriest film to date, counting The Thing. Some might think that gore is an unnecessary way of filming, but in this film Gore is not used to impress or Show off. It's used as a background thing. I didn't feel that it was a way of using the gore to create terror. And if you happen to like gore, you'll find one redeeming factor in this film.The acting is good. James Woods is really funny as Jack Crow at times, altough Daniel Baldwin isn't really great, nor is Tim Guinee. But the acting holds up. There's not much else to say other than that James Woods is funny... at times. The action in this film is quite abundant, yet it's not that great. It can be enjoyable but at the same time the action is very repetive. That doesn't bode very well. Another thing abut this film is that it's too damn long for an action/horror film. Its almost 2 hours long. They should have made it 90 minutes instead, as that would be more fitting of a movie of this type.Well. The film is boring sometimes, yet it has some redeeming factors. All in all I give it a six. Nothing great, but if you're a John Carpenter fan you'll like it. And you might want to see how his style has changed. Dramaticly.

Although Vampires is his first literal western, JC's been turning out 1st rate original westerns from Assault on Precinct 13 to They Live and Escape  From New York to The Thing.  Even though these movies don't take place in the west, they have all the ingredients of a good western the lone hero/outlaw, the seige or attack, the showdown, and plenty of action. Vampires takes place and was filmed in the southwest (filmed in Sante Fe, NM).  Carpenter's DP Gary Kibbe captures some nice wide John Ford-ish western vistas, and Carpenter's minimalist score capture the desolate, hard nature of the place.  The real asset of this film is its cast, especially James Woods as the insanely tough and foul-mouthed slayer Jack Crow.  He really does some inspired improvised riffs, and when he's not kicking ass Woods has a lot of fun with it all.  Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter hero all man, flinty eyed & completely alone, and Woods plays this unsympathetic character with such a quick wit you can't help but admire the guy.  Thomas Ian Griffith plays a great Valek, the master vampire whom Jack has sworn to slay.  Griffith plays the character completely straight, and it works extremely well.  Griffith is an imposing figure, and you get a real sense of the nobility & savagery of Valek's character.  Compared to Woods, Griffith underplays his role, but still commands a very real presence of power & evil.  Carpenter stretches the $20 million dollar budget well, but you can sometimes see the zipper down the monster's back.  Despite a few fake looking wounds or rubbery stakes, Carpenter delivers a polished & stylish film, on par with movies costing 10 times as much (better in some cases).  I believe Carpenter works best with a little larger budget, but he should stay away from the typical Hollywood giant budget, he works best with a smaller production.  Vampires is a treat for any Carpenter fan, and hopefully marks the beginning of a new standard in his films.

If the vampires get their hands on it, they can then do a rite which will enable them to walk in sunlight and go virtually undetected.END PREMISEWhile this movie received horrible ratings among fans of the vampire genre, it is a clever twist on the old story with enough variations to make it great. I have not always liked Carpenter's work, but this one is up there with his older classics, in my opinion. I think the reason it was not well received is that movie audiences of today, especially American movie audiences, have become more jaded and desensitized to the effects of horror.After all, what makes horror, true horror, to you? Is it more blood? More graphic scenes showing disemboweled corpses in detail? The true psychological mind game? Ghosts? Monsters? What? That question is answered differently by every person you ask. Therefore no horror movie, especially a specific genre of horror movie, will satisfy every fan of that genre. Vampire fans, in particular, are discriminating creatures who demand a certain level of story quality, effects quality, and believability. Otherwise, they will turn on the makers like a pack of rabid wolves.There are rules which must be followed, or the movie loses its flavor for these discriminating and sometimes sophisticated palettes. Carpenter broke the rules in this endeavor, and the lack of its success embodies the fans' contempt for his lack of respect for the main principles of vampirism.Guns were far too widely used here. They were much better utilized in Len Wiseman's Underworld, in which unique bullets were used. I won't go into the details so as not to spoil that movie for anyone who has yet to see that pure work of art. Click my name to see my review of it.I liked the plot, and I found this movie very enjoyable. I, however, am not the discriminating vampire fan. I highly enjoyed Lost Boys, although, I would not recommend it to another fan of that specific genre due to its mainstream-ality. Honestly, there are very few vampire movies out there which live up the the rigid expectations of the true vampire fan. This movie is one of those movies I would recommend, merely because, while it violates some of the basic rules behind vampirism and is not what I would classify as an intelligent vampire film, it still has a few redeeming qualities.These vampires have an agenda. They are on a mission. They do not simply kill to feed. They are after the black cross in order to liberate their species from the prison of darkness, and will kill anyone in their way. There are some suspenseful scenes, and this movie does carry a degree of intensity, but it was otherwise a bit disappointing for the true vampire fan.While the Master Vampire in this endeavor is purported to be the original vampire, his demonstrations of vampire craft are not very impressive. According to legend (those rules I mentioned earlier), older vampires are accorded specific powers which young vampires are not. While he does demonstrate the legendary feats of strength, that is where it stops. That in itself, was quite disappointing. The potential was here, and as I said, there are some great elements, but this movie fails miserably to live up to its expectations and potential.My honest recommendations for good vampire movies would be Underworld, Dusk Til Dawn, Salem's Lot (the made for TV movie, and not the butchered video release...beware!), and Near Dark, one of the best, in my opinion. I (being a romantic) loved Interview with a Vampire, regardless of the hidden subtext and omitted story lines, but that is my personal choice. Fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles for the most part hated that movie, for those reasons, and others, I'm sure, and her Queen of the Damned was completely bastardized on film, so I'll stand by the movies I've already named here, with Underworld at the top of the list. I found that movie to be ~extremely~ good. I judged Underworld harder than most, because of the high expectations I had for that movie. I was not disappointed. If you are a fan of horror and/or vampire/werewolf lore, check it out. It's going to be a classic, one day.This movie rates a 9.3/10 with few slow spots and lots of heavy, fast-paced action.the Fiend .

The main thing separating this picture from that forgotten direct-to-video film is that it gets a better cast and director than it really deserves. John Carpenter may not be at the top of his 'Halloween' game but he is still able to do what he has all ways done best, create a heightened sense of fear and atmosphere. Vampires does have some blood and gore but it doesn't cover the walls,it's ability to use these fun and quirky characters is the draw. James Woods is that main character, Jack Crow. Crow leads a Vatican approved group of Vampire slayers who have met their match in the form of Valek, the very first bloodsucker. Jack's crew is brutally killed and he and his partner Montoya are the only two left standing. He rebuilds his crew with Katrina who is linked to Valek throuh a bite in her neck.Woods isn't the actor I would expect to headline this project but he takes the material very seriously. I imagine the opportunity to work with Carpenter is what persuaded him and the two play off of each other's strengths. Carpenter was never someone who was strong in developing heroes for his pictures and James Woods is able to make this Crow stand out. Vampires is a High Noon western horror hybrid and Woods plays Crow as the cowboy with a dash of outlaw in him. The plot of Valek looking to find this crucifix isn't all that fun or new but the journey is.I guess the problem I have with this film is that it doesn't really have villains. These vampires aren't interesting or eloquent and they let other people do the talking for them. Valek gets some dialouge but it is little more than the filler You'll never get me. I guess I kind of wanted a Bela Lugosi who could wouldn't lose his battle to Crow in a fistfight. The follower Vampires are mindless drones meant to merely snarl.

I was interested but didn't think much of this movie at that time. I saw this on video, some years later. John Carpenter's VAMPIRES story is interesting, but it seems like there was just something missed in the overall picture. Although the places that they traveled to eradicate the 'nests' was very desert-Gothicism, in other words it was the place you would figure they would be. The camera work, the colors and the entry of the characters was juicy, I truly was enveloped into the film's visual outlay. But as it went through there was just something, that I felt it lacked. James Woods (Jack Crow) for me however always brings something different and insightful to the character-role that he is 'in'. Whether it's the crud-white trash in The Onion Field or his newest quest in the legal world Shark. James Woods was the actor that won the 'Saturn'award that year for best actor in a science fiction /horror film. Nuff said. I always seem to enjoy the Baldwin brothers when they are characters in a story. Daniel brought his on in this one too. He was a big-good guy, not a perfect good-guy, but a big part of Jack's team.Sheryl Lee, the female Vampire in the movie, however, I don't know if she did drugs then or if she was just annoying. Maybe it's me who has the problem, but I just think that part was somewhat miss-cast. She has done other parts that were all her, but for me not this one. For me and some, there were a few of the lines, that should have been rewritten. They were hard to swallow, some lack real 'Bite'.With that said, I still felt this was only really deserving of a 7',considering the talent involved and then the lack of in some of the scripting. In a wrap-up though, still a fun and entertaining story to see. John Carpenter is very much a 'master' in the horror genre.(***) "}{"Title":"Godawful. 1/10.","Date":"4 April 2002","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I have to hand it to Mr. Carpenter; it is really brave of him to release this mess with his full name attached to the title (it aired as John Carpenter's Vampires).

So - no loss.Spoilers! (like anyone would care, for this movie)Interesting film in some ways. Prob. had money, but looks as low budget as it gets - short of Blair Witch, and sort of Blair Witch with minimalist music. Vampires fly, blood flies, gashing, slashing, roaring (snoring), and potassium flares and assorted what not. But it just looks so . . . underfinanced, or something.Woods and the 'other' Baldwin are bounty hunting looking vampire slayers, the only survivors of a vampire ambush, set up by their Catholic boss, it turns out. Took one vampire, mean 'unstoppable' ex-priest Valek from the 14th century - card carrying vamp #1 - to carry out said bloody ambush. Uses his hands and arms like a chainsaw - oh, that's another movie.Basically, the Catholic Church is supposed to have inadvertently created vamp Valek while botching a 'forbidden form' of exorcism. If that's believable - hey, what isn't? The boss is a cardinal (or bishop, I forget) who wants eternal life, not by what his own church teaches, but by becoming a vamp. Actually, a turncoat bishop is the most believable part of the tale, because that does have a long historical precedent.The vamps can't be scared by crucifixes. No consecrated hosts, ala Stoker. No coffins at night (they sort of burrow into shallow graves and smooth the dirt on top somehow). Stoker really had the better myth.In the BTVS tv series, the vamp has to want to drink the blood (though it's an immediate transformation). That's still okay. Cause it falls into the obv. metaphor of vampirism - evil, and evil habit. Cooperation with evil. Once bit by the evil, it becomes worse with practice, until it seems as if there's no return (full vamp). There is a cure prior to that point of no return. But once become the demon, it fears the cross, the consecrated host, and so on. Garlic, wolfbane, and so on were prob. talismanic charms to ward off evil spirits, and borrowed by Stoker. It seems pretty straightforward. Descent into evil.And that Wood's team is pretty much not Catholic isn't such a stretch, suggesting only the mercenary nature of so many historical crusaders, or those who joined various crusades. That they're a bunch of drunken, whoring carousers - well . . maybe a stretch.As for the 'other' Baldwin, after vamp chick rips open his jugular (sure looks like that) - shouldn't he be dead? Looked like she was going to eat him, starting with the neck. Oh, well. Luckily they went off together happily into the sunset - Wood's character insisting that he would - hunt them down, and kill them, and . . good luck pard, I'll miss ya (at which time I think they hug).It was one of those kind of movies.

Even the music, composed by Carpenter himself, is western like, not unsimilar from an earlier movie (assault on precint 13).However, for this movie, I think it fails.  Carpenter is much better when his movies are moody, atmospheric and scary.  While Woods deliciously plays up his bastardly character, the other characters fail in their roles.  Are we to believe that Montoya falls for Fenn's character?  On what basis? Because he could slap her around?  Because he could tie her up naked? Because she bit him and took a chunk of his neck out?

So, I knew I was going to hate most of the characters.Okay, there are two I really liked.  The main Master vampire, Valek (of course) except that his character falls short of being able to truly like him.  We didn't get the chance to get to know who or what he was and what made him the way (personality-wise) he was.  All you know is that he was condemned by the Church (who wasn't back then?) and then turned into a vampire.  Ooh...big deal.  The second person I liked was Sheryl Lee.  Her character is the only mature character in the whole thing and the only one with any sense...As for Mr. Woods' character Jack Crow...I have never seen a character I've hated so much since watching that other travesty of a vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn and having to put up with Quentin Tarrentino until he is thankfully killed.  Jack Crow is a leather-wearing cool-guy wannabe who acts tough, talks tough and gets off to beating up a defenseless priest.  Then if that's not enough, he proves how much a jerk he is by spending a good portion of the film asking the question over and over that proves he's way too obsessed by that lower part of his anatomy better left alone.  His character is immature and irritating, and had I been any part of his team, I would have staked him out over an ant bed covered in honey and left the vampires to their business!I guess I could sort of like the younger priest...at least by the end. He's one of the few that truly believes what he preaches.  He stands up for himself finally and does it without resorting to the bullying tactics shown by Jack Crow and only at the end does he try to be like the afore mentioned Crow in showing a beginning in that anatomy obsession.  Daniel Baldwin disgusted me until he was bitten and beginning to fall in love with Sheryl Lee's character.  Only then did he begin to show some compassion instead of mindless bravado and a macho attitude that wouldn't quit.  Thankfully, it did quit.I think the best part of the movie was the scenic shots of New Mexico. Having lived in Santa Fe for a year and missing it immensely, that was about the only hope the movie had in winning me over.  I liked the shot of the St. Francis Cathedral, brief as it was, and I liked the mural across from the pay-phone Jack Crow was using.  The other thing I recognized was the quick shot of Camel Rock.  But that was it, and I have to say that I should have just walked out of the theatre after those scenes were over.  Now I think I'll just look at the old pictures from my stay in Santa Fe...rather than even bothering to rent that pathetic excuse for a movie.

Then, a master unlike anything they have seen before kills almost everybody in sight. Who is that? A monster that is unstoppable, like a machine with superhuman strength.The acting by James Woods is excellent. His performance here is top notch. With conviction, he is a distraught and very angry man who is determined to find the master that can be the one vampire that is possibly the first.The master vampire Valek, is the most sinister vampire I have ever seen in movies. The look is excellent. With the pale white face, veins on his face, and the power, he is the ultimate monster. Valek is cunning and smart too. As he would bury himself beneath the very dirt anywhere to avoid the light. He also has telepathy to possibly control his bitten victims and see their thoughts. He also can fly faster than ever. Like the original vampire Dracula.The plot is great. I enjoyed the story and the rough and tough attitude of the good guys and the sheer villainy of Valek. Daniel Baldwin is good as Montoya, Sheryl Lee is fine as Katrina, and Thomas Ian Griffin is great as Valek. Great casting.The Last Word Cool. Not great, Vampires is a good movie.

There's a brief attempt to portray the genuine horror of vampirism, but this is soon aborted in favour of an overbearing score and buckets of blood.  The victims are just the usual faceless fodder, completely unsympathetic.  Who cares if they're killed?  There's no particular reason given why vampires are any worse than the evil that humans do to each other every day.  All of the main protagonists are fairly unlikable as well.All this adds up to a film that's just impossible to care about.  It's too miserable to be a popcorn flick, but too trivial to be a serious character piece like Near Dark or Ultraviolet.  It treads a middle ground, and really, who cares?  Not Hollywood, clearly.

His most praised film, Halloween, I felt was his most overrated.  He does crank out some decent cinema once in a while, but they usually tend to work in spite of him, very much unlike a director like, say, Brian De Palma, in which good films happen because of him.  With that said, Vampires only goes to show that whatever talent Carpenter may have had is virtually gone for good.Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire hunter working for the Vatican.  His team of slayers, who also includes Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), have just taken down a nest of the bloodsuckers in Mexico, but were unable to locate the master.  As they're celebrating in a motel that night, the head vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), appears and slaughters everybody present with the exception of Crow, Montoya, and a prostitute (Shery Lee) who was bitten.  Crow believes the prostitute can be used to track down the vampire because of the psychic connection that is developing between the two.  At the same time, with the help of a young priest (Tim Guinee), Crow discovers that Valek is looking for the Berziers Cross, which if done correctly in an incantation, can grant all vampires the ability to walk in broad daylight.A plot like that would you to believe that Vampires would be full of tension, suspense, and action.  There's nary a hint of a moment where those elements come in.  Instead, Carpenter opts for blood and gore, and if he was aiming for a make-up effects display, he's succeeded.  The only thing that may be considered unpredictable in this film is the way Valek kills his next victim, whether it may be with decapitation, throat slashing, or just plain old sticking his hand through their bodies.  The acting and script reek of the second rate variety.  Now, to be fair, James Woods delivers a fun performance, which is easily better than anything else this movie has to offer.  But his attempts are counteracted by his fellow thespians.  Daniel Baldwin proves he's the least talented of his brothers, and I believe that says it all.  Sheryl Lee resorts to ridiculous bouts of overacting, and Thomas Ian Griffith does nothing but look menacing and kill a bunch of people.The script is as equally atrocious.  Whether it's the predictable story, the awful dialogue (He's unstoppable unless we stop him), or the unpleasant mysogyny, there's not a salvageable element in this entire screenplay.  I'm not sure whether to blame the writer, Don Jakoby, or the original author, John Stakely.  Maybe they're both at fault.  A concoction of both writers' imaginations led to this script, which is probably twice as bad than what each one could have come up with individually. "},{"Title":"Pointless!

And I think with Prince of Darkness, The Fog and Escape from L.A is very underrated films, some people think it is just an Action Film some people think it is just an Sci-Fi film about Vampires. Well it is not! It is a horror film about immortal Vampires fight against Evil VS. Good. An Ultimate battle. Also the film is worth of watch because it is fun on all the actors had with their roles.James Woods was perfect as sardonic, illusion-free Crow and his brushing campiness with the tip of a finger, yet withdrawing just in time, is priceless. Daniel Baldwin makes the most of his character's arc, nicely underplaying his role, while he still manages to convey Montoya's journey by minimal changes of expression or voice. The final scene couldn't have been done any better. Sheryl Lee gives what I consider one of the strongest supports I've seen in quite a few years, whether by male or female actors, especially when you count in the scarcity of means she's handed over. Ian Griffith had several fine moments and the entire supporting cast was refreshing in their non-Hollywoody realistic, natural look and acting. The overall impression was of people enjoying what they're expertly doing. I know that From Dusk Till Down and Blade are the most overrated Vampire films, but John Carpenter's Vampires are very underrated.I disagree with all of the haters of this film, if you are a true Vampire fan like me, you will enjoy this film. The saddest thing is that this film got two awful sequels who really both sucked with all the new cast in them. So don't say this is the most awful john Carpenter movie which is not!!!!!!! I have enjoyed this film more than I did They Live, Village of the Damned, In The Mouth of Madness and Christine those movies to me are all overrated this one isn't. After Vampires is the last good John Carpenter film. Ghosts of Mars and The Ward are just terrible movies and they are not good at all.This is a classic scary movie! Another great John Carpenter film! I love this movie and it will always be favorite best one and not only because is John Carpenter film, but because it is a Vampire flick and I just love Vampire movies to death! Fright Night (1985), The Lost Boys (1987), Fright Night (2011)-remake and Vampires (1998) are just my favorite Vampire horror movies! The main plot about this film In the blood-chilling tradition of Halloween and Village of the Damned comes John Carpenter's unique vision of the ultimate killing machines, VAMPIRES. Forget everything you've ever heard about vampires, warns Jack Crow (James Woods), the leader of Team Crow, a relentless group of mercenary vampire slayers. When Master Vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) decimates Jack's entire team, Crow and the sole team survivor, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), set out in pursuit. Breaking all the rules, Crow and Montoya take one of Valek's victims hostage. The beautiful but unlucky prostitute (Sheryl Lee) is their sole psychic link to Valek, and through her senses they will track down the leader of the undead. As Valek nears the climax of his 600-year search for the Berziers Cross, Jack and the new Team Crow do everything humanly possible to prevent him from possessing the only thing that can grant him and all vampires the omnipotent power to walk in the daylight.I am giving this film a 10/10 because it doesn't deserve all the hate from fans and critics!!!

However, it is a movie that, the more you think of it, the more of a dud it seems to be. There isn't much that you remember from it, aside from one decent shootout. Carpenter's signature moody keyboard loops were replaced by guitar solos. Oh, and it's the first time I noticed this irritating fade-in fade-out style of editing that Carpenter adopted in his later films, where a normal, satisfactory scene would be ruined by making it seem like a dream sequence.

One of the main elements responsible for this is the rather original and innovative approach it takes in regards to vampires. Not only is this one openly deviant about the proper tools and what doesn't work alone makes for quite a good telling here by including the storyline about the search for the special artifact. Not only is the concept of that particular object rather creative and original but it also allows for the film to turn into a road movie that includes all the trappings devoted to hunting and tracking a vampire clan. This includes the one main method of accomplishing that in the psychic connection between the un-turned victim and the master, again a rather novel touch that produces a lot of fun. That doesn't include the main reasons why this one works so well in the actual hunting down of the vampires, which there's plenty of within this. This one manages to really make the hunters quite impressive by utilizing special tactics and maneuvers that clearly showcase some experience in their field which is what really impresses since it routinely works rather than the stereotypical method of having experts continuously fail at their profession simply to drive the movie along. That alone makes this one enjoyable along with the frantic action on display and highly-enjoyable gore scenes which features some rather bloody times throughout this in how both sides have plenty of bloodshed ravaged toward them. These are enough to help this overcome its one true flaw. The final showdown really could've been done more effectively, and really should've had one to begin with. The climactic fight lasts all of about a minute, with a couple stabbings, some minor throwing around and then the big hit. It's really nothing much of a fight and should've been one for such a journey like this to take route. Still there's not a whole lot here that really gets this down.Rated R Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.

What I really liked about the film was this cool vamp slaying team, there were a few well known faces in there, character actors that really made a unique cool looking unit. Its such a shame that they all get wiped out early on.This leaves Woods and Baldwin galloping up diarrhea drive without a saddle. It also seems to diminish the film before its even started, but wait! all is not lost. Woods character is a solid hard ass, he looks unashamedly cool with his black leather coat, blue jeans and shades, he's got a mouth on him, a wicked name and knows his way around most weaponry, in short he's an older Snake Plissken with a short back n sides.The plot is simple enough, its Woods vs vampires, good enough for ya?. When I say vampires I mean just one badass head vampire (who looks suspiciously like the head nutter from 'Ghosts of Mars') and a lot of faceless stake fodder. Its all about Woods really, yeah he has the typical wet sidekick pushed on him, a newbie priest to look after, and there's Baldwin but to be honest they don't figure. You wanna see Woods swearing and kicking vampire ass.When I first heard of this I didn't think too much of it, after 'Escape From LA' most were in shock and this really didn't sound very inspiring. But this does turn out to be a pretty decent western vampire flick along the lines of 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. There is plenty of blood and gore with some nice body part effects, obviously violence is high, nice visuals and your obligatory cowboy-like musical score.Not your obvious Carpenter flick as it does seem more glossy than most, still looks a bit 'made for TV' here and there but generally its a tad more Hollywood. Doesn't add much new to the vampire lore either, only the way they harpoon vamps and certain weapons have a face lift of sorts. All your usual types of deaths, leaping around, decapitations, vampire POV, bone snapping sound effects etc...are present and correct.Better than you would expect but mainly down to Woods, without him who knows. Its cheesy and not quite up to the standards of other more original quirky Carpenter films but it certainly holds its own amongst other vampire films. It does always amuse me though how all the characters know regular bullets don't have any effect on vampires, yet they continually empty clips into them as if it will do any good.'Can I ask ya something Padre?

One of the hookers named Katrina (Lee) was bitten by Valek, so Montoya and Crow take her along to help them track Valek using the psychic link she shares with him. Crow knows he was sold out but sets out to destroy the Master and his vampires anyway. Horror legend John Carpenter makes his first vampire movie here and the opening raid sequence is pure Carpenter. The airy shots of the southwest and musky vampires nest catch the atmosphere just right and set the tone. You have to like the political incorrectness of this picture. Like most of Carpenters movies, someone sells out and it is usually an authority figure. This time it is the arch bishop played by Maximillian Schell, and the church itself. The movie plays like an action/western film but the excellent make up and gore effects by KNB reminds you it is horror your watching. James Woods brings all of the attitude he has to Jack Crow and really has fun with it. Purposely staying away from the Gothic vampire look, Carpenter makes Valek and his vampire's nasty things. Unfortunately Thomas Ian Griffith's performance as Valek is quite flat. So is the Horror in this movie. All though Gory, Vampires doesn't build much suspense and or get the audience to jump at all. When was the last time a John Carpenter film failed to do that? There is a great Unearthing sequence and the vampires do some impressive things, but it comes across as Fun, not scary. Carpenter delivers an action packed slam bang film that is never dull and always entertaining. The only true disappointment comes from the fact that this is a pretty scare less John Carpenter Horror film, which is certainly a surprise. Some witty dialog and good social commentary and a good cast make Vampires a lot of fun.

This one has been praised by His Fans, no surprise there, and not so much by Neutral Observers. It is a middling Movie with just enough Glorious Gore and Smutty Humor to satisfy those who seek out such things. The Vampires have no interaction among themselves and are virtually Zombies and the Master growls a lot.James Woods is the Star here, along with the cheesy effects and be-headings, but He is let down by the weak Dialog (the Woody thing is used more than once for guaranteed 13 Year Old giggles and seems to be a homage to Beavis and Butthead?).

After dealing with them, it's time to let their hair down for some hellraising and hookers, despite Crow's intended target, master vampire Valek not being at the nest as he'd thought.Things take a turn for the extreme worse for our protagonists when Valek himself strolls in, has a little fun with Sheryl Lee's hooker character, before single-handedly slaughtering most of the vampire hunters in a spectacularly gory orgy of ultra-violence.When the three survivors, Crow, Montoya - played by Daniel Baldwin, and Sheryl Lee, escape, the film seems to lose it's vibe. Energy immediately dissipates, and the film meanders somewhat for much of the rest of the film, though Woods, and his smacking about of a new priest assigned to them, provide enough amusement. Sheryl has gained psychic insight into Valek's mind, and we see glimpses of his gory slayings as he hunts down a sacred relic he needs for his kind to exist in daylight. During this uneven mid-section, we are treated to scenes of Sheryl tied up naked, slapped about, and called a bitch by Montoya. Crow isn't exactly sympathetic towards her either, and while some may find it amusing, it does lend the film a more unpleasant tone than necessary.Energy revs back up a few gears for the final showdown, though the climax never matches the balls-to-the-wall approach the film began with.It is not one of John Carpenter's best by a long shot, but despite it's flaws, it still makes for outrageous gory fun.

The vampires are really nasty, and at obviously takes a team to get the job done. I didn't care for the sidekick Montoya, but all the others are nicely western-like, from the bounty hunter to the whore, to the posse of vampires, to the city-boy-preacher.On the minus side, the effects are too revealing. When the vampires come into the sunlight, both arms catch fire, then they cut to the dummy. Every time. And when someone gets bitten in the throat, you can see the tube that squirts blood.

James Woods and Daniel Baldwin lead a posse of vampire slayers roving through the southwestern United States. The slayers are in the employment of the catholic church - an amusing Carpenter-signature twist which is nicely exploited in the second half of the film. In this film, vampirism is described as something like a virus. Sheryl Lee has just become infected by a very powerful Master Vampire, and Woods exploits her psychic link with the master to try to hunt him down.Like most of Carpenter's work, the film uses special effects subtly, minimally and very effectively. The vampires growl very nicely, rise from the earth and, when exposed to sunlight literally burst into flame. And the slayers use weapons which, though they look somewhat outlandish, are not really all that extraordinary.The directing and script are good, and the characters are nicely developed and very well acted. James Woods and Sheryl Lee are great, and very nicely supported by Dan Baldwin and Tim Guinee. The soundtrack (also originating with Carpenter) is mostly pretty bad - consisting of western blues-rock clich√©s and semi-dramatic synthesizer work. The lack of depth, simplicity of the plot and weak soundscheme make this a one-shot movie, however.Recommended for late night b-movie watchers, Carpenter fans and Vampirists.

I happen to thoroughly enjoy this fast-flowing vampire romp that continues the trend of more gore with a desert wasteland setting; a trend established by Near Dark in the eighties and revived by From Dusk Till Dawn in the nineties.  Speaking of the gore, I cannot praise KNB effects enough.  They have done a ton of the movies I've been watching lately and they prove one thing in every one of them  they are on top of their game.  That party scene is unforgettable.  There's so much gore you'll have to watch it several times just to catch everything.  James Woods is also something to watch the movie several times for.  He's hysterical with some great one-liners.  All of the actors did fine jobs.  I was especially pleased with Daniel Baldwin, he's probably the most realistic, but will always remain the second best Baldwin.  And Mark Boone Junior always cracks me up.  What absolutely made the movie for me was the ending.  Absolutely superb.  You can create your own sequel in your head.

How can we understand Crow's rage and anguish and motivation, when all we hear about his past are two or three lines of dialogue?   Three quarters of this movie is people looking menacingly at eachother, and people en route to doing something.  As well, I REALLY hated the way intense action scenes were presented in a sort of slow-motion montage that made me wonder if my VCR needed cleaning.  And the priest was miscast.  He made a good priest; as a hunter he was embarassing.That said, there were still some great scenes.  Sheryl Lee was almost transcendental in her ability to rise above her mundane role, but I think this has more to do with Sheryl Lee than it does with John Carpenter.  And James Woods was fun in his usual intense, somewhat disturbed way.  The vampires rising from the sand were striking and when the action actually HAPPENED, it was fun.  But am I the only one who thinks that John Carpenter has become unfocused and sloppy?

Not Daniel Baldwin (the tough-as-nails, never cleanshaven Baldwin brother), who is also effective as Montoya, Crowe's partner. The problem with this film is Thomas Ian Griffith, who has shown good acting ability in his many films (most B-grade schlock, but he makes them watchable) but who is absolutely wasted in this film as Valek, the head vampire who longs to live during the day. Valek could have been so powerful and so evil, yet all he does is kill, and he hardly speaks even though we know he can. Had the makers of this film focused more on Valek and showed some of his history (flashbacks, paintings of the old Valek), the film would have been great.

Despite a tongue in cheek performance from the talented James Woods playing the bitter Jack Crow, and some fine sweeping shots of the New Mexico countryside for his ensemble of renegade mercenaries to strut their stuff and brandish their shiny weapons around in, the film doesn't seem to go anywhere but stroll through some feisty vampire hunting scenes, which don't offer anything more than what we all saw in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' until a final showdown with the aforementioned master vampire. The Vatican is briefly introduced, possibly to flesh out the thin storyline and we get a little background info on Jack's past, and pointers to why he's always so pissed off, which he is (quite enjoyably) through the entire movie! And of course we get a lot of guys (and gals) with pointed teeth and heavy brows being harpooned and dragged to their fiery deaths. It's all handled quite unpassionately by Carpenter, even the master's revenge rampage scene early on in the movie is edited together more befitting to a romantic montage, with images fading in and over one another, making it seem like Carpenter just wants to get the thing over with, when it should have been real toe curler. This also seems painfully evident in a disappointing finale which has more plot holes than some of the staked vampires.Like a lot of Carpenter's more recent work, Vampire$ is fun enough but ultimately flawed, it's quirky, at times funny and fairly lively but at the end of the day it's just another one of those films destined for video rental mediocrity that could've been so much more. And if it weren't for James Woods' slightly uncomfortable but ironic anti-hero it would have been even much less than that.

Whether it be if they can transform into separate forms, most films a vampire can only transform into a bat while in Bram Stoker's Dracula Dracula could transform into multiple apparitions, or if crosses can ward vampires each film has its own set of maxims. Now in John Carpenter's Vampires crosses do not work, garlic does not work, stakes thorough the heart work, I think they forgot about holy water, and it is a good thing to lop off the heads and burn the carcasses of the victims. The vampires themselves are superstrong, cannot be out at daytime, and cannot transform themselves into anything.The origin of vampirism is peculiar to each movie. Most are originated with Dracula or Cain. Here we have Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) an ex-clergyman who was transformed into the living dead after a botched exorcism. He has prayed on mankind for over 600 years. He now is looking for the Black Cross that will allow him to walk the day with impunity. Now Valek is played with some gusto, but the other vampires are all backdrop characters that never distinguish themselves. I really wish that vampires would be more interesting than just one-dimensional killing machines. This is one of the reasons that so many people liked Ann Rice's novels. Her vampires have more depth. However, they are whiny.Jack Crow played by James Woods is my favorite character. He acts with humor and cynicism. His parents have been killed by vampires and he is employed by the Church to wipe out the bloodsuckers. Valek wiped out, his current team except for Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), after they were set-up. Jack wants revenge.Carpenter's directing is quite good. The action scenes are thrilling and viscerally entertaining.  Vampires is a film that plays well in the theater, but is a bit bogged down on the small screen (unless your small screen is 50). If you like horror, then you will probably like this film. If you want a little more 'fang' to your film, than watch Fright Night or Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Carpenter appears to have had a serious case of ambivalence with this film. Did he want a semi-spoof of the vampire genre, the potential is there in the sardonic humour. Did he want a surrealistic horror film, moments appear, especially with some of the cinematography. Did he want an action flic, there are lots of explosions, gunfire, and macho leaping about. However, what appears closest to Carpenter's vision would be the teenage slasher flic. Gore, blood, and fake body parts fly with abandon. But none of it works. The characters are almost parodies of classic movie types, the tough and stoic leader, the loyal sidekick who betrays him, even a hooker albeit a vampire hooker with a heart of gold. But Carpenter does nothing with them. Holes are shot in the old vampire myths (no crosses and garlic here) but nothing fills there place. The movies plods from action sequence to action sequence with little or no character or plot development. Then there are the gaffs. Vampires arise from the ground covered in the red earth of New Mexico. Next scene, they stride across the same location looking well bathed and more like neo-goth models than the undead. The supreme vampire looks more like a refugee from Belarus than the titan of unholiness. Sure they diss the Catholic Church, but an institution that survived the Reformation is unlikely to be bothered by John Carpenter's lame jibes. Add disjointed continuity, dreadful dialogue, and the world's most boring vampires (why be undead if things are this dull?), and you get a movie which is not worth the effort.Overall, give it a break. If you want to see a class act in Vampire movies, try to catch the old '70's version of Dracula with Louis Jordan. It pops up on the tube from time to time. Little gore, no guns, but more real chills and superlative acting than you'll see in any of Carpenter's recent efforts.

Vampires live in nests, and the slayers flush them out systematically, like a cross between pest control and a SWAT team. After a wonderful opening sequence, the plot thickens when head vampire Valek turns up, putting a large dent in the number living slayers on Jack's team.  The plot thickens a bit from there, but I won't spoil any more for you. For those who aren't familiar with John Carpenter's style, this might be a bit disappointing and silly.  Woods is the only one with a juicy role, and never stops having fun. Baldwin appears to be taking the script seriously, and Ms Lee isn't given much to do other than her usual wide eyed, trembling with fear schtick.  But those last two don't matter, because this is a Carpenter film.  The last thing this guy wants is for us to take him seriously.  He is an expert at having fun, and having it on a small budget. No huge special effects, a few dodgy sets and deserted locations, some actors ready to take the micky, and he's ready to rock.  He is a great drive-in movie maker, and Vampires is no exception.

First of all, I want to complement film critic Gene Siskel for A) Liking the movie and B) Stating something that is absolutely true about this movie. He said on his show that one of the reasons this movie works so well is that there are no teenagers in it. I couldn't agree more, and I'm a teenager myself. It shows why movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer are so utterly bad. Carpenter was smart enough to cast mature actors who could be menacing, funny, and didn't have to bring up desperate moments of teen sex humor.

The opening sequence in which a nest of vampires is routed by a rag-tag team of vampire busters is well directed and entertaining. Unfortunately, nothing else in the story makes much sense.  The key plot point, involving a religious relic, is explained sketchily in some throwaway dialogue.  There is gore that goes way over the edge, but might be enjoyed in a Grand Guignol kind of way by hardcore horror fans.  However, the sadism, especially directed at women, can not be enjoyed.  James Woods more or less delivers a self-parody of his wired screen persona and seems rather bored.  Daniel Baldwin is wooden as his sidekick.  Thomas Ian Griffith does not have the evil charisma necessary for the master vampire Valek. The absurd ending shamelessly sets up a sequel that not too many will clamor for.

You've got a group of Vatican sponsored vampire slayers led by Jack Crow (James Woods), a man with enough attitude for you, for me, for all of us. He and his crew clean out a nest but miss the Master Vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith). The crew goes back to the Sun God Motel and settles in for a serious night of partying with whores and booze (also paid for by the Vatican and supplied by local law enforcement). An unhappy Valek comes calling. He pauses long enough to bite one of the whores, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who finds the experience VERY pleasurable. He then proceeds to massacre the crew, only Jack Crow and Montoya (Daniel Baldwin, in a sleep-acting tour de force) escape. They take Katrina with them, planning to use her telepathic link to Valek to track him down. This is the best part of the film. Katrina would have been better off with Valek. Sheryl Lee spends the remainder of the film being slapped, punched, bound, gagged, writhing and twitching--one of the most degrading performances by an actress in a film this year. The misogynistic streak in the film disturbed me. A young priest, Father Adam, joins the crew, giving Crow another target for abuse. James Woods has all the charm of an irritable scorpion. Thomas Ian Griffith isn't given enough to do. He certainly does make a menacing and imposing Master Vampire. Sexy in a feral sort of way. I would like to have seen back story on Valek.

"},{"Title":"Why bother?","Date":"8 November 1998","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  The idea of one of the masters of horror giving the vampire mythos a try on screen is a tantalizing proposition.  When it's John Carpenter, the man who has give the world such brilliant films as Halloween, Escape From New York, and the underrated In The Mouth Of Madness, chances are that the film should be a sure success.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a sure success. In brief, John Carpenter's Vampires is a bad, bad film.  Not bad as in cringe-inducing, but bad as in the fact that Mr. Carpenter should know better.  Case in point halfway through the blood and sex-soaked film, lead vampire hunter Jack Crow (James Woods) explains to a catholic priest the truths about vampires.  He goes on a tangent about how they're not like the movies make them out to be and then proceeds to describe them using several Hollywood vampire clich√©s.  Are we supposed to be biting (no pun intended) on this? With the clich√©s set in motion, we are force-fed Jack Crow and his team of vampire hunters, which includes the lesser Baldwin brother, Daniel, as Montoya.  Crow's team hunts down a hive of very, very stupid vampires and kills them.  The master vampire escapes, however, and extracts his revenge on the team and a group of prostitutes at a seedy motel.  Leaving only Crow, Montoya and a sole prostitute (Sheryl Lee, of Twin Peaks fame) alive, the vampire, named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith, trying really, really hard), continues his quest for an ancient cross that will allow him to walk in the day.  Crow and others attempt to track Valek down for the rest of the movie, setting up a bloody conflict in a deserted town prison. Where John Carpeter's Vampires truly fails is in the details.  For example, Sheryl Lee's character is bitten by Valek at the hotel, rather than slain, for no apparent reason other than to give the Crow team a telepathic link to the master vampire.  But why would a vampire bent on murder grotesquely kill everyone in sight except for a prostitute?  Another instance involves a minor detail Crow and Montoya loose their car in a crash, only to steal another one in a few minutes.  Now is there any real reason why ten minutes of screen time was wasted by an act that had absolutely nothing to do with anything?  Things only get worse from there, with major inconsistencies involving Crow's seemingly magical crossbow (how does someone reload a crossbow that is attached by rope to a jeep so darn fast and without even going back to the jeep to attach the new arrow?) and certain vampires that stand in sunlight with no problems one minute, but burn to a crisp the next. Coupled with a throwaway ending and some bad acting, particularly by Baldwin, John Carpenter's Vampires just isn't worth a trip to the theater. While not completely without merit (Woods and Griffith try, at least), the film is a huge disappointment.  Will I get quoted in the movie trailer if I say that this movie sucks?  Maybe.

I consider myself a fan of John Carpenter, and as such, I am aware that he has rarely made a perfect film (maybe Starman), but he does sometimes come close (The Thing, Escape From NY), and then sometimes he misses completely (Escape from LA, The Fog). But one thing he does usually deliver is entertainment. No matter how bad his films have been, no matter how disappointing, I've never wanted my money back because I've always gotten something out of them.So, I liked Vampires. So much so I'd like to see it again, and I'll buy it when it hits video. But this movie, on the Carpenter scale, comes in at about 6 for me (10 being highest, 1 being lowest).What makes a great movie? Look through this site and you'll see people who loved movies you yourself hated. But on the whole, a balance of character developement, plot, and action make a solid movie. As vampire movies go, I think Lost Boys and Interview are high on the list because of their ability to balance all these elements which make a good movie, I think Dusk Till Dawn is on the bottom of this list as it failed at character and plot and was almost pure action (and poorly done action at that).Vampires hits just above middle for me because although it lacks competent character development, it's plot is average and mildly interesting, and it's action is average to good.I think James Woods was probably one of the best things about this move. Thomas Ian Grifith was great but suffered from a severe lack of dialogue and development (don't blame the actor for these shortcomings). Daniel Baldwin was okay. Laura Palmer was good (but also lacking proper dialogue). And the rest were rather forgettable (once again, I blame the writing, not the actors. -- How you could waste Maximillian Schell's talents on a phone in role like this is beyond me.)If you like vampire movies, you should probably like Vampires. If you like Carpenter movies, you should also like this film. But if you're looking for a critical masterpiece, you shouldn't be seeing a Carpenter Vampire movie to begin with.This movie is supposed to be fun, and it is despite the many flaws. Therefore it succeeds in its mission.(P.S. you can't de-romantasize vampires by dressing tall, good looking people in black velvet. No amount of dust or dirt will take away from their appeal.

The most regrettable aspect of Vampires is the sheer amount of violence directed at women.  Vampires introduces innovative elements into the undead genre, creating villains who are neither the urbane philosophers of Anne Rice nor the traditional Dracula clones.  Unfortunately, the focus on Valek, the powerful undead antagonist, prevents characterization of other vampires, reducing them to a sort of Night of the Living Dead zombie rather than intelligent villians.

Now, I know a lot of people have said that this is a great script, and I think I might agree if I had a copy of the script to read. But, John Carpenter (famous for his horror movies, and desperate for a cinema success) ignored this important fact by concentrating on the blood rather than the story.The movie starts out by plunging you into the story, assuming you know the characters and their history.  The only background on the characters, their motivation, and what their mission really is, comes through in little two minute speeches that seem to be pasted reluctantly between the scenes of gore.If you're the kind of person who enjoys gore, then this movie isn't for you, because the special effects are so primitive, it's a kick in the balls to anyone who is a veteran movie gore watcher.  There is absolutely nothing special about the violence in this movie, it isn't gross, it isn't shocking, it isn't even unsettling.  In fact, most of the time, it's just damn hokey.

The characters also become very boring, except James Wood.  James Wood's character, Jack Crow was likable, despite the fact he enjoys entirely too much talking about other people's erections. His character was hardly consistent; he changes several times during the film, most notably, at the end of the film where he's everybody's friend, completely tolerant, a complete opposite from the middle of the film, when we've learned most about him.This movie also stars Thomas Ian Griffith, who seems to be cast solely on his resemblance to Christopher Walken.

He most likely would have had lots more frightening lines rather than Thomas Ian Griffith, who basically does lots of groaning and hard breathing. More unbearably, through most of the movie he has this ridiculously stupid look on his face. All the scenes with Crow's sidekick, Tony Montoya seemed like filler. Most information from those scenes could have been revealed more easily and efficiently, and you are disappointed at the end when he doesn't die. There were several more characters, but they were hardly interesting.In the first scene, the master vampires are pinned as completely superior, but in the end, they are killed as easily as goons, James Wood, and the inexperienced wussy priest guy seem slack-jawed and carefree to kill them. The masters also seem as stupid as goons. Maybe this is based on the fact that they never explain how they become masters`Let's go kill some vampires.'`Yeah, whatever.'And that's where the un-needed erection jokes are used again.

New Mexican farmhouse - a suspected vampire hideout. This first set worked well for me, as pike-and-crossbow-armed members cautiously moved in, opening doors in dusty attics and among large, wooden crate/wardrobe/coffin-like objects. Questions came to mind, such as 1) It's an old wooden house. Wouldn't it be safer to just torch the place and thereby drive the vampires out into the sun, burn them, or reduce their cover? and 2) Those vampires snarled, were agile, and used surprise, but seemed little trouble to armed humans. Why didn't the undead use firearms or set booby-traps? No matter the Slayers use an inventive extermination tactic, and the head vampire of this nest (Valek, played by a menacingly well-cast Griffith) makes up for the poor match-up as he evades the hunters, tracks them down to their rented motel, and returns the visit.Team leader Jack Crow (Woods) and the few other survivors retreat to meet the supervising cardinal, where they conclude that Valek seems to be searching for an object or person. A new priest, Father Adam (Guinee), is assigned to the group, and Jack sets out to try to stop Valek, ignoring orders to re-build his team.I enjoyed the humans-eradicating-vampire-nest (and vice-versa) scenes of the first act, but the movie declined from there. Griffith does a great job as Valek, Guinee was fine as Father Adam, and I was pleasantly surprised by Lee's performance as afflicted prostitute Catrina, but the only good dialogues to be spoken are explanations of Valek and other vampires.For the most part, the film did not scare me (notable exception a tentative tiptoe into a dark building by combat-unready Father Adam) - this is mainly an action film. There are loads of violence and foul language, and while that's appropriate for the life-and-undeath vampire-vs.-human struggles, I found it disturbing in a human-abusing-human context. It made it almost impossible to feel sympathy towards Jack or driver Montoya (Baldwin, who reminded me of an overweight Elvis). The only character I could root for was Father Adam, a devout priest thrusted into having to put up with these ruffians. Although it must be said, other students in the audience seemed to like these rough intra-species words and actions more than I did. (Our favorite line was a snide remark about our state.)There is plenty of gore, but it's at a fitting level - a bit nauseating but not overwhelming. Vampire demises are good, human deaths are quick and dirty, and there is one deliciously gross and effective bisection. The Southwestern settings were adequate-to-very-good.Rating for John Q.

He is required to kill vampires and look cool doing it. This is beneath his obvious talent. Baldwin never seems to be with the program. Sheryl Lee spends most of the film bound to a bed.

His teammates include Daniel Baldwin, Tommy Rosales (a great stunt double), Mark Boone Junior and others where they go from old hideouts and take out every vampire.

First the myth of the vampire is tweaked and twisted just enough to make Vampires pretty original in its treatment of these thoroughly well-known creatures. Second the music (by John Carpenter) is spot-on perfect, and owns your brain for days - and, unlike so many movies, isn't obtrusive in the slightest; it's a perfect fit. Third in the strange realm of the cartoonish, where earnestness and silliness must exquisitely commingle for a movie (or book, or whatever) to be believable, well, in that strange realm Vampires succeeds beautifully. And that is sure no easy feat. P.S. Thought I'd be safe and check spoiler pertaining to my critique of director/ screenwriter treatment of a female character in this film. Some viewers of Vampires will find Sheryl Lee's character's treatment to be offensive in the extreme re misogyny/sexism/ violence against women, and as a progressive, enlightened male, it's a charge that's hard to refute. I personally think the character in question could've gone through the versions of hell she goes through and not, say, be tied naked to a bed in the process (there is nothing in her nakedness that's crucial to the scene at hand, or the movie in general; it's 100% gratuitous, meant solely for the titillation of the males in the audience, and as a male I am indeed offended by that). I also don't think it was necessary to treat Sheryl Lee's character post- vampire with total callousness, even though I understand where the filmmakers are coming from with this; they're saying she's a vampire, these vampire hunters despise vampires and, therefore, her treatment's going to be abysmal, which fits character-wise and story-wise. That's a fine argument except for one niggling detail, which is, when you pornographize to the extent which Sheryl Lee is pornographized, you're not overriding the sexually desirable with the vampirically wretched, not by any stretch. You're only dealing in sex and desirability - and given that her keeper in the scene in question (Daniel Baldwin) doesn't desire her at all, the filmmakers can't even say it's contextual. It's just plain misogyny, period.

This is of a slightly different theme though &#150; whilst still a vampire film, it has more of a western feel to it, from the sparse desert landscapes and gunslinging vampire hunters, to the whole overtone of vengeance and retribution. Some say this is one of Carpenter's worst films, but when you've made a name for yourself, and established a solid reputation, you're free to churn out a bit of bilge every now and then, eh? Personally, I think this movie's quite entertaining&#133; This plot line is quite a good one. Vampire slayers, employed by the Catholic Church (another catholicism-basher, then?) are on the verge of wiping them out for good. Tracking the latest batch of pesky bloodsuckers, they believe they've found the 'nest'. Apparently, according to their 'Slayer Rules' if you find the nest, you find the master. Unfortunately, they don't find him at the nest, but he finds them at their motel. Valek, the Master, wipes out most of the slayers, leaving him free and unmolested to perform an ancient ritual that will enable him to walk in the daylight, and reign supreme. The whole 'take-over-the-world' ploy rears its ugly head once again.First and foremost the biggest reason to watch this film is James Woods. He does a brilliant job of his hard-ass, sardonic and murderous vampire slayer, Jack Crow. He has some of the best lines in the movie Vampires are not romantic. Its not like they're a bunch of f*ckin' fags hoppin' around in rented formal wear and seducing everybody in sight with cheesy Euro-trash accents, all right? and he looks cool with a crossbow. (Of course, his parents were killed by vampires, which explains why he spends the entire movie being perpetually angry.) Daniel Baldwin is Jack's second in command, Anthony Montoya. He is clearly meant to be the strong, silent type who backs his partner up with unfailing loyalty. Unfortunately, Montoya seems hellbent on challenging Jack's every idea, and there's quite an amusing scrap between the two towards the end of the movie. (Guys, eh?) Sheryl Lee's Katrina is a hooker who becomes inescapably involved with things after being bitten by the Master Vampire, and Jack and Montoya use her to help them find him. She basically does what she was famed for in Twin Peaks &#150; she spends the entire film looking mostly dead, and predictably, there's the token scene where she's in the buff for no good reason. Tim Guinee does a good turn as a vampire-hunter-wannabe-priest who chiefly gets in Jack's face a lot. Jack responds by kicking the hell out of him at every given opportunity. Interestingly enough, Guinee appears in Blade as Karen Jensen's ex-boyfriend. He turns into a vampire, and she kicks the hell out of him. Thomas Ian Griffin is very good as Valek. He's very menacing and rather grotesque in a way, and he makes some interestingly gory kills. (If this film taught me one thing, it's to watch out for guys with sharp fingernails.) Maximillian Schell does a good job as the Cardinal that Jack's slayer-gang report to. He's obviously corrupt and conniving&#133;. just look at his beard.The rest of the film looks really good. (Having a jedi of directing like John Carpenter at the helm, you would expect this.) It's full of dusty yellow, heat-hazed desert panoramas, long open roads, blood, sweat, guns and seedy motels. Just the kind of life a roaming vampire-slayer would have. Jack and his crew of miscreant vampire-slayers look like hi-tech pest control. Valek and his band of minions &#150; who look like a heavy metal band who take their costuming very seriously &#150; cause necessary murder and havoc. Check out the Monastery scene towards the end of the film. There's something about people in dusty black coats throwing monks against walls that only John Carpenter could make look amusing.For all it's bad reviews, this film makes good on a few things, like cracking one-liners, (don't make me come over there and beat the sh*t out of you, Padre) an amazing amount of gore, and John Carpenter's home-made (slightly dodgy) soundtrack. This movie is more than adequate for a Saturday night in with a couple of friends, a few beers and a pizza. Just don't expect more than that, and you won't be disappointed.

One suggestion is that around the world there are nests of vampires lurking in unexpected places. The aim of the vampires is to possess a cross which has magical powers and will allow them to exist in daylight hours instead of always being creatures of the night and dark places. Vampires are almost indestructible for their numbers can easily be increased simply by biting someone and that person develops into a vampire within a very short time. Recruitment of vampires is therefore not at all difficult.Of course the Vatican must stop this proliferation of evil and engages Jack Crow (James Wood) to hunt out the nests and exterminate them. What a guy is Jack! With a massive assortment of equipment including crossbows and long spears (apparently guns are not much use) Jack Crow leads his support group into dangerous places. When eliminating vampires it is essential to go for the heart. A sharp thrust right through. When the victim staggers he is dragged by a hawser out into the sunlight. A sudden burst of flame and only the skull is left.I always thought that vampires were weak, pale and anemic craving for blood to sustain them. Here they are violent and quite strong being able to lift a man and throw him across a room.If you miss the first conflagration, don't worry there are lots more to follow. Jack's methods seem to work very well. But the Master Vampire is truly hard to catch and poor Jack loses most of his support team. There is a minor love theme essential to the plot. A hooker has been bitten and consequently she can be used to hunt down Valek because once bitten there is a a telepathic communication between the Master and his victim. This idea tends to stretch the imagination a little too far but who am I to make such judgments. I know nothing about the vampire world.John carpenter's spooky music adds to the creepy atmosphere.

The main vampire hunter, a guy named Jack, does come off as a bit over-the-top -- like he's trying to be arnie or van dam -- but it ends up being funny and entertaining rather than just bad. The plot line is original and involves a catholic intrigue, with a few truly surprising twists at the end. The music is also by John Carpenter and went well with the scenery (film is set in the southwest) and the mood of the movie. Unconventional movie music but I liked it a lot. 7.5/10 I'd like to see this one again, potentially buy it if it's not too much.

The story is simple. Basically, in this movie, all the vampires want to kill humans, so of course, we have to kill them first. So, james woods (who plays a vampire hunter working for the catholic church) and the least appealing baldwin brother gather up some fellow social outcasts and try to kill the master vampire before he finds a way to start walking around during the day.James woods and all the vampire hunters are really stupid and unlikeable, and when i say that i mean James Wood's character mostly. He and the baldwin guy spend most of the movie slapping around sheryl lee and talking about erections. This is fine i guess, if you like that sort of thing, but it doesn't really make for a quality movie. Also, Carpenter goes out of his way to tell us that the vampires here are not the romantic kind, who try and seduce girls and wear expensive clothes. But then he has the master vampire wearing some kind of fancy suit and a cape! And he has a distinctly european-sounding name. Yeah, I'm really sure Valek is from texas or oklahoma. But whatever.I understand that this movie was trying to be some kind of vampire themed western, but even cheap westerns have better dialogue and more likeable characters than this. the catholic church should also sue the creators of this movie for making priests out to be such spineless idiots. one priest actually has the brilliant line that goes A master vampire, able to walk in the sunlight, unstoppable. Unless we stop him. Uh Huh. And this is not bad compared to some of the stuff James Woods gets to say. He actually asks the master vampire about how well the vampire's penis works, not once, but twice! Even worse, Woods says all his lines with this arrogant conviction that leads you to believe he actually thinks he's telling you quality stuff! In the end, the vampires are more sympathetic than the humans because at least they don't talk as much. This movie is like watching a porno, except instead of sex, it has vampires.3/10.

It is fast-paced and outrageous.  Many people think it is overly gory (and it is the most gory of all Carpenter films, most of which purposefully eschew gore), but, like a good Sam Raimi film, the gore here is part of the fun.  James Woods gives a perfect over-the-top performance as a vampire slayer and resentful scumbag, although he does tend to overshadow every other actor in the film.  The story is only a small portion of the fun here, but it had a number of surprises for me.  For example, the movie first appears to be anti-Catholic but ends up being more pious than one would suppose (and it's not too tough to notice that the hero's initials are J.C.).  Far better than From Dusk Till Dawn, which is only good for the first 15 minutes.  I give Vampires a hearty 8/10.

The recent batch of movies by Carpenter have been a letdown. A recent example is 'Vampires' starring James Woods and to be honest if the film didn't have Woods then it would be totally lost.I won't go over the plot as my friends here do so adequately but the problem with this film is that does nothing very well. The editing in the film is atrocious, it tries to be cool with the use of fast cut editing particularly in the opening sequence but it only looks amateurish, a bit like a karaoke singer after one too many.Apart form Woods the acting doesn't inspire either and the actors employed would be best left to tv filmwork. I don't include Maximmilian Schell in this because he is one of the great actors and wasted in this tripe. He only appears briefly though.This film has been made in the same vein as another Carpenter movie, 'Big Trouble in Little China' but 'Vampires' isn't as good and not half as funny.My conclusion with this film is don't bother to even rent it instead wait for a freebie on tv.

In fact it plays more like a western. However it does give a fresh take on vampire films. It centres on the world of the vampire hunters, rather then innocent victims or the vampires themselves. Carpenter has avoided the tongue in cheek angle however, so this is far from a buffy the vampire slayer type of film.James Woods plays the role of the head slayer well, a man on a mission with a deep hatred for vampires. Daniel Baldwin plays his number 2 and adds an extra dimension to the plot with his interaction with Sheryl Lee, the sexual tension between them and the subsequent morale dilemma it causes for woods character. Does he slay his best friend turned vampire?There is not a lot of time spent with the world of the vampire. Thomas Ian Griffith's does extremely well in his portrayal of Valek the head vampire but he is most definitely a bad guy in the film and not a character that faces much examination. His minions all wear black and could be out of any number of modern vampire films they are far from the romantic sort. The only human side to the vampires you see is from the freshly turned Bladwin and Lee. As I said though it's not a romantic film, more film noire with the pacing of a good western.Overall I found this very refreshing and would recommended to any fan of vampire films.

(Too bad) Yes,  there were a lot of complaints that it wasn't scary enough.  (Boo hoo)  Get this  IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE! This one's all about James Woods hamming it up as the crazy baddass who makes his living, hunting down and killing vampires.  That's it. Plain and simple.  That's right.  This is an old fashioned action/western flick with vampires playin' the baddies.  Now, with that said,  I'm gonna break this poppy down.  (so stop reading if you're worried about the spoilers, cause I'm about to lay some down)We start off in the desert with Jimmy Woods and Daniel Baldwin scoping out an old abondoned house.  We then see them open the back door of their armored car to let out the troop.  The slayers suit up and into the house we go.  Vampires are shot, beaten, smacked around by Woods, and drug out into the sun where they BURST into flames like match-heads.Once the nest is cleared out,  the team are living it up at a sleazy motel, partyin' and drinkin' with nearly every whore in the state, when they get an unexpected visitor who crashes their party.  This party-pooper, by the way, is a giant Trent Reznor-looking, 600 year-old vampire (head master vampire, mind you) named Valek.   Valek, shows up and makes a real mess of the place, snapping necks, ripping heads, tearing people in half like paper, and having a good time, all the while, wiping out the whole damn crew.  In fact, the only survivors are Woods, Baldwin, and a just-bitten, prostitute.  The dissappointed three flee the place and start haulin' ass in a big ol' chevy (This is a nice chase scene, by the way)  losing Valek.  Pretty soon it's sunrise and they're semi-safe for a while.Things slow down for a bit until Woods has to go back to the hotel to clean up a bit.  That part I loved.  Lots of bloody gore and lots more severing. Also, the music to this scene ROCKS. Well,  the bitten prostitute is being kept around for one reason only.  She will serve as a tracking device to Valek because the two are telepathically linked. In the meantime,  Woods picks himself up a new priest (played by Tim Guinee) except he really doesn't care for the guy much.  It's great fun watching him slap the poor guy around and taunt him with homo-sexual remarks and that's all the spoiling I feel like doing.  Don't worry,  I didn't give away too much.  We're only twenty-minutes into the whole thing.This is one of my favorite vampire flicks EVER.  It delivers in all departments and doesn't give us this overly romanticized,  sexy, dracula, schtick that I have become all too used to.  These guys are bloodsuckers from Hell and there is NOTHING sexy about them (although, I think the ladies will dig Valek.  He does a great job with the sparse screen time that he gets.Another thing I really apprecitated was that all of the effects were real. There was none of the CGI crap that we usually get in horror flicks these days.  That was refreshing.Having read the book, I had high expectations.  While the movie left out a LOT, it was still very well done.  The book focused much more on the whole mercenary thing and I really hated that Felix's character wasn't a part of the film.  Oh well,  this is still a good time.  Once you know that it's not supposed to be scary, you may enjoy it a lot more.  There's a sequal in the works and I'm looking forward to it.

Admittedly Vampires isn't as bad as films like Village of the Damned but it shows none of the suspense, good story and general creepiness of his early work. Vampires is just another From Dusk Till Dawn movie, epitomising everything that is wrong with horror movies in the 90s.

An interesting opening sequence shows James Woods and his team of Slayers invading a vampire sanctum in broad daylight.  Their technology is nifty and the ever-present set of Important Rules add flavor to the tired kill Dracula formula.From there, though, we're subjected to the usual formulaic writing decline. The Master Vampire kills a lot of folk, bites Sheryl Lee, and quests after a mystical Black Cross that will enable him to walk in sunlight and thus become invulnerable.  Of course, our two remaining not-very-likable heroes must stop him by duct-taping an inexplicably naked Lee to a bed and turning a mild-mannered priest into a shotgun-toting former soccer player bad boy.There's really no one to root for in this film.  The main characters are either two-dimensional (Woods), bad-tempered (Woods), or both (Woods and buddy Daniel Baldwin).  Master Vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) we could care less about, and Sheryl Lee is little more than hissing eye-candy.That being said, it's awfully hard to care about the plot's outcome.  The run-of-the-mill tedium is numbing.  Gore is fairly heavy and sometimes well executed, but the movie is not at all frightening.  Mild suspense is the most we get.There are one or two semi-interesting twists thrown in, but I expected more from this film.

That said, I must also say that Vampire$ by John Steakley is perhaps my favorite fiction novel.  It influenced a lot of modern vampire and vampire-hunter lore, as well as this writer's storytelling style.I never go to a movie based on a book expecting to see the book.  Jurassic Park was a lot of fun, regardless of Crichton's own self-surgery, and I loved Starship Troopers for the Nazi propaganda satire it was.  But, come ON!  There are soooo many good elements in Vampire$ it seems a shame to neglect them!No Felix??  He's the catalyst of the story!  No Jack Crow becoming a Vampire at the end?  Hoping for a sequel, Mr. Carpenter?  Fat chance.  Carl Joplin and Annabelle were also sorely missed.I will say that the characters of Father Adam and Valek were faithfully plucked from the book (although Valek was severely neglected in terms of development).  Okay, transplanting Davette into the hooker Katrina made a certain amount of movie sense, but all Cheryl Lee did was writhe around and roll her eyes like some psychotic crack whore, which she is eminently qualified to do (and not that I'm complaining -- her performance was... um, riveting).Combining the characters of Cherry Cat and Montoya into Daniel Baldwin's best Reservoir Dogs impersonation was bearable, and James Woods honestly comes as close to being Jack Crow as I could expect, with the two following problems 1) Jack Crow would never need to steal a car (that was just stupid), and 2) the neat thing about Jack Crow is that he's tough as nails on the outside, but is slowly withering away on the inside, watching all his friends die and crying in the Pope's lap.  No development for the movie Crow, aside from the revelation that he killed his vampiric father and he likes to hurt people (did like the wood references, though).The basic theme of the book is that there's this bunch of ex-football players and commandos and such who drive around in a semi, ridding decent God-fearing communities of their vampire problem and getting paid HUGE sums of money to do it, and knowing that eventually, they're all going to die. The basic theme of the movie is that there's this handful of tough guys slaying vampires in the southwest.It's a western.It's a bad western.As a vampire flick, it's kinda fun.  Near Dark was much better.As any kind of tribute or slight nod to John Steakley's well-crafted characters, it is a travesty.And it's number 8 out of the top 10 box office offerings for last week.

It's neither director John Carpenter's best work and doesn't come even close to his best movies (HALLOWEEN, THE THING etc.). However, in this day and age, when all the vampires seem to be brooding, good looking teenagers who try to avoid killing people, it feels good to watch a movie in which vampires are what they're meant to be monsters.The film starts with a group of vampire hunters, lead by man named Jack Crow, attacking a nest of vampires in New Mexico. All the blood suckers are killed and the gang go to celebrate in local motel. At night a vampire named Valek attacks them and none of their weapons seem to work on him. Valek slaughters nearly the entire group, only Jack, his friend Montana and a hooker bitten by Valek survive. Jack decides to hunt down Valek who turns out to be the oldest and most powerful vampire.This film is not meant to be anything more than an entertaining popcorn movie to relax with and then go on with your life, and it works like that. Carpenter keeps the story going, doesn't even try to create any unnecessary plot twists or minor characters, but keeps the story very clear and simple. Music is good, actors capable and the action sequences don't go over the board.James Woods is the definite show stealer here. His Jack Crow is definitely one of the more entertaining vampire hunters I have seen in movies. He's not an old Van Helsing clone, or a superhuman hybrid like Blade, nor does he have an arsenal of ridiculous weapons like Hugh Jackman's modernized Van Helsing. Only things Crow has are a handgun, crossbow and smart-ass comments. Woods obviously has had fun playing the been there, done that guy to whom killing vampires is just an everyday work.In other roles Tim Guinee is a good counterpart for Woods, as the nervous and inexperienced priest who joins the group. Especially the scenes where Woods has to teach him the facts of life are enjoyable. Thomas Ian Griffith looks really awesome as the vampire Valek. Although he doesn't have much to do, just watching him ripping people to pieces is a pleasure, since not many vampires these days has that bite anymore. In fact, all the vampires in this movie look awesome, with pale skin, long teeth and nails, glowing eyes and dressed all in black. This is what vampire are about! So VAMPIRES is not truly memorable film, but if you want to watch a little better film from director John Carpenter's 1990's works, where James Woods is at his best and vampires are not brooding teenagers, then this is a film for you. Put it on, sit back and enjoy.

Featuring some good performances, dark humour, gore and action, Vampires is an above average vampire film which lacks the spark of other Carpenter classics.The Catholic Church has known about Vampires for centuries. In fact, they are partly to blame for their creation, leading to much of the cynical humour of the film. They find out about The Black Cross, a device capable of making Vampires invulnerable to sunlight, and that master vampire Valek is after it. They send in their most skilled fighters-James Woods, Daniel Baldwin and co. to find the nest, and destroy all the demons. Woods plays Jack Crow, a hunter who has been brought up by the church to fight vampires after a tragic youth. His gang finds the nest, and kill all the evil ones inside. However, they don't realise they did not get Valek. While celebrating with hookers, Valek appears and wipes out almost everyone, except, Crow, Baldwin and one bitten prostitute played by Sheryl Lee. They escape and try to decide what to die. A new Padre is sent to the annoyance of Crow, and they try to find the cross before Valek. Katrina the hooker, because she is turning, has a psychic connection with Valek and can lead them to him. However, she may turn soon and they must try to save her. Baldwin is also getting a little too close to her for Crow's liking.Being a Carpenter film this has a Western feel to it, the settings, the dialogue, the characters all reminiscent of classic Cowboy figures. The finale is also a stand of much like Rio Bravo. Woods steals every scene he is in, while Lee and Baldwin provide good support. Griffith is ideal as Valek, looks and talks the part with ease. There is a good amount of gore, and an admirable lack of CG. Whle the story is simple, it works well and everything looks cool. There is something missing though, whether it be a strong theme tune by Carpenter (his one here is forgettable) or a real cliffhanger ending, or sense of apocalypse. I'm not sure what is missing, but it is not up to the standards of his past classics. Still good though.7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"It wasn't nominated for the Oscar...so what?","Date":"9 April 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I bought this film without even having the slightest idea what I was going to see. But I was positively surprised by this movie! John Carpenter proves that he is still capable to make very good films even if they're not busting through the roof of the box office.Unlike John Carpenter's classics like Halloween, The Fog or The Thing I think this movie was not intended to be scary. And it definitely wasn't meant to win an Oscar for best screenplay or acting! This film is not just a horror film but also a cool road-movie. The scenery is very enjoyable throughout the whole 108 minutes. I loved the aerial shots of the desert-like plains at sunset. The locations give the film kind of a free and romantic feeling.But the romanticism stops where the fights between vampire and man begin. The film was surprisingly gory considering it was 1998 and the MPAA wasn't on vacation (hey, nobody said that I didn't like the gory scenes). The film is not based on computer generated effects but on nice stunts and cool gore effects. But that doesn't mean there's nothing else to like about Vampires.The acting is not outstanding but decent enough for this kind of film. James Woods was perfect for the role of ruthless vampire slayer Jack Crow. Thomas Ian Griffith was very convincing and looks good even if disguised as a vampire. Daniel Baldwin does okay and Sheryl Lee is a hot...uhm...actress.A very enjoyable film overall, not scary but perfect to spend your Saturday evening with.My rating 8/10 (if you want more information DVD contains an interesting audio commentary by John Carpenter himself!)

This movie has the absolute worst dialogue I've ever listened to. How could James Woods keep a straight face while saying it?

Memo to screenwriters there is no convincing way to portray a woman under a vampire's telepathic control. See Ryder, Winona Bram Stoker's Dracula. Let's drop that little gimmick, yes? Surprisingly, the only thing I liked about this movie was Thomas Ian Griffith. He *DEFINITELY* had the master vampire look going. Too bad he had to open his mouth, speak, and ruin the effect. How idiotic a method to kill vampires. Harpooning them and dragging them into the sunlight. If the turncoat priest warned the master about the attack in the beginning, why wouldn't the master have moved the nest? wouldn't that be easier than having to go out and get more vampires, and risking the possible death of the master, however unlikely?wait..that would be logical. here's hoping John Carpenter is abducted by Vulcans and forced to be their concubine before he makes another movie.

I think its time for Mr. Carpenter to let REAL composers add some atmosphere to his movies, because he hasn't developed his skills with the passage of time.But enough about that, what about the movie? I've only just seen it, but I wasn't sure at first if I had seen it before. I'd certainly heard of it, but once I watched it, I realised it was my first time. Not a good sign really, that the movie is so formulaic in its workings that I thought I'd seen it. Perhaps I had, and it was as memorable then?! The problem for Vampires is..... From Dusk till Dawn! That is a Vampire movie, funny, with suspense, everything Vampires wasn't! James Woods plays the swearing and violent Lead Slayer, but he doesn't do it with any cool or panache. Shades and a leather jacket doesn't always = cool.The support cast, one of the Baldwin brothers, Maximilien Schell (slumming it!) and Ian Thomas Griffiths are all simply OK.I've not read the book, and I hope to hell the movie isn't remotely a perfect adaptation, because that would seriously question the intelligence of anyone who'd want to film it! Vampires isn't terrible, and its also not great. What it is though, is immensely derivative of lots of other Vampire movies you've seen before, but it doesn't stand out, and is guilty of being so average, it felt almost a waste of time watching it.James Woods is wasted in this movie, he's better than the script he was given, and for sure Clooney did it a whole lot better and cooler in FDTD.Its a sad state of affairs when Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV does a better job at entertaining than Carpenter did with Vampires.I think John Carpenter has seriously lost his touch.Next film?

It's not scary, though that's probably not the intent.","Date":"18 June 2001","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  ** out of **** This is my second review of John Carpenter's Vampires, and it's a considerable jump from my original * star rating.  I'll get into those reasons in a moment, but there are a couple of statements in my original review that I truly regretted stating.  For one thing, I feel a bit out of line implying John Carpenter as an untalented director.  He's gifted, all right, though he still has a tendency to ruin perfectly good premises.When I first saw Vampires (around the time it was first released), I had been expecting a terrifying scarefest, and considering the fact it was arrived in theaters during Halloween weekend, my expectations were further built up.  At the time, it was a complete disappointment to me due to the complete lack of scares and certain other elements I'll further go into in a moment.  I wrote the review last year, but it was based on the memory of it that I had back when it first came out and all I remember was feeling angry and disappointed.For the most part, it seems my disappointment came because I had been expecting scary and spooky, but didn't get any of that at all.  Since then, I've also looked at other aspects, and decided to give Vampires a second chance.  It was much better than my first viewing, though I want to stress that it's still far from being among Carpenter's best (i.e. The Thing, In the Mouth of Madness) and it's certainly not a great film by a long shot.  Still, it qualifies as watchable screen entertainment and is still decent filmmaking.My second viewing gave realization that Carpenter wasn't striving for a horror film (though he stated otherwise in his DVD commentary, but I'll ignore that remark).  It's more of a Western, given the human-vampire showdowns and guns drawn in desperado-style fashion.  The setting, often in desert towns and motels, only enforces that feeling.There's originality in the script, and that must be credited.  It's fascinating to know that the Catholic Church created the first vampire and is using vampire hunters to rid the world of them.  This core idea is the best vampire premise I've heard to date, and it's unfortunate it's not developed or explored further than what we're given.  There's really not enough look into how these teams were formed or how the members were chosen.The film chooses to kill off most of the team in the first 20 minutes, which I suppose I'll have to accept for the benefit of the plot (which basically involves a vampire's quest to find a cross that will grant him the ability to walk in sunlight, and the human slayers who try to stop him),  but it still left me wondering the possibilities if the movie kept them around longer.  Some of their interactions were wildy humorous, and I was interested in finding out exactly how they all came to meet one another.  When they are killed, it's actually a little odd to see the lack of emotional expression on both team leader Jack Crow (James Woods) and his partner Montoya's (Daniel Baldwin) face.  I thought I sensed some camaraderie between the teammates, but I guess they didn't really get along as well as it seemed.The movie opens with a bang and ends the same way, featuring gorefests and constant vampire attacks that keep the action moving.  These serve as the film's best moments.  The first 20 minutes features not one, but two massacres (one for the humans, the other for the vampires, or rather just one vampire).  The last 35 minutes features an abundance of vampire attacks on the remaining slayers, as well as the final confrontation between our anti-hero, Jack Crow (James Woods), and the head vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  Carpenter's direction during these scenes is more than competent, creating tension and some excitement.  These scenes were considerably better than I had remembered on my first viewing.To go further into the motel massacre, there are a few things I wondered about.  Two of the slayers, Deyo and Anthony, as well as a cop, were clearly only slapped by Valek and you can see that Anthony is clearly still conscious when he goes to the floor, which makes me wonder why he never got up and left with Crow and Montoya.  Sure, some would say they were slashed but I clearly didn't see any cuts on their faces.  There were also several prostitutes in the other room with Crow (the room Valek wasn't in) and I wondered they all ended up getting killed.  Perhaps Valek just came back and finished the job.Despite the action-filled beginning and ending, it's the middle segment that sorely lacks.  For 50 uncomfortable minutes, we are treated to mysogynism as our two lead slayers constantly hit and abuse this prostitute that was bitten by Valek.  Fun, this most certainly is not.  The pacing is terrible during this long stretch, and I found myself squirming in my seat.While we're in the subject of abuse, there's also plenty of priest-bashing, which leads me to wonder how odd it is that the one priest Crow continuously pounds on, Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), actually finds all this physical pain as a teaching device, turning him into a tough guy and somewhat rowdy slayer (albeit still a reasonable and faithful man of God, which is far more than can be said for any of the other slayers) by the end of the film.  It's nice to see Carpenter doing something he would do, though the resulting development of Guitea still seems a bit unlikely.Speaking of Tim Guinee, I'm a bit surprised hardly any critics or viewers mention him (yes, I myself neglected to mention him in my first viewing).  He arguably delivers the movie's second best performance (behind James Woods, of course) and has perhaps more screen time than the other three billed before him (Daniel Baldwin, Thomas Ian Griffith, and Shery Lee).  He's also the most likable and sympathetic character, since he feels completely out of place in this terrible situation.  Sure, the same could be said for Lee, but she overacts to an unconvincing manner and turns into a vampire by the end.I still feel the same about most of the acting.  While Guinee was far more memorable than I recalled and Woods is as fun as ever to watch, everybody else still remains rather underwhelming.  Daniel Baldwin is, of course, still the least talented among his siblings.  Thomas Ian Griffith snarls a lot, but isn't scary for a moment.  Maximillian Schell is on hand to smile in a sickly fake fashion and get a paycheck.  Thankfully, the last 35 minutes are better, though not quite enough to give the movie that ** 1/2 star rating that I had been pondering (yup, my second viewing was REALLY more kind).  Carpenter should have added a few more vampire attacks in the conclusion, just to work harder to make up for the very lackluster pacing and unpleasantness of the middle segment.There are some other flaws.  Some character motivation feels a bit out of place, particularly the revelation of a traitor.  There's also Carpenter's score, which is actually quite memorable and entertaining to listen to, but it maintains the same slow speed and tempo, it hampers some potentially fast-moving action sequences.  The last fight between Crow and Valek is a bit of a letdown; it's somewhat thrilling, but not nearly as exciting or as suspenseful as it could have been.  Plus, that giant cross used in the final fight looked a little bit like a rubber contraption for one brief moment.Carpenter's endings (mainly his horror-oriented films) are usually ironic, bleak, darkly humorous, or a mix of all those.  Vampires is the only one not to end this way, and it actually doesn't surprise me.  It just doesn't feel like a movie telegraphed for a dark ending, and the lack of a final kicker is actually another letdown.  I mean, who could forget the final scenes to The Thing, Prince of Darkness, or In the Mouth of Madness?  They all went out with a real bang, keeping the viewer entranced even as the end credits rolled.  Vampires just sort of ends, actually, and left me with a feeling that I hadn't possibly seen everything.  And, as a whole, the movie still feels incredibly predictable (except of course, the way Valek kills off his victims). As I've already said before, Vampires is quite a gorefest, and it'll please those looking for blood and guts.  As a matter of fact, this could very well be Carpenter's goriest film to date (or a tie with The Thing).  There's decaptitations, neck bites, lots of blood spurting, and even a man who's cut in half, and not in the way you'd expect.  Yeah, credit should be given to Robert Kurtzman for putting in a lot of convincing gory f/x without relying on CGI, but the film will probably be too stomach-churning for some.  Vampires was 1998's second vampire movie (to the best of my memory, that was the second pair of duo films that year) and it's easily the better one.  Blade is still terrible, no matter what anybody else thinks.  If you're going to see one of these two, please avoid that brain dead action thriller and at least stick with this one for something more reasonably smart.It's not often that I feel this kind to a movie that I'd already seen, so for me, I find this a rather rare occasion.  I might trying watching it again in a few months to see if I gain anymore new appreciation for certain parts.  Now, this doesn't mean I'll just go right out and change my mind on any film.  There are many, many bad and good movies out there that are simply the same whether by memory or another viewing.  I happened to come back to Vampires again because of it's connection with a renowned director, the film's premise, and my understanding of the fact that this isn't a balls-out horror film, as Carpenter would put it.  Though, as a warning, those expecting the kind of film I had been looking forward to when I first saw this might find themselves feeling similarly the way I did after I first saw this flick.

I suppose the excuse to make this is the innovation of killing them in a slightly different way than is rote.But the reward here is James Woods. I think he is one of our best technical film actors.

Clint Eastwood and he have an exchange about one of their wives which ranks in my top film moments.Oops, a minor spoiler follows, though you should be able to see it from across the continent.So here is Woods in a really unartful enterprise, playing a role that seems to allow no room for acting. And his comrades wouldn't know how to cocreate a technical reading anyway. But he's still damned good! It is like fine rock guitar playing the holes are where the emotion is. Woods does what the director wants during the `important' moments, like saying goodby to his infected partner, like confronting the cardinal. All according to the specified level of mundaneness. But in the holes, where he is just walking, or grabbing an implement, you can see a good actor. Even this small leavening excites.And such is noted in the only clever dialog. There's a juvenile running joke about getting an erection when killing vampires.

After the terrible Escape from LA (1996), Carpenter really saved his butt and his fans by making this film. Pretty close to the western films, through the story about tough vampire hunters team in small towns on the edge of the desert, near New Mexico. With James Woods as the leader of the team. The movie is based upon a novel Vampires by John Steakley, a pretty solid novel, I might add. Carpenter did a pretty good thing here, by showing his vision of vampires, a dark, Gothic monsters of the night, by my opinion the way it should be. There's a lot of blood, gore, action and somewhat cynicism... well expected from Carpenter, but the result is pretty average here. Comparatively... entertaining film, with characters very different than those from the book, they are pretty weak in the film... but the dialog remained the same, a lot of toughness, swearing and other angry-macho stuff, there's also a weak tension as the movie goes by. But, not a bad job, again...Now, acting crew here was a good choice. James Woods, who holds this film on his chest, as Jack Crow, a merciless, tough vampire hunter, in one of his best performances, honestly I think that James Woods steal the show. He was brilliant. Daniel Baldwin, not a great actor, but he did a nice job here. Sheryl Lee, a fine choice for a tortured prostitute, on the way to become a vampire, she was good. Maximilian Schell's appearance in this film was a surprise, great actor, Tim Guinee was also OK, and to mention a well-known actors from Woods's team Mark Boone Junior, great! and Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa, great! But, alas... small parts... And the best thing for the end. - Thomas Ian Griffith - Don't know how they got him for the part... but, that was more than the perfect choice. A worthy original vampire villain from a Carpenter film. Griffith played Jan Valek a 600 old vampire master. Formidable, dark and alluring, and of course a real monster, the way it should be! Griffith is perhaps the best known for the part of Valek. Absolutely one of the last vampires that looks great on film... regardless of these new vampire films and other vampire movies from the beginning of 2000s, including TV series... Valek is one freakin' excellent vampire! Dark camera, John Carpenter music style... ahhhh what else do you crave? This movie is perhaps for John Carpenter fans... a real treat, and of those old school vampire fans. Watch it!

Then again he could quite easily have taken up a medical degree and become a surgeon as the ability to stand the sight of blood, guts and human remains just seems to come to him naturally. But this is the sort of role Woods relishes, it is a role that does not need to be developed beyond a certain point and yet we witness a point the character's life during which he is at the peak of his game. Crow doesn't take orders, he doesn't take much stick and if an enemy needs to be disposed of then it will be with no questions asked.So we have a John Carpenter film in which the best character or certainly the most interesting is in fact the hero himself. From what I've seen Myers was more interesting in Halloween; the thing itself was more of an intriguing element in that film than anything else and the fog in the film of the same name carried that same presence and air of mystery that the thing did in that respective film. So who or what are the bad guys here? Just plain old vampires, of course. Oh, there is a head vampire or 'master' as he's known but he doesn't come close to any of Carpenter's previous antagonists &#150; he's sort of what Myers might have been like if he had gone around trying to bite everyone to death.Like Carpenter's films, the title bears a direct link to the enemy of the film or setting. 'Precinct 13' and 'New York' are both places with 'Halloween' acting as a timeframe for a film. Here whilst trying to work out the thinking behind simply calling a film 'Vampires', is when it occurs - Vampires are the enemy just as The Thing and The Fog were so why not? Vampires takes place in a world in which the average Joe might consider a nightmare scenario. The film is Dawn of the Dead set across North America and from what we hear Europe as well only there are pockets of resistance to help kill the uncanny enemy. Carpenter's heroes in his horror films inhabit spaces in which they really do not want to be but they have no choice (see Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween and Escape From New York). Here, Crow enjoys his work and likes his life. One man's dystopia is another man's utopia &#150; all the killing and maiming in Crow's life keeps him going whereas in a 'normal' environment he'd be left twiddling his thumbs.But it is not just the killing, it is the booze and the women after hours. Crow is living out a sort of American Dream by doing his job during the day and then spending it on hosting women supported by local crooked cops and drinking beer, only difference is he hasn't just put in a days work at a steel mill or something. But Vampires is a little more than just an interesting set up and predicament even if it is for the bad. We catch up with the gang just as things decide to get ugly and the vampires threaten to up their race for world domination &#150; look at it as a Cold War during which the other side are just about to obtain plans for Weapons of Mass Destruction. Jan Valek (Griffith) plays the role of the indestructible monster with the job to predominantly find an ancient cross that can be used to kill off mankind's hope once and for all and thus begins the mission to stop him. There were a few things I had problems with and the first one as to why Valek does what he does to one of the loose girls at a party the vampires gate crash. After Valek puts his little spell on her and bites her, she can see everything Valek sees making her a valuable tool for Crow and co. to use against the enemy. Is there a reason Valek was so kind as to give them that aid? Then there is the manner in which a false and rather silly romance begins to flourish between this girl and Anthony Montoya (Baldwin), Crow's best friend and ally-come-sparring partner. The romance actually takes over toward the end and is solely relied upon for the films ultimate tragedy which is the only reason it exists. Then there is the way the film develops the skills of one time priest and now loyal sidekick Adam Guiteau (Guinee) from rookie into proper hunter, sort of relegating a man of the church to level of comic relief which is done in poor and more importantly for the audience, 'unfunny' taste. But it is the way the film eerily borrows from Blade toward the end when it turns out the hero is needed for the final steps of the process to end mankind and raise the Vampires. The climax itself is a little off with the process having to be performed just-before-sunrise-and in a small area that none of the other vampires bother to check throughout the night just in case Guiteau might be hiding there. While Vampires isn't necessarily bad, it is sketchy with some pretty illogical occurrences going on. That said, it is a lot of fun and there is an energy behind it. Carpenter clearly hadn't fallen out of love making films at this pointing his career and that should be enough to make someone want to give it a go.

The story centers around a group of 'vampire hunters', led by Jack Crow (James Woods), who are a secret service summoned by the Vatican to exterminate the bloodthirsty demons. His group roams around the desert, hunting the 'nests' of vampires and exterminating them. But their routine vampire hunting becomes everything but routine when they stumble upon the Master vampire, Valek. While chasing Valek through the desert on his bloody rampage, they meet a prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who has a psychic link to the master vampire. It's up to the remaining people on the team to stop Valek, who is searching for an ancient cross that will give all vampires the ability to walk in sunlight - which could result in dire consequences for mankind.Exactly twenty years after John Carpenter directed and released the horror legend Halloween, he brought us this extremely entertaining, popcorn vampire flick. I liked the storyline for this movie, and the entire spin with the Catholic church and the powerful crucifix (giving the vampires the ability to walk in daylight) set this apart from most vampire-themed horror movies in the sense that it isn't too conventional. These vampires aren't easy to kill. Scratch the garlic, that doesn't do anything. They aren't flamboyant or seductive - they're bloodthirsty demons, and the only way to kill them is a stake to the heart. Sure, there are quite a few plot holes here and the script isn't perfect, but these aren't large matters considering the type of film this is. There is almost a campy sense in this movie, because it is hard to take too seriously on many occasions, although I think this might add to it's overall charm. There is also a few light dashes of black humor to be found as well, but nothing too over-the-top. This film still strives to maintain its seriousness.The cast is actually pretty good here as well. James Woods is our leading hero, and he plays a cynical bad-ass. He's a great actor and I've enjoyed his work in the films that I've seen him in, and this one is no exception. Daniel Baldwin is the secondary hero, and is also good. Sheryl Lee plays the psychic prostitute, and while her character might sound a little ridiculous, she plays it well and her character is of big importance in the story. Vampires also boasts some really amazing special effects. Digital effects are minimal, most are really realistic looking and really disgusting (this movie isn't light on the gore). I have to give some credit to the special effects supervisor, because it was a job well done. There's some really well-executed actions sequences as well, and the battles with the vampires are truly engaging.Overall, Vampires is a good vampire horror movie that is worth a look for fans of the genre and/or the theme. It's not a perfect movie by any means (and it's definitely not something I would have expected from Carpenter), but the story is decent (also with some great action sequences) and entertaining nonetheless. Recommended if you like seeing some vampires do their thing. 6/10.

Specifically, it looks almost like Carpenter got a bunch of people together to party, they filmed it, and added a bunch of gore in post-production (I admit that I just made all that up as I thought about it).But anyway, this movie is a pretty amusing romp, as James Woods leads a group of hunters trying to stop a centuries-old vampire (Thomas Ian Griffith) from finding a relic and becoming fully immortal. None of the overwrought pomp from Bram Stoker's Dracula, just pure unadulterated fun; absolutely no pretense whatsoever. Definitely the sort of movie that you watch with best buds.

The basic idea, of a band of Vatican special operatives hunting vampires, was reasonably promising. But the execution (no pun intended) was awful.The special effects were variable. Whilst gruesome in the extreme (one protagonist was cut virtually in two by a vertical blow of the master vampires hand), basic special effects like a flying vampire, and dead bodies, were often not realistic. When the vampires were dragged into the sunlight they first started to steam (not smoke, apparently), and then either exploded like oversized firecrackers, or gave off huge quantities of flame like roman candles. I am not sure whether we were meant to be appalled, sickened, or amused by it.Having introduced the team as a ribald and profane group of devout Christian warriors for the Vatican (the compromises are rather startling), the majority of the characters are then killed off in a bloodbath. The surviving hero then turns renegade and virtually single-handedly finds the hiding-place of a crucifix that had been missing for 700 years, and incidentally the master vampire that has been hunting it. Having been captured by the vampire, he is then rescued in a lightning commando raid by a priest. At this point I became convinced that this film was meant to be a black comedy.Despite the apparent religious connotations, and the references to exorcism (which if conducted in reverse apparently destroys the body but preserves an undead soul- an interesting idea that could have been explored more), this is a pagan film! They even specially deny that cruxifixes, crosses, and garlic work against vampires. Heresy! Give me a traditional vampire film any day.Few films show such consistent contempt for the audience. The producers obviously despise those who appreciate good horror.

If the nearest video store doesn't have it at the moment you can try to locate another store or just settle with renting John Carpenter's Vampires.It's not as spectacular but it's certainly good enough if you're just looking for an anti-intelligent and sensationally bloody movie about a bunch of vampire-slaying lunatics. There's so little of plot in this film that it's really hard to believe Vampires is actually based on a novel. James Woods is excellent as Jack Crow, perhaps because we very rarely see him in the type of a role like this.I don't like Daniel Baldwin like I really don't want to praise any of the Baldwin brothers but Sheryl Lee was once again irresistible and Thomas Ian Griffith made a fabulous performance as the master vampire Valek.

At a time when the horror genre is being overrun by teeny bopper horror/comedies (no references needed), parlor trick gimics a la Blair Witch, and countless direct-to-video vomit fests, VAMPIRES was released. Thank God for John Carpenter. Now there is nothing new here, nothing groundbreaking or philisophical, no Oscar candidates or social commentaries, just good clean, wholesome horror.Disguised as a low-budget gore-fest, VAMPIRES proves to be so much more. The perfected skill and technique of Mr Carpenter oozes through every scene in his 19th project. James Woods, a highly underrated actor, delivers a great performance as Jack Crow the leader of a group of vampire slayers. Something tells me Carpenter originally wanted Kurt Russel for the role, just a hunch. Laura Palmer was also great. Superb horror-effects from legendary Robert Kurtzman and Greg Nicoterro could've made the film a better sequel to the cult-classic FROM DUSK TILL DAWN than the two pathetic sequels we've seen.The bottom line is that in a day and age when selling out to mainstream horror audiences is the way to go, John Carpenter shows us that he still has the magic. Sure it's not his best or scariest, but for those who enjoy exciting, adventurous horror in a Tales From the Crypt vein, you should definitely give it a try. Who knows you might like it.

On second viewing, this time in widescreen DVD, I managed to appreciate it more. This isn't a good movie, but I'm probably judging this against another movie I'd seen a week before (Blade). While Blade was more comical, Vampires was more humorous.As for the gore aspect - it probably wasn't as bad as it could have been. The two major problems with this movie concerned the master villain who came across as a reject from a Marilyn Manson concert and wasn't in the least bit scary, and the middle hour of the movie managed to be way too slow. I noticed about 10 minutes that could have been trimmed immediately - noticeably the stupid long shots of Woods and co walking down the road, and the five or six vampire burning bodies at the beginning.If you take it for what it is - a darkly humourous look at Vampires, and if you are not Catholic (which this movie seemed to have something against), then you may enjoy it.This is Carpenter's best movie for a long time, but still falls way short of his early excellence.

He takes a bite out of a hooker in a really imaginative way, and in just two days she changes.As the formula goes, you never know when you are in the midst of one of them.With all this said and done, believe it or not,I still found the film to be well worth watching, especially on DVD.

The tension, suspense, colourful characters and an excellent moody score all blend into a well rounded little chiller. From the incredibly gripping opening to the tension hammered finale, Carpenter knows how to pull you along at breakneck speed and hardly stops for a breather along the way. The movie contains some of the most haunting images of Carpenter's career including a creepily, inspired scene where the Vampires rise from their dusty graves, a vision that's sure to plaster a gleaming smile on any Zombie enthusiasts face, to the Demonic, Master Vampire, Valek thrashing through the air in wild, rabid pursuit of the Vampire slayers. Of course it wouldn't be a John Carpenter movie if it didn't contain his widescreen images and this films photogenic, New Mexico desert locations deliver some of the most beautifully shot scenes in a Carpenter movie.

This is lame. As the title applies, vampires are what the film is about, using the same kind of plot tried in Bela Lugosi's day. Forget the graphic bloody violence because you've seen it all happen before. Modernizing the vampire story has lost a crucial feeling of horrifying chills, only within its place comes a lot of writers who hadn't had the time to apply an old-school formula to 90s standards. Filmwise, it looks updated, and that's it. All it should have needed is more attention to diverse detail, not a crop full of vampire hunter mercenaries who make something look like a substandard action guy thing. Now we must make an understanding here. Way back in 1978, Carpenter brought horror movies to a new dimension in HALLOWEEN, resulting the birth of the slasher. This one, VAMPIRES, offers nothing revolutionary, and attempts to cash in on newcomers who have seen vampire movies thousands of times over. With the big film studios recently losing out on delivering no visible breakthroughs, a scary future is in sight! A complete waste.

Not without its flaws","Date":"28 January 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I just saw the movie Vampires recently, and I have to say it's a nice little entry in the Kick-Ass Vampire Flick genre which began with Bordello of Blood and also includes the Wesley Snipes whup-ass masterpiece, Blade. Vampires defines a nice middle ground between the absolute carnage of Blade and the nipple-fest of Bordello of Blood. It's incoherent and laughable in parts, but hey, 90 percent of Hollywood movies are that and more.In Vampires, James Woods, who has made a career lately out of playing brooding, violent sociopaths, plays a brooding, violent sociopath who hunts vampires. It's drudge work to him, really, and he doesn't even get into the fun at the hooker hotel with his crew, who cavort with topless sluts under the benevolent smile of their priest. I'm NOT making this up!Well, in horror movies, anytime anyone has a good time partying and women go topless, people die. Sure enough, who shows up but master vampire Valek, played by Thomas Ian Griffin, who is a dead ringer -- pardon the pun -- for the lead singer of the '80s hair-wave band Youthquake.Valek does neat stuff like spinning people 'round, 'round, like a record baby 'round, 'round. Then he rips 'em in half and reaches through a guy's chest to strangle a woman. But the part that will endear him to the ladies is that he is apparently the best muffin muncher this side of the underworld. Oh, sure, they spread some bull about him biting her on the thigh -- don't believe it! He puts his mouth to good use, and turns her into some sort of pre-vampire mind slave.I know what you're saying, ladies. You'd turn into a pre-vampire mind slave for the right guy who knows how to seriously suck a girl's, ah, blood. Well, we find out about this plot development in a series of screaming arguments between the James Woods character (his name is Crow -- though, to his credit, he never tells the hookers to eat Crow)  and his sidekick, Montoya, played by the decidedly un-hispanic, definitely flabby Daniel Baldwin.Flabby. Did I say Daniel Baldwin is Flabby? He's bloated, for God's sake! His pants don't even fit, wardrobe couldn't keep up with him. Obviously Daniel's well-publicized off-screen battle with cocaine has reached a crucial stage. In the movie, Montoya is a cipher, but a bloated, glaze-eyed cipher who's in about as bad a shape as...well...ME! Can you imagine me getting into slice-and-dice tumble-fests with screaming, snarling rabid-dog vampires? I should say not.Anyway, after Valek crashes the party, Crow and Montoya escape with their lives and the pre-vampire mind slave Katrina, played by nubile nymphet Sheryl Lee.For reasons never really explained, the guys separate. Montoya checks into a sleazy motel with Katrina, and she wakes up the next morning tied up, face down naked on the bed. I believe it was at this point that every guy in the audience whispered aloud Ye-e-e-es.Anyway, as Katrina flails around, realizing how helpless she is, at the mercy of whatever dominating bad boy did this to her, Montoya wanders in and explains how he cleaned her up, mumble-mumble mumble. Yeah, sure. We're all thinkin' that bloated, jaded Daniel Baldwin is definitely a guy who knows how to make good use of a tied-up naked woman, some ice cream and lubricant.Meanwhile, Crow goes to meet his Vatican contacts. Previously, in one of his chummy screaming matches with Montoya, they'd established that the team had been betrayed. Well, one look at Maximillian Schell playing a Cardinal and I'm thinking Hmm...this ain't no walk-on. Maximillian probably sold Crow out to the Youthquake dude! Was I right -- read on!The middle part of the film is spent establishing that Crow is a sadist who likes to beat up priests, and that the filmmakers are sadists who like to decapitate priests, set them on fire, turn them into blood fountains (?!) and so on. Does someone here have an issue with the priesthood? Actually, there are S&M themes running throughout the entire film, even more than your average vampire movie. After being bitten by vampire-possessed Katrina, Daniel Baldwin's character, get this, actually SETS HIS ARM ON FIRE, even though he knows it won't stop the vampire process. Either that, or he was just particularly stoned that day on the film and they wrote it in. The vampire leaders are called Masters, and the followers are called Bottoms. Well, okay I made up that last part.Oh, and there's some incomprehensible plot point about finding some cross that will allow vampires to walk in daylight. Apparently Valek and his Youthquake cronies have been on a road tour of the Southwest looking for it for the last 300 years. The flimsy plot devices they threw into place makes no sense. But then it makes no sense that shooting vampires with high-caliber ammunition not only doesn't hurt them, but doesn't leave a mark on them. Yeah, Vampires has its flaws.But what it all boils down to is a big fight at the end. Who shows up but the Cardinal -- and he's working for the Youthquake bad guys! Well, I was just shocked at that!The Cardinal gives some lame excuse about losing his faith, not being able to believe in God, deciding a vampire's eternal life was the only option open for him. I'm thinking The only reason I'd become a vampire is for the endless kinky sex. But sex doesn't matter to Catholic priests, so what's he joining up for...unless priests ARE into kinky sex. Nah...can't be.Sadly for Valek, he makes the classic James Bond mistake of not killing the hero right away, but saving him for an especially evil, especially slow death. Naturally, Crow comes back and kicks his ass. No big surprise. But luckily, the movie makers did take one final opportunity to tie up Sheryl Lee. Ye-e-e-e-es!What happens to Daniel Baldwin's character is so especially lame and stupid that I won't even go into it. Maybe he was just wandering around on the set in a drug haze as James Woods frantically improvised dialogue, I don't know.All in all, I'd say see this movie before the Republicans take over and make films like this illegal. They don't want America to know the truth about our on-going struggle to wipe out vampires and keep Sheryl Lee tied up. Yahoo!

I read a lot of reviews, some good, many bad, but I wanted to see for myself of course. And I wasn't for one second disappointed.First off, it seems that a lot of people were disappointed with this film. Whether it be fans of the book, or just people who just wanted to insult Carpenter. Of course as with nearly all of his films, they get many bad reviews and do not so well at the box office. One of the few major critics I'll let go is Gene Siskel. He liked Vampires.Anyway, now to my opinion. While it wasn't The Thing. And really since 1982 which film of his has surpassed The Thing? I thought Vampires started off great, the method of which Jack Crow's team disposed of vampires was great. Watching the poor vamps clawing at the floor and hissing as they're dragged to their doom into the sunlight. I found it great. And for the die-hard Carpenter fans, the ones who knew how to respect this film....tell me the music did not kick ass. I loved it. It had a creepy quality and still had that western theme.The action let up for quite awhile, but Valek was definitely cool. And James Woods was definitely entertaining as Jack Crow. I liked this more than Blade, even though Blade had a lot more action. Blade was a quick execution in style, more like a long music video than an actual movie. Vampires is John Carpenter's own interpretation on vampires themselves. It's a movie of self-expression and horror, which is of course, what John knows best. I don't think a large percentage of audiences in the United States gives John Carpenter the respect he deserves. Vampires is his best film in recent time and who better to do a film like this? Steven Spielberg? I think not. Quentin Tarantino? Already did it with From Dusk Till Dawn (And quite well might I add)And as much as I love Escape From LA, John's last film before this in 1996, it was truly at heart a remake of New York, right down to certain characters even. Hence Brain from NY, and Carjack Malone from LA.Final thought, if you have an open mind and an educated background on horror movies, see this film. On my eternal scale from 1-10, I give Vampires a 9. Definitely one of the best of the year.

I thought it totally kicked butt. However, to like the movie as much as my friend and I did, you have to have a proper appreciation of classic B Movies. While Vampires might not be a B Movie in the technical definition of the word, it most definitely has a B Movie feel to it. Let me put it this way If you loved Army of Darkness, you'll likely enjoy Vampires. They're very similar, in fact. The main characters are both loudmouthed macho jerks who spout incredibly cool lines. Just as Ash never needs to reload his shotgun, James Wood's character never needs to reload his crossbow, which in this case is even more laughable, yet wholly irrelevant to enjoying the film. There is a rather unpleasant misogynistic side to the movie, which is my main criticism of the movie. It goes without saying that this is a guy film to be seen with one's male buddies, as opposed to, say, most Mel Gibson action flicks which many women enjoy along with men (Braveheart, Conspiracy Theory). Of course, if the woman in question likes being treated as just one of the guys, and appreciates B Movies like Army of Darkness, by all means, see it. The main selling points of the movie are hardcore action, gratuitous nudity, witty macho dialogue (much better than Schwarzenegger's crapulent tripe, but you should have guessed that by the fact that the movie stars the grizzled James Woods), some decent gore, and a few interesting concepts such as the church's involvement, relics, and the always interesting vampire concept, which always varies from movie to movie. I shall now compare Vampires to Blade and  From Dusk Till Dawn, two other relatively recent modern-era vampire flicks, both of which I enjoyed. Blade and Vampires, while similar in concept, have very different settings. Blade is an urban tale, filled with martial-arts-type fighting, a black main character, realistic gore, and the concept of vampires having an organized underworld society, and it should be noted that the main hero was conceived as a comic book character, and thus killing is treated as a serious business. Vampires is a modern western, with mindless shooting, punching, and general butt-kicking, with gore to a similar degree as Blade, yet far less visual realism (i.e. poor gore effects); the main character is an obnoxious jerk and killing is more amusing and entertaining than meaningful. Blade, I thought, was a cool movie, but I liked Vampires even better as it was a lot funnier and filled with tough-guy, wisecracking, butt-kicking western-style characters. However, I thought both are eclipsed by From Dusk Till Dawn. To start, compare Vampire's hooker party with the now-legendary Titty Twister Club.  From Dusk Till Dawn had much better effects. From Dusk Till Dawn slaughtered its characters slowly, instead of wasting them all at the beginning. Of course, From Dusk Till Dawn had a boring, meandering beginning that attempted to be a plot with quasi-serious character treatments. Considering the real point of that movie was the vampires, they should have made the beginning move a lot faster, since once they get to the Titty Twister Club, most of the beginning becomes completely irrelevant. However, if From Dusk Till Dawn started right at the Titty Twister scene, there would be no question that it was better than Vampires, which concentrates it's action scenes at the beginning and end, and makes you sit through a middle that is full of funny and entertaining lines but little action. Salma Hayek gave a much more masterful performance than any of bthe women in Vampires. Woods was much better than Clooney, but there's no comparing Danny Dullness Baldwin with Quentin Tarantino in terms of sidekicks. The actual depiction of the vampires themselves is similar in character (bloody thirsty monsters, unlike the more refined and intelligent ones in Blade) yet different in style (the Master Vampire of Vampires was a pretty spooky human predator, where as the vampires of FDTDawn were more demonic in appearance). I have no conclusion to give you, except that if you love beat-em-up action films, go see Vampires.

Why anyone would attempt to grade this movie on the same curve as Saving Private Ryan is beyond me.I can't imagine why anybody could like a movie as hokey as Blade better. Blade, with its horribly subpar CGI effects (CGI itself an affront to the horror genre) and ridiculous hero (Blade?  Did his mom really name him that?  No, I guess not...hehehe), pales in comparison to Vampires.And if you spell vampire with a y, well, stick to your Anne Rice novels and Manic Panic, because Vampires isn't your cup of...tea.I can understand fans of the novel having a legitimate beef with the film, but movies based on novels almost always disappoint true fans of the novel.  Hell, I kept waiting for the scene where Melanie shoots the skin-head in Jackie Brown, but that never happened.And for all the whiney, true John Carpenter fans disappointed with Vampires, go see the movie again anyway so that JC can still get a decent budget for his next flick.  I can't believe any JC fan would complain about Vampires after the studio-influenced mess that was Escape from LA.  Did JC have any say in that flick at all?I loved Vampires.  I loved its brutality, its out-and-out misogyny, its action, its disrespect for VampYres, its Western sensibilities, and most importantly, its style and vision.  I don't know why any horror fan wouldn't agree.  With any luck, Vampires will help restore the horror to horror flicks, something that's been slowly whittled away as of late by a host of Scream knock-offs.  The sheer gore, terror, and testosterone of Vampires is a cause for horror fans everywhere to celebrate.

Carpenter At His Best.","Date":"21 February 2013","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":" John Carpenter's Vampires is one of the best Vampire films ever made,a great hybrid of the genres Horror and Western that's filled great direction,an excellent performance from James Woods and great make-up and special effects. This film is a Cult Classic and one of Carpenter's best.Based on John Steakley's novel of the same name,Vampires tells the story of Jack Crow(James Woods)a vampire killer/slayer who leads a group of other vampire killer/slayers who are all good at their jobs. But when a vicious vampire names Valek(Thomas Ian Griffith)kills his whole squad,Jack wants revenge and to kill Valek. Now with the help of his partner Montoya(Daniel Baldwin),Hooker Katrina(Sheryl Lee)and Catholic Priest Father Guiteau(Tim Guinee)Jack must figure out how stop Valek before it's too late.I think that one of the reasons John Carpenter's Vampires is one of the best Vampire films ever made is because of the way John Carpenter approaches the material and the vampires in the film. The vampires in this film aren't surrounded by a Gothic background and the vampires are not romantic,they're ugly,violent vicious creatures who would bite you and kill you in a split second and drain you of your blood. This is the way I love seeing Vampires portrayed on screen as violent killers and not romantics or sentimental like in the Twilight films,but as real vampires. What I also love about the film is the Western style Carpenter injects into the film. Carpenter loves Western films and most of his films are pretty much Westerns in disguise and it's fully evident here. Carpenter takes the influence of great Western directors such as John Ford,Howard Hawks(Carpenter's favorite director),Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah brings it into the Southwest Texas locations in Vampires,using brown dirt and dust and old fashion Western style towns that either have people or the towns in the film are deserted. If you look at Carpenter's other films like Escape From New York,Escape From L.A,Big Trouble In Little China,Assault On Precinct 13,They Live and Ghosts Of Mars all of those films are in the Western style whether it's in the modern world like Big Trouble or They Live or in the future like the Escape films and Ghosts Of Mars the Western influence is still there in the films. Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter antihero and one of the best Vampire killers in film history. Like a lot of Carpenter antihero's Jack Crow is tough,aggressive and very much an individual who can take on anything and anyone and also spits out cynical dialog with a dark sense of Humor and grit. As the film goes on you start to understand why Jack became a Vampire killer and why he has such hatred and disdain for vampires and what they're about and it will bring depth to the character. What also brings depth to the Jack Crow character is his relationships and friendships with his partner Montoya and Father Guteau because with Montoya the relationship while harsh and filled with tough guy dialog seems genuine and real and you feel Jack and Montoya truly care for each other where as Jack Crow's relationship with Father Guteau(or Padre as Jack calls him)takes much longer to develop,but as the film goes on Jack begins to respect Guteau. The violence and gore in the film are well-done and suit the film and matching the overall harshness and grit of the film. The Action scenes in the film are also well-executed and are done in the great Western style that the film has. The blood and gore in the film is amazing and realistic and the blood flow does not stop until the end. If there something in the film that will bother most viewers it's the middle section and ending of the film. I happen to like the middle section despite the lack of Action and gore because the middle gives viewers a chance to know and care about the characters and the plot. The ending is great and memorable because and while some will be angry that there is not a lot of Action,a huge body count or bloodbath,it's a thrilling conclusion to Vampires and is a wonderful Western ending.The cast does a great job in their roles. James Woods gives one of his best performances as Jack Crow,a master Vampire slayer,with Woods bringing toughness,grit,one-liners and depth to the role. Great performance. Daniel Baldwin is wonderful as Montoya,Jack's partner. Baldwin has good scenes and good chemistry with Woods. Sheryl Lee does a great job and is sexy as Katrina,a hooker who was bit by Valek and helps Jack and Montoya. Lee also has good scenes with Baldwin. Thomas Ian Griffith is frightening and menacing as Valek,in my opinion one of the best vampire villains in film history. Maximilian Schell does a good job as Cardinal Alba. Tim Guinee also does a good job as Father Guiteau,the priest who helps Jack and Montoya.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent with Carpenter bringing a great Western atmosphere to the film and also makes the film visually stunning to look at. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter is wonderful and has a great,gritty Western sound to it and matches the mood and tone to the film. Another great Carpenter score.The special effects and make-up by K.N.B is impressive,bloody,gory and very realistic. Another great job from K.N.B.In final word,if you love John Carpernter,James Woods,Horror Films,Westerns and Vampire films,I highly suggest you see John Carpenter's Vampires,one of the best Vampire films ever made and one of Carpenter's best.

He was absolutely amazing in Karate Kid 3, so I needed to find out if he was quality in anything else. Much to my dismay however, he only appears in about 4 or 5 scenes throughout this film, despite being the main bad guy.This film starts off like it might actually be worth watching, if you can look past the fact that the first main action bit is a bit repetitive. James Woods and his band of slayers burst into a house, or nest, of vampires and starting harpooning them, while the ever fatter Daniel Baldiwn flicks the switch on his car to drag the vampires out into the sunlight. They do this for about 5 or 6 vampires. Yes, OK this will kill them, but for an action film to keep doing the same thing over and over again is really boring. it's like just doing the same move over and over again in Street Fighter. yawn. Anyway, after their rampage on the vampire nest, they decide to celebrate with some prostitutes. I should point out that they're meant to be working for the Catholic Church as well! And there's a cop there too, just chatting. eh? Anyway, Terry Silver turns up, probably a bit miffed cos his mates were just killed, and slaughters everyone. Very nice how he slices the bent cop from Batman Begins in half as he opens the door. He kills everyone, except James Woods, of course, and a prostitute that he had bitten, presumably just so he could create the link between him and the pro, so James can use it to his advantage.Also left alive, is Fat Baldwin, who was not present for the slut-fest that was ensuing, presumably he was off eating pies or something. They bring the bird with them and say they'll track down Terry Silver. Much walking around, and driving follows, and some young priest joins them.It turns out Terry Silver is after some old cross that was used 600 years ago when he was first turned into a vampire. Why didn't he just get it at the time? Why wait a couple of hundred years before searching for it? anyway, they follow him for a while thanks to the visions of the pro who is turning into a vampire. Fat Baldwin starts to fall for her, even though she is growing increasingly un-fit.In the end, they kill Terry Silver, and James Woods lets Fat Baldwin go off, despite him being bitten by the pro after she turned into a vampire, thus breaking his own rules of slaying. ah well.All in all, it has some quite amusing bits, and some lines that are really cheesy, but funny. the storyline (what little there is) is very reminiscent of Blade, where Frost is looking to be able to walk during the day. There are about 4 action scenes throughout, and all of them involve killing the vampires with daylight. The vast majority is James Woods either walking, or driving about with fat Baldwin in tow.A really really poor film, where nothing happens at all, the special effects are rubbish, the action is too far apart, and Terry Silver doesn't appear enough in it. I may give this to my brother as an ironic birthday present, cos I don't want it tainting my DVD collection any longer, and I only bought it yesterday!

I found it true to its aim. The story unfolds at a fast pace, the carachterisation is great, believe it or not James Woods makes a convincing action hero, and the story is as original as it's needed. It plays as a western where the Indians would have been substituted by vampires and the cavalry is in the payroll of the catholic church, an institution that is portrayed as withholding terrible secrets and involved in a war with evil that has been going on for centuries and will never finish.

It's not too gory either. Sure KNB do some great make-up effects but it's not like the gore is the only entertainment of the movie. Blade and FDTD relied on the gore to entertain too often. Carpenter has made a Vampire movie that seems more realistic than that.This movie is strangely light-hearted for a vampire/horror flick. Don't get me wrong though, it's best that way.

The music is also light-hearted in a way but can also be spooky at time. Carpenter always comes up with great tunes and his guitar riff and 'Roadhouse Blues' approach to the genre gives a whole new feel. Plus James Woods shines in the way that only he can do.The DVD has a boring commentary (Carpenter has no one to talk to), a trailer and the cover claims it contains a photo gallery also but unless it's an easter egg it ain't there.

Knowing that any Vampire victim has a telepathic link with it's Master Crow decides to use Katrina to get to him, upon further investigation it turns out that the Vampire Master in this case is Jan Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), the very first Vampire ever who is now on a mission to find the Brezier Cross which will let him & his kind walk in sunlight...Directed & scored by John Carpenter this film was apparently originally slated to be directed by Russell Mulcahy & star Dolph Lundgren! Thank God that never came to pass, also just before production began the studio cut the budget by two thirds, so instead of an eighty million dollar flick Carpenter had to rework it for a twenty million dollar budget. Anyway, the script by Don Jakoby was based on the novel 'Vampire$' by John Steakley (I have never read the novel but according to Steakley in interviews the finished film contains much of his books dialogue but none of his books plot) & is an entertaining action horror film that isn't up there with Carpenter's best it's one of his better efforts from more recent years. The character's are a mixed bag, the intense Crow played by the always watchable James Woods is a great character & you end up liking the guy but his second in command Montoya is very unlikable while Katrina the prostitute is given next to no development & it doesn't feel right when the two fall in love at the end, nothing that has happened in the film to that point indicates why the two would fall in love & it just doesn't work. Also the main Vampire villain is given very little to do, apart from two lines of dialogue & lots of dark Gothic posturing he might as well not be there. At over 100 minutes Vampires is quite a long film but it doesn't feel like it, it moves along at a good pace, it can be a bit repetitive at times but it does provide good solid gory horror themed entertainment. The twists are a little easy to predict, there's the clich√©d 'forget what you've seen in the movies' type speech in regards to Vampires (every modern Vampire flick has to have one) & while it's certainly good it's not a film which will linger that long in the memory.Director Carpenter needed a hit after his previous films Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), In the Mouth of Madness (1995), Village of the Damned (1995) & Escape from L.A. (1996) all flopped at the US box office & as such he goes back to basics with Vampires, it has a fairly straight forward story, plenty of action & gore as well as a nice modern clean look about it. There's a fair amount of style here, the opening scene when all the Vampire slayers get ready & strap on all their gear complete with huge weapons & sunglasses is all about cool macho posturing. I wouldn't say it's particularly scary but it does deliver on the gore front, from slashed throats to decapitated heads to burning Vampires to someone being vertically sliced in half & separating down the middle.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Vampires is well made with glossy big budget Hollywood production values, the special effects are all of the real on set rubber & latex variety rather than CGI which is pleasing. Actually filmed in New Mexico. The acting is good & James Woods is just a great actor & is in top form here.Vampires is a good solid big budget Hollywood horror film with plenty of gore, special effects & action. While it's not classic Carpenter since he has made better films it's right up there with his best. Well worth a watch.

Real misogynistic stuff. James Woods' character is a comic book bully who bitch slaps priests and cuts them to make them tell him the truth. He also beats up Sheryl Lee's character at will, and passes her off as just a hooker to anyone who asks, even though he needs her to find the head vampire. Of course the Catholic Church and its Bishops and Priests are all OK with Woods and his tough guy ways. They even paid for Woods and his buddies to party with hookers as a reward for vampire hunting. Pure garbage. Just a real stinker of a film.

It seems the church have known that Vampires exist for hundreds of years and have hunted them with the help of Vampire hunters like Jack Crow. Now something stirs among the Vampires, it seems they anticipate something big to happen.I'm no huge fan of Vampire movies i must say. But i prefer this kind of Vampire-movie to most others. This is more of a straight forward action/horror movie with loads of violence and bad one-liners. The Vampire movies i appreciate the least are ones like Queen of the damned which is basically two hours of moaning and sexual innuendo.James Woods delivers a solid performance as usual, and he really seems to enjoy himself here. Thomas Ian Griffith is suitably lame (complete with fake accent) as the Vampire-lord Valek. And that is what feels liberating with this movie, that everyone seems to know and accept that this is not Oscar-winning material. Rather they have some fun and try to make an entertaining movie.

Die you bloodsucking...Die!But something is missing from this flick. The main action has the slayers attaching a wire to the vampires and then dragging them out into the sun. The vampires then promptly explode. This effect is used about ten times. That sums up the movie. The filmmakers really didn't know what else to do with the vampires except to have them get crispy in the sun. It was also a letdown to be introduced to this super hit squad of slayers and then see them meet their maker within minutes. Of course their slaughter scene was fantastic so I'm not complaining too much. Overall, Vampires was sparse on vampire action variety. There was some plot nonsense about a black cross and a secret ceremony but it was all just an excuse to watch more combustible vampires.Basically there are two scenes of vampire killing. One is at the beginning and the other is at the end. There are some slaughter scenes in the middle to keep you interested.

Even the best directors have bad days, and Carpenter is no exception.Everything in this film offended me in some manner. The women in the film might as well have swastikas tattooed over their faces, and the men in this film are truly beneath what I would call a man (whatever that might mean). James Woods is a fine actor, but his character made me constantly root for the bad guys, er girls...I actually like a bit of blood and gore in my horror films, and this nonsensical attitude of less is more than seems to be prevalent among American audiences today has got to stop. Compare the R-rated (in Australia that is, the R-rating in Australia actually means something) Nightmare On Elm Street episodes with their M-rated counterparts. Is less more? Not in a horror film. More blood is needed. The problem is, more of a story is needed for balance, and Vampires fails to deliver on that score. As a matter of fact, Vampires does a lot to undo my theory about what sort of content makes a horror film memorable, primarily because the ensuing gore is a cover-up for a weak story. The story is so memorable that I can hardly remember it after all this time. I hardly remembered it five minutes after the film was over, in fact. Hardly a result consistent with the directorial skills John Carpenter normally brings to bear.I've been waiting a while for John Carpenter to make another film that compares with The Thing.

This is an amazingly bad film! For some foolish reason, I watched this expecting a horror movie, but beyond the fact that it has some vampires and a light smattering of gore John Carpenter's Vampires isn't a horror movie by a long chalk.There's no tension, no buildup, no mystery, no disturbing death, no atmosphere, no uncertainty or sense of foreboding.In spite of which, I liked it. It was reasonably fast-paced, with an entertaining premise, a bunch of (amazingly bad!) action scenes, an amusing cast and script notable for its consistent unintentional humour... all served with extra cheese.At least, I think the humour is unintentional, but every time something mildly dramatic or exciting happens James Woods delivers a devastatingly funny line (like when he says to the gay supergoth vampire bloke So tell me, does your dick still work after 600 years?)...All the dialogue is like that - super-macho, utterly unconvincing and full of oddly unnecessary expletives. Personally, I swear a lot, possibly more than these guys, but the script is so awkward it sometimes sounds like they're cussing to hit quotas one penis reference, two f-words and an overwritten sexual insult per scene! The rock score (composed, of course, by Carpenter himself) is a major cheese-enhancing factor. Electric guitar solos meander almost non-stop throughout the film's hundred-plus minutes (of the type often referred to as bluesy by those who don't know better), fitting perfectly with the biker-bar look of many of the characters and the dusty desert setting, but... well, not in a good way.The lead performances were all brilliantly funny without being in the least bit good. James Woods proves once again that he has charisma even when he's asleep. Daniel Baldwin (who, not being a big fan of American movies, I've not really seen before) seemed like he was distractedly thinking about his mortgage payments. Sheryl Lee provided the least laughs at first, playing her badly-written hooker character with an almost professional attention to clich√©, but in the end she got to yodel and chew scenery What else needs a mention? Well, there's a romantic subplot (by the numbers, skipping several numbers along the way), the sound fx (I love the way the vampires make a mad array of badly-dubbed animal noises every time their mouth move, as if they're carrying speakers in their pockets!), and the excuse for a plot (I will avoid the novel like the plague, but in my kindness I assume Carpenter skipped the chapters that made us give a damn)... but no, I won't go on.Because, for all the dissing (and the fact I rated it 4/10), this is a fun movie.Like Plan 9 from Outer Space with cool colour cinematography.The look of the film is the only thing that's unabashedly, no-excuses-needed good about it... but then, it's hard to make a desert look less than beautiful.My advice is to definitely watch this, but first stock up on some quality skunk... and rent, don't buy!

I don't like Woods much anyway, but there was hardly a worse choice to play the main character in this travesty. I can forgive a weak story, but there is no excuse for bad acting imo. The rest of the actors actually do a much better job than Woods, which is good considering just how bad he really is in this. The only bright spot acting-wise is from Sheryl Lee (Katrina) and Mark Boone, for all of the 5min he is in the movie (as Cat).If you really really love cheesy bad b-movies, then you may find some enjoyment in this. If you have read the book and want to watch the movie, be warned. None of your favorite characters are portrayed here. Only their names are used, the characters themselves are not the same (watch it and you will understand). Though one of the scenes (the motel) is here, the rest of the movie is a completely different story from the book.I wrote this review to be helpful mainly to those who are wondering how it compares to the book, and to warn off anyone who believes any of the good reviews this movie has.

And it's not pretty","Date":"7 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","Review":" John Carpenter's Vampires is the latest movie I watched as part of my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows this October. It's also the worst so far. This movie, which is about a vampire slayer named Crow (James Woods), came out in 1998- right about when a TV show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer was on the air. Skimming through some of the comments, I haven't seen anyone else talking about this, but to me the differences are obvious. Although both are about vampire slaying, this movie is the anti-Buffy in numerous ways. And it makes the movie look fairly ugly.If you think the vampires in Buffy are too tame, and that the amount of violence that can be put on TV is too light, then you'll probably love this movie and hate Buffy. That's fine for you. Personally, though, I happen to believe in what I was taught in twelfth grade English, that less is more. Besides, I've never heard of vampires who fight like this- tearing apart and decapitating people with a single swipe of their claws. True, the vampire who does this, Valek, is supposed to be the ultimate super-strong vampire. It's just too bad they couldn't decide on how strong he is- when he's killing Crow's team he's pumped full of bullets and isn't moved by them; but when he chases after the truck a gunshot knocks him off.But the big way in which this movie is the anti-Buffy is in its view of women. I'm male but a liberal, and I liked how Buffy empowered women, made them the heroes for once, and gave them independence, smarts and strength. In contrast, in this movie the main female character is a prostitute called Katrina. She's bitten by Valek early on, almost sounding like she was having an orgasm while he fed off her. She gradually turns into a vampire, but Crow and his sidekick Montoya keep her alive in hope that she can be used to find Valek. The way she's treated by the men is not respectful. She's tied to the bed naked, for one thing. Now, as is evident from reading my other reviews, I love female nudity in movies. But here even I was wondering why she was naked. Montoya hits her, which may be forgivable in the heat of the moment, but he doesn't regret it Who cares? he asks. Later Crow also turns rough with her (and it's Montoya who ironically objects). I'll grant you, Crow's rough with everyone- too rough to be likable- but even elementary school bullies know you're not supposed to hit a girl. At any rate, Katrina is a powerless pawn, a worthless hooker, there are no heroines, and James Woods is who we're supposed to be rooting for.What's good about this? Again, it'll appeal to people who love gore, its vampires aren't fooling around. It may provide a scare (although a better movie can scare you with less graphic violence) and sometimes its presentation of vampires is valid. Vampires, Crow tells us, are not romantic. That's true to the original legend. I just wish I could have seen this less romantic version of vampires in the original Nosferatu. 4.5/10 Happy Halloween.

A really bad movie that doesn't take anything seriously and it's not worth to be watched not even by real horror fans. Why? Because it's not horror! It's like 90 mins of rockmusic, angry looking vampires and lots of blood. And nothing more.I read some other user comments before and many of them say that a good director like John Carpenter totally disappointed with this film. What?? John Carpenter, a good director?? Name one good movie! Except for Halloween, an acceptable film, all the rest suck. Is that a good director? I don't think so. Halloween is probably the only Carpenter movie that's nice to watch. John, although he has the urge of putting his name in all his film's titles, as if he's some kind of God of horror movies, never impressed me and probably never will. And he'll never do better movies than Wes Craven, the guy I consider the master of horror.Let's get back to Vampires. It's like another user said, just like a music video. Carpenter, in stead of creating a good tensed scary vampire movie, concentrates only on special effects and gore. Blood, blood and only blood.So the plot is very week and predictable and you NEVER get not the smallest feeling of scare in you. Not even once.  Well i couldn't give this movie more than 3 out of 10.

Daniel Baldwin is nobody and Maximillian Schell (playing a cardinal) was only known for The Black Hole.I was annoyed by the big goof that the vampire entered their hotel suite without being invited (twice, when he bit the hooker and when he came in the front door). This is a really well known rule (that a vampire can NOT enter an abode without being invited) and that annoyed me.I also realized I'd seen this as soon as I saw the priest.I caught the original version of The Fog the previous day on TV, that had worn well with age. This film despite being newer had not worn well.From reading some of the forum postings this is based on a book? Who by? Obviously the vampire hunters have a set of rules as they are both constantly quoting them at each other.Woods cuts the heads off all his dead friends (and the hookers and sheriff) and stakes them all to ensure they stay dead and don't become vampires.I assume this is to make us feel sorry for him in some way? Well it totally didn't work here then.And am I the only one whose going to point out the goof where Wood's tosses the lighter. It'd go out before it ever hit any of the gasoline.Why Montoya undresses the stripper in the hotel room (It'd look suspect as hell if room service came in there), I assume it's to stop her escaping (A vampire isn't going to have nudity issues, are they?).Woods does debunk some of the Hollywood vampire mythology but he doesn't debunk the entering a room myth. The master vampire also enters a church (so the not allowed on hallowed ground myth is rubbish as well?) Montoya is infected when the girl tries to escape (because he was an idiot and trusted her) but tried to cauterize his wound to stop himself being infected. He also lies to Woods about what happened in the room.They manage to find out where the master is by the hookers link to him (in San Miguel) and Montoya lies to Woods again about being tired (when he's turning into a vampire).We then find out why Woods has been teamed with a priest who was previously a scholar, he tells him about the sign for the sun. The Master then descends on a monastery with a group of 7 master vampires (one of whom looked very much like Charlie Sheen).Woods tells us it took 5 days for his father to become a Vampire (but the hooker and Montoya seemed to turn much quicker than that). The Vampire group kills all the monks and find the cross that they have been looking for that will allow them to walk in the day.(also debunking the crosses kill vampires myth).The hooker leads the vampire hunters to the monastery full of dead monks. She then guides them to the abandoned town where the masters nest is.The Priest kills his 1st vampire (and goes a bit mental). The priest is sent (unarmed?) to lure the vampires into the elevator to try and kill the 7 minor master vampires that the main master has brought with him.The hooker starts to remind me more of a Pfeiffer sister as she turns into a vampire. They kill 2 minor masters (a Man and a woman who breaks the jeep winch) before nightfall. As night comes it appears they have infected the whole town and the hooker has turned in Montoya's jeep as she attacks him. (It took her 2 days to turn, by the way).Woods discovers the cardinal (Schell) had betrayed his group in the town. Montoya saves Woods from being burnt at the cross as the villagers/vampires are forced to retreat back into the prison at the rising of the sun. (Oh and he manages to walk past lots of bits of daylight without catching fire, BIG GOOF!) Woods kills the main master Vampire far too easily by exposing him to sunlight, and has a weak emotional scene with Montoya allowing him to have a 2 day head start to flee with the vampire hooker (Vaya Con Dios means Go with God, by the way).Weak ending with the priest becoming a swearer like Woods (and Montoya was played by Daniel Baldwin? NO WAY! He's the spitting image of Anthony La Paglia hence me thinking it was him for the whole review, I actually had to edit the entire review for each time I'd written his name because of that!).

After one successful day's killing the group is celebrating at a motel when they are attacked by a master - Valek. Only Jack and his friend Montoya survive alone with a hooker who has been bitten by Valek. Using her physic link with Valek, Jack tries to track him down before he can uncover a relic that will allow him to walk by day and night.John Carpenter's best days seem to be long gone by recent (well - many years actually) form. Vampires is widely seen as nothing more than another slip on the downward spiral of his films. The plot is best ignored - the bones are all you need to know and it's safe to ignore all the stuff about the Catholic church creating vampires and the relic etc and enjoy the main action.However I found it all to be a bit silly and the main focus was on the gory effects which never seemed real or scary - just tacky like a straight to video slasher. Bodies splitting, bodies burning, gore, gore and more gore. In moderation gore can be scary but here it is the only thing going on and it all gets a bit tiresome. Of course it does depend what mood you're in - I did enjoy it a bit because it was a Saturday night and I was looking for a bit of undemanding nonsense to not trouble by brain.....however any other time and I would have been let down seriously and given up.Woods is always worth watching and gives a strong performance here, even if he hams it up at times. For most of the time though he gives a good tough guy role. Baldwin is OK (he is my favourite brother since Homicide) but has no good lines and is lumbered with the dumb task of convincing us he loves a vampire. The climax's potentially emotional scene between the two men didn't convince me at all. Lee is totally wasted and has almost nothing to do apart from shake and stare.Carpenter himself shows none of the subtlety or talent that he once had. The effects scream out in all their gaudiness and the action is signposted and clearly aimed at teenage boys who like to see stuff explode. Only in the odd scene does he show that he can still frame a shot or direct a good scene - the majority smacks of a hack job.Overall this is just about passable if you're in the mood for a bit of undemanding twaddle. However if you're looking for anything else then you'll be seriously letdown. At best I found this to be just passable and instantly forgettable.

The filmmakers fail to build up momentum, suspense, terror, and actually, significance of the fact that the characters are hunting down bloodthirsty vampires. They never seem to be afraid of the monsters, thus we don't share feelings of sheer terror; the characters act as if haunting down these menaces is part of their daily life--and it is. John Carpenter, the so-called master of horror, has constructed a thriller in which the tensions are low, gore is high, and there is just enough story to fall in between to give the characters something to discuss between the many scenes of gruesome vampire attacks.The film opens with a pack of vampire hunters, including the leader, Jack Crow (James Woods), and his best pal, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), preparing themselves in mid daylight for busting into a small country cabin that is supposedly a nest of vampire goons. They expect to undercover a master, who is the most powerful of all vampires. The men sneak into the house, carry out the day's business, and head to a hotel where they have several prostitutes and alcoholic beverages waiting for their arrival. Right in the middle of their fun and games, however, a master vampire, named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), crashes the party, killing nearly everyone present--in various ways tearing off their heads, ripping open their bodies, breaking people's necks, shooting them with shotguns, and of course, sucking out their blood. The only characters alive by the end of the first twenty minutes are Jack, Montoya, and a hooker named Katrina (Sheryl Lee),This beginning sequence has no purpose, no meaning, no impact other than to develop a macho style of vampire killers whom themselves are overtaken moments later. While the writers may have developed a firm appearance of style, the characters are left a mystery. Whom were those people mutilated at the victory celebration in the hotel room? They appear on screen, and then are killed so quickly, we couldn't learn their names if we really tried to. The scene afterwards doesn't payoff either, where Jack must go to the hotel and make sure everyone is dead, so they don't turn into vampires later on, and then bury them in the ground nearby. There isn't a whole lot of explanation there either. Its only purpose is to exploit copious amounts of gore to the audience.Jack, Montoya, and Katrina end up teaming up to rid the world of Valek, who is indulged in a plot about an ancient holy cross that will allow vampires to be able to be active in sunlight (which normally kills them). They don't even have the chance to rebuild their team, and this is one powerful monster they are up against.John Carpenter's Vampires is never a convincing movie, more like an over formative video game with no rules, guidelines or boundaries. Although the story does get somewhat interesting in the second act, and interest permits, the first hour of the movie has little to no momentum build up and thus lacks any kind of fright. As the film progresses, it follows a particularly predictable increase of dramatic tension, which is perfectly natural for such an underdeveloped underdog action picture. The country/western setting the filmmakers try to place upon us is more painful than scary, and even the scenes of such gore don't look any more real than the bug attacks from Starship Troopers.I did like some of the performances, however. James Woods is enjoyable to watch in his aggressive character; he is simply perfect to present the over-esteemed Crow. Daniel Baldwin also puts in his fair share of hard work here, as Crow's sidekick. He, like Woods, brings a certain emotional, although muscular, style to his performance. Thomas Ian Griffith is devilish and bold as the main master vampire. Sheryl Lee does not get much to do here, except to drift around where to flow takes her like a dazed bimbo, and discuss various matters the script calls for.John Carpenter has directed many scarier flicks than Vampires, and I must say that I am a little disappointed in him here. He goes for all out gore instead of suspense, irony, and skill. The few scenes that do generate some shock have already been milked by TV ads and theater previews. I don't know about you, but after seeing some of Carpenter's past work, I have a much higher standard for this director. Too bad. Just when you think someone will go for the heart, he goes for the jugular.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.

Relying on fancy cinematography, a wild musical composition made by Carpenter himself, and an appropriate New Mexico location, VAMPIRES is one enjoyable ride.James Woods' mordant performance is right on the money as Jack Crow, the leader of the vampire extermination squad. Woods' disdainfully sardonic sense of humor adds flavor to a solid vampire flick. Daniel Baldwin is Crow's trusty assistant who helps thin out the numbers of the vampire race. Thomas Ian Griffith  is also great as the Master Vampire, Valek, whose only intent is to gain the ability to live and walk during daylight... Oh yes, and how can we forget the beautiful Sheryl Lee, who is puissant as the tough prostitute who gets bitten by Griffith. The soon-to-be vampire also has a psychic implication with Valec and she can admonish his every move.The fight between mankind versus the vampire species is ignited.Casualties from both sides are predictably ensued, and the origins of Valek's vampirism have been traced to the rituals involving Roman Catholicism of the late 14th century...  As Crow and Valek fight man to vampire only one survivor can be left standing. Who will it be?VAMPIRES is a fine horror show. The special effects are again top-notch for a horror flick.  VAMPIRES is better than average for it offers a very detailed storyline into the creation of the vampires as well as their primary goals. This film is of course, surreal, with its nifty, swirling photography, and a vigourous musical score composed which insinuates when the next action sequence will take place. The humor in VAMPIRES remains righteously edgy as well.VAMPIRES is a prepossessing film which manages to steadily keep its tongue implanted in-cheek throughout the whole movie with solidity. James Woods and Daniel Baldwin add depth in their personalities as wisecracking vampire hunters who care only about their jobs and they don't give a hoot about anything else. The negative portrayal of the Roman Catholic Church as a travesty is also sinfully satirical and  may  be occassional offensive.VAMPIRES is a satisfying film where vampires feed humans as a culinary delight. The effects are decent, and the plot plus character analysis tries its best to be ingenious. Black humor always consistently remains iniquitous as the humans yell disparagements to the vampires before finishing their jobs with a nasty stake in the heart!  All of the trademarks of a John Carpenter film are comprised in this new installment.  VAMPIRES is a more conventional horror film with frights and scares eliciting.VAMPIRES certainly lacks the cohesiveness and substantiation that make several genre legends, legends, but this films is definitely worth a look for horror fans everywhere.  A feast for aficionados of slick scary movies. Not for the squeamish.RATING **1/2 out of ****.

Vampires looks like a giant tribute to Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (even the illustration on the DVD-cover is taken from it) and handles about a 600-year-old super vampire that operates from the New Mexican desert. Because you see, vampires don't sleep in coffins or live in old castles; they dig holes in the sand and emerge from them at the break of dawn. James Woods plays Buffy the Vampire Slayer, working for the Vatican and assisted by Daniel Baldwin and a naive young priest as they're trying to prevent bloodsucker Valdek from finding the Cross of Berziers; a religious relic that gives vampires the power endure daylight. The set pieces are quite impressive and the screenplay definitely contains exciting sequences (like the multiple spontaneous combustions!), but Carpenter completely ignores building up tension and opts for brainless macho action. Maybe this was meant to be a tribute to Peckinpah as well but Vampires is truly women unfriendly and barbaric. Female star Sheryl Lee, who stars as a prostitute slowly turning into a vampire after being bitten, gets slapped, abused and yelled at repellently while the only other female cast members are some hookers that're used as bullet shields for the men! The aforementioned sequences in which the vampires crawl out of their sand beds are the only real atmospheric moments in an overall disappointing and forgettable horror flick. "}]
