There's no two ways about it. They could have gotten two six years olds to draw the cels, a troop of monkeys to write the dialogue and then printed the film upside down and full of static and I'd still have loved it (if anybody out there says 'Didn't they do that anyway?', I'll thump them.) I am one of a dying but suprisingly populous breed the Tranformers fan, and to me this film is like the Holy grail.If you think I'm going to get all gooey and teary-eyed then go into nostalgia overload then forget it because I'm not. I say this with a straight face and a critic's eyes this is a good film. It may be a two hour toy commercial. It may have made zip at the box offce. It may get bad press from idiotic fossils that just aren't prepared to make the effort to tap into the universe the film is set in. But the fact remains that to anybody that's grown up with Transformers, this film is marvelous. Why? Because it does it right! The characters act right. The style is right. It's all done so perfectly that no right minded Transfan could possibly complain. How many Batman fans (and I mean real Batman fans) can honestly say the same thing about their film franchise.It's easy to get preachy about the violence in a film aimed at kids. It gives the moral majority something to do other than examine each Disney film for subliminal messages. I found it refreshing to actually see this kind of film refuse to pull its punches. It's an action film without tapping into the over-sentimental gushy stuff that usually turns kids off anyway. This is a war. Death and violence are part of it. Will it effect the children that watch it. Maybe, but I don't know which way. I saw first saw the film when I was 7. I saw all of my favourites get blown apart. I saw my absolute, total, complete and utter hero, the person that personified all that was good and noble to me (you know who I mean) get killed saving his friends in an ultimate display of bravery and courage. I cried. My mum cried. I still do. I think that one moment made me more afraid and ashamed of death and destruction than a dozen Private Ryans.The animation is top notch, there's an amazing soundtrack and the voice talent is good too. Not perfect, but Nimoy's portrayal of Galvatron is incredible. Espicially when you consider that it was probably done as a 'For the money not the art' job. The script isn't bad either. It has a host of sharp, quotable one-liners that would put Bruce Willis to shame (I've got better things to do tonight than die.) The story is a rip off of Star Wars but what isn't and who cares? It's cool. The animation is superb. I said that earlier but I really do believe that it's better than Disney at some points. Certainly better than the average output at the time. It doesn't compare with today's graphics but it hasn't aged badly at all. The sountrack can sound a little too cheesy at times but the energy and verve of the film is there and it backs up the visuals with ease.In the end it won't matter. This film won't mean a thing to anybody that doesn't know who Jazz, Bumblebee and Soundwave were to begin with. They won't watch it. They won't like it. And you know what? We don't care. Those of us that can name all five mebers of the Stunticons know better. They gave us what we wanted. And we remain eternally grateful.

All the fan favorites are here with new ones to be cherishing, and the soundtrack to this movie is probably one of the best sounding albums to come out of the 80's.

It's definitely not mainstream, but for anyone who can appreciate robots voiced by some big names (even Orson Welles!) thrashing each other with a very cool, hugely 80s soundtrack, this is where it's at. The main plot, although not exactly inspired, is at least compelling. Any of the scenes with Unicron (Welles) or Galvatron (Leonard Nimoy) easily make the movie worth watching, and there are a few scenes that actually have heart.

But when Transformers The Movie was released in 1986, when I was 11, the movie scared the hell out of me. But so did Superman and Star Wars, which was exactly its intention.As when Batman came to the big screen in 1989, the filmmakers took something old and made it new again.  In the case of the Transformers, the movie was dark, loud, and very adult considering the fact that it springs from what was another silly fad the children of the 80's latched onto.I don't know how people older and younger than I will perceive it, but the film is Shakespearean in its beauty. The 1980's soundtrack works surprisingly well, even now, unlike other 80's attempts, like, say Heavy Metal.The movie picks up in 2005, or about 20 years after the cartoon supposedly took place. Young Spike is now older and has a child of his own, and all the Autobots and Decepticons are back, with some new faces. In the opening moments, Unicron (Orson Welles), destroyer of worlds, eats a planet of peace-loving people (supposdely robots, but still eerily reminiscent of our Earth populi), killing millions. Decepticons don't just plot against the Autobots-- they murder them in cold blood (er, oil?)This is the equivalent of the X-Files movie getting made, and Cigarette Smoking Man getting to use dirty words. It is a true expansion to the big screen, an intelligent version of the TV show, made not to pander to their audience, but to elevate it.This movie is impossible to find in the States, but if you ever watched the TV show, it will bring you to a new level. If you've never heard of the TV show... it's still a great Anime-yarn, and a helluva lot better than that X-Files flick.

The movie just follows these robots along as they spend most of the 84-minutes fighting. All the new characters are introduced by having an established character say to the new character Hey! (new guy) Blow up that thing! or, Hey! (new guy), attack those bad guys!. Awesome. I love movies where fights aren't disrupted by petty things such as plot details or character introductions, it makes things much more fun.The animation is generally better than it was in the TV series. Add to that an 80s soundtrack, consisting of only 80s pop and hair-metal. Awesome. Of course, not everyone is going to like the soundtrack. In fact, I'm willing the bet that a majority of people would loathe the soundtrack, but that is not important, because the soundtrack is awesome. Plus there are some really cool quotes.

Transformers was my favorite cartoon, right after Voltron (the lion one). I liked the new characters, it didn't matter. It was a perfect 80's over sentimental, over rock tracked, bravado of a male ego movie aimed at little boys, even down to the vehicles, Semis, race cars, dump trucks, construction vehicles. Nowadays it wouldn't wash, with the violence and destruction (Unicron) but those were the 80's.

If you are a fan of the character-construction of Superheroes (Marvel-Dc) you need to see Transformers. The mix of American storytellers and Japanese animators in the original 80's Transformers series turned out to be one of the most successful and remembered cartoons of that era. And the colossal movie that worked as introduction to a whole new cast of characters is a magic piece of cinema. Many will ask if these words are true, after all we are talking about a piece of animation. Yes, this is a cartoon conceived for kids, but it has all the drama and solid storytelling that is vital to all good movies.The movie starts with a roll-down resume of the entire story (a la Star Wars) and seconds later, the well-known tunes the title song of this robots pounds the air. But this time is different, this is a heavy-metal version that song. It is not only fitting the mix of Heavy Metal and Transformers, these songs are used adequately as a composer uses his variations to call the attentions on certain moments. The unfairly forgotten composer is the responsible for the rest of the soundtrack he used all kind of synthesizers to create a futuristic and emotional score.Every sequence is a masterpiece by itself. There are no weak points, even comic relief moments like the introduction of the junk-ions is something big and great. If there were not enough reasons to give T The Movie a chance, think about the famous actors that are part of this mega-event using their voices to give life to some of the new robots (besides the cast of voices of the original series).

Fans of the cartoon will be sad to learn that Optimus Prime and Megatron both 'die'. But both won't stay down for long, as there are two sequels, in one of which Optimus Prime returns. Megatron is also rebuilt as Galvatron by the new villain, Unicron, a gigantic planet-sized Transformer.There are several new things we meet. The Decepticons have taken over Cybertron, but the Autobots plot from Autobot City on Earth, and two secret moon bases, to retake the planet. An early attack on Autobot City leads to the final battle in which Prime fights past the bulk of the Decepticons to Megatron. Megatron 'wins', but Prime gets in his hits and leave Megatron barely alive. The Decepticons retreat, and Prime is taken for care.Prime then tells of the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, a new item most fans have probably never heard of. With his last breaths, he passes the Matrix to the new leader, Ultra Magnus, and tells him the the Matrix shall one day light the Autobot's darkest hour.Meanwhile on a shuttle back to Cybertron, the shuttle Astrotrain is too weak to complete the trip. Cargo is jettisoned, and the Decepticons loyal to Megatron are thrown into space, along with Megatron himself who still clings to life.They are found by Unicron, the main villain. Unicron offers Megatron a new life in exchange for loyalty and the destruction of the Matrix of Leadership, the only thing Unicron fears. Megatron, faced with death as the alternative, bitterly accepts. Unicron then turns him into Galvatron, and his other minions into Galvatron's warriors. Blessed with a new body, name, and ship, Galvatron heads for Cybertron. Interrupting the coronation of Starscream as the new leader, Galvatron kills him with one shot. The Decepticons swear loyalty.Unicron devours (yes, he EATS) the two Autobot moon bases. An outraged Galvatron whines that Cybertron and its moons belong to him. But then Galvatron gets the bad end of Unicron's deal should Galvatron disobey him, Unicron can cause him pain. Unable to rebel, Galvatron leads the Decepticons to Earth to complete his mission.The Autobots are rebuilding their city when Galvatron attacks. They flee to the shuttles. One shuttle with Hot Rod, Kup and the Dinobots crashes on the planet of the Quintessons. The other crashes on the planet Junk. Galvatron follows and confronts Ultra Magnus. Killing him, Galvatron claim the Matrix, claiming that with it, he can command Unicron instead of the other way around. Unicron is naturally livid, roaring out into the depths of space.On the Quintessons' planet, Hot Rod and Kup are captured by the Quintessons, who play a bigger role in the grand scheme of things then this movie shows (we later find out they created all Transformers, and are the vanguards of Unicron). The Dinobots break in and rescue them. With a new mini-Transformer named Wheelie on their side, they escape.The Autobots mourn for Ultra Magnus when a whole bunch of Junk Transformers rise from the rubble (as it's name should imply, the Junk planet is a giant trash yard of scrap metal). After a chase, the shuttle with Hot Rob and the others land. Peace is negotiated (along with some freaky dancing), and the Junkions rebuild Ultra Magnus- complete with 90 day warranty! (all Junkions quote television.) Also unearthing their own shuttle, the Junkions and the Autobots blast off for Cybertron.Galvatron confronts Unicron, and yells that Unicron will obey him or die. But upon attempting to use the Matrix, Galvatron cannot. Even more angry, Unicron transforms to a winged human-like robot with fists the size of moons. He then decides his choice to spare Cybertron was incorrect, and attacks the planet. The Decepticons fight back. Galvatron tries to rebel again, but Unicron promptly eats him.The Autobots crash into Unicron's eyes and try to destroy him. While they fight off his inner defenses, Hot Rod falls into a pit. He finds Galvatron, who appears passive. But with an order and another jolt of pain from Unicron, he attacks Hot Rod. Overpowering him and almost killing him, Galvatron gloats about how easy it is to kill Autobots. Hot Rod grab the Matrix around Galvatron's neck, and transforms to Rodimus Prime. He throws Galvatron into space and uses the Matrix to destroy Unicron. As the Autobots escape, Unicron explodes, his head flying away from the debris. With the Decepticons weakened, the Autobots easily retake Cybertron.However, there are, as mentioned, sequels. Galvatron lives, and orbiting Cybertron is the disembodied head of Unicron. Also, it appears Starscream has a ghost, and Optimus Prime may live again. 'The Return of Optimus Prime' and 'Fives Faces of Darkness' round out an excellent trilogy. But even on its own, this movie is excellent.

They were shocked just as many of us were when Prowl was shot down. Transformers the movie is a movie of the ages. It shouldn't get an Oscar. An Oscar is not worthy to be placed with such greatness. Long before Julia Roberts was famous, and long after she leaves fame, Transformers will have ALWAYS be loved and cherished by it's millions of fans around the world. Can a movie like Erin Brockovich do that? NO.Another foolish complaint, in my opinion, is the hard rock soundtrack. This is the GREATEST soundtrack of ALL TIME! Every single song on the disc is a masterpiece that brings tears to one's eye due to it's greatness. Outdated? What do you want, the music from the cartoon series? That's even more outdated!

They would then reply that it's a classic and perhaps name all the awards it has won. Did that increase your enjoyment of the grainy oldness? No. Transformers the movie came out in 1985/1986. Years from now people, especially younger people, won't give a darn about most of those old, out-of-date movies that won awards in 1985/1986. They might as well be Teen Wolf.

Spock from Star Trek as Galvatron and the late great Orson Wells as Unicron the planet eating robot.

The Transfomers were a line-up of Japanese toys that were marketed to the young consumers through an animation series. In the United States, the show was re-dubbed and edited in English. Even Marvel Comics launched a comic book series that went beyond the storyline that was featured in the t.v. show. Enough of the background story, let's get to the movie.Several years into the future, near the turn-of-the-century the Autobots and the Decepticons finally had enough of each other and wage a giant battle against one another. Optimus Primes gets his boys ready to clash with the evil Megatron and his crew. When the dust settles, there are heavy casualties on both sides. Quite a few are fatal. But that's only the start of it. Unknown to both sides, a dark and evil entity is coming near the Transfomers home planet. It's negative energy can destroy everything in the solar system. Who'll stand up to this threat? Will Optimus Prime and Megatron finally get the hate out of their systems?

Now, like I said in my review for the TV series, I got into the original robots in the early 90's after seeing some commercials for the Generation 2, stuff and getting intrigued.  Some time later at a locale video store, I happened to find some old G1 videos, and easily fell in love with this series, with its excellent tale of good vs. evil, with robots!  After seeing, I don't know, about 20 or so episodes of the series, I was hooked, and later, at the same video rental store, my mom found something that easily excited me  Transformers the Movie.  An actual movie of the robots!  It was too good to be true!  I did wonder why I didn't recognize any of the robots shown on the cover.  Sadly, I would soon find out.When I first watched it, I thought it would be an all-new movie-length plot in which the Optimus Prime and the Autobots would once again battle the Decepticons in another riveting adventure.  My hopes widened during the opening scene, with an excellent rendition of the theme song by the band, LION, following with a nice scene with Optimus Prime and Ironhide discussing the Decepticon situation, along with Ironhide's orders to take a small Autobot group to Earth to get enough energon to prepare for an assault on Megatron's forces.  Also nice were the appearances by Jazz, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and a now-adult Spike Witwicky, who now has a son(BTW, I never saw Carly until after viewing this, so I didn't now she was the mom)!  The film got even better, as we see that Megatron and his usual group of Decepticons, including the always-traitorous Starscream, overly loyal Soundwave, and the emotionless Shockwave, learning of Prime's plan, plot to once again attack the Autobots.  This well-scripted scene made me wondering what would happen next.Too bad what did happen next scarred me for life.In less than a minute, to the tune of NRG's Instruments of Destruction(which fit the scene, I might add), Megatron and the Decepticons easily KILL Ironhide and the other Autobots in only a few shots.  Yes, not injure.  Not capture.  They killed them.  Unlike in the TV series, where characters took some powerful hits head on, the shots fired here are 100% fatal.  What really scars the mind is when Prowl, fatally hit from a well-placed shot from Scavenger, falls to the ground, as his optics lose all their color and smoke starts emitting from his mouth.  I was shocked at the time of this scene, and I couldn't believe what had happened.  I actually rewound the video at least once just to make sure I had not imagined the scene before me.Things did not get better.  Many of the original Autobots and Decepticons were killed in the film, and I must admit I was tramuatized when Optimus Prime died, the flicker in his eyes going out, and his color fading away from red and blue to a deep black and gray.  It is easy to realize that even though the characters are the same, the film is very different from the television series.  It is much darker, and does not have as much of a clear view of victory as the TV series did.  On the TV show, you always knew that the Autobots would pull through.  In this, however, you begin to wonder if the Autobots will ever get out of their current predicament.  In fact, the deaths of the Autobots in this movie also affected the G.I.Joe film. Originally, Duke was supposed to be killed by Serpentor, but due to the upset children over seeing the deaths of their favorite Transformers, it was changed for him to be wounded and fall into a coma instead.The movie definitely exceeds the series in many points.  The voice-acting is topnotch.  The animation was ahead of its time, and it really helps when you see how well the deaths of your favorite characters were animated.  The music is another plus, as the techno soundtrack raves in the background, creating an absolutely haunting atmosphere.My only problem, of course, is that the originals don't get much screen time, except for the Dinobots and Perceptor.  Most of the Autobots only appear in small cameos, and quite a few of them die, but the only ones besides Prime to really have any roles are Jazz, Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Blaster, and the late Ironhide.  Ironically, although Micheal Bell had lines in the film, he did not have any as Prowl.  Also, the late Don Messick, though listed in the credits as doing the voice of Gears(who briefly appears in the movie--- you REALLY have to look hard to spot him!), does not speak as either him or the equally late Ratchet, who also gets killed in this. Meanwhile, most of the newbies get most/all of the screentime, and although a few characters like Kup can be somewhat interesting, characters like Blurr and Wheelie make you wonder, Why WEREN'T these guys killed too?But still, despite its flaws, Transformers the Movie is an excellent animated feature.  It is still worth viewing, especially for hardcore fans of those robots in disguise.BOTTOM LINE  I for one am waiting for the Transformers Live Action movie recently announced.  Hopefully it will be as entertaining as this one, but not as depressing.

The transformers are divided into two groups, the power hungry decepticons, and the goodwilling autobots. They are both faced with the same problem, a planet sized robot, unicron, appears and threatens their homeworld just as the autobot's leader, Optimus Prime, Is shot to death by the decepticons' leader, megatron. Then, as all hope is lost, the autobot's matrix of leadership surfaces, and is in the control of the famed Ultra Magnus, who is promptly killed. The matrix is passed onto Hot Rod, who is unwilling to use it, even if it means that Cybertron will be destroyed.

Fans of similar types of animated TV shows and movies should enjoy this movie also, but it is easy to be a little lost if you haven't seen the series before. Unlike a lot of modern day remakes that have attempted to recapture the magic of Transformers, this movie was done during the prime of the series and the peak of its popularity. Overall I found the movie to be very well done. However, as mentioned by a few others, in ways this movie comes across like a giant advertisement.It seems an interesting coincidence that shortly after the movie the line of toys got shaken up with several changes. After watching the movie, I'm sure you can guess which character's toys got canceled and which ones were being pushed on consumers at the time. It is still an enjoyable movie, with a few notable differences not seen in the TV series prior to the movie. One rather large difference being that in the movie it is quite possible for the robots to sustain such injuries as to actually die, whereas in the entire series leading up to the movie, the exact opposite was true...they could sustain near body destroying damage, and just have parts swapped out and replaced and be good as new. This was one change that was received well by some fans and poorly by others.The movie has a surprising cast of some high profile actors doing the voices of the characters, and has a soundtrack that really fits each scene very well. Although the music is very 80s sounding, it is fitting as the movie was released during that time frame. In particular, the score written for the infamous scene involving Optimus Prime, was quite moving. I've seen adults watch that scene and get choked up by it.This was also what many fans feel to be the reason for the decline of the original series. Optimus Prime was the heart of the show, being the leader of the Autobots, (the good robots).... a lot of fans lost interest in the series when they killed him off in the movie. They brought him back at a later point, but it was really too little too late for it to save the series.The series, and the movie, is very enjoyable and still one of my favorites, despite all the obvious goof ups by its creators. However, much like is the case with Star Trek fans. If you are going to nit pick and focus on the mistakes, then you obviously aren't a fan and shouldn't be spending your time watching it.This movie stands well on its own, but I'd highly recommend renting the DVDs for the first couple of seasons of the TV series before watching this movie, or you can end up quite lost with a lot of things not making sense.

However, we are treated to a wonderful American anime, with very likable characters, witty dialogue, and action scenes that draw you in.Also being way ahead of it's time, was the casting of big name actors, at least, for 1986. Judd Nelson, Robert Stack, Leonard freakin' Nimoy as Galvatron and Orson freakin' Welles as planet-eating Unicron! Very cool!

To top things off, Optimus Prime (The Flagship Character of the Franchise)is killed before the plot really gets going, a choice that haunted the franchise for years to come.

So in order to make parents shell out even more cash, they decided to release this deeply disturbing movie/ marketing ploy. How do you ask? Well simply put, by killing every single recognisable character from the original series, and replacing them with all new ones. If corporate America, ever had reason to hold its head in shame this was it. Not only was this series one of the worst offenders in the selling kids crap with 20 minute adverts thinly clothed as cartoons, but here a new low by making all those toys already bought, redundant, at least from the cartoon's perspective. The cartoon's sole purpose was to advertise pointless toys in the most consumer unfriendly way imaginable, it is quite an achievement in its self. Think about how often the Transformers actually transformed into anything, and how often transforming was a benefit. This film however, doesn't even try to attempt to tell an interesting story. In fact subsequent games based on the films and cartoons, did a much better job of telling a story and progressing the universe. Never really understanding the attraction of the original series, and having only a passing interest in the toys, I suppose I can't fully appreciate the nostalgia for many adults. However, that said there was nothing creative or in the least bit laudable about this film, or the cartoon franchise that spawned it. The sooner it realised for the marketing sham it was the better.

Hasbro's Transformers became such a huge hit thanks to a combination of both the toys and the original G1 TV series of the same name. Robots changing into vehicles, guns, and even animals was such an incredible and original concept that it's hard to ignore. After running for two seasons at the time, Hasbro decided to make a full-length movie starring the Autobots and Decepticons.Plot The year is 2005 (imagine that) as the Autobots, led by the heroic Optimus Prime, prepare to retake their home world Cybertron from the clutches of the evil Megatron and his Decepticons. However, a terrifying intergalactic force has arrived on the scene that's proved to be literally bigger than their petty war, the planet-sized Unicron (Orsen Welles). With the power of this new foe greater than anything imagined, it will take a new generation of heroes to stop this menace. Time to transform and role out! Next to Revenge of the Fallen, this is by far my favorite film of the franchise. Seeing how the Transformers were before their live-action release was a real pleasure to see. Many of the famous characters, Autobot and Decepticon alike, get to have there little moments of action and glory, especially the Dinobots, who are my all-time favorite characters. The action scenes are just spectacular and it's pretty much non-stop. Call me old-fashioned, but I love the music, which is typical 80s soundtrack and it fits perfectly with this movie, such as Stan Bush's The Touch which is made famous because of this movie. The animation is also worth noting, definitely superior to the animation of the TV series.The film also became famous by taking risky moves with the old characters while introducing new ones. Optimus Prime and Megatron (Peter Cullen and Frank Welker) are still going at it as their rivalry never seems to end, though both go through some major changes. The Dinobots are fun to watch and bad to the bone. The other classic Autobots and Decepticons are cool in their own unique ways. Hot Rod makes for a good hero and Kup is a fun old robot who likes to think about the old days of the war. Orson Welles was great as Unicron and we're talking about his final role before he passed away. He provided true menace to his character with his voice; forget Citizen Kane, Transformers man!There are very few things to nitpick around here, but overall, this movie is definitely worth buying, partly because of the nostalgia factor. With a great story, stellar voice cast, lovable and diverse cast of characters, great action scenes, and fun music, The Transformers The Movie is sure to please any fan.

What can I say about this movie? Well I guess I can start by saying that it is the most action packed animated film I have ever seen! That's technically what this movie is. It's just 1hr and 20min of non-stop shooting, explosion, fighting,and adventure. Well of course there's more to the plot. The film opens with a giant planet named Unicron that looks like the Death Star eating another planet. Then it shifts to the Autobots who're about to lead a shuttle to search for more energon cubes. Unfortunately for them, The evil Decepticons raids their ship and kill all the members. This really got a lot of fans angry because they saw a lot of their favorite characters die 10 minutes into the movie. The only reason they killed so many characters is so they can add new characters and release more toys. They were taking a big risk killing off so many characters. Anyway, the Decepticons takes over the ship and they are spotted by the Autobot Hot Rod. Hot Rod and some other Autobots attacks the ship, and an all out battle rages. During the battle, Optimus Prime (the leader of the Autobots)confronts Megatron(the leader of the Decepticons). They engage in an all out battles that left all fans cheering because they waited so long to see these two rivals fight to the death. After a while, It seemed that Optimus won, but Megatron played a dirty trick and wounded Optimus pretty badly. But Optimus with all the strength he had left gave Megatron one last punch that left him crippled. The Decepticons escape, and optimus with his last breath, gave the Matrix and his leadership to Ultra Magnus. Mean while, an injured Megatron gets betrayed by his minion Starscream and gets pushed off into space. There, he meets Unicron who makes Megatron one of his minions. In exchange, he gives Megatron a new and more powerful body and rename him Galvatron. He also gives Megatron 3 robots named Relector. With his new power, he kills Starscream and takes over the decepticons again. Now Unicron is forcing him to kill the Autobots and destroy the All Sparks. Now the Autobots have to face Galvatron and Unicron at the same time. I'm not gonna spoil the rest because this is where the movie gets really good. I'm a casual fan of Transformers, and I must say, this film really impressed me. Some people hate it because it had to much violent action, some random music use, and there's to many references to Star Wars. Yes there is a whole bunch of action, but that's what's awesome about it. How many movies have you seen where something blows up every 5 seconds? Yeah, sometimes the action can be a little uneven, and the animation might be laggy from time to time, but this was made in the 80s so give it some slack. There are many references to Star Wars however. Like the character Hot rod is related to Luke, Unicron looks like the Death Star, Arcee has the princess Leah hairstyle, Optimus Prime talks to Hot Rod in his ghost form much like how Ben Kenobi talks to Luke. But i didn't really mind that. So many movies copied things from Star wars up to the point that you don't care anymore. As for the music however, it is completely random. Like when Hot Rod opens the Matrix and the song The Touch starts playing in the background. It also has the most random use of Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid. They played that song when the Autobots where fighting some other random robots in some random planet. And after they made peace with those robots, they started dancing to the exact same song! Despite all these negative feature to this film, it's awesome and anyone will love it. I give it~3.5/5 stars!

Orson Welles a great job with Unicron, however many sources say he didn't care about the part, which is sad because this was his last role and he should've seen his performance. The saddest scene has to be when Optimus Prime dies, bu I must say there should've been more autobots in the room who were in season 1 and 2 or maybe they died as well in the battle of autobot city.

It gives the moral majority something to do other than examine each Disney film for subliminal messages. I found it refreshing to actually see this kind of film refuse to pull its punches. It's an action film without tapping into the over-sentimental gushy stuff that usually turns kids off anyway. This is a war. Death and violence are part of it. Will it effect the children that watch it. Maybe, but I don't know which way. I saw first saw the film when I was 7. I saw all of my favourites get blown apart. I saw my absolute, total, complete and utter hero, the person that personified all that was good and noble to me (you know who I mean) get killed saving his friends in an ultimate display of bravery and courage. I cried. My mum cried. I still do. I think that one moment made me more afraid and ashamed of death and destruction than a dozen Private Ryans.The animation is top notch, there's an amazing soundtrack and the voice talent is good too. Not perfect, but Nimoy's portrayal of Galvatron is incredible. Especially when you consider that it was probably done as a 'For the money not the art' job. The script isn't bad either. It has a host of sharp, quotable one-liners that would put Bruce Willis to shame (I've got better things to do tonight than die.) The story is a rip off of Star Wars but what isn't and who cares? It's cool. The animation is superb. I said that earlier but I really do believe that it's better than Disney at some points. Certainly better than the average output at the time. It doesn't compare with today's graphics but it hasn't aged badly at all. The soundtrack can sound a little too cheesy at times but the energy and verve of the film is there and it backs up the visuals with ease.

Even to a noob like me, this film is pretty darn special. With an epic planet-sized transformer eating planets, a major Autobot-vs-Decepticon battle on Earth, an adventure across other planets, and a handful of significant character moments, I can easily see how this film could provide the ultimate experience for an 80s Transformers fan. It's about as significant as comparing the Star Trek movies to the original series.The story for this is pretty darn grand. For a casual viewer like myself, it takes on pretty silly proportions, especially with the inclusion of the Dinobots, some bizarre tribal robots who like to kill other robots for no reason, a trash planet filled with samurai-style robots who shout TV slogans, and God-knows-what-else. I could also criticize the movie for having only a few moments worth of human-based drama. And of course, the film deals so heavily with the established mythos of the cartoon series that it may alienate the uninitiated. Regardless, the story does have its bright moments, and is a good excuse to have a bunch of robots zapping each other.The animation quality for this is fairly strong. It does show its limitations in regards to movements and designs, but the drawings are quite detailed and show phenomenal shadows, textures, and coloring. Voice-acting can be pretty dated and cheesy, but it does feature a surprisingly strong cast, with the likes of Robert Stack, Leonard Nimoy, Orson Welles, and Eric Idle in the mix. Writing is simple and straightforward. Music is very retro, for better or for worse.Recommended for fans of the classic canon.4/5 (entertainment 4/5, story 3.5/5, film 3.5/5) "},{"Title":"Thankfully, this movie was made way before Michael Bay's time.","Date":"24 April 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" When it comes to Transformers movies, now we are talking! After the disastrous handling of the live action Transformers movies, all thanks to the schlockiest director working in Hollywood, Michael Bay, my faith in the franchise was severely tested. But going back and watching this 1986 cartoon movie, reaffirmed my faith in the Transformers. This movie rocks! The animation is crisp and first rate, the story is engrossing, the directing is spot on, and as for the voice cast...WHOA! Who was the casting genius that complied this elite group of actors! Think about it you have Leonard Nimoy, Robert Stack, Judd Hirsh, and if thats not enough to be able to wrangle non other than Orson Wells! First time I saw the credits, my jaw must have dropped through the floor. What really surprised me about this film was how much guts it had. I mean this movie didn't play around, when it came to violence. These robots not only got hurt they got dead. It blew me away how one by one these characters where slaughtering each other. Now, I know people complain that this was a gimmick to get kids to by the newly introduced Transformers by killing off the old ones. Maybe they have a point but I still have to commend the filmmakers for showing that in a war, even robots, get killed. Of course the death of Optimus Prime is heartbreaking to this day but he went out in a blaze of glory. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie 10/10 is kind of a pet peeve. This may sound nit-picky but i cant help it. Unicron is supposed to be the size of a giant planet. They show him attacking worlds and devouring them. Yet the proportions are all wrong when he deals with the Autobots and Decepticons. Think about it. If this thing is as big as say our own world, the Transformers would be microscopic in comparison. Yet here they are inside Unicron and looking like kenner dolls on his shoulders. Furthermore, when they drive out of his body through one of his eyes they make it seem like they just smashed through a glass wall. If this thing is the size of a planet it would be like a trillion sized micro-germ slamming through your eyeball and knocking it out. Just ain't gonna happen. Aside from that, Fantastic Film!

Transformers The Movie does none of that. Not content on just making a 84 minute long episode, the producers decided to up the show's status quo and take its action, animation, story and characters to new heights of excellence.I would caution though, that viewers unfamiliar with Transformers characters should go and watch the original TV series before watching this movie. If you cannot tell the difference between Starscream and Skywarp, go refresh your memory before watching this. There is little introduction to the characters as we jump straight into the thick of the action even before the opening credits flash across the screen. Before you know it, a whole bunch of old characters pass on and another bunch of new characters take their place. Now, if one were to not be familiar with the old characters, then their deaths in this movie would be quite meaningless, hence my recommendation to watch the series beforehand.Did i say deaths? Yes i did. A rarity among animated shows of the 80s was deaths of main characters. And in the tradition of this movie taking what was to a whole new level, the deaths are actually quite graphic and violent. Thankfully, those are robots getting their guts blown out.The story is upgraded from the down to earth TV series style to an intense, action packed, sprawling space epic. The threat is larger than anything the Transformers have ever faced(literally). Sure it may share some elements of Star Wars but it is a huge notch up from the TV series it is based. One of the most epic stories in an animated movie based on a cartoon series.As usual of Transformers, the characters are the main stars. The new characters introduced are extremely likable from their very first uttered line, thanks to a great mix of an engaging script and professional acting. A good measure of Character development, that usually takes at least a couple of episodes in the TV series, is present here and very well handled with none of the characters seeming bland or uninteresting. The script is as emotionally charged as ever, especially the Death of Optimus Prime which was so realistically ad heart wrenching-ly played out that it would bring a tear to anyone's eye. The most obvious jump in quality would be in the art and animation department. Battle damage, metallic sheen, complex shadows, vivid colours and other little details make this movie very spectacular to look at. Such art detail stands the test of time and would even be able to measure up to the art standards of today's TV series derived anime movies. Despite the sky high levels of the art detail, the animation does not suffer one bit. Every scene is fully animated with hardly any short cuts used, characters are always in motion and so are some of the backgrounds; again a rarity among anime TV-series-to-movie films. The fight scenes are superbly storyboarded utilizing all the right shot angles, close-ups or wide pans, and lighting effects to add to the impact and cinematic feel of each battle. Unfortunately there are a number of animation goofs here and there, hence why i did not give it a near perfect score. Those mistakes however are not easily spotted until repeated viewings. They are not jarring and does not distract from the film at all.The soundtrack is really up to personal preference. In my opinion, i love the 80s rock soundtrack the rousing score. It is a huge improvement over the bland musical cues of the original series and really complements each scene very well; truly the icing on a great tasting cake.On a whole, this movie is a real treat for all transformers fans, and an entertaining(though maybe slightly confusing) watch for the casual anime fan. Highly recommended; Transformers the movie is truly a legend and a classic in its own right.

This feature was commissioned to revamp the product, and kill off many of the original characters in order to introduce new ones. It sees the Autobot/Decepticon war take a backseat to a global war of survival against planet eater Unicorn (voiced by Orson Welles).Surprisingly enough, there is a lot worth mentioning in this film, both good and bad.On the minus side, of course, the predominantly 80s soundtrack has aged quite horrendously and some new characters are less appealing than they should be, chiefly the dinobots whose comic relief is neither comical nor relieving. The ending also feels rushed, which is a shame since such a fast-paced and action-packed film as this could have used a calmer denouement.On the plus side, though you can fault the film's purely commercial objective, you can only admire its inventiveness. Unicorn is a beauty, both in design and in how the creature is used. The opening planet destroying scene is abrupt, savage and hugely impressive, even 20 years later. Optimus Prime is used to maximum effect, as is the whole Megatron/Galvatron storyline. The fast pacing and varied locals are the real strength though, since our heroes run from planet to planet and bump into intriguing (and often disturbing) creations, such as the genocidal Quintessons. The film's laudable level of violence is probably a key component of its enduring appeal.All in all, one can only hope that at least a few of the many neat ideas explored here will find their way into the sequel to 2007's live action version.This may not be Shakespeare, but to an extent, it is worthy of its minor cult following. A more than adequate 85 minutes with touches of bizarre genius.

I always relate Transformers to everything that was good about my childhood. No matter how bad things were, I could always count on words of wisdom from Optimus Prime, some cynical remarks from Springer, and of course the usual self-serving antics from everybody's favorite backstabber Starscream. Each day I would come home from elementary school (I was probably 6 years old when the series debuted) turn on the television and be whisked away to the far off reaches of the galaxy.I regret that I wasn't able to see Transformers The Movie at the theater. Being from rural Kentucky we only had one cinema and unfortunately Transformers didn't draw enough interest to be shown on the big screen. I saw it several months later on VHS, but it was definitely worth the wait. The plot is fairly rudimentary (good vs. evil), but there is so much more to Transformers. It was definitely the cartoon for intelligent children. I never truly appreciated the complexity of the series until I got older. How many shows of this genre have dealt with topics such as death? The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots). I do believe that the death scenes hurt the overall success of the movie and the subsequent Season 3, but we're very necessary elements to the film. I mean c'mon the Autobots and Decepticons were AT WAR! How many wars have ended without casualties? The series wasn't quite as graphic, but often times Optimus Prime was faced with very difficult decisions (Watch The Ultimate Doom for instance).The animation in the film is superb...as is the soundtrack. With the exception of Dare to Be Stupid there isn't a weak song in the movie. Leonard Nimoy pulls off an amazing voice characterization as Galvatron and I was also pleased as usual with Peter Cullen as Prime, the late Chris Latta as Starscream, and the legendary Frank Welker as Megatron (among others).The only quarrels I have with the movie would be the dance scene with the Junkions (while their friends are being gobbled up by a gigantic moon-gobbling planet), and the introduction of Blurr and Wheelie. In a perfect world they would have been fed to the Sharkticons ). The introduction of the matrix of leadership seemed to come out of thin air.

As all the transformers we knew and loved are killed off are never seen again after the highlight of this movie the decepticon surprise attack on the autobots.  After this the movie basically focuses on the many new transformers we have never seen before.  The only transformer from the series that really has any screen time after the attack is Grimlock.  And how the heck were the transformers killed so easily in this one?  They were shot up all the time in the series, and didn't even blink...here they get shot once and die.  The plot with the planet was ok, and the scene with the shark robots was pretty cool, but the junk planet was lame and some of the new characters just plain sucked.

It's definitely a nostalgic 80s cult classic. I can't say enough good things about it. I loved it as a kid. My kids love it today, and I can appreciate the level of story telling and animation on a whole new level now as an adult. The soundtrack isn't for everyone,(mainly 80s rock and roll) but when I hear it, I'm instantly transported back to my childhood with a warm fuzzy nostalgia rush. Seriously, Stan Bush is a genius. You don't need to have a strong working understanding of the Transformers universe to enjoy this film; the story can stand on it's own.

"},{"Title":"Brainless Action and Death With a Rockin' Soundtrack","Date":"20 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" I really wanted to rate this one higher, really, I did, but there are just one too many things holding this movie back for me to call it anything more than above average.The first main issue with this movie is how it mistakes kill a whole bunch of people off for dark. There's a lot of character deaths in this film, most of them happening to characters that aren't established well enough for them to have much emotional meaning. I know, this was made for fans of the show, but this is also a feature film. It needs to stand or fall on its own, and fall this film does. Kinda hard.For the main problem with the film, you see, is tone. This movie goes from mess-your-drawers planet-eating monstrosity to kick-ass 1980s opening song in an instant, and the tonal whiplash HURTS, man. Then there's the moment where Galvatron walks in and he doesn't just MURDER, Starscream, he turns the dude into ash and then crushes the crown he was wearing, all from a blast with that Hanna-Barbara shyoomp sound effect attached to it. I get that it was something on the show, but this goofy sound instantly sucked all the menace out of Galvatron. Tell a good story first, appease raging fanboys like myself LAST. Finally, the story itself plays more like a three-part episode from the show than a movie. After Optimus's death, the movie just meanders from scene to scene with the Autobots trying to evade Galvatron while working their way towards their home planet Cybertron in order to stop Unicron from eating it. There's a lot of popcorn action, but roughly half of it involves. Shoot, the good guys only learn Unicron's name by sheer coincidence, in a subplot that's completely disconnected from the main one, on some planet with some kind of weird law system where the innocent are put to death and... I have no idea what happens to guilty, nor can I fathom it. Point is, that whole detour, again, comes off like the plot to a filler episode rather than a plot beat of a movie. Oh, and Unicron's defeat is a complete deus ex machina. His opponent never even fights him proper, he just opens this Matrix of Leadership thing and then Unicron blows up. Makes you wonder why previous Autobot leaders didn't go out and do that, you know, BEFORE Unicron set his sights on Cybertron.On top of that, Unicron himself manages to get progressively less threatening as the film goes on. When he starts, I was genuinely frightened of him as I watched him devour the screaming inhabitants of a planet and grind them up into primordial soup to power his veins. And then he wet himself when he realized he'd sent a tyrant off to collect the one thing that could destroy him, and then he transformed into his robot form and proceeded to get his eyes blown out and his head blow off, all while systematically shrinking as the animation severely downsized his scale in contrast to the normal sized Transformers. He had his moments, and he was certainly a threat worthy of a feature film, but overall I felt he was squandered in the end.By all rights, I should find this movie pretty forgettable. Outside of Galvatron icing Starscream, the death of Optimus Prime, and the sheer pants-darkening terror that was Unicron's first scene in the movie, there's nothing to this for me to really keep. I'm not a G1 Transformers fan. I grew up watching Armada and later checked out Transformers Prime, and this movie banks pretty heavily on its audience already being fans.That is, except for one thing THE MUSIC. Holy crap, this movie has a soundtrack to rival the likes of Star Wars and Highlander in its sheer, magnanimous badassitude. As Team Four Star proved in their Bardock Abridged special, you could stick some of these kick-ass hair metal tunes over any kind of action scene and they would fit like a glove. Unicron's medley as he prowls across space and eats a planet is equally frightening as the scene itself is, and Optimus Prime's death is sold almost entirely on the music. Prior to that, Prime had maybe 2 scenes and no substantial character moments to speak of, so there's nothing to get attached to in the movie itself.I'd rate this movie as merely above average, but this soundtrack is so awesome that I can't in good conscience rate it any lower than I did. If you're not a Transformers fan, just skip the movie and put on the soundtrack. I wasn't lying when I implied that it's one of the best movie soundtracks I'd ever heard. "},{"Title":"THE animated film of the 80s.","Date":"16 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" SPOILERS AHEAD!I'm going to go through the most common criticisms for this film1) They killed off the main cast.This is more something that angered 80's fans. Most people today would call it bold. There's a gravity to it... that later seasons of the cartoon decided to contradict that by bringing them back to like. However, they still managed to respect Optimus' death. Sort of life Gandalf the Grey coming back as Gandalf the White, his death in this movie was a setup for a victorious return.2) The animation is cheap.Computer-animating those shots to such detail would have already been a nightmare, so imagine how much manpower was put to bringing them to life by hand?3) There is no plot.The purpose of this film isn't to confuse little children with complex twists. The purpose was to expand The Transformers universe with an intergalactic adventure, depicting the fictional societies, politics, and technologies of several alien races, obviously including the titular Transformers.4) There is no character growth.Hot Rod was a young, innocent, but impulsive soldier who got Optimus killed. Optimus left the Matrix with Ultra Magnus, whose tactical leadership style is invaluable to the Autobot cause, but he would later find that the Matrix was never his to use. Meanwhile, Starscream usurps the Decepticon leadership from his injured commander, but Megatron is reborn as Galvatron, an almighty warrior who gradually admits to himself that he is only a pathetic slave to Unicron. The prodigy Hot Rod returns as Rodimus Prime and redeems himself by unleashing the light of the Matrix and destroying Unicron. That growth is pretty philosophical.5) There is no dramatic tone.If you didn't react when the movie opened with Unicron devouring a planet, when Optimus died, when Galvatron finally executed Starscream, when Daniel thought his father died, when Unicron transformed into a giant robot, when Galvatron failed to use the Matrix to escape Unicron's control, or when Hot Rod became Rodimus Prime and blew up Unicron, you must be no fun to talk to.Obviously, I'm also going to praise the excellent voice cast, the spunky rock soundtrack, some of the best one-liners I've ever heard, and the overall fun of the movie. "},{"Title":"Really for fans who followed the TV show","Date":"30 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" For the toy company of Hasbro, one of their most successful cartoon TV adaptations and iconic staples among many children are the transformers robots. Who knew that such a simple idea of a robot that could transform into item that we are familiar with everyday could be so entertaining? To many, the TV series is what made the toy line even more fun for people because at that point, they had characters with personalities and backstories that made them somewhat relatable to their viewing counterparts. Twenty years later or so action director Michael Bay got a hold of the rights turned it into even more of a phenomenon, spawning sequel after sequel. While seeing how popular the concept had become it's important to take note that the robots in disguise characters originally had their own animated movie two years after its official TV airing. With that said, expectations should be different for this viewing. The problem is even with a different set of expectations; the end result is disappointing. There is effort here, but it lies among a pile of questions.The story takes place in the midst of war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons lead by Megatron (Frank Welker). During this period they are interrupted by a massive alien planet known as Unicron (Orson Welles) looking to destroy anything with life and can only be stopped by the matrix of leadership. The premise at first is acceptable but once immersed into the conflict all buildup is lost. Penned by Ron Friedman (who wrote for a lot of other TV shows), this feature length film was actually a connecting point between seasons 2 and 3 of The Transformers TV show. This is the immediate problem for several viewers. For those who never saw the TV show, are now required to see seasons 1 and 2 before even thinking about viewing this movie. On top of that, there are numerous characters listed and seen throughout the run time but yet are not mentioned, given backstories to or even speak dialog. This makes it all the more difficult for a viewer who is not familiar with the TV show.Then there's the whole plot, which originally stated seemed easy to follow. However as the viewer watches, they will notice that for Unicron's motivations and background go untouched. Why does Unicron want to destroy all life and where did he come from? Why does he destroy his own kind? Even the plot point of the matrix of leadership isn't very clear. How does it keep Unicron from doing its business? All these questions go unanswered in the form of convenient contrivances. Perhaps this information was given prior in the TV show? Again though, how would this win over new viewers if they've never seen the show? This lack of exposition can make the viewing feel quite empty. Nonetheless there are still some elements that provide enough saving grace to keep this movie at an average level. One of the more noticeable things is for anyone who saw Michael Bay's live-action franchise before this, they will at least be able to point out any of the characters they've seen before but in their 80s version.Another positive is the voice-actors cast for the characters. Of the most popular you can't go wrong with is Peter Cullen who will always be Prime and Frank Welker who is practically anybody and anything else. There are also vocal appearances for Grimlock, one of the dinobots (Gregg Berger), Shockwave (Corey Burton), Jazz (Scatman Crothers), Bumblebee (Dan Gilvezan), Starscream (Chris Latta), Blurr (John Moschitta Jr.), Hot Rod (Judd Nelson), Galvatron (Leonard Nimoy), Ultra Magnus (Robert Stack) and Kup (Lionel Stander). But the voice that stands out the most of this bunch is none other than the voice of the late Orson Welles. Although it was reported that Welles hated his role, the magnitude of his voice-work at which it is used for the massive planet destroyer is gleefully astounding. Welles voice is so deep and booming that it matches the look and presence of this memorable character with ease. Imagine if Welles voiced a character today? Holy cow.Helping at least make what's left of this product somewhat enjoyable is the overall visual design and animation. Directing this movie was Nelson Shin whose main expertise is being an animation director. So although he wasn't heavily involved in the actual steps of animation, his supervision was still critical. Other animators like Satoshi Urushihara (Akira (1988)) also worked on this project and most of the animation looks great. The entire look of the film has a very anime inspired feel to it, making the detailing on a lot of the backgrounds and close up shots look very intricate. Lastly, the musical score composed by Vince DiCola is actually well put together. Although he tried his best to score Rocky IV (1985) as his first attempt, his style just didn't match. Here however, DiCola feels like a better fit because of his reliance on synth musical instruments. It centers on robots so why not? Also Stan Bush's Touch single is quite the catchy song. It rings all the more 1980s to anyone looking for a blast from the past.It's not the movie some fans of the newer films may expect it to be. If you never followed the TV show then it will be confusing to understand much of the plot devices, extra characters and their motivations. This is where it fails. Yet even with that, it's hard not to enjoy the anime-style detailed animation, appropriate electronic musical score and respectable voice cast, including a final stoic performance from the late Orson Welles. "}{"Title":"a guilty pleasure at its best it's like HEAVY METAL for kids","Date":"4 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" Perhaps it's due to time and perspective, but the Transformers 1986 animated movie is a big breath of fresh air - compared to the Michael Bay films, of course. Yes, this film is noisy and busy and it has a bunch of characters who, if you're not previously familiarized with them, may go by at times in a blur. And actually, no not kidding, there is a Transformer named Blurr by the way, who of course is the fast-talking robot. But besides the point, this is a movie that is very naked about it being from a TV show, itself taken from a line of toys. It's not there to be very deep and doesn't pretend to be, though it has a couple of oddly ballsy moves that I'll get to in a moment. It's there to entertain boys ages 5 to 10. And that isn't one of those trivial points; the age distinction should be listed on the side of the tape like on the side of an action figure or video game console.The plot... oh sheesh. So the Autobots have to fight the Decepticons (duh), and this time there's a, also no kidding, a giant Transformer that is basically a giant, spherical AI that eats planets. Or maybe Unicron IS a planet, or a planet made of artificial intelligence, I don't know, but this thing is coming after, well, everything, and it becomes a thing where even Megatron, the ostensible villain, is groveling at Unicron's, uh, not-feet. So the movie becomes a series of action scenes to string along this thin story, also involving a Transformer named Hot-Rod, who we can kind of distinguish because there's a little boy (the only human I think in the film) who is by its side when an attack happens on Earth.This is thin stuff, but it shouldn't be about the plot, right? The downside of course is that there IS a lot of exposition to get through, not at all times but frequent enough, and while, unlike in the Bay films, I can tell the robots apart visually I got lost when it sometimes came to just remember such-and-such's name. Of course the gaggle of celebrity voices does help things, and some of them are character actors (very memorable ones to boot) Leonard Nimoy, Eric Idle, Judd Nelson, Lionel Stander (ever seen Cul de Sac?), Scatman Crothers and, wait, Casey Kasem was in this too(!) You can remember who some are since they are so distinctive, and Nimoy actually does a really memorable job as Galvatron, the upgrade for Megatron. I think, anyway.The one that makes the film almost notorious in a weird way is Orson Welles. This was the end of the line for the man who started in movies as Charles Foster Effing Kane. It's been said that it's the sort of bottom low for someone of his stature to hit by the (what wasn't known as) the end of his career at the time. And yet, call me crazy, but Unicron was one of the most fascinating parts about the whole movie. Yes, it's a kids movie involving fighting robots in space - and all the better that it barely takes place on Earth - but the concept of a gigantic robot, so massive that it has the impending doom of the Death Star from Star Wars, is a cool and curious piece of intelligent 'what-if'-ness.Though it's ultimately put to use for a 'Transformation' by the climax, I liked the idea that other robots, all robots, and worlds, would have to submit to this giant force, or what's called in psychology and philosophy as the Big Other. It also just looks cool in the movie, and has depths and dimensions and designed parts that make it wholly stand out from most of the Transformer characters, who all have blank faces. At least Unicron, for as much as you might mock the name or its purpose to just consume, is distinctive and fits that out-there, science fiction cum comic book ideal. And Welles, albeit with an added post-production growl to his voice, does the character a deadly kind of presence that works as a performance.If only I could actually care about some of these situations, or if the script was just a little more focused; the section with Optimus Prime early on is the exception, which seems to come as a big 'Oh Wow' moment story-wise - taking out one of your main characters for what one almost assumes could be the end of the movie (all scored to You Got the Touch in epic fashion). It should be noted this was a 'bridge' between seasons 2 and 3 of the show, so this might have been an even bigger deal if one was attached to the cartoon. Just taking the movie on its own terms, it's a fairly bold move - maybe too bold considering the scope of the rest of the production.What else does one remember after the fire and fury of a movie like Transformers? Maybe the Sharktocons (sic) who have an appearance that brings out chuckles? Or how it's unmistakably Eric Idle as the one Transformer with a mustache and, of course, doing improv? Or the soundtrack (80's hair metal glory). A lot of this story is so light that it just barely makes up like three or four episodes connected of what the show would be, and the quality of the animation varies between having genuinely impressive and creative designs and effects, and looking just on level with all the other 80's animation of the period (Ninja Turtles and, to an extent, X-Men come to mind). But here, again, because of how the Transformers are designed, you can't exactly get too wrapped up in any of their features, just their voices. It is what it is, though it carries a certain charm I can never say the new Paramount productions carry.

In the episode, the physically underdeveloped nerd of the family watches in awe as the movie version of his favourite weekend cartoon plays out across the cinema screen. His face soon turns to sheer horror when his beloved heroes are routinely blown away by the evil Decepticons, and I was immediately transported back in time. Not only does the bespectacled Adam Goldberg (played by Sean Giambrone) remind me of my older brother, but I instantly recalled my own horror at seeing the likes of Ratchet, Ironhide and Prowl being casually blown to pieces.Your enjoyment of Transformers The Movie really depends on whether you roll your eyes or clap your hands like a child at the sound of un-ironic 80's cheese blaring over sketchy animation of giant robots. No will claim that this is a work of high art or even narratively consistent, but if you're even remotely invested in the ensemble of Autobots, the ensuing blood-bath (oil-bath?) will still no doubt be shocking. Characters are dismembered, decapitated and shot execution-style. Casual viewers or newcomers may have trouble distinguishing one Transformer from the next (something that the live-action Michael Bay movies struggle with), but the relentless carnage at least makes for a refreshing experience to the usual child-friendly fare.It also has Unicron, the big bad guy who is so huge he transforms into a planet. Voiced by Orson Welles in one of his last feature films, his operatic, ham-fisted growl combined with that opening tune still has the ability to give me chills. While Unicron commits planetary genocide in the opening moments, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) plans an all- out assault on the Decepticons. Prime's opposite number Megatron (Frank Welker) hears of the plans and attacks first, leaving the Autobots scattered and on the defensive. Following an attack on Autobot City, the Autbots flee with Megatron wounded and blasted into outer space. But Unicron wants the Matrix, a talisman of great power currently in the hands of Autobot Ultra Magnus (Robert Stack), and so re-creates Megatron as Galvatron (Leonard Nimoy) to recover it.The narrative consists of little more than one action scene after the next, full of explosions, gun-play, and fan-favourites the Dinobots cracking-wise. While these moments are generally entertaining and lovingly realised, they soon become quite tiresome. When good guy Hot Rod (Judd Nelson) lands on planet Junk and is attacked by the motorcycle-riding natives led by Wreck-Gar (Eric Idle), I just longed for some of them to sit down and have a conversation. This leads to a disappointingly underwhelming climax as Hot Rod, Galvatron and Unicron finally face-off. The animation is rather jittery but incredibly stylish, in a style seemingly lost with modern-day cartoons. I may be nit-picking, but it's only because I believe that Transformers The Movie deserves to be taken seriously, and although it's far from perfect, it will always retain a place in the hearts of us children of the 80's.

The one I'm guessing is from the TV show, and correct me if I'm wrong, is an auto-bot who's voice box is on fast forward. The other two is some kind of mustachio Australian cowboy road hog bot and a mini bot that thinks he's an imp or a red Leprechaun that rides on Grimlock like a horse. These three are an annoyance to listen to, but fortunately that's the only thing I don't like about them and none of them get on my nerves over anything they do.With my only reasonable complaint out of the way, let me explain the complaints I have that will completely backfire at me; One, Optimus Prime dies even though he has suffered worse in the TV series and could have been regenerated as easily as Ultramagnis by that mustachio Australian cowboy road hog bot and his medics. That backfires on me because then there won't be so much anticipation for Optimus'es resurrection later on in the TV series.Two, some five-headed alien Easter egg randomly tosses other robots into a robot-shark pit that seemed to have no connection with the film. That backfires on me because you are taught more about this five-headed alien robot as being one of the creators of the transformers later on in the TV series.Three, Unicron is a Galactis rip-off. That backfires on me because I am neither familiar with Marvel's Silver Surfer villain and I don't know if Galactis was an original character either.Four, the upgraded Megatron, Galvitron, is Unicron's little pawn. That backfires on me because it's better to be a pawn to a galactic near omnipotent overlord and actually do something than, from what I heard about in Michael Bay's Transformers 4, being a pawn to humans.Fifth and finally, WAY TOO MUCH ACTION for me! You thought Michael Bay's Transformers films were action eye candy, this 80s film alone puts it Them to complete shame! I mean 90% of this entire film is nothing but lasers, explosions, butt chomping, obliterating and socking each other in the face! Even that backfires on me because I am aware that there was also a lot of breaks and buildups in the few episodes I saw in the TV series and if I were to combine the TV series and this film into a one week long mega-film, it would have been evenly balanced. You see, that's what I mean when I say any complaint I have with this film is complete trash! It's as pointless as me saying its soundtrack is an 80s product of the time... Which is why the entire Transformers cartoons exists, for PRODUCTS! In short, I am really stupid to complain about the soundtrack being an ad when that is the entire goal of this feature presentation! Done right, mined you, unlike Space Jam!The only reasons I personally give this flick a 6/10 stars is because of my first impressions, my age of outgrowing this type of mindless mauling and my complete stupidity for biting into this before double checking. If I were a genuine Transformers fan and have seen every series and interpretation, I would have given this a 10/10.For anyone else, this is a film to put on you're TV and place on the wall so the kids and teenagers that dig this trend can go bouncing up and Down on pogo sticks and trampolines while guzzling down Red Bull.

They didn't hold back or try and soften the conflict and it was portrayed superbly. Everything from the soundtrack to the characters, and the dialogue works perfectly. Especially the dialogue which you just wouldn't get in a kids film nowadays. So many good one liners. The speech between Megatron and Prime is just pure brilliance with a fight scene that follows animated to perfection. The voice casting is exceptional and every action sequence is pulled off with such style and finesse. It even has one of the saddest scenes of any film that still makes me teary today. Once very rarely something comes along that just works in every single way...even more. Transformers the movie 1986 is an example of this. I feel privileged to have seen this as a child.

It was my absolute favorite movie as a kid and I wore out my VHS copy. Seeing it now as an adult, I cannot see it through anything but child- like eyes and with overwhelming feelings of happy, sweet, nostalgia.Is it a great movie? I am not sure. Is the soundtrack cheesy 80's rock? Maybe. Is it my favorite Transformers movie? Absolutely. Will it always bring a smile to my face? I have one right now just thinking about it.Sure, the animation is wildly inconsistent, going from pretty amazing to laughably bad Sunday Morning cartoon fare from scene to scene. Sure, it can be seen as one big commercial for the future toy products of the series. But none of that matters when you are 8 years old. The Optimus Prime death scene was borderline traumatizing. The film is surprisingly violent by today's standards and outright gutsy in its willingness to kill off series regulars. It held no punches and if you were a kid in the 80's there is no way you can hear You Got the Touch and not smile, picturing Optimus Prime going to town on the Decepticons. This will always be in my top favorites.

This is a movie that has real heart, real emotion, real themes at its core and one of the best film soundtracks ever. Sure there a bits where it drags a little and you want it to get back to the main action but it all makes sense in the end. This film probably won't make a massive amount of sense to the average 12 year old I must say, but to the 30 somethings amongst us it carries a great deal of our childhoods with it and along with that I feel a massive emotional attachment to it. The film deals with themes such as loyalty, friendship, the transition from youth to adulthood, the acceptance of responsibility, respect for elders, working toward a common goal and much else all backed by a superb 80's soft metal soundtrack composed by the much underrated Stan Bush. The soundtrack is the driving force behind much of the emotion of the movie, watch the scene where Hot Rod becomes Rodimus Prime without The Touch and its nowhere near as effective. Watch Optimus take out the decepticons without The Touch and you won't pull for him. Watch Hot Rod and Kup escape the Sharkticons without Dare playing and it doesn't work as well. This is a movie worth seeing. If only to compare it to the newer rebooted films which are technically superior and have had more spent on the catering for the cast than this movie probably cost to make but don't have the plot lines, heart, story or sheer entertainment value that this 80's throwback does.

If I knew that Bay would bastardize the series like he has with a bunch of penis, fart jokes, racism and Shia LaBeouf I don't think I would've ever bothered to watch any of his movies about TF.The movie is basically TF trying to transition from their early toy lines with the Optimus Prime and MMegatron eras as the respective leaders of the Autobots and Decepticons to the more updated version with Rodimus Prime and Galvatron being the leaders.They even were able to woo Orson Welles into playing the voice of Unicron.

But I'm not here to tell you all a normal review, rather, I'm here to discuss the Pros and Cons of this film, so here goes Pros First thing that I should note is the Production values that went into the making of this film. The Animation, Voices and Music were top notch. The Animation itself is among of, if not, the best Non Disney films from the 80's that I have seen (the only films that I can think of with better animation would be Akira and The Land Before Time) In fact, these three movies surpass Disney quality at times too.Next, Unicron is introduced. That giant, planet-eating robot is introduced here. Along with Galvatron, Cyclonus and Scurge (forgive me if I spelled that wrong). The Villains are much more powerful. Oh and the Quintasons are introduced here too (again, I know I misspelled it).Third of all is the script. It has some good character development in it.And finally, we all knew that Megatron would kill Starscream sooner or Later. Although I'm not saying he's a bad character though.Cons Despite the high quality of the Animation in this film (trust me, I'm not lying when I say it, it moves smoothly and almost surpasses Disney at times). It's loaded with errors like the series. Some aren't that noticeable unless you play the movie frame by frame. While others are incredibly noticeable (Devastator's green chest plate, Hot Rod's two different Transformations and the Credits are most noticeable among them).Blurr and Wheelie were the most annoying characters ever introduced. While the former is tolerable to a point (he'll leave you wondering when will he ever shut up) Wheelie should be burned with Holy water. He makes Robin the Boy wonder look like a cool character (Thank god that Wheelie was changed for RoTF) The Death of Optimus Prime could give kids nightmare and possibly traumatize them for most of their young lives.And the infamous oh Sh*t line said by Spike. Need I say more.Conclusion Good points- Unicron and new Decepticons, High production values, good plot and Starscream dying. Bad points- Blurr & Wheelie, numerous animation errors despite the excellent animation, Optimus dying and Oh Sh*t line.Score 8/10.

Deemed 'too violent' a storyline, only a few of the characters were herded and slaughtered, but hard hitting none the less.Parents groups were outraged following the release of the film for it's violence and animated death, to such a degree it even changed the face of it's cousin film 'G.I.JoeThe Movie'. Duke was originally slated an Optimus Prime fate, but later was re-dubbed into a coma.The opening 20 minutes is simply one of the best cartoon battle sequences ever, taking 'JoeTM' opening title sequence into thought as that good too. So much so quickly, you really don't have time to get the perspective the first time.With some great voice work by rather respected actors at the time (including Orson Welles final film credit), the script gets past the grind and keeps pretty brisk. Even if your not a die-hard TF fan, this is still an old school retro kick ass 80's film. Reaching cartoon epic, bring the popcorn and no bathroom breaks. "},{"Title":"Commercial or Movie?","Date":"26 August 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" The Transformers movie was made following the second season of the original Transformers series. THis movie is the transition to the third season. Also in a way this film was a great platform to advertise the new toy line that came out.Much of the original cast of characters appear in this film. Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Braun, Prowl, Ironhide, Jazz, Bumblebee, Blaster, Perceptor, CLiffjumper, and Spike are all there to make up the autobot ranks. Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Devastator, Blitzwing, Insecticons, and Astrotrain are there as well. However it is somewhat disappointing as many of the autobots and decepticons die in the first half hour of the film. The deaths of many prominent characters (Prime, Ironhide, Ratchet, Prowl, Braun, Starscream, etc) leads to new characters appearing. The only season one and two characters to appear throughout the film are the dinobots.Hot Rod becomes the new key autobot and he is somewhat different than prime in that he is much younger acting, the polar opposite of the mature and experienced prime. Also starring in this film are the war tested Ultra Magnus and Kup. I am all for new characters appearing, but this would have been a greater movie if it was all of the original characters throughout the film, not just in the first half hour.Other new characters that are not favorites of mine are Blurr and Wheelie. BOth are extremely annoying, BLurr talks faster than a guy hosting an auction and Wheelie has to talk in annoying rhyme schemes. (FRIEND FIND, LOOK BEHIND!) Overall the story is pretty good. Cyclonius (Giant planet sized transformer who eats planets to gain energy) is the main protagonist. Cyclonius is a really good villain for this film. He is also responsible for turning Megatron into Galvatron. The story is very similar to Star Wars in lots of ways, not a complete rip off, but there are a lot of parts similar. Cyclonius is like the Death Star going around destroying planets, Hot Rod is like Luke Skywalker going through training gaining experience, Arcee(another new character I forgot to mention) has princess Leia's hair, and Megatron uses a lightsaber like weopon to fight Prime.The music is great. Stan Bush has great songs in The TOuch and Dare playing a great times. Most of the music in the background sounds like music from Rocky Four (Not a coincidence because the same composer worked on both films.) Also there is great action, especially the fight between Prime and Megatron and a great squabble scene involving the decepticons on Astrotrain. Being a Soundwave Fan I was hoping that he would become the new leader.I really feel that the film dies off after the first half hour and most of the original characters are gone. It is not bad, but it does go slightly down hill. Also Galvatron voiced by Leonard Nimoy is not as evil sounding as Frank Welker as Megatron.I do recommend this film though. It is a good animated movie. It is disappointing that so many original character are not seen throughout but whatever. See this movie if you can.

Michael Bay's Transformers, as good as it is still does not stack up to the classic film from 1986. If you're any kind of a Transformers fan, you'll find yourself smiling, getting goose bumps and even crying. What makes this movie so good is not just the intensely beautiful animation, great characters but also the dark tone and Vince Dicolas amazing musical score.

"},{"Title":"You've Got the Touch!","Date":"9 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" Many of the official Hollywood critics call this movie, and the cartoon series that complemented it, nothing but a crass commercial for the Hasbro toy line. While that is definitely true, this movie is actually a very decent animated adventure story as well, with superb animation and an excellent voice cast that made the characters come to life.The colors and shades, as well as the character designs, are first rate, which is pretty surprising for an American cartoon movie that is not a part of the following Disney, Don Bluth, or Warner Brothers. The animators realized this film would be a step-up from the syndicated weekday cartoon on TV, and put their best effort into making the richness of the animation cells come alive. The individual frames alone are a work of art. For this alone, the movie deserves praise.The voice actors, a mix of professional voice-over artists and Hollywood actors, also inject significant life into this movie. Veteran cartoon voice-overs, such as Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, and Chris Latta do excellent work as the main characters Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Starscream, respectively. Their energy and emotion imparts clear personalities and color into cartoon characters that would otherwise be moving ads for cheap plastic toys. Many fans fondly remember Cullen's booming, noble, magisterial voice as the heroic Prime; Welker's sinister and raspy tones as Megatron; and, of course, perhaps the most fondly remembered Transformer of them all, the duplicitous, cowardly, sniveling, and crafty Decepticon with the whiny, high-pitched, raspy voice, Latta's inimitable Starscream. Welker also does the voice of one of Soundwave's cassette minions, whose gangster-style accent sounds like a later Welker classic, Bankjob Beagle from Duck Tales. The professional movie actors do well as well. Leonard Nimoy is superb as the reincarnated Megatron, Galvatron, and Robert Stack, of TV's Unsolved Mysteries, is delightful as the noble Autobot lieutenant Ultra Magnus. Legendary Brat Packer Judd Nelson, best known as the annoying record producer with the ugly goatee in Airheads, is actually quite good as the reluctant hero of the film, Rodimus Prime. I cannot be as kind to film giant Orson Welles, in large part because he was extremely reluctant to be a part of this movie, and was very ill when he recorded his voices. Still, the film makers filter his voice through some electronic machine, which transforms Charles Foster Kane into the evil robot-god Unicron. Monty Python fans will love Eric Idle's turn as the goofy, ad-spouting hero Wreck-Gar.On top of the animation and voices, you have a great '80s hair metal soundtrack, with such classics as You've Got the Touch, and Weird Al's Dare to be Stupid. Gen Y-ers nostalgic for their childhood, and possibly a new generation of young children, will adore this gem of cartoon art. This is the first movie I remember watching in theaters, and having seen it twenty-one years later, it still holds up. If you can find it at the video rental store, I highly recommend you watch it.

These things are true, but these qualities make this movie great. The lines may be campy and corny, but somehow they fit into the movie. It is a very quotable movie since there are so many one-liners. When a 45 foot tall robot that transforms into a gun says I will crush you with my bare hands! or when Hot Rod says I have nothing but contempt for this court and the shot zooms in on him you can't help but believe that they're serious. Sometimes it seemed like the introduction of new characters would almost be proceeded by ....now on sale for $9.99, but this actually gave a good opportunity to learn each characters name and introduce them.The soundtrack is superb and a tribute to the talents of 1980's musicians. Most of the songs are feel good/pump-up rock music chock full of wailing guitars. The song The Touch was reused in Boogey Nights where it rose to popularity. A little known factoid is that Stan Bush wrote the song specifically for Transformers The Movie. A Weird Al song even makes an appearance, and somehow it fits flawlessly into the movie.The voice acting was excellent as would be expected from the all-star cast (Leonard Nimoy, Orson Welles, Robert Stack, etc...). Leonard Nimoy's voicing of Galvatron is quite memorable, he brings life and charisma to the character that was missing when they brought back the man who voiced Megatron to do Galvatron for Season 3 of the TV show. The voice actors worked with the script and delivered almost every line in a memorable way.Transformers the Movie defies the usual pattern of TV show to movie transfers. Perhaps this is because these kind of movies are just about cashing in, but heck, Transformers the Movie was about a show cashing in on a Hasbro toy line of robots that transform into cars and jets. If a movie about robots fighting to 80's rock music sounds awesome then this movie will not disappoint you. If you're looking for an hour and a half of entertaining one-liners then you will not be disappointed. If you want a movie will good voice acting and character development, then you will not be disappointed. See this movie, you will not be disappointed.

A monster planet that devours everything in its path&#133;and it's heading for the small planet of Cybertron where a unique race of transforming robots continue to fight a civil war&#133;a war between good and evil that has raged for millions of years. The evil Decepticon Transformers, led by the maniacal Megatron, have sworn to crush their enemies, the Autobots. To this end they have relentlessly pursued them across the galaxy to planet Cybertron to planet Earth and back again. But the heroic Autobot Transformers and their courageous leader Optimus Prime are not easily defeated. By 2005 the Decepticons have conquered the planet of Cybertron but, unknown to them, the Autobots are hidden on two of Cybertron's moons preparing to retake the planet.Years ago I used to read the weekly comic book (and did so until it finished in issue 330 or whatever) and also had a box of the toys. As I got older I forgot all about it and sadly all the comics and toys went the way of the jumble sale &#150; a charitable type of sale before E-Bay made shopkeepers of us all. With the news of a big budget version due next year I decided to revisit this one to remind myself what it was all about. I surprised myself by how much I remembered and how hearing the names of the characters brought back a lot of the old stories to me (specifically Soundwave, Blaster, Bumblebee and others). To some degree these waves of memory and nostalgia helped me get into the story despite, after a powerful opening, an ambling establishing approach. The plot was also familiar to me so I assume that it was from the comic series or the movie was just coming back to me.Assuming familiarity with the characters to be a given to some degree, the plot is actually pretty engaging, with plenty of deaths, action and good (for the time) animation. Although it does not have a real depth or complexity for adults it is very good for children &#150; colourful and engaging but with a real dark edge. Fans of the Transformers will lap it up of course but it isn't solid enough for the casual adult viewer to get into &#150; although maybe the remake could change all that? The voice cast is quite impressive and it is a shame that the material doesn't give them a lot to work with in regards characterisation. It is a shame in a way that this was Welles' and Scatman Crothers' final film but it does make it a curiosity if nothing else. Some of the voices annoyed me (the Dinobots were far too simple) but people like Nimoy, Stack and Kasem all have the sort of voices that suit the metallic delivery. Conversely Idle doesn't work at all while Welker is mixed (good in some roles but irritating as Wheelie). The animation is impressive throughout even if it does feel rather quaint now.Overall then a reasonably effective film for children and Transformer fans. The plot sees plenty going on while the animation is mostly very good. The pop music has dated it and takes away from the dark edge that it has. Not perfect then but considering some of the sh1t that benefits from 80's nostalgia cool, this is actually worth a look.

It is enjoyable to watch over and over. My only regrets are as follows. There is no transition from the series into the movie. How were the Decepticons able to finally take control of Cybertron (in the introduction), since in the series the Autobots prevailed in every episode? The movie opens with the valiant Autobots planning to retake Cybertron from the treacherous Decepticons. The series showed that the Autobots severed almost all ties with Cybertron and only the Decepticons sought to return with their energon fuel to revitalize the planet; that is why Shockwave remained as the sole Decepticon on Cybertron. Hence the question - Who is the aggressor here as the Decepticons' attack on the Autobots was preemptive to prevent the Autobots in their mission? (It was, however, sad to see some of these Autobots actually die, since in the episodes they would only get injured, but in the movie...., but this was symbolic, especially when evolution and change needs to be explained to a younger audience.) The fight between Megatron and Optimus could have been better. Megatron's wounds would not truly reflect the damage inflicted upon him. Furthermore, I never understood why the Decepticons retreated following the fight between Megatron and Optimus. I also never understood why the Decepticons alone never had the capability of eliminating Unicron; why only the Autobots, especially, since the Decepticons were willing to combine forces to overcome a common foe? If you can put some of these inconsistencies or intangibles aside (there are others), the movie is fantastic and I still enjoy watching it today.

I relate Transformers to everything that was good about my childhood. No matter how bad things were, I could always count on words of wisdom from Optimus Prime, some cynical remarks from Springer, and of course the usual self-serving antics from everybody's favorite backstabber Starscream. Each day I would come home from elementary school (I was probably 6 years old when the series debuted) turn on the television and be whisked away to the far off reaches of the galaxy.I regret that I wasn't able to see Transformers The Movie at the theater. Being from rural Kentucky we only had one cinema and unfortunately Transformers didn't draw enough interest to be shown on the big screen. I saw it several months later on VHS, but it was definitely worth the wait. The plot is fairly rudimentary (good vs. evil), but there is so much more to Transformers. It was definitely the cartoon for intelligent children. I never truly appreciated the complexity of the series until I got older. How many shows of this genre have dealt with topics such as death? The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots). I do believe that the death scenes hurt the overall success of the movie and the subsequent Season 3, but were very necessary elements to the film. I mean c'mon the Autobots and Decepticons were AT WAR! How many wars have ended without casualties? The series wasn't quite as graphic, but often times Optimus Prime was faced with very difficult decisions (Watch The Ultimate Doom for instance).The animation in the film is superb...as is the soundtrack. With the exception of Dare to Be Stupid there isn't a weak song in the movie. Leonard Nimoy pulls off an amazing voice characterization as Galvatron and I was also pleased as usual with Peter Cullen as Prime, the late Chris Latta as Starscream, and the legendary Frank Welker as Megatron (among others).The only quarrels I have with the movie would be the dance scene with the Junkions (while their friends are being gobbled up by a gigantic moon-gobbling planet), and the introduction of Blurr and Wheelie. In a perfect world they would have been fed to the Sharkticons ). The introduction of the matrix of leadership seemed to come out of thin air. It was never mentioned in the series, but seemed to be the Autobot Ark of the Covenant. I suppose it was always understood to be there and was just never mentioned.My Transformer biased nature aside, I think this movie is one that everybody should check out at least once. Whether or not you're a transfan it's still rather entertaining. I only hope the big budget live action version due out next summer will be half as good. 10/10 and worth owning on DVD!

The story and characters hold up well, and the animation is very well done. This was before computer animation took hold, so the fact that everything looks so good is saying a lot. What really struck me watching it today is the colors, the very bright 1980's colors that are stunning to look at, and the mechanical world of the backgrounds is stunning as well.Watching it now I can really pick out Judd Nelson's voice. Lionel Stander, the voice of Kup, has a very familiar voice, but I have not seen any other movies he's done. I suppose I recognize him from childhood as the voice of Kup. I can kind of pick out Orson Welles as Unicron, although it is not as clean as his voice usually is. Maybe the technology changed it or his age affected it. But who else could voice the larger-than-life figure of a monster planet. (insert your own Orson Welles weight joke here) I used to worship the soundtrack. Today the songs are cheesy even by 80's standards, but I still like them. The sound effects of the movie stand out as well. Mechanical robots, lasers, explosions, almost as detailed as sound for animation today. This is all more than a nostalgia trip, this movie is really good.

BLAM!","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" Make no mistake. This movie traumatized me. I mean, I must've been about eleven when this came out in the theaters and they start the movie off with an unflinching slaughter of many of the robots who were there at the beginning of the series. To top it off, Optimus Prime, beloved leader of the Autobots, gets murdered by his arch nemesis as well! I left the theater in a state of shock and while I didn't sob hysterically like others have admitted, I did have to hold the tears back.Watching the movie again recently, I was surprised at how much of the film still holds up, in terms of its sheer savagery. I mean, just having that slaughter of the Autobots at the beginning with Megatron shooting Ironhide point blank in the face with his bazooka is enough to make any 80's kid wince. I remember watching this and thinking, They didn't kill each other in the cartoons! What the hell is this? There are a few great moments in the film and the first half of the film is classic material with loads of action and some great fights between both factions. The voice over work is very well done with lots of celebrities contributing like Leonard Nimoy, Judd Nelson and Robert Stack, among others. The music is actually OK, considering that most of it is 80's hair metal. Lion's reworking of the Transformers theme is a nice rendition. I think the best thing I could say about the movie is that they really took advantage of the PG rating to deliver as much sadistic behavior between these robots as possible than they could with the TV series. They even said the word s**t at one point! Sadly, the movie has also become pretty dated and some of it is actually unbearable (The whole thing with the Junkicons dancing to Weird Al Yankovic's Dare to be Stupid is mind-boggling in how awful it is). The animation is clunky and several of the new characters (mainly the Autobots, though I loved Galvatron and his new cronies) that are introduced aren't terribly interesting, save for Unicron who I always found absolutely terrifying. Also, and this complaint goes back to when I first viewed it, we don't get to spend enough time with the old Autobots. The new guys were like I said before, not all that interesting.After the movie, I never really enjoyed Transformers as much as I did before then. Yeah, Optimus Prime came back at one point to retake leadership of the Autobots but I guess I just outgrew the whole thing. One thing I can say is that Starscream's death in the film made for an interesting little episode afterward where his ghost returned to possess a few of the Decepticons. My memory is a little hazy on that one but I remember it being pretty creepy.Naturally, I'd recommend this movie more for the kids than I would the adults. I think anyone over the age of eleven watching this for the first time would find this to be pretty cheesy. This one is definitely for the younger audience and I think it'd be a good idea to let the youth of today in on what classic after school entertainment was like twenty (has it already been that long?) years ago. For me, it's a nice throwback to my youth. Like I mentioned earlier, the movie hasn't aged very well but there are still plenty of things to enjoy about it.After all is said and done (and it makes me laugh to admit it), the scene where The Touch starts playing and Optimus Prime flies up into the sky, transforms into his robot self and proceeds to shoot down all the Decepticons in his way still gives me the chills.RATING ***1/2 out of *****.PS We might as well enjoy this before the live action version directed by Michael Bay comes out.

Admittedly, the dialogue seems cheesy now that I am older, but still it's not exactly the Transformers that younger children would expect.  It's level of violence is way over the top for a children's franchise, and there are some quite disturbing scenes, such as smoke pouring out of Ironhide's face as he gets killed and Transformers being digested inside Unicron.Speaking of Unicron, Orson Welles was perfect!  Unicron easily made me pee in my pants and tremble when I first saw him.The animation is typical 80's era, and at times spacecraft move around a little jerky (like in the introduction when Unicron approaches the first planet).  The music and atmosphere is reminiscent of Heavy Metal, which makes me wonder if the writers were inspired in some way by that film. The computer-like effects are really trippy, like the warp hole sequence near the beginning and the sequence when Megatron becomes Galvatron.The most surprising feature of this movie is the inclusion of two words of profanity.  The first occurrence is Spike saying Oh, Sh**!  What do we do now?, and the second is Ultra Magnus saying Open!  Dammit, open!!This is definitely Transformers the way I want to remember them.

Although their were some flaws, the movie itself was way ahead of it's time.  Since there is not much for me to say good that has not already been said , i'll try and focus on the little things I thought otherwise dissapointing.  First i think i'd like to list the flaws.1.)Why is devastator the only giant(gestalt) robot in the  film.  By the time the movie came out, the series had produced several other more popular giant(gestalt) robotsSuperion,bruticus,Menasor are just examples but there were more albeit powerful gestalts at that time.  Not to say I don't like devastator, because he was the first, and my alltime favorite so it's good to see him get credit in the movie, but for him to be the only gestalt in the movie was ridicoulous.  They could have at least thrown in his main rival Omega supreme(non-gestalt i think).  But instead we get to see him pick apart the dino-bots.  Like we have not seen that one before in the cartoon series.  Gestalts were the second coolest thing about the caroon series in general up to that point after Optimus Prime himself.  So for fans to get only the one gestalt who gets pummeled by rumble and frenzy later on in the movie is just retarded, and makes the movie look inconsistent just a tad bit.2.)The end of the movie was rushed.  I'll tell you why I know this. Unicron in his robot mode is a hell of a lot smaller than in his planet eating form. Several autobots are seen propelling themselves out of his right eye in the end.  A good comparison would be myself jumping out of the statue of liberty's right eye.  Mind you the statue of liberty is a giant statue standing on a very big planet earth.  If unicron is planetary(earth/cybertron) size why then can we see the autobots crashing through his eye?  They should big like microsized nothings to his eye.  At least that's what I think. Another problem is with the autobots in general attacking unicron from the outside.  The dinots breathe fire/laser beams on his butt, and he feels it, and tries to swat them in that area.  It's just not feasable to think a planetary sized unicron would feel anything like this at all.  Even at the age of 11 when I first saw the movie I was questioning this stuff.  The only explanation I can think of is that unicron like megatron can make himself larger in his non robot mode.  You notice in the cartoon series megatron could transform into a gun which could be big enough for a transformer to use, or if he wanted small enough for a human to use also.  This would clear things up about the whole unicron size issue for me at least.Well all in all it was a great great great animated film.  The best ever released in america to date.  Yes Yes it was even better than the lion king. I can say that with confidence since the animation at the time TTM came out was way ahead of it's time.  Lion king's animation was right on time for when it came out, but not wayyyy ahead.

The Transformers actually had the guts to take a wildly succcessful franchise and throw a total monkeywrench into it by killing many of the favorite characters and introducing all new ones.  It didn't prove to be a wildly successful strategy, but you've got to admire them for going for it instead of letting the whole thing go stale.The movie also had the courage to use profanity, feature fairly graphic deaths (for a kid's movie), and introduce one of the most terrifying and evil characters in animated history  Unicron.The Transformers movie surpasses the series in every way.  More colors, better animation, deeper story, more plot twists, and better voice acting.  In a world of ultra politically correct animation out there, Transformers is a perfect movie for 10-13 year old boys who are too old for Disney but not quite ready for rated R.

Considering I own 2 versions of The Movie on DVD, and with a new, 2-disc edition in the works, it must have something going for it, right?Sure it has. Although it bombed faster than a fundamentalist plane-hijacker on speed when it was released in cinemas, it was actually quite a succes on video. An odd 17 years later, the DVD's keep flying off the shelves. The fact that the Transformers franchise is once again enjoying big-time popularity nowadays has nothing to do with the some new kind of 1980's 'revival' going on(in fact, ever since 'Beast Wars' revitalised the whole franchise in oh.. 1996?) Transformers has enjoyed ever- increasing success as a toyline with a fine anime series to support it. The comics continue to sell through the roof.Anyway, on with the review. I've seen a lot of anime, and that includes most Miyazaki films, epics like 'Wings of Honneamise' and 'Grave of the Fireflies', and the 'Evangelion' series, all of which I consider cutting edge animation classics, regardless of genre (be it live- action or animation). This movie cannot seriously be considered a 'classic' film, it's somewhat silly in places, has some blatant animation errors, but more importantly it is too confined because of its content (in essence it's a 90- minute toy commercial). But, it's undeniable that this is an absolute cult- favorite.The Generation 1 cartoon series was certainly groundbreaking in that it revolutionised the storytelling for production-line animation (despite the occasional silly episode, a lot of serious themes were tackled, something pretty new to American network animation at that time..), and it had the most wonderful voicecast one could possibly hope for. So in that respect, the series was professionally handled, and thankfully this was carried over to The Movie. Yes, it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of plot, but the animation was top-notch at the time, and still holds up pretty well. The instrumental score by keyboard wiz Vince DiCola is great too, and fits the action/packed scenes like a glove. The acting is, as always, fantastic.The story is basically just a re-hash of the original StarWars movie, and somewhat weak, but there's so much going on that it does not really matter anyway. Character development is rather poorely handled, but for people familiar with the tv-series that shouldn't be too big of a problem. And, while some scenes are pretty neatly directed, like the Optimus/Megatron shredfest, which has a lot of pace, other scenes are less well-handled. But still, despite all the flaws and plotholes, it is one of the most rewatchtable movies I have ever seen, and has tons of memorable one-liners.

All the way through, awesome movie - but it just needed ten more minutes of explanation.  The biggest problem?  The complete and total lack of the mention of Primus.  That's where the biggest plot hole is Who is Unicron, where does he come from and why does he want to destroy Cybertron and the Matrix so badly?  The comic book deals with this better than the series ever did.  In fact, the comic book is best in most respects, as it didn't kill off mass quantities of transformers, although some seemed to just show up at random.  (Like Goldbug)  Anywho, for anyone who watches the movie, learn this about Unicron In the beginning of time, there were a whole bunch of Gods, and a lot of the weaker ones got killed.  Unicron lingered, though, and like most other gods, he was able to transform into a planet.  Well, he and Primus (another God) got into a huge fight until something momentous happened and they were torn apart.  At this point Primus transformed into his planet and Unicron into his.  Primus' planet? Cybertron.  (Makes it a whole lot easier to understand why Unicron is so angry at Cybertron, doesn't it?)  Anywho, Primus created the matrix and the autobots as a defense, while Unicron created the Decpeticons to do his bidding, which was to destroy the autobots so that Primus' defenses would be destroyed.  And instead of killing off all the cool autobots, they could have merely sent them to the center of Cybertron (where Primus' head lives) and made the autobots upgrade as Megatron did into Galvatron.  A lot easier, simpler to understand, and Ratchet and Windcharger don't just whirl off into space forever.  But, really, that's just how I wanted to see it done. Otherwise, this movie was possibly the greatest animated film of all time. Hell, it was.  Even if you dont love Transformers, give it a watch.

As you can see.And there are so many great scenes, played out perfectly as kids wanted to see them (and the scenes don't age), such as when Starscream says How does it feel, mighty Megatron? and then proceeds to kick his dying body and leave him to rot!  That's so excellent!  And it has Citizen Kane himself, yo, as Unicron!  How much better can you get?And the music?  It's absolutely perfect.  I own the soundtrack.  Yes, that's right.  I own it.  And love it -- except for one song, which most people probably skip too . . . too emotional.  This music out-metals Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 combined and heaped together with, well, almost any other movie soundtrack.Yeah, sure, maybe the animation isn't all that good, for the eighties or beyond, but who cares?  And sure there are plot holes aplenty, but, wha? Who cares?!  If you focus on these it's either in retrospect, and easily dismissed, or beacuse by hating the movie because of them you believe you can prove how cool you are.  And the violence -- well, life is violent, yo. And who doesn't love, somewhere in their soul, seeing Starscream take Megatron straight gangsta style and cap all those autobots?  Sure, maybe that whole 'execution' scene was a little much, but it sure left me knowing what to expect from the rest of the film. And the Sharkticon scenes (Guilty - or - innocent?  Innocent!)? And the entry of the Dinobots - who knew that the simple utterance of 'Excuse me' could be so thrilling?Know this -- though it might be a toy commercial, and an excuse to introduce a whole new line of toys, it never once treats kids as too dumb (look at recent movies, yo!  How do they treat their 'adult' audiences? Like the Core?  Come on now.) and if it has a fault in that, it sometimes treats them as too adult. And remember . . .

Featuring the star voices of such legends as Eric Idle of Monty Pythons Flying Circus, Orson Welles,director and star of Citizen Kane and Leonard Nimoy who plays Spock  Star Trek (TOS).  The movie has been re-released to coincide with the release of the television series now on DVD and the new television series that is being broadcast. Speaking as a fan of the television show, its about time!People who were there when it was first released and have been wanting the film can now get hold of it easily and people who don't know about the greatest of Transformers are now made aware.  And maybe I'm slightly biased towards this film because I'm a big fan of anime and cartoon series' but I think its great.It begins with the decepticons (bad guys) planning an all out attack on the autobots (good guys).  They battle and the leader of the autobots Optimus Prime is badly damaged but before he dies or shuts down, I'm not sure, his gives to his second in command the matrix, it is said that the matrix will light their darkest hour. But the decepticons are not the only force to be dealt with there is a planet sized enemy which devours all that stands in its way and its heading towards Cybertron, but with Megatron also under its power the planet is a force to be reckoned with. Transformers has a fantastic soundtrack, its cheesy but its good because of this it fits in with with the film and the themes of the film, (which is basically goodies have more heart and are better than baddies) perfectly, most of the songs are performed by Stan Bush whose vocal stlye again is perfect for the film. The animation is smooth and is the same as in the television series, more characters are introduced and the older characters developed or evolved, its a good length and offers everything you could ask for in a movie made of this now cult television series. If you remember the televion series from when you were a kid and you want to revisit your childhood its excellent or if you have kids and think that kids television shows were better when you were a nipper get it for your kids.  Also if you love big mechs or just want to watch a fun movie its all there for you, enjoy.

So, Optimus Prime and all the other OG transformers go to the big junkyard in the sky in this film, to make way for a new line of characters to fill toy store shelves at Christmas time.  G.I. Joe did the same thing around 1987, or so, when they introduced Serpentor and all the `Cobra-la' B.S.  Neither show, sadly, was really the same afterwards. Or, maybe I just got older and stopped watching cartoons.As for the plot, there really isn't one.  What story there is revolves around control of the Transformers' Matrix (What is the Matrix?  The movie never really explains.  It just looks like a big disco ball that rises up out of Optimus Prime's chest after he dies).  The movie mostly 90 minutes of non-stop action, set to a bunch of 80s background music, reminiscent of the rock music accompaniment in the classic animated movie `Heavy Metal.' However, Heavy Metal's soundtrack actually enhanced the film, while in the Transformers, the music just sucks.  Songs are included by Weird Al Yankovic and the classic `The Touch' (the original, however, not Dirk Diggler's version, although in some ways that would actually sound better).Overall, it's worth watching if you saw it as a kid.  The DVD is good quality, but doesn't have any extras worth noting.

Optimus Prime dying was such a sad moment, and it was represented very touchingly (the color fading, the music, daniel weeping on his dead body, ...) + the seemingly easy slaughter of key figures like Ratchet, Brawn, Prowl, Windcharger, ... was quite shocking (like the scene in the ark where Starscream pretty much blasts them so shreds with Megatron in gun-mode, and then seeing the smoke coming out of their mouths and eyes like with Ratchet). It's like a lot of people say the movie was pretty dark and tragic on some moments (what also 'got me' were the lines of transformers going over the boiling 'kettle' of some kind of plasma inside Unicron and then mercilessly being dropped in to feed Unicron's enormous hunger for energy). Apart from that the music was amazing ... makes you want to sing (or scream) along, just so rocking. Animation was superb (for its time) and definitely superior to all previous animated movies, and even to a lot of later animated movies. Unicron looked sooo cool, and the scenes where he eats planets like the moonbases, w00t!

That being said.. it's true, I'm partial.. but, hey, I'm also somewhat of an expert. Anyways, I'll try to keep my review as factual as I possibly can. But I'm not guaranteeing anything. The Transformers movie was unique in many ways. It had a major impact on toy-to-movie lines. More directly on the GI Joe movie, but also, for a movie based on a toy line, it stayed true to the idea that a movie about war is going to have some violence in it. So, the movie scores realism points. The movie also had very good animation for a mid eighties movie. Most assuredly superior to that of the Transformers cartoon. So that was a plus as well. Also, the movie featured a great caliber of actors. Leonard Nimoy, Judd Nelson, Robert Stack, Orson Welles, and the Not-quite-as-brave as Sir Lancelot, Eric Idle. All performed exceptionally, in my opinion. Another high point of this movie was that it stayed true to the Transformer toys... Many characters were included, and not so many were left out. However, one may wonder why there are characters from the 1984-85, and 1987 series of Transformers... what about the ArialBots and Predacons?! The reason behind this is that the 1987 characters in the Trans Movie were made for the movie, and the toys modeled after them. Like Blurr, HotRod, Kup and Galvatron. Since the movie was in production during 1985 to 1986, the majority of '86 characters were not included. Aside from leaving out the 1986 figures, much to the regret of many fans, lots of Decepticons and Autobots meet their fates in the movie. There is, however, a reason behind this. Hasbro.. the toy company who made both lines, had a major say in what characters to use(what toys to make) and what characters to kill off (i.e. older figures not available anymore, that's why Starscream gets it, Chris). It is also why Optimus Prime dies in the movie, which in itself made changes in the GI Joe movie. Duke, a main character in GI Joe, was supposed to be killed in their movie; however the Death of Optimus Prime had such a negative impact on the Transformer movie turnout that Hasbro and the movie producers quickly changed the end of GI Joe to make Duke live. Doesn't sound good that they killed off the characters for toys, I know, but the movies plot makes up for it. They're covered up and play into the realism of the war based movie. All and all the Transformers Movie is a great movie to take a look at. And between myself and all the other big screen + surround sound owners, buy the DVD. Go ahead... splurge, it's worth it... besides, you get to hear the human character Spike say a naughty word. Heck, if I were about to get eaten up by a giant monster planet, I'd probably say worse.

And seeing this movie now on DVD 16yrs later brings back a lot of memories. First I just want to say that this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. There was not one dull moment in this movie. From beginning to end, nothing but action. This movie had a lot of surprises and really deviated from the television series. The Decepticons were really powerful in this movie. The series usually portrayed them as weak but here in the movie they were a force to be reckoned with. Like wise with the Autobots in this movie, they seemed pretty weak. I found it interesting how Optimus Prime single handedly defeated all the Decepticons during the battle on the Autobot base on Earth. However, him dying was the biggest surprise of the the movie. It did occur to me that the Junkions could have repaired him just like they did Ultra magnus. Nevertheless, the scene was quite sad.I really would have liked to have known the origins of Unicron. I mean, he was never mentioned in the series. It was obvious that he himself was a transformer created by someone. Where did he come from? Why did he want to destroy the autobot matrix of leadership all of a sudden? I must say, him transforming was one of the high points in the movie. Later in the series they try to bring Unicron back with the floating head begging any drifters to get him a body. I think he even brought back Starscream who turns on him.Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. The soundtrack was awesome and I highly reccomend this movie.

Assuming it were technically possible, imagine being able to purchase a toy for your young male child that could trans-form from a car to a heavily armed robot and back again. And for the girlies? We could have a pony/bear/mobile kitchen/hairbrush that trans-forms into a robot - with lasers. Two toys in one - brilliant! And a surefire money spinner for a forward thinking toy manufacturer.Oh the film? Yes it was very good but I wouldn't recommend it for children. Too dark and tragic you see.

I always relate Transformers to everything that was good about my childhood. No matter how bad things were, I could always count on words of wisdom from Optimus Prime, some cynical remarks from Springer, and of course the usual self-serving antics from everybody's favorite backstabber Starscream. Each day I would come home from elementary school (I was probably 6 years old when the series debuted) turn on the television and be whisked away to the far off reaches of the galaxy.      I regret that I wasn't able to see Transformers The Movie at the theater. Being from rural Kentucky we only had one cinema and unfortunately Transformers didn't draw enough interest to be shown on the big screen. I saw it several months later on VHS, but it was definitely worth the wait. The plot is fairly rudimentary (good vs. evil), but there is so much more to Transformers. It was definitely the cartoon for intelligent children. I never truly appreciated the complexity of the series until I got older. How many shows of this genre have dealt with topics such as death? The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots). I do believe that the death scenes hurt the overall success of the movie and the subsequent Season 3, but we're very necessary elements to the film. I mean c'mon the Autobots and Decepticons were AT WAR! How many wars have ended without casulties? The series wasn't quite as graphic, but often times Optimus Prime was faced with very difficult decisions (Watch The Ultimate Doom for instance).     The animation in the film is superb...as is the soundtrack. With the exception of Dare to Be Stupid there isn't a weak song in the movie. Leonard Nimoy pulls off an amazing voice charactrization as Galvatron and I was also pleased as usual with Peter Cullen as Prime, the late Chris Latta as Starscream, and the legendary Frank Welker as Megatron (among others).     The only quarrels I have with the movie would be the dance scene with the Junkions (while their friends are being gobbled up by a gigantic moon-gobbling planet), and the introduction of Blurr and Wheelie. In a perfect world they would have been fed to the Sharkticons ). The introduction of the matrix of leadership seemed to come out of thin air. It was never mentioned in the series, but seemed to be the Autobot Ark of the Covenant. I suppose it was always understood to be there and was just never mentioned.     My Transformer biased nature aside, I think this movie is one that everybody should check out at least once.

First thing I have to say is that this is an odd movie.  I say this because it was obviously made for Transformer fans, yet they kill off most of the major characters in the TV show.  Although, in some cases this is a good thing (I was happy to see Starscream go).This movie isn't any kind of major animation feat, but it's still cool, and a bit better than the TV show.  I kind of doubt anyone is watching this movie for animation value anyway.  Even so, there are some really cool things to see in the film, and some really detailed scenes that have some awesome animation.As for story-line, it is actually pretty good.  A little bizarre with the whole Matrix of Leadership deal, and it really isn't explained very well, but c'mon, it's Transformers.  The characters are well done as well.  I was very glad to see Grimlock and most of the other dino-bots in the film. ...And while I'm talking about Dino-bots...Where was Snarl (Stegosaurus)?  They had Grimlock, Slag, Sludge, and Swoop, but no Snarl!  What was the deal with that?One major problem I had with the film is the soundtrack.  I'm sure it was cool at the time, but I think it would have been better if they just had some original score.  Also, why oh why did they put a Weird Al Yankovic song in there (Dare To Be Stupid)?  I like Weird Al, he's got some really funny music, and I think he's very talented, but that song just doesn't belong in there.There really isn't a whole lot else to say about the movie.  It's a great movie for a true fan of the Transformers.  Hopefully even a non-fan would appreciate it.

I am not going to give any spoilers.  I am only going to talk about the way this movie makes me feel. Back in the early to mid eighties, I was the biggest Transformers fan there was.  I still am.  I watched the series. I collected what toys I could, (being very poor). And I lived Transformers.  Every episode, I was there, glued to the tv.  Optimus Prime was always my favorite.Well, I regret not being able to see this in theaters(because of the aforementioned poverty) and for many years I had all but forgotten about Transformers.  When I was in college however, one of my friends brought it over, and there we were, about seven college guys, glued to the screen, talking and reminiscing about being little kids again.  Since then, I have fallen in love with the Transformers all over again. Sure, the movie had it's flaws, but they were endearing ones. ^Alert! Possible spoiler here^ (guess I will give one, but if you have read any of the previous comments, you probably know this already)  When Optimus Prime dies, I cry.  Every time.  I don't personally think that he should have died, but maybe that's cause I'm biased. Other people have said this, but it bear repeating.  This is better than anything today.  I don't consider this Anime.  I have nothing against anime, but it gets really stupid when people fall over if someone says something to them.  And huge sweatdrops?  c'mon.  But this movie doesn't have that.  This is just action, humor, and amazing things in it.  This is one of only a handful of movies that I consider magic.  That may sound weird, but try to follow me.  I think that if a movie elicits as much feeling and emotion as this one does for me, then it can qualify as magic. Every time I see the movie, I am living in the Transformers universe, and I am a six year-old again.  Today's cartoons, with all their anime elements, and focus on less violence/more childish things, just can't hold a candle to the Transformers.  GI Joe came close, but nothing beats the Transformers. I get shivers when Optimus Prime says Autobots, Transform, and roll out!.Anyway, I doubt that anyone will read this, but If so, Transformers the Movie is my favorite movie of all time.

After reading numerous reviews of the movie, I became interested in seeing it.  When I bought a DVD Player, this was the first movie I popped in.  Let me say, I was not dissapointed.  This was a terrific movie. The movie itself focuses on the never-ending battle between the Autobots and the Deceptacons with a new menace thown in.  The movie starts out with Unicron (the new menace) eating up a nearby planet.  After the movies credits end, we see Laserbeak flying by into the autobots headquarters. Then were introduced to ole Optimus Prime himself.  He has a couple of Autobots make a run to earth to get som energon.  Cut to the Decepacons who find out about the plan.  After that, Megatron and the other Deceptacons begin an all-out attack.  This is where were're introduced to many of the new 'bots, like Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, and the annoying Wheelie (who shows up later).  Things get so bad they call Prime for help.  He finnaly arrives, mows down a couple of Deceptacons and has a kick-a** one on one deul with Megatron.  Both warriors are severly wounded and the deceptacons retreat. Meanwhile Optimus is on his death bed and passes the Matrix of leadership to Ultra Magnus.  Then Prime tearfully passes away.  Meanwhile Starscream gets rid of Megatron along with some other wounded Deceptacons.  Soon after Unicron finds Megatron and Co. and gives them new bodies.  Now called Galvatron, he Immediatly goes back to Cyberton and destroys Starscream. Unicron proceeds to swollow up the Moon Bases along with Jazz (my favorite Transformer), Cliffjmper, Bumblebee, and Spike (using the famous S word). Back on Earth the other Autobots decide to go after Unicron while being chased by Galvatron and the oter Deceptacons.  The rest is all history. Let me just say although I liked the movie what I didn't like was how they killed off a lot of the original Autobots (Ironhide, Brawn, ect.).  The New Autobots aren't as good as the originals.  Plus Megatron was a much better leader than Galvatron.  I also din't like Spike's annoying son Daniel. Aside from the flaws, this is still one of my favorite movies and I have no regrets buying it.

This time I'm not writing about superb battles to the death, the awesome sound track or beautiful animation (for 1986).  It struck me recently how much this movie parallels the story of Jesus Christ.  Most movies have such a parallel (i.e. Neo as the prophecied saviour who returns from the dead in The Matrix or Qui-Gon Jinn as John the Baptist who paved the way for young Anakin as Jesus as Roger Ebert noted about Star Wars The Phantom Menace) but this movie takes it farther than most.The Autobots believe that when they die they go to a sort of robot heaven inside a device known as the Matrix.  Throughout the movie they repeat the phrase, Til all are one, referring to the day when they will all be together, though whether it will be in a corporeal paradise or the spiritual plane of the Matrix is unclear.Optimus Prime represents Jesus.  He is the perfect soul who dies for the Autobots' salvation.  Following his death he transforms Hot Rod into Rodimus Prime who will serve as the Holy Spirit he leaves behind.  Unicron's arrival represents the final battle between the heavenly hosts and the servants of the Devil.  Even the theme song calls it the Judgement Day.  Eventually, as must always be the case, good triumphs over evil thanks to the supernatural (divine) intervention of Optimus Prime who now exists only as a spirit rather than in a physical body.As I say, you can usually draw this sort of parallel with movies because Christianity has the greatest influence on our thinking when it comes to stories about good vs. evil in Western society, but the spiritual parallels to Heaven and even the Holy Spirit take this parallel farther than I have noticed in any other work of science fiction.Just food for thought.  This really isn't a religious movie despite what I've said.  It's a guy movie.  If you like Battle Bots and Robot Wars then get this movie, sit back and have a blast watching living robots blast each other to kingdom come in the original and timeless classic The Transformers.

Maybe I'm wrong, I honestly can't say because I don't know what it's like to be on the other side of the looking glass on this one.The plot is basically this It begins with the Autobots(the good guys) planning to retake their home planet of Cybertron from the evil Decepticons. Meanwhile, the 'Cons are planning to attach Autobot city on Earth and destroy them forever. So ensues a enormous battle, with fatal results to the leaders of both sides. Optimus dies and passes the matrix of leadership to Ultra Magnus. But is he the chosen one? It couldn't be that impulsive little twerp Hot Rod, could it? hmm..Anyway, little do they know at the time that a huge planet called Unicron is scouring the galaxy, eating other planets to sustain itself. We don't know where it comes from (unless you watched the post-movie cartoon episode Call of the Primitives), but apparently the only thing that can stand in his way is the Autobot matrix of leadership. He recruits the near-death Decepticon leader Megatron to seek and destroy the matrix (not to mention gives him a brand-spanking new body and calls him Galvatron...New toy promotion for Hasbro, woohoo!) Does this interest you? if yes, and you haven't seen it, go rent it, I won't tell you anymore. If no, then I need not say anymore )The characters, voiced by famous actors such as Judd Nelson (Hot Rod), Leonard Nimoy(Galvatron), Robert Stack(Ultra Magnus), Orson Wells(Unicron) and Eric Idle (Wreck-Gar) are fairly well defined and rather charismatic. It would be nice to have an extra hour or so to explain some stuff, like why the heck do the Quintessons execute people even though they find them innocent? What were their crimes? We never do find out exactly, until the post-movie cartoons(sort of). Then there's the sad fact that the definitive Autobot leader Optimus Prime dies early on in the movie.

He-Man cartoons do the same to a degree, and so does cartoons from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.But Transformers cartoons never did such a thing.  They presented a story in a way that now, as adults, we can still watch and enjoy with the same vigor that we watched with in our youth, and that's because that Transformers isn't a cartoon that has dated itself to the point that it screams 1980's, and it doesn't talk down to its audience.  The characters are multi-dimensional, and they react to each other in intelligent ways.And the movie itself goes beyond anything that the cartoon ever did.  It introduced new characters in a reasonable manner, and it even included the reality of death and rebirth, coupled with a need for facing responsibility, factors so often left out of children's entertainment.  These characters were presented so realistically, that I did feel a sense of loss when Optimus Prime died, and my sister even cried a little (and she's older than I am).It doesn't happen often that a cartoon becomes presented on the big screen, and it works as its own entity, rather than a ninety minute episode of its source.

Im speaking of the series Star Trek.This is the same concept with The Transformers.  This ,much like Star Trek, was a sci-fi show that was influneced by the cold war.  Most non-fans dont understand this.  The the concept was ripe for a film, unfortunately, there should have been a extra six months to a year for promotion and post-production.WARNING MAJOR SOPILER ALARTThe film takes off where the show leaves behind.  It's the year 2005.  The Decepticons reclaim Cybertron and the Autobots have warmed up their welcome with the human population on earth.  The biggest battle in the civil war between Autobots and Decepticons is underway when the unstoppable ,planet eating robot Unicron makes his way through the galaxy.  Unicron is a physical representation of all the original sin, namly greed, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath ,envy and lust.  He is just this relentless eating machine.  There is only one thing that can stop Unicron, and the Autobots have it.  So Unicron manipulates the leader of the Decepticons to seek out and destory this mysterious force.This is probably the only film that neatly blends Japannamie art with American style story telling and voicing.  The action sequences are exciting, the musical score is ahead of it's time and the story (in light of it's weak plot structure and lifted themes) is good. The cast is top notch.  Judd Nelson (Hot Rod)plays his most heroic character to date.  Leonard Nimoy (Galvatron) out-does himself at the antonym of Mr.Spock and Orsen Welles (Unicron) is perfect in his final performance.This film suffers from some fatal mistakes.  All the original characters are killed off in the first 10 mins of the movie. The producers were making it obvious that they wanted to sell new toys. The film lost touch with it's fan-base, being too violent for the under 13 and to kidy for the over 13.  Much of the film plays a little too loud at times.  I will say that carrying a continuing story from a current series to the big screen (EX. The X-files) is the most difficult to do.  You have to update the new fan in a brief crash course while you please the die-hard fans by going the next level.I had the honor of seeing this film on the big screen.  I was an under-rated experience seeing all the dazzaling animated specticals on the screen.All in all I give this film a good rating, being a worth attempt at a movie experience.  The film is much more enjoyable to be seen on the big screen though, rather then on DVD.

Transformers The Movie is NOT a cinematic masterpiece, but is still a damn good movie at that. The voice acting consists of stars from the 70's and 80's (Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Stack (Eliot Ness from The Untouchables), Orsen Welles (his last movie, I hope he died content), the ultimate Pythonite Eric Idle, John Mischitta, among others.). The music is quirky but manages to match the scene well, in the fact that it's a mix of techno-synthesized instrumentals and 80's rock music. The animation is actually high quality and goes pretty deep in detail.WARNING!! SPOILERS DOWN HERE!!! DON'T READ IF YOU WANT TO STILL ENJOY THE MOVIE!!!!     Transformers The Movie has two low points that I can think of. The first being that most (if not all) of the classic Autobots, such as Ironhide, Wheeljack, Ratchet, Prowl, Brawn, and Optimus Prime, and are replaced by new characters. Unfortunately, the writers didn't think they the fans would MISS the Autobots. The other low point sticking out in my mind is how bland the newer characters are. Ultra Magnus (Magnus is Latin for great. Ultra Great???? What were they thinking?) is the Optimus wannabe, Kup is the veteran who is more intent on telling war stories than fighting for his cause (I thought all the Transformers were created around the same time.), Arcee is the only female Transformer (do robots have gender?), Blur is funny, albeit annoying as you can't understand a word he says, Wreck-Gar speaks only in messed up television quotes, Hot Rod is the only Autobot I've seen that acts like a teenager. Perceptor is a nerd. And Blaster is the only decent one.          Actually, my complaints seem to have taken up more room than my plusses for the movie, but that was because I was reiterating my points. The movie, overall is real good, despite the problems with the new characters, and I suggest this for fans of the Transformers, or people with weird interests.

The battle of Autobot City culminating in the death of Optimus Prime and 2.) The introduction of a whole new generation of characters. The producers have done an excellent job of taking the TV series and making a full length feature out of it, and when I say it is inspirational, I mean just that. It's just simple good vs. evil, two absolutes. You're on one side, or the other. The animation is brilliant, and the music just fits in so well its amazing. Vince Dicola's instrumental pieces really capture the feeling of the scene, and Stan Bush's The Touch & Dare really do inspire.Back to the movie, and I think the best thing about it, which is also its only downfall, was the death of so many well-known characters - Ironhide, Wheeljack etc. and of course Optimus Prime. This lead the way for a whole new generation, which I personally loved. Suddenly the series got so much darker, more serious and definately more cooler. But it wasn't what people wanted, and the series was cancelled. The movie does an excellent job of integrating the newcomers- Hot Rod, Kup, Ultramagnus, Galvatron, Cyclonus- and the whole thing is just fun besides. I mean the idea of battling a monster planet which transformers into an absolutely monstrous robot is so cool!Top scenes would include the Battle at Autobot city (5 mins into the film) Galvatron and Hot Rod's battle inside Unicron (when Hot Rod opens the Matrix!) and Hot Rod and Kup before the Quintesson judges.An excellent movie, and definately one of my all time favourites!

I was also into the cold war attitude that was going around at the time.  While our society had good guys and bad guys (us good; Soviets bad), it became easier to get into the series for reasons like seeing good triumph over evil.  I didn't get to see the movie until ten years after it came out and I had seen the series take it's final bows long before.  I had heard that all of the characters that I had taken great pains to know for those years had all been blown apart in a few short minutes of air time. Upon seeing the movie, I wept inside as a long past era of television joy came to a shattering end in those few short minutes.  The great thing about the old characters is that they had a connection with Earth and people.  It made them transforming into Earth vehicles all that much more fun too because we could relate to playing with cars, jets, etc. or seeing animals. The new show was just too spacey (for obvious reasons).  The connection was lost.  The only thing I liked about the new show was the introduction of female autobots.  All women should be allowed to fight and autobots needed girlfriends anyway.  But, in the end, a sad way to see all of my old TV friends go which completely spoiled what was an underwhelming movie in my opinion anyway.

I had seen the episode of the TV show where Optimus Prime is resurrected before I saw the film, so I wasn't really too shocked when he kicks the bucket here.  But I am sure that if I had seen the film before that, I would have been in tears. I wish that they had kept Leonard Nimoy on to do Galvatron's voice in the TV show because he's excellent here!  No offence intended towards Frank Welker who voiced Galvatron in the TV show (who is one of the hardest working voice artists in the world), but Nimoy is really menacing.  MONTY PYTHON's Eric Idle is very funny as the TV-jargon spouting Wreck-Gar.  The voices are all very well done.  Even better is the music score, especially the songs.  My favourites are THE TOUCH by Stan Bush (which was used again in the TV show in the aforementioned resurrection episode) and DARE TO BE STUPID by Weird Al Yankovic.

The cartoon series was bright and full of friendly characters and no deaths ever occured, the movie however was very different. In the first half hour, we witness most of the main heroes and villans killed and introduced to new characters to set up a base for the new cartoon series set after the movie. In a nutshell, this is a dark, action packed cartoon that has excellent animation and superb fight sequences that should not be taken to seriously after all, it's only a movie.

This has to be one of my all-time favourites, no animated movie will ever surpass this movie to me.(Spoils the first half of the movie for some readers, so dont read on if you havent seen the movie)The movie starts off quick with a few cartoon regulars flashing up here and there and the intro to Unicron - the planet sized transformer. Then for probably the first time you see ironhide and other autobots get blown to bits, I couldn't beleive the shock I got when I saw this as a kid, totally awesome. Then with a war brewing between the autobots and the decepticons on Earth, the ultimate show-down between Megatron and Optimus Prime was an over whelming scene, starting with the classic song The touch by Stan Bush, which really captures the moment, then as the battle duels on both men fall to which I still cant beleive happens.Then the matrix - life force for the autobots has been passed on to Ultra magnus and the autobots flee. You see many autobots that have fallen during the battle, original characters such as wheeljack and cliffjumper. For the decepticons megatron is left for dead and starscream takes control (something he has always wanted to do since the first episode).from there the movie introduces many new characters for the series to continue with, my favourite being Rodimus Prime who has the matrix passed on to him by Galvatron and shows the Optimus Prime like courage, also Judd Nelson who plays Rodimus' voice to perfection and really makes a change when Hot Rod makes the change.The story and production of the movie is great, and leaves the series for dead, and also changes the tv series forever.So if you havent seen this movie then I suggest you take a look because most animated movies  made these days dont even compete.

I would have liked to see the scenes that were cut put in as extras on the DVD for one.  Another extra I would have liked to see on the DVD is the addition of the biographies of the Autobots and Decepticons who were killed.

I broke down and picked up the DVD version, and this time around, I found something that I hadn't noticed before....The movie has no plot.Other than a need for the Autobots to reclaim Cybertron from the Decepticons (which was the recurring theme in the television series), this movie was nothing more than a fight scene, then a breather, then a fight scene, and then another breather.  Repeat until credits roll, sprinkle in some '80's big hair metal.But the movie's a great ride to watch.Call me sentimental, but it's like visiting old friends again.  The numerous fight scenes had some cool visual tricks, and the music (especially the two main theme songs) fit the movie well.  I think the biggest shock of the movie was the fact that, after numerous episodes where both Autobot and Decepticon could blow each other to pieces, and then be standing by the end of the episode, this film actually had the characters die (or go off line, or whatever it is robots do.)  By far, the scene that carried the most impact (and surprisingly still does), is *minor spoiler, but if you don't know this one, where have you been?* the death of Optimus Prime.  The scene was handled well, with the characters focusing on the loss of their friend and leader, and not some overdramatic stomping around swearing revenge on their enemies.  It kept a respectful credibility to what Optimus Prime meant to kids who watched that show.  Too bad the reality of the situation was to just clear out the old characters to make way for the new toys.The DVD version is great, with a lot of crisp visuals.  I wish the audio had been better, and I would have liked to have seen it letterboxed and with more special features, such as deleted scenes.  It's not really so much of a kids movie.  They only know Beast Wars now.  This should have given more to the fans, which are in the 20+ crowd, and would have appreciated all the extras.All in all, the movie, despite it's lack of an in-depth or original story, is entertaining, and definitely worth the price for the nostalgia trip that kicks in as you watch it.  A cult classic.

I am now 22 and I love this film just as much as I did when I first saw it in the movies years ago. The film takes place in 2005, where the Decepticons, led by Megatron have taken over Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers. Optimus Prime and the Autobots plans to take back Cybertron but little do they know a planet eating machine named Unicron is heading their way which might force them to put aside their differences and fight together to save the galaxy. That is pretty much the main plot. There is not one single boring moment in this film. It's action from start to finish. Granted, this movie is violent. There are deaths. In the first 10 minutes we see several of our favorite characters get blasted away. Now to a 6 year old, this is kind of traumatic, but for all intensive purposes, this was to make way for the new toys being developed. Also, the death of a certain autobot (I won't give it away just in case people have not seen the movie) definitely disturbed me when I was younger! I actually cried the the movies. I could understand why this movie was rated PG. Anyway, we have a talented cast who gave the robots life such as Eric Idle, Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy and Orson Wells and some great moments in the film the attack on Autobot City, the creation of Galvatron and his troops and the transformation of Unicron/attack on Cybertron. This might not be a film for non-Trans fans but nevertheless, it is an excellent film, not only for the animation of the time but for the cast and the action it has. If you have not seen it, rent it.

Then, something remarkable happened. I got a sense, a vague idea even, of what someone you know dying was like. No more. Finito. The movie then hit home with the idea that revenge wasnt necessary. No one shook their fists or vowed to slaughter every last Decepticreep. Now thats what i call moral values.It is possible to complain about too much violence in this movie but i dont see how. Violence is only bad in movies when you dont see the consequences. Prime got seven shades of something-i'm-not-allowed-to-mention out of him. He dies in hospital.

Firstly the bad points1) The annoying Narration during the STAR WARSesque intro. (Sounds like Popeye the sailor trying to impersonate the bogey man)2) The fairly irrelevant and over the top  soundtrack that seems to pop up (with singing) during the fight scenes.3) No apparent plot just over extended fight scenes.4) Just when you thought Spike was annoying along comes Spike Junior.5) Eric Idle's character was very hard to understand.6) We are treated to Optimus Prime's death and funeral only to be told by the Narrator at the end of the film that He will return.7) Not enough time was given to the old  characters. Only the new characters seem to get  all the dialogue. (At least Hound and Jazz did not get killed off like the others)And the good points1) The Animation and sound FX are excellent.2) The Fight scenes (although numerous) are very well staged.3) The Death of Prime adds an overtone of tragedy to the film.4) Some great scenes of violence and horror such as Megatron's execution of Ironhide. Decepticons killing their wounded in their bid to escape. Apparently one of the wounded (Thundercracker)  reappears later on in the film. strange!! 5) The cast are very good particularly Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron who denotes the complexity of the  character.Overall the film would have been better if more time was spent explaining Unicron. (It would have been interesting if they scripted him as some mechanical God who created  the transformers but who now wants to destroy his creation).It would also have been better if Unicron  had an army of his own that the Autobots  and Decepticons could unite and fight against.  This would have added an interesting twist  to the movie's plotThey should not have bothered with the Conversion of  Hot Rod to Rodimus Prime plot device. They should have just let Ultra Magnus lead the Autobots full stop. Magnus's lack of self confidence seems to add an interesting dimension to his character.After reading some of the other passionate reviews of this film it might be a good idea if the Transfans lobby Lucasfilm and Industrial & magic to  try make a big budget Live action Transformers film  (with CGI Autobots & Decepticons). ILM would see it as a chance to further develop their CGI effects since George Lucas runs the company as a non profit organisation. It wouldn't too hard for ILM to do this as George Lucas seemed to have based the  Trade Federation Droid Army from Episode 1 on the Transformers. (Such as Robot ships that walk around, Giant wheels that transform into robot killing machines) What does anyone else think of this idea?

I expected something magnificent for the theatrical release, something with more quality, with more action.  I didn't expect the murder of the characters I loved!  I mean, the Pokemon movie didn't kill Pikachu!  This was unnecessary.  The deaths were instant and painful, a little heavy for kids (boobs are bad but murder is fine?).  Here I am ready to watch Ironside kick ass on the big screen, just to watch him get shot and die.  What the hell?Now I know why this movie was made.  Everyone who was going to buy the old toys already bought them.  People may not be interested in the newer toys if they already had a collection of solid Transformers.  The solution kill them off and offer more. Son  Mom, I need a new Transformer. Mom  You have enough, play with the ones you have! Son  I can't - they're dead.  They were killed.What kid wants to play with toys that are outdated?How does the decepticon army (of what, 7?) so easily defeat the autobot army (probably of about 7)?  I mean, if it was that easy, how come it didn't happen before?  I guess because kids are too dumb to notice (sarcasm).I liked the soundtrack though - it was so bad, it was good.  You got the touch...  The weird al song didn't quite fit though - talking about Mr. Whipple squeezing Charmin toilet paper while the Autobots are being attacked.  Strange.It's my opinion that this movie killed the Transformers series.  The new characters, and the slaughter of the others, was too much for the kids.

As a youngster, I adored the toys as well as the TV show which my friend and I hurried home from school every day to watch. This was really the first instance of a major action based animated motion picture following a well-written script. It was a precursor to things like Titan A.E., and the huge Anime boom here in the US (although Anime had been around for years in Japan.) It was a film that stirred the imaginations of boys (and some girls) everywhere, opened doors to allow Japanese Anime into the mainstream (at least more than it had been), and employed some highly respected actors for the voice overs. Cynics can pick it to pieces today, but in its day it was a true pioneer of Anime-adventure/action films, and remains as an all around excellent film. "}{"Title":"More Than Meets the Eye?

Believe me when I tell you that this is the best movie that could have possibly been made about the Transformers.  The animation's passable and the dialogue is often juvenile, but everything else is so white-knuckle and kinetic that you get swept up in it in spite of your best efforts to remain cool and adult.  It blew me away as a kid that the characters swore and killed each other; it blows me away now that an American animation studio was able to make this kind of movie about a children's toy line and get it released in theaters.  All the death and destruction psyched me up, and I was always really grateful that the filmmakers weren't trying to sugarcoat the struggle like they did on the television show (which was always kind of lame, to be perfectly heinous with you).  Only other cartoon I remember doing that was ROBOTECH (and, to an extent, VOLTRON).Not without its flaws it needed to be longer, to flesh out the story and characters more--most of the killing gets done in the first thirty minutes, without establishing who's really dying except for Optimus Prime and Ironhide (none of the other doomed characters even have dialogue).  Hot Rod's ascension to leader seems arbitrary, following the hoary old chosen one/HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES blueprint, even though there doesn't seem to be anything THAT special about him anywhere else in the movie (in his defense, though--maybe this is a good time for a SPOILER WARNING--it's not fair to say he gets Prime killed.  Megatron was reaching for a gun to kill Optimus anyway, Optimus was just standing there lecturing Megatron, it was a pressure situation.  He should have just screamed Hey! He's got a gun! but hell, he's an impulsive kid who made the wrong choice).  And Rodimus Prime is a blood-stoppingly stupid name, anyway.  Some of the songs on the soundtrack--I'm thinking mainly of Stan Bush here--are completely insipid, even for their era.Still.

I didn't know what to expect, but it sure wasn't to see almost the entire old guard get blown away. Even as I looked on aghast at this shocking development, I marveled at the power displayed on the screen as well as the moxie involved in offing afternoon cartoon characters (though, cynically, I would have to submit that this was done, at least partly, to make way for a host of new characters; I guess they felt they needed to cull the herd). No other kiddie cartoon genre that I know of has done this (well, I haven't seen the GI Joe movie; anybody die in that?). The fact that they are robots may have made it easier, but those robots had more personality than most human cartoon characters. It was hard to see them go, especially Ironhide who, in a final, pathetic bid to stop Megatron gets a blast in the face for his troubles...Especially that is until the next rude slap in the face (I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way) the death of Optimus Prime. I couldn't believe it. If I was aghast before at the deaths of Prowl, Wheeljack, et al, I was mortified now. I just couldn't wrap my mind around it. I kept thinking they had to bring him back before the end of the movie, but somehow knew it wouldn't happen.At the same time, I thought this was awesome. Here was some more of that aforementioned maturity regarding cartoon characters. You just don't see this kind of thing happening in children's genres, before or even since (for all the violence depicted in Dragonball Z, does anyone ever get killed or even seriously bruised?). This was nothing less than epic storytelling...Or would be if it weren't for one thing Hot Rod. Here's a guy who is at least partly responsible for the death of Prime. Rightly, he should have been dismantled or at least incarcerated for interfering with Prime's justice and thereby helping bring out his demise. And if I were him, I would be torn by guilt; I mean it would have been a big issue and should have been in the movie, but wasn't; HR just doesn't seem all that broken up about Prime's death. No, instead of punishing or resenting Hot Rod for his impetuousness, or Hot Rod feeling torn up about it, he's made into a leader. And what do they call this fearless new leader?None other than Rodimus Prime. Say it again. RODIMUS PRIME. Turn it over and over again in your head and you can't help but reach the conclusion that it's and INTENSELY STUPID NAME. Optimus Prime; now that means something. Loosely, it's something like Best Leader or the like. What the hell does Rodimus Prime mean? All those cool developments I touted before seemed to come crashing down like a house of cards and OP suddenly seemed to have died in vain. This is a real blemish on the movie for me. It could have been great, but thanks to Hot Rod and whoever thought of Rodimus Prime, it wasn't. Whoever did think of Rodimus Prime should be made to dissemble, then reassemble the Rodimus Prime action figure till the end of his days.I guess I've gotten too much into this already, but I don't regard this movie as great as others seem to. I see it as a nostalgia kick and I still dig the mythology. The animation is cool, too, though not as even as it first appeared. This is largely a cult film and I suspect it has the status it has because it was the only Transformers film ever made. I'll probably still get it on DVD (eventually) despite all my gripes about it.

Those who watched the show religiously (if not, why'd you see the movie?) will also love the crucial events that  unfold in the Transformers world. The death of Prime, the passing of the torch so to speak. Old characters featured continuously in the series who had laser blasts merely damage them or knock them around have their carcasses horribly torn to shreds, another example of a more adult way to address things. Also a good experience is the soundtrack, both instrumental and the songs which greatly heighten the scenes effects. So to summarise, when making this movie, the companies may have only had dollar signs in thier heads, but for those of us who grew up with these characters, this gave gave us an enjoyable movie and another chapter in a great story.

The thing that pisses me off is Hasbro's lame attempt on making a Transformer movie.  Dont get me wrong it was great.  However, the record needs to be set strait.  AFter watching the movie a thousand times, evaluating it, memorizing it.  I have come up with some conclusions.  One everyone thinks the animation is great. Well I disagree, some of the cells are beautiful but alot are not.  Just watch the movie, espcially the Optimus/Megatron fight.  In one cell Megatron is done with amazing detail and in the next shot i thought i was watching the old t.v. show.  Surely they could have spent more time fixing that garbage but they had a deadline.  My theory suggests that the movie had to come out right before the toy and since the toy was more important, time on the movie was sacraficed.  Two, it was a commercial, i mean Optimus gets like no air time whatsoever he's there he's dead.  I mean sure the screenwriter had to do it that way.  By plot point 2 the main character needs to be established and how can Hot Rod be the main character with Optimus around.  But, if Hasbro hadnt used it as a commercial, i bet Optimus would have made it to the end.  Or at least made more than a cameo death. Heck they brought him back anyway.  3rd, the ease of the old characters death, then after they are destroyed the new characters are practically invincible...what a plot hole, certainly Optimus could have done a better job than Hot Rod anyday, but unfortunately he just gets smacked around like he was a loser for all those years.  And then when Ultra Magnus eats it, the screen writer just has him brought back like he wasnt even scratched, I mean if it was just that easy to fix somebody they should have brought everybody back and finished this war a long time ago.  Another seriously idiotic excuse for keeping the new line of toys intact, if they were going to bring him back like that they shouldnt have killed the man in the first place. Concerning Hasbro, the bottom line is this.  They did well with the toys but they should have let the professionals handle the movie.  I mean the shadow they cast over the movie only hurt it.  Now after i have pretty much made Hasbro look like amature film makers, let me talk about what made it a good movie.  First was the realism, death...destruction, finally an animated movie with a attitude.  If Disney moives were bad like this i would watch them everday.  Vince Dicola busted some serious instrumentals and even though the songs were a tad corny they were loaded with inspiring motivation, but of course Hasbro didnt make the music, no wonder it was good.  The new characters were actually preatty darn cool.  They stood out against each other and each had their own syle.  The one-liners were great, which i might add was the one thing i thought the screen writer did well with.Alot of people think that transformer fans are dying off.  I disagree. i think that everyone who liked transformers has a place in their heart for them, but Hasbro continues to make that place harder and harder to find. They are a toy company but i feel they have too much leverage over the media portion of trasformers.  I think a Prequel dating before the original show should be made.  I think this seqel should be void of any Hasbro influence and should be made with more violence, drama, and geared more toward adults than even the first one.  I say this for the simple fact that trasformers was too popular to just die as easy as it did.  it was like right after the movie came out, trasformers deteriorated, not because we all grew up but because Hasbro kept it a kids program.  Trasformers in their nature were a violent lifelike creation.  I mean Hasbro bought them from someone in Japan who are known for violent cartoons.  If transformers came back to the big screen violent and bad ass, poeple would go see it. Adults would take their kids to show them what daddy used to watch.  And moral groups would hate the movie and we would all laugh at them as we got our money's worth. Unfortunatley however, if the first one hadnt bombed...All Hasbro's fault...A sequel would have already been made.  Many have tried to offer a script but no one will buy it.  But as i sit here typing, i am on a mission to do so.  The problem lies in the fact that most people who make the script are just starting out.  We need a man way up on the film food chain to come up with one and if no one has the gutts then let that man be me....Adam Arnold...one filmmaker not afraid to reach back into his child hood and bring out what should have ben done years before...Adam "},{"Title":"Before DragonballZ, before Poke'mon, There were TRANSFORMERS!","Date":"5 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":"  I've got 1000 words to say that something changed my life forever.

I haven't even really ever seen an episode of Pokemon at all, but I can say without fear of hyperbole that Transformers The Movie is the greatest film ever based on a line of toys (and that includes video games).  Not only that, I'd go as far as to put it into the highly honoured and sought after category of one of the top 20 greatest films I've ever seen... and it doesn't even feature John Rhys Davies or Bruce Campbell.  I've always held that the addition of a robot (especially a giant one) can help any film... all the characters but 2 in this film are giant robots! 	Sure he's ripped of from both the death star and a monster Brianiac built in an early 80's Super-Man comic, but Unicron the &#145;devil figure' in this film has got to be one of the greatest villains ever in the history of film.  He's a robotic planet played by the acclaimed Orson Wells in his last and greatest role.  The opening scene in Transformers has got to be one of the most hard hitting in film history.  In opens in the dead silence of space.  We hear this blood chilling theme and from afar we see a giant mechanical planet race past these two suns.  Then we see this other planet inhabited by happy, peace loving robots.  Suddenly their world begins to shake and the giant robo-planet appears in the heavens above them, and then it proceeds to devour their world.  I guess what ever comity it is the regulates violence in film didn't think seeing robots killed would faze children much.  I guess they didn't realize that these robots were very real and very human to the children that watched the Transformers show.  Eight of the mane characters from the shows first season are all brutally killed with in the first 30 minutes of the film.  In fact Transformers probably has a higher death tole than any other children's movie.  When I saw transformers in theatre I was 7 years old and could distinguish between reality and fiction, I believed in the after life and also went to see the movie with my Dad so I wasn't really left an emotional wreck, (though I was rather upset with the death of Optimus Prime) but I have a friend who was actually left emotionally scared by the film for several years.  	Of corse the movie isn't all doom and gloom, it features one the greatest good turning the tides of battle against evil endings of all time.  Very few moments are as uplifting to me as the moment Roddimus Prime says This is the End of the Road Galvitron! and then proceeds to bestow a holy beating on the Decepticon leader.  As we all rock out to the amazing sound track The Touch by Vince(Rocky 4)DiCola. YOU CANNOT, DESTROY ME!! YOU CANNOT DESTROY MY DESTINEEEEEEGHH!!! Yeah right Unicron, kiss my shiny, robot ass!  So much of what makes this film great is the amazing sound track, with cool songs like the Extended Transformers Theme, Weird Al's Dare To Be Stupid and the action song The Touch, that Dirk Diggler sings in Boogie Nights.  Anyway though there are a few holes in the plot at some points, it's still one of the greatest films of all time and I'd put it up against Titanic any day.Each category is rated out of 10.  The Cool lines rating is based on quality not the quantity of cool lines.  For instance one really cool line in a movie that otherwise has none might get the film a 6 in the Cool Lines rating.

The voice acting is stiff, especially from the well-known stars in the cast, which is ironic, since their voices were appropriate for the characters they did. The animation and music are okay. But, like with many things, there is another side to this. In terms of ideas, the movie makes its contribution, adding several unique plot ideas that were improved and duplicated in the comic book, as well as giving TF canon a much wider scope. The personalites of the Autobot characters are well shown, even though about three are archetypal, but the new Decepticons leave a lot to be desired. It also shows that Sunbow productions has the audacity (or the stupidity) to kill off two of its main characters, and put quite different (though not necessarily bad) leaders in their place. In my opinion, the move tie-ins in the comic book and the post-movie cartoon handle these ideas much better, so enjoy them, and only think of the movie as a way to make ends meet. But it had potential, and is a good romp for some younger TransFans, though ultimately it dissappoints me.

The film displays a depth rarely touched by any childrens programme, and this is why it continues to hold up today.The sheer power and depth of this film can be sampled simply by looking at the cast list - how many cartoons can boast the vocal talents of Judd Nelson, a definitive eighties badboy hero (the breakfast club) Leonard Nimoy (need i say more), Eric Idle - one of the creative geniuses behind Monty Python and Orson Wells (YES IT IS HE!)although the film can be accused of promoting the american way it is by no means too guilty of this, it has its grey areas, there are casualties on both sides, but equally the story (in combination with a fine 80s soundtrack) provides a message that rings clear - we can all be prime, we can all be the best.

The film's story line isn't anything really different or unpredictable as the independent crap is today. This takes you from the ending of the era we all knew as Transformers, and brings these characters to a whole new realistic life and death.  Never in the TV show has any Autobot or Deceptacon been killed, it's unheard of in kids shows.  This movie broke the mold.. we see 4 of our favorite characters from the original show murdered by the Evil Deceptacons in one of the opening scenes.  Eventually we witness the fall of Optimus Prime and Megatron, the two leaders of Good and Evil as the duke it out in a final showdown.  Optimus Prime was everything to the kids who watched the show, he stood for all the good qualities we want our children to learn.  Many of us cried when he died.  We then are taken on a tremendously well written adventure, following a group of new Autobots and Deceptacons.  We slowly realize one stands out and becomes the star of the Film.  Hot Rod, played by Judd Nelson.  From the time when he was responsible for Prime falling to Megatron in an attempt to help out, until his Destiny that even he is not aware of.

But there I was, in the theater in August of 1986, watching what has now become a cult classic.  Sure critics have ripped Transformers the Movie, but it wasn't made for them; it was made for the numerous kids who were saving their allowance money to buy the toys and getting up early Saturday morning to see the most original toy concept ever created.  For those kids, the movie pleases, and even today those grown-up kids enjoy the movie for it's animation and no-holds-barred action.For starters, Transformers die!  To kill major characters was utterly terrible, but inevitable. Those characters had run their course.  The deaths but established a history, a mythos never before mentioned in the cartoon. Transformers were always cool because of their humanity; in the movie it is revealed that they have spirit as well through the Matrix.The movie moves at an incredible pace. The battle scenes were totally awesome, and the score accents the action. Was Devastator ever as destructive, Megatron ever so cunning and ruthless, Optimus Prime ever so valiant?  The (sexual?) tension between Hot Rod and Arcee was interesting, considering there were never any female Transformers, save for one episode of the cartoon, and seeing Spike all grown up and still buddies with Bumblebee was a treat for long-time fans.  The introduction of Galvatron and his forces was great, and he serves as a persistent and powerful antagonist through the film.  The movie did a great job at characterization, and gave life to our favorite robots as never before.The only problem that I have with the movie is the way it lags after what is now know as The Great War.  In the beginning, Ultra Magnus appears to be a force to be reckoned with, a warrior towering over his troops, yet he ends up being a grouch throughout the rest of the film.  Grimlock and the Dinobots were reduced to status of insolent, mindless, robotic oafs, a role unbecoming of them considering how powerful they are.In all it was a pretty darn good piece of animation, and I'm sure that there will be plenty more late nights where my friends and I kick back and reminisce over one of the most exciting phenomenons the toy industry will ever experience.  Transformers the Movie will always be the greatest toy movie ever created.

That was precisely the point.  Western culture has traditionally considered animated television programs and movies to be for children.  This movie was aimed at a mature (teenaged, at least) audience and did a fantastic job satisfying that demographic. Called an overly violent movie, it pales in comparison to almost any action movie teenagers regularly attend and even the Power Rangers which were popular with even very young children until recently.  One critic referred to the gratuitous profanity in this movie, a single, minor expletive appropriate to the situation. The premise is intelligent and the plot is well designed and executed. The animation was excellent for its day (perhaps some critics said the animation wasn't up to Disney's standards because the robots happen to be mostly block-shaped, but the backgrounds and Earth scenes are beautiful). The soundtrack, called noise by some critics, rocks.  The reality is that all of the things the critics didn't like about this movie are what make it so popular and perfectly suited for its target audience. My only complaint is that, in its eagerness to replace the old characters with a new generation, the movie glossed over the death of the original characters.  Most of the Autobots on the shuttle died too easily and didn't so much as hit any of the Decepticons, let alone take any of them with them. The death of some Autobots, Wheeljack for instance, are not even shown. Also, Optimus Prime's defeat of Megatron wasn't decisive enough and Megatron wasn't damaged enough in the fight.  The fact that Prime died and Megatron wasn't even dying make Megatron seem the winner, and not Prime the victor, tragically lost to the recklessness and inexperience of Hot Rod. That aside, the movie is simply a lot of fun of fun to watch and has excellent replay value.  The story, animation and soundtrack are excellent, making for a mature, intelligent work of science fiction which belongs in every young adult's collection.  Truly an animation classic.

However, leaving aside the novelty value, I still feel it's a fantastic film. Despite the dialogue being aimed at children's vocabularies, there are many strong characters developing, and dying through the film.Most noteworthy for me, however, is the way in which the rock score has been tied in to the on screen action in a number of scenes. Firstly showing the youthful exuberance of Hot-Rod, then as the Autobot city comes under attack, and as Optimus Prime comes to the rescue, all early on in the film, the music is perfectly balanced to the excitement, and triumph of good. Again, towards the end the same tunes, by Stan Bush, are used to excellent effect as the autobots attack Unicron and Galvatron, and to mark Hot-Rod's ascension to leader of the Autobots. Basically it rocks, and the combination of perfect 80's rock music, and transforming action is yet to be bettered, even by the mighty Star Wars.

Gotta admit that I was a bit upset about that last. Not the fact that it was carnage, mind you, but the fact that my FAVORITE characters got the longest, most graphic, most agonizing deaths. Like Ratchet (Smoke out the eyeballs, geez!). Like Ironhide (My heart was breaking! I was bawling!). Like Optimus Prime, of course, although his death wasn't totally unexpected. And then the carnage was over for a while and I thought I was safe. But then, the ultimate heartbreak. They went and did in my favorite character, twisted old Starscream. AAARRRRGH!

Bravo!--As a HUGE Monty Python fan, I loved hearing Eric Idle's voice speaking some witty, unique dialogue.--Some great character development in the movie, more than I expected especially given the blow-'em-up quotient.So many people wrote off the show as a 30-minute commercial for the toys, and in many ways it was, but it also addressed some classic psychological issues, and so does the movie, even throwing in a coming of age story for good measure.Jeers--The music. Sorry, I'm not into metal or Weird Al. But I did like one or two songs...--The confusing side stories and little unexplained bits! What's with the Quintessa thing? Where the heck did Unicron come from? And WHY?--Wheelie. Enough said.--Some niggling, nitpicky questions. For instance, why couldn't the Junkions fix all the dead guys like they fixed Ultra Magnus?--As a female myself, I can't understand why they made Arcee such a stereotypical (i.e weak) female?

Yes, there are continuity problems, the plot is somewhat predictable, and the story-line is somewhat reminiscent of Star Wars... but it still is a great movie. Good versus evil--a standard theme in films of this sort, yes.  But this film adds a strange twist to this formula.  In one of the most action packed first 20-something minutes of any animated sci-fi action film, most of your favorite characters--from the TV show that spawned this film--(96% of them good) die.  In fact, the legendary Optimus Prime (righteous and heroic leader of the Autobots) dies in battle at the hands of his arch-nemesis Megatron (vile leader of the treacherous Deceptions).  This is due in part to the reckless action of a young firey Autobot named Hot Rod.  And Hot Rod must go through the long hard road towards redemption. Some of this wonderful storytelling is lost at times through a series of somewhat unnecesary (e.g. the battle on Quintessa lacked a back story to explain why the Quentissons were so vicious), yet truly exciting, action sequences.  But the very core of the story are still there. Since the film does require a longer narrative sequence than the one provided, the plot can be confusing for those not familiar with the TV series.  In fact, the film fails to inform the audience that Unicron (the villain of the film) and Cybertron (the Transformer's home planet) were actually ancient enemies. But, faults included, The Transformers The Movie is a truly great movie and can be enjoyed both fans of the TV series and those who have never even seen the show, if viewed with an open mind.

Digitally re-mastered, the makers were obviously trying to give bigger spectacle to the original movie that every smart-arsey observer noted was 'just out to make money' like the show before it was.Making a movie was always going to be hard (God knows making the show must have been hard enough!) and the film-makers have to be given credit for taking such a mammoth task on and obviously trying their best. Sadly, though, their efforts are trampled by a wavey plot with no heart and a corny and niggling soft rock soundtrack that crawls out from under the rock it came from every time a key scene emerges. Still, it's not an attempt to be sniffed at, introducing some great new characters that never got any air-time when the original show was running, as well as some neat, emotionally charged scenes.

The scene in question was only shown in theaters, and has been omitted in every release of the movie I have seen. It is during the attack on Autobot City (before Optimus Prime dies) Optimus Prime orders the Dinobots to destroy Devastator! In the next scene (from this point comes the scene that was omitted). Grimlock (voiced by actor Greg Berger) says in mid-air while he is flying in T-Rex mode Me, Grimlock kick Decepticon a$$. The next thing you see is Grimlock descending out of mid-air flight from the spaceship. As Grimlock nears Devastator (Devastator has his back turned away from the oncoming Grimlock-unaware of Grimlock nearing him.) Grimlock, who is still in T-Rex mode, uses one of his feet and delivers a firm, solid, and fast kick to Devastator's rear! I guess the reason I still remember this scene is because it was the first time I ever heard any Transformer swear. This was of course before Spike's famous Oh $hit scene transpired later on in the film, but to me, that was nothing compared to this scene. I believe when F.H.E. (which was a sort of family-values oriented company, much like Disney) acquired the rights to the VHS release of the movie, they chose to censor the Grimlock scene. But that still doesn't explain the Spike scene. Sometimes I feel like this scene never happened, but I swear it did..I wish some other Trans-fan who also has a vivid memory could come forward to state that they also recall this scene that was only shown in theaters.

Our Technology has finally caught up a little to be able to show Megatron and Optimus Prime in a true heavyweight battle. But first watch the original, watch the TV series on DVD and read the comics, because people..... This is a modern day classic in Animated Adventure, with a star studded cast doing the Voices of the Robots.Sit back and relax because the Autobot are about to 'Roll Out'. "},{"Title":"Yup!

For those of us that grew up on the classic TV show, it's a must-own.From the oldschool fan POV, it's so inspirational. Stan Bush's crazy 80's music STILL Inspires me when I listen to it. I just wish I was being chased by an evil flying robot and saving the world while I'm listening to it. It's also the nostalgic centerpoint of Transfandom itself. Fans may have continuity disagreements throughout the franchise of comics and TV shows and toys, but all fans have love and respect for what goes down in the film.For the kid who skipped being a Transformers fan during the 80's. It's not that big of a deal. It could be looked at as a big toy commercial, as major characters are killed off in order to bring it new ones. It could also be viewed as a Star Wars rip off.I say, it's both. It's classic storytelling, therefore drawing obvious comparisons to films like Star Wars, and its a showcase for a surprisingly BIG cast. Including the infamous Orson Wells on his last film ever.The poster is hanging up in my room. I worked at blockbuster for 4 years and made it my goal to sell as many copies as I possible could, and I've turned many of my friends into fans of it as well.I've done my part.GET OUT THERE AND WATCH IT!!!

It became iconic for it's transforming robots, lasers, cool heroes and evil villains. it has a large, powerful, cult following, and this movie caters to that cult. Other people will probably think less of this film because of that cult. We are delivered in this film the story of a robot named Hot Rod, who must stop an evil named Unicron, a transformer disguised as a planet. It's simple enough, but unlike other TV shows like He-Man or Care bears, this doesn't always seem like a big toy commercial, because it adds a human layer (many people die,and in the recent DVD release, they put in a controversial use of the word S**t). These who remember The Breakfast Club will probably not recognize Judd nelson as Hot Rod. He's less of a jerk, more of a hero. Leonard Nemoy is as good as ever as the evil Galvatron, Unicron's emissary. Eric idle turns in a hilarious vocal cameo, but it is Unicron, voiced by Orson Welles, who is the best character. Knowing that they needed someone with a booming voice to play the planet devouring monster, Welles was the obvious selection. If this film was beneath him, he dominates entirely. He's the closest we'll ever get to hearing God speak, without hearing God speak. Terrifying and cool. I still love this movie, ten years and counting since i first saw it. Many people won't like it, but it's fun, action packed and Welles rules.

While the synthetic non-lyrical score didn't bother me, and I took to the new rendition of the Transformers main theme, the rest of the lyrical music went above and beyond their scoring duties. If the point of a score is to underline the action, then the lyrical themes in Transformers underlines, bold prints, italicizes, and highlights the events on the screen so even the youngest and most intellectually challenged members of the audience get it. Any kind of sequence, and I mean any kind of sequence, that could get a pop song gets a pop song. I'll take a Franz Waxman score instead, thanks.With my most prominent thought (complaint) out of the way, I want to say I loved the Transformers when I was growing up. I watched the film when I was very young, and only recently caught up to it again . . . and I still feel Devestator is the baddest of the bad. Overall, I think it survived a little better in my memories, but now, years later, I'm attracted to completely different aspects of the film. Back then I liked the old-school Decepticons over the next generation, and my interest in the transformers series somewhat declined in the later seasons; now I have an equal fondness for the new wave of slicker and quicker baddies. Back then it was just a nifty cartoon with elements that were not available on the TV show (death and destruction!), and now I find it laced with a dark sense of humor too (Star Scream's death--'Megatron?' 'Here's a hint!' BAM!--classic) Still, then and now, Hot Rod is no suitable replacement for Optimus Prime. Optimus forever! I admire the film's ambition (for a 'kiddie cartoon'). Main characters drop left and right? Die StarScream! Die! Spock and Kane as Galvatron and Unicron respectively? Oh yes! Oh hell yes! Only Orson 'The Man' Welles could voice a planet-sized transformer.In closing, I'm tempted to complain about some jumps in logic that genuinely bug me now, but I remember the kid in me from 20 years ago didn't care about the silliness so I think I'll just hold my peace. I mean, it's a cartoon about giant robots that become cars and airplanes and boom boxes and yeah, that's not silly or illogical in the least . . .

The guy cutting my hair (also a child of the 80s) was telling me about how he and his wife were going to have a baby, so he went out and bought a bunch of Transformers tapes so his kid would get to watch and love the same cartoons he did, only to be somewhat disappointed because he found out they were having a girl.  Until that day, the thoughts and memories of the Transformers hadn't crossed my mind for over 10 years.  Thinking of the Transformers brought my whole childhood back into perspective.  I couldn't really remember much, except for that my hero, the one who represented everything that was good in my childhood DIED in the movie.  Thats all I could think of for a good 2 weeks until my friends and I saw some guy wearing a Decepticon logo T-shirt.  We got to talking, and every one of my friends had watched and loved the series.  So we decided to see the movie after finding out it was on DVD.  Enough background info, time to talk about the movie itself.  There were some good parts, some bad parts, and some parts I still can't understand.  One scene in particular, the verdict scene with the sharkticons, I couldn't understand when I was little, and I still have no f'ing clue whats going on with that scene now.  One truly bad part was the weird Al dance scene.  When my friends and I all saw that we just groaned.  But it is outweighed by the good parts.  Like I already mentioned before, the one part that left a lasting impression on me was the scene that probably emotionally scarred me for life when I first saw it at the age of 3, the death of Optimus Prime.  I think this is the only movie that I ever cried watching, even though I was only 3 at the time, his death was that traumatic.  (I must admit that when my friends and I all watched the movie again, I had to hide back a tear during that scene).But that was the one thing that made this a great movie (which is the one point I want to make even though it took me 5 pages to get here) is the fact that Prime's death can have such an impact.  Just think about it, (I'm sure I'm not the only guy that shed a tear when he died, be honest) but this movie makes you have REAL feelings for when a PIECE OF METAL dies.  To me, that's amazing how when a big red truck dies, caused such an emotional surge.Those are my thoughts, and if you disagree, then you probably never watched the show when you were little.P. S. for you Transformer buffs out there, I was born in 1984 which means I probably never saw the first run of the series, therefore I saw it in syndication where they only showed the first two seasons.  That means the movie was truly an ending to the Transformers for me, which probably helped to give the lasting impact of primes death throughout my childhood.Oh, and one more thing for you Transformer buffs.  Everyone says comments on how beautifully animated it was, and how it is the bes American animation ever.  But it's not.  It is Japanese.  The story is American, but TOEI animation, a Japanese company did the animation.

The battle scene at the end between Hot Rod and Galvatron is the best fight I have seen in this cartoon series. The element that any Transformer can die makes the fight much more intense. Another Good no Great scene was the Galvatron Starsceam Confrontation, classic. I will never foget the death of SCREAM.Now the bad points. Wheele Daniel Arcee Sharktacons Junkion and The Quintesson. All of the characters just named were pointless. All of these Characters came out of nowhere. The Cartoon was famous for characters appearing and disappearing.

Skyfire awol, and the Arielbots, they must be on vacation during the movie. And clearly Someone hated Kickback and his Insecticon buddies. They Killed the Insecticons about 3 times in this movie.How could they make Hot Rod the main focus of this movie? Rod is a cool car but no real background story on him. All we no is he is The One. I guess because he touched the Matrix before Ultra Magnus did. Notice the Matrix was never in the cartoon series. But suddenly there a Matrix.Even with the bad plot.

It had a very brief run in Irish cinemas. Only the excellent Marvel Comic gave me little snippets of the movie plot (such as Megatron's demise, Starscream's execution) interwined with their big Story they had developed in order to promote the movie. If only the producers of the Film had allowed Marvel comics (not Marvel Animation!) to draft the script. I only managed to see the film in 1997 after being told by many people of it's excellence.Unfortunately I did not get the Epic film that the Comics had hinted at but rather an extended TV special. Firstly the bad points1) The annoying Narration during the STAR WARSesque intro. (Sounds like Popeye the sailor trying to impersonate the bogey man)2) The fairly irrelevant and over the top soundtrack that seems to pop up (with singing) during the fight scenes.3) No apparent plot just over extended fight scenes.4) Just when you thought Spike was annoying along comes Spike Junior.5) Eric Idle's character was very hard to understand.6) We are treated to Optimus Prime's death and funeral only to be told by the Narrator at the end of the film that He will return.7) Not enough time was given to the old characters. Only the new characters seem to get all the dialogue. (At least Hound and Jazz did not get killed off like the others)And the good points1) The Animation and sound FX are excellent.2) The Fight scenes (although numerous) are very well staged.3) The Death of Prime adds an overtone of tragedy to the film.4) Some great scenes of violence and horror such as Megatron's execution of Ironhide. Decepticons killing their wounded in their bid to escape. Apparently one of the wounded (Thundercracker) reappears later on in the film. strange!!5) The cast are very good particularly Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron who denotes the complexity of the character.Overall the film would have been better if more time was spent explaining Unicron. (It would have been interesting if they scripted him as some mechanical God who created the transformers but who now wants to destroy his creation).It would also have been better if Unicron had an army of his own that the Autobots and Decepticons could unite and fight against. This would have added an interesting twist to the movie's plotThey should not have bothered with the Conversion of Hot Rod to Rodimus Prime plot device. They should have just let Ultra Magnus lead the Autobots full stop. Magnus's lack of self confidence seems to add an interesting dimension to his character.After reading some of the other passionate reviews of this film it might be a good idea if the Transfans lobby Lucasfilm and Industrial & magic to try make a big budget Live action Transformers film (with CGI Autobots & Decepticons). ILM would see it as a chance to further develop their CGI effects since George Lucas runs the company as a non profit organisation. It wouldn't too hard for ILM to do this as George Lucas seemed to have based the Trade Federation Droid Army from Episode 1 on the Transformers. (Such as Robot ships that walk around, Giant wheels that transform into robot killing machines) What does anyone else think of this idea?

Joe.  However, unlike them, I 1) don't remember a whole lot about those series, but do remember having a good time watching them, and 2) did not like this movie.Transformers The Movie is about robots who can transform into mechanical machines such as cars and trucks and planes, to disguise themselves from humans.  This isn't really explained in the movie, but I guess the producers thought that everyone had already watched the cartoon series which the movie is based off. The good robots are called the Autobots, and the evil robots are the Decepticons.   There is this one big evil bot called Unicron, who swallows planets, who has forced the leader of the Decepticons to join him in destroying the Autobots.   There are multiple fight sequences between the Autobots and the  Decepticons and other creatures and finally with Unicron at the end.   There are many problems with the movie.  Most of the robots tranform into earth based vehicles, which are useless in outerspace.  So whenever there's a chance, the robots transform to play demolition durby or to run away from their enemies.  The Autobots base is demolished by the Decepticons, even though the Decepticons army seems just as tiny as the Autobots' (not to mention that the Autobots' base is very well shielded and armed)  And there is absolutely no payoff at the end with regards to the 'autobot matrix''.The one Autobot I remember from my youth is the leader Optiumus Prime, who quickly meets his maker early in the movie.  He is succeeded by 'Rodimus Prime.' (who came up with THAT  name??) This movie was made over 10 years ago, so perhaps I am being harsh, but there was no plot and no character development.. just a bad soundtrack that drove me nuts.  I am sure it was a fine animated work for its time, but I am not judging the merits of the animation but the quality of the movie.

I had also collected the Transformers comic books that Marvel had put out at the time.Recently I found this movie in the cheap bin at the store, so my curiosity got the best of me so I decided to buy it and check it out as I didn't get to see it when it first came out.  After watching it however, I came to the conclusion that I didn't miss much.  The film is a poorly made pile of scenes, and not even the use of well-known actors to be the voices of the characters could save this travesty of a movie.  Very disorganized with barely any kind of story other than the Autobots were trying to reclaim Cybertron and that there was a changing of the guard as some of the old Transformers many had grown to love were killed off which of course is the marketing ploy to bring in new characters so they can get kids to buy more toys.What especially turned me off to the movie was the constant use of annoying 80's pop music.  This wasn't a movie, this was a long MTV music video (interesting choices like Weird Al's Dare to be Stupid).  I actually fast forwarded many parts of the movie just so I could stop listening to the lame music.  At least in the animated TV series, they put in the effort to compose and use incidental music that was more appropriate.I'm sure hardcore fans will still want to see it, but for everyone else my advice is don't even waste your time with this.

It adds a whole new level integrity to the Transformer's universe but it's a damn shame that the story had to be crap of the lowest order and that there are still technical faults within the animation. I know there are always going to be goofs whether a movie is live-action or animated but Transformers has always had a shocking amount of them.I know that many people are going to hate for this and call me cynical but this is not really a movie. It's an 85 minute toy commercial. Orson Welles was right. Many of the Autobots and Decepticon's die (including Starscream, thank God, he truly was irritating) but are soon replaced by new characters. It's like Hasbro was subliminally telling kids to throw out the old toys and go buy new ones.Set in the unfathomably distant future of 2005, when we'll be living on the moon and skating around on hover-boards, the gobbledygook plot involves a giant planet-eating robot planet called Unicron (barely an anagram of a certain magical creature, for no reason) and his mission to destroy the 'Autobot Matrix of Leadership', which is obviously inside Optimus Prime. It begins with the Autobots and Decepticons doing their usual battle of blowing up each other's stuff but what is bugging is that in the show they rarely get hit and certainly never die if they do. But here loads of them are killed-off easily and without any particular attention. So many of them fall it's hard to keep up. The story moves so fast that it becomes almost completely incomprehensible.None of these new characters have the same appeal. Once Optimus Prime is dead the new leader, Ultra Magnus, doesn't yield his authority or leadership with any special flair. Megatron is left to die, while floating in the depths of space and is reconfigured/evolved by Unicron into Galvatron, who doesn't seem to be any kind of eviler, just a new toy. The Matrix of Leadership happens to be a glowing ball in Optimus Prime's chest and when Ultra Magnus get his hands on it the movie could have become a 'chase for the bland MacGuffin' kind of story. But it continues to meander and go in eccentric/weird directions. The subplot involving the junk planet and the shark-bots and the judge and jury who execute robots for being guilty AND innocent is just baffling. What the hell is all that about? And even worse is the guff with the dancing biker-type robots with the leader voiced by Eric Idle. I mean...what? Either I accidentally took an acid and went on a weird trip last night or this film is just random nonsense.The main thing that makes this film so inaccessible is the almost total exclusion of human characters. An older Spike is in it for a few seconds and his son Daniel has a bit of character development. But where is Sparkplug? Where are any other humans? About 2 minutes of it is set on earth and everything else, set in space, seems kind of alienating (pun intended). I know we've seen the Transformers battle on Earth loads of times before in the TV show but this sudden switch of locale and whole new assortment of characters made it feel like something I had no familiarity with.I realize that the transition between seasons 2 and 3 had to be steep and drastic (a 20 year story gap and loads of new toys...sorry characters) but it needs more time to develop than this and everything feels rushed and hasty with no focus on pacing, coherence or character. The constant 80s rock is kind of fun though and Vince DiCola's score is fun. I truly miss this kind of hedonistic music, it may not fit the film terribly well but it has a nice kind of nostalgia to it.Vividly animated it may well be, but I found this film to be so asinine and dumb. I can only watch it with severely lowered expectations.

However, the music and dramatic atmosphere of their death scenes were made to appear as if their deaths would not be tragic for the TV show audiences. The film quickly rushed into bringing upon new characters that hardly were introduced as well.The movie seemed to have just taken a not-so-much-of-an-advantage portion of its' length to add in complex plot structures that don't affect the main story of the movie, but instead to make sure this will be a bridge to Season 3 in the TV show. The Quintessons' entrance was clearly unnecessary in the plot and was only put in so that Season 3 can be established right away. The main villain of the story, Unicron, is really simple, he's just a misanthrope who wants to destroy EVERYTHING. Why? We don't know, that's just trying to make a character as a big, simple problem, which is a weak point common in several fictional stories.His voice actor, Orson Welles, was correct that this story is about a big toy attacking smaller toys. A lot of the plot was cheaply winged off of Star Wars such as the light sabers sounds, Arcee's cinnamon bun hairstyle like Leia's, and especially the climax between Hot Rod and Galvatron.

Does the past hold up with the memories you once associated with it, or will it seem silly and outdated? I recently relived a portion of my childhood in watching the original Transformers cartoon movie from 1986. It is appropriately titled Transformers The Movie. I never did see this movie as a child, although I watched the show on and off in some of my early years. I recently decided to watch the movie, partially out of interest to see the movie for the first time, but mainly to relive something out of my childhood. I wanted to see how it would hold up after 15 years of no transformers cartoons.To keep things straight, Transformers is not a good movie. The story is heavily episodic and jumpy, as if several TV episodes were crammed together. The quality of animation was alright for its time, but hasn't aged well. The soundtrack is heavy on the 1980s power rock/ pop (think Top Gun), also not having aged well. The movie is cheesy and silly, and in all honesty, somewhat ridiculous.However, the movie, while definitely not good, works as a guilty pleasure fun movie. As dumb as it was viewing it, I highly enjoyed it. With each cheesy line, I was more drawn into it. Viewing it wasn't like the phrase about you can't turn away from watching a car crash. It was highly nostalgic. A part of me did wonder how we enjoyed such things as kids. While the movie is silly, it is highly exploitive in a sense of how much of it is focused on robot-on- robot action. Movies aren't made like this anymore. Transformers gets in, has no story but a ton of robot fighting, some cheesy 80s tunes to boost the mood, and gets out after 80 minutes. It's almost as if the movie knows exactly what it is, and does exactly what it can do.Transformers doesn't jump out as a must see movie. For people in their 20s and older, it can be charming, as a relic to a different age of TV. For people too young to remember it originally, it will jump out as an example of the questioning Is this REALLY what you used to watch? It is pretty much a toy commercial in disguise. However, it is worth viewing, both because it is a pure relic from the 1980s, but also because it comes from a time of more pure filmmaking. Transformers does exactly what it is sent out to do. While it wasn't aiming very high, it works. You could certainly do much worse than checking this out. 6/10. Go download the soundtrack if you need a new workout mix.

The animation is done in basically the same style as the cartoons with bright colored cel shadings and stark lines. This was a formula that worked well for many 80's cartoons and I was glad to see they stuck with this for the movie. Computer animation was practically non existent back then so there was really no option other than to stick with the artists and style fans knew and loved or to get a new team in and a possibly different look The voice cast was well chosen and the musical score was wonderfully done by Vince DiCola and a few 80's metal bands. While the dialog was strictly comic book stuff (this was a comic adaptation after all!) it fit well into type of movie this was and the audience this was aimed at, young boys who wanted to see robots battle it out with just enough dialog to get the story into place. You can almost see how each sentence said would fit neatly into a word bubble above the characters heads. The plot was fairly basic science fiction but fit well into the genre and the level of understanding of the audience this was aiming to.Where the movie really shines though is in it's execution. The soundtrack and the action on screen flow together and compliment each other in a way that just feels right. The images and sound blend in such a way as to invoke emotion in the viewer (excitement, sadness, etc), helping to draw them into the scenes a little more. This is something that few directors get right and it seems fewer and fewer movies manage to do these days. Too often you see scenes with a song slapped into them haphazardly and in a way that clashes with the images and action on screen.So while this movie is your basic 8-12 boys film comic adaptation, the well done musical score and sound track and the brilliant execution of the scenes along with the music make this well worth watching.

As many have said, I was a fan of the show and toys. I saw it in 1987 on VHS and in my opinion, it is still the best animated movie ever made. But unlike some commenters here, I believe the soundtrack (specifically Stan Bush's songs)to be one of the main reasons the movie was so awesome, so moving and inspirational, even today. Now I own the DVD and watch it at least once a year and I listen to some of the soundtrack occasionally too. I also own season one and three on DVD but the movie is the highlight of the series. I've recently seen the new Transformers movie and it was excellent too.In this movie, the main character, and my favorite, is Hot Rod, the teenage autobot that transforms into a wicked-cool futuristic car. His bravery matches that of Optimus Prime, and the story reveals his destiny which is to unleash the power of the Autobot's Matrix in order to save the day. In the process, he becomes an adult autobot and new leader, Rodimus Prime. In season three of the TV show, Rodimus Prime is not the same confident leader he was at the end of the movie which is disappointing. Near the end of the series, Optimus Prime is resurrected and the leadership is passed to him again in order to save the world, yet again and Hot Rod returns.My only complaint as an adult fan and after seeing the storyboards for the unfinished scenes is that I wish the early scenes/battles would have at least shown all the original autobots once and their demise. We see a few of the main characters deaths but some of the autobots we are left wondering what happened to them in the rest of the movie/TV series.Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone, especially Gen-Xers. Just like when I was 7, I still wish I could be Daniel, riding in Hot Rod to Look Out Mountain with Dare blasting from the speakers.

I don't care what some of you say, this was the BEST! Everything was great about the movie. The music I loved, much better than anything Disney, although there are a couple Disney movies I still like. And to the guy who compared it to Disney, the difference is that none of the characters on screen are singing. The songs are just part of the music, not part of the story. Disney songs stop the action. It's the complete opposite with Transformers; some of the best scenes happen while the songs are playing. The story was awesome with very small errors that can easily be fixed. Like all the other people, it was extremely shocking to see my favorite heroes die (my favorite, Brawn was the first to go), but that's life. And I was over 10 years old when I first saw the movie, so I took it a bit better than some kids. On the opposite side of the coin, I was shocked (in a completely different sort of way) when Galvatron killed Starscream. I hated him, so naturally I was glad they got rid of him (not totally, as it turned out, but at least that got a decent explanation) as well as the Insecticons (villains who take control of other people's minds are the worst villains if you ask me). Anyway, I enjoyed every single minute of this spetacular movie, & the post-movie episodes were my favorite episodes.BOTTOM LINE 100/10 Watch it, no matter the cost.

With Optimus Prime and many other beloved Autobots lost in battle, it's up to the new crew, including Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Arcee, Springer, Kup and Spike's son Daniel, along with the Dinobots, to pick up the slack and save their world from oblivion with the Matrix, which Optimus Prime told them would light their darkest hour. But there's a new enemy in the way - Galvatron, the reformatted version of Megatron. Will Hot Rod/Rodimus be able to open up the six pack of whoop ass that is the Matrix in time? You'll either love it or hate it. As we all know the beloved 80s cartoon that this was an offshoot of was part of a conspiracy to sell toys, and the big problem is that Hasbro, which owned Transformers as well as GI Joe, was always making new toys, so this film here, rather than focus on the characters we knew and loved, gives them an undeserved early send off and then foists new characters upon us (GI Joe The Movie, had a similar problem). Now Rodimus Prime and the new crew were a fairly likable bunch, but killing off Optimus Prime and the others, such as Ratchet, Prowl and Iron-Hide, so blithely and gruesomely, really wasn't necessary, especially considering that the target audience was mostly young children. And the way the Decepticons seem to get off so easily doesn't seem fair.Among the surviving Autobots - Bumblebee, Cliff-Jumper, and Jazz.In short, the film is never quite as much fun as it should be.Still, the film does have its redeeming qualities. The animation is top notch, the battles are well staged, the final clash between Optimus Prime and Megatron is quite good, proving once again that Optimus was the only competent Autobot based on his ability to actually hit what he's aiming at (I love his subtle way of saying I've got me some sissy ass Decepticon butt to kick, the above mentioned Megatron MUST be stopped...), and Leonard Spock Nimoy sounds like he's having a grand old time as Galvatron, and he is very good as the villain, as is Orson Welles as Unicron. Music's a bit weird though; I kinda like The Touch but I'm not too crazy about the other songs. Optimus Prime's death is actually quite touching, more touching than the deaths of most live action characters in live action movies, in part because Peter Cullen read the lines so well, heart breaking when he rasps Until that day... till all are one. And Optimus was a cartoon robot. The fact that we can feel more for a cartoon robot than a live actor means one of two things - the cartoon is either very good or live action movies suck.For fans or not, or maybe just general animation lovers, we may never know.

The Transformers may have been the Pokemon of 1986, but unlike Pikachu and his annoying brethren, you don't have to be 5 to appreciate it.The plot totally rips of Star Wars (to the extent that the movie begins with a Lucas-esque opening crawl), but don't hold that against it -  the first 25 minutes especially are actually pretty gripping, as the giant planet devourer Unicron rips apart a world while the Transformers continue their age old civil war with the Decepticons attacking the Autobot city on Earth. You've got to admire a film that kills off the hero of an entire generation of adolescent boys before we're even half way through (even if it was only done to clear the shelves for a new batch of toys). After that things deteriorate a bit, with some annoying editing that seems designed to incorporate commercial breaks or the Transformers familiar spinning logo, but it still builds up to a rousing conclusion.The dialogue is quite amusing in parts, especially the scenes involving the Dinobots, Kup or the TV talking Wrek Gar, with quite a diverse range of vocal talent on display, including a last film role for Orson Welles. The animation is probably the thing that's aged least well, as it's not a patch on the likes of Princess Mononoke or Akira. It still looks OK however, and adds to the films sense of retro cool.Probably the best thing about the film though is the pounding 80's Power Rock soundtrack.

But watching it fifteen years later brings to light problems with the film that its target audience would easily overlook.First and foremost, this is not a stand-alone film.  If you don't know who the characters are, forget it.  If you are not familiar with the general storyline of the series, don't consider watching this movie.  (Just knowing that the autobots are good guys and the decepticons are bad guys isn't enough.  You need to know about Cybertron and the overall history of both sides.)  First you should familiarize yourself with the first few episodes of the series.  Why they couldn't have spent five minutes (the film is very short) establishing the backstory is beyond me.  Obviously no one ever intended for this movie to be anything more than a transition into a new, darker season of the series.The other main problem with the movie is the ease with which the decepticons kill autobots (and, to a lesser extent, vice versa).  No one ever died in the TV show, which was understandable, and it was understandable that the writers wanted to make the movie more believable.  But they went too far to the other extreme.  The decepticons easily (Megatron acknowledges that this is almost too easy) kill a space-shipload of autobots and a few more occupying their base city on Earth.  One shot and they die, while in the series, these same weapons had virtually no effect.  It's all just too easy, like an animated shoot 'em up.  If only the writers had spent time beefing up the battle scenes, then they might not have needed to insert the ultimately pointless Sharkicon subplot.Again, the target audience (which I was a part of when this movie came out) would see none of these things as problems.  But those who have grown more discriminating tastes will wish this movie had a bit more substance.

But anyway, another important thing to learn from Transformers the movie is that heroism and leadership in robots is not from a noble soul, but a little dohickey matrix of leadership that they carry in their chests...and that without it they're NOTHIN'. Also, guns that did very little damage in the cartoon, were very lethal to robots in the movie.  This movie only lacked one thing, and that is Robot Nudity.  But I guess we'll just have to wait for that. All in all, dead robots swearing makes for a pretty entertaining movie.

The characters, unusually for a cartoon, actually show some evidence of being three-dimensional. While the middle of Transformers the movie is mainly contrived plotless action in the manner of every 80s cartoon, with a loud heavy metal score (effective in some places) drowning out the simple dialogue, the traumatic deaths at the beginning, and the selfless sacrifice of Prime make 'Transformers The Movie' a worthwhile exercise in comparison to many of its ilk.

I mean Transformers was a hit, they would have triple their profits.In my opinion another factor that had influenced in this movie was the incursion of anime culture in the U.S. A particular trend of these genres was the death or replacement of a first generation of characters,giving way to a second new generation form with the remains of the first one, so was the case of series like Robotech.Transformer the movie was not the exception because it had a Japanese crew in its production and animation(Toei co).From my point of view Hasbro and co tried to apply the anime formula on the Transformers which backfired because they eliminated main,central characters that kept the show going and with out them it just wasn't same, So was the case of Optimus Prime. Why did they believed the series could possibly work without Optimus, i mean what would series back in the 80's like Superfriends(JLA),Masters of the universe, or Thunder cats be without Superman, He-man, or Lion ho; nothing. This move from Hasbro and co. made no sense, but it cost them dearly. The movie flopped, season 3 generation wasn't embraced and accepted as season 1& 2 generation did, been therefore the last one and although the toy line survive for a couple of years; it wasn't kids main expectation anymore. About this i have 2 ideas for the future 1- Keyword Marketing( nobody specially kids go to the movies to see their favorite characters die, it was a bad promo). 2- Saying If it ain't broken, don't fix it. In conclusion, i think Hasbro and co. should have analyzed deeper the motto of the Transformers,more than meets the eye, because indeed they were.

I remember watching Transformers as a kid and I remember playing with the toys with my friends at their house. But further more I really have no recollections of the series. Guess I was too young at the time when the Transformers were at their prime in the Netherlands. I remembered the basic main characters but that was about it.For anyone who isn't really that familiar with the '80's cartoon series, this can be a very confusing and even bad movie to watch. Really nothing is ever explained in this movie and everything is just taken for granted. Basically the entire movie is about the Autobots constantly fighting the Decepticons but in the movie it never gets clear way. The entire story lacks a purpose and the movie is just basically the one event after the other without bothering to explain anything, or even introduce the characters. I'm sure that the movie worked better in 1986, when new Transformers animated series episodes were still being made and everybody was still really into the series and characters. The movie was perhaps perfect for its time but in todays perspective the movie is just silly and without a point.The '80's musical score makes the movie feel even more outdated!The story is really the weakest thing about the movie. Sure, when compared to a animated series episode the story is more complex and bigger but nevertheless, for 'just' a movie the story is just way too weak and simple. The movie also heavily 'borrows' from the Star Wars movies with its story.For the fans this movie is a nostalgic trip to a great period of growing up with the animated series and the classic characters. They should be able to appreciate all of the characters and big battles in the movie but for a non-fan the movie simply just has very little entertainment to offer. The humor is underused and the most fun and interesting characters seems wasted in the story. Often characters are introduced quickly in the movie and they disappear out of just as quick (often without a clear reason or explanation) again.Still the characters are the reason why the movie still somewhat works out. All of the characters are highly imaginative and obviously have a long background with each other. But like I said before, all of the best and most interesting characters are wasted in the movie and the movie also has way too many characters in it for a 84 minutes short movie.For most part the animations look just the same as for the television show, with the exceptions of a couple of big battle sequences, that are detailed but at the same time also quite confusing to watch at times.Oh, and Orson Welles somehow also got mixed up in this. I'm really not surprised that he later regretted this and actually hated the movie.If you're a fan and grew up with the series, then by all means see this movie, already for nostalgic reasons alone but if you're just like me, a person who've seen some of the animated series episodes but it didn't made an huge or lasting impression on you, than you're really better of just skip viewing it. 5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"it is what it is...","Date":"4 October 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":"  The first thing you have to realize and accept when watching this movie is that it is 90 minute commercial for a series of toys. It is nothing more. Its purpose is to kill off old characters so new characters and their corresponding toys can be introduced and sold. This is a bad movie. Yet it is a bad movie I have seen over a hundred times and I will likely see many times more. Every time I watch it, a smile reminiscent from my childhood stretches from ear to ear across my face. I first saw this movie when I was a young child, perhaps 4 or 5 years old. Within the first ten minutes, some of my favorite characters had met fairly graphic and violent ends. But all of this would be overshadowed by an event exponentially more tragic. This was the first time I had ever cried in a movie.The story begins during a civil war between two groups of robots, one good and one bad. While this is going on, a gigantic robot that devours planets, threatens the robot's home world. The rest is fairly obvious. Somehow the gigantic robot that devours planets will have to be destroyed, or else there would be now new toys to introduce. The animation is significantly better than the television series, but that really is not saying much. At times it is quite good, but there are other times where it almost looks unfinished. The soundtrack consists of some of the best 80's rock music I have ever heard and it totally fits the film. The heavy metal version of the Transformers Theme is most enjoyable and sets the stage for a very violent movie. The story is clearly the brainchild of the toy maker's marketing department. The title character, 'Hot Rod' is the typical rebellious teenager, or at least what a 9 year old believes what a rebellious teenager should be, who eventually discovers his potential. Then there is the child in the story who was created so young members of the audience would have somebody to both idolize and relate to. The only character of interest is 'Unicron', voiced by the late great filmmaker Orson Welles in one of his final roles. This works only because he adequately brings arrogance to an otherwise one-dimensional character. I love this film, or should I say I love this very bad film. I've tried to write an honest review for one of my all-time favorite movies. Die-hard Transformers fans probably will not enjoy reading this, but sometimes the truth hurts.

If you know the characters better than I do you know what you are watching exactly and that is definitely something that will help you.

On one hand, this is one of the few examples of excellent American NON-DISNEY animation and should be herald as such. On the other hand, this movie singlehandedly destroyed the Transformer Franchise as a whole, and after several relaunch attempts, from Beast Wars, to Beast Machines, to Robots in Disguise, to Armada, they still haven't gotten it back.First things first, the animation. Marvel/Sunbow put in some serious work during the two years it took to make this movie. From the intricate details in Unicron, to the fight scenes, it took lot of effort to put all this together, and they have done such an awesome job with it.The writers have done a pretty decent job of letting the audience know that this Autobot/Decepticon Civil War has gone nuclear. For all the arguments over 'cartoon violence', I think it's more valuable to teach kids the consequences of violence as opposed to cand-coating it, and that the good guys don't always win. The death of Optimus Prime was a good example of this.HOWEVER, killing of major characters is a risky proposition if not handled right. This has to be a gradual process. You have to bring in new characters and gradually let them grow on people before you write old characters off. This is what Hasbro didn't do. They wanted OUT WITH THE OLD-IN WITH THE NEW in one fell swoop, and it didn't work. While Optimus Prime's death was well handled, their attampts at writing in a successor wasn't!If you are going to ge rid of characters, you have to at least have interesting characters to replace them. So how interesting were these new characters? Let's see...BLURR aside from being able to talk fast, his pressence was pretty worthless! KUP the rambling old robot who loves to bore people with his 'LONG AGO' stories. WHEELIE a high-pitched robot who speaks in rhymes. This character is right up there with Serpentor (G.I. Joe) and Minmei (Robotech) as one of the most ANNOYING CHARACTERS EVER CREATED!!! ARCEE the docile, wimpering, token female robot. CYCLONUS he looked cool. That's it. He served no other purpose than to stand around and look cool. SCOURGE your typical evil henchman who is a total DUNCE, who leads an army of clones that are dumber then even he is! GALVATRON a new vrsion of Megatron...and boy, did Megatron lose a lot in the process, as he lost everything that made him cool in the first place, only to become as annoying as Serpentor! ULTRA MAGNUS Optimus Prime's original successor. Had an opportunity of a lifetime and choked harder than the Knicks! When you are kneedeep in death and destruction, and your leader screams, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT NOW!, you ar in trouble! HOT ROD A hot-headed idiot who, despite being the one that got Optimus Prime KILLED in the first place, became THE CHOSEN ONE, THE ONE WHO WILL LEAD US IN OUR DARKEST HOUR, BLAH-BLAH-BLAH, to becomethe new Autobot leader, Rodimus Prime. A VERY CRAPPY LEADER!!! His leadership was so inept, he ruined the third season so badly, that not even Optimus' resurrection was enough to save them from cancelation!!! ...and it was worth kilng off IRONHIDE, BRAWN, PROWL, RATCHET, STARSCREAM, THUNDERCRACKER, SKYWARP, THE INSECTICONS, WHEELJACK, WINDCHARGER, AND OPTIMUS PRIME for THAT?!All you Transformer fans, if you want a much better attempt at portraying war in the Transformer mythos, look for any of the Simon Furman written issues of the Transformer comics. If you want some entertaining Transformer shows, check to firs two seasons. Though this movie is notwithout merit (awesome animation and fight scenes), this movie did driv a nail in the Transformer Franchise, leave a void that still hasn't been filled.

I really looked forward to the movie--but was disappointed. It was neat how they jumped the action to 2005, and had the Decepticons winning on Cybertron. I remember cheers from the audience when Grimlock and the dinobots appeared..Starscream's treachery was classic--but then, after  15 minutes, they had killed off the likeable old series regulars and added some less than attractive new ones(Rodimus Prime for example). It seemed as though they aimed the movie at a slightly younger audience than the tv show too(Blur and the Junkions were really annoying). The fact that these robots who had been routinely blasted in the series and then recovered were wiped out so easily seemed quite strange. The Matrix of leadership had no connection to the series--surely they could have come up with a better story but I guess they had to satisfy the toy makers.And then there was the music! The music was absolutely terrible. One of the best things about the tv Transformers and Gi Joe was the fantastic musical score by Michael Walsh and Johnny Douglas(I think Anne Bryant and Ford Kinder did the song lyrics). I felt nothing when Ironhide and the others were blasted thanks to that terrible screaming nonsense. As Wheeljack might say if it aint broke--dont fix it!

You have an annoying kid (Danny/Anakin) who ends up saving the day.  You have an apprentice (R.C./Obi-Wan) who must reluctantly prove his mettle (hahaha) when his master (Optimus Prime/Qui-gon Gin) dies.

In a way, this is a good thing (it's bad in that there is only one female character in the entire movie and she's given nothing to do).

A plethora of name actors – Scatman Crothers, Eric Idle, Leonard Nimoy, Clive Revill, Robert Stack, Lionel Stander and (most notoriously perhaps) Orson Welles – provide voices for the various characters…but all singularly fail to breathe life into them, mainly because the script is so muddled and the whole enterprise incredibly slipshod.

As others have said there should have been a lead up episode regarding the matrix, the Quintessons, etc. It would have been thrilling to have an pre-movie episode with the Sharkticons squaring off against the Insecticons. Me, I would also add having episodes introducing these new characters. As it is, only two very annoying sounding characters were introduced in season 2 (warpath and seaspray) but they were spread throughout its course and many times proved useful in moving a story along a given episode. In the movie there's no less then six very annoying characters introduced in a matter of minutes Blurr, the Sweeps, Wheelie, Wreck-Gar, Daniel, the Sharkticons who are pummelled in our heads without the benefit of commercial breaks. Other than Wreck-Gar and of course big Unicron, how did they push along this story? Does anyone remember a particular line they said? However I remember all the portions where the ORIGINAL CAST dominates a scene. It's their brief appearance as well as the painful depictions overbalance the survival as opposed to many great Autobot character getting decimated that stays with me most. I'd think the writer of this favored the Decepicons as Optimus Prime (in IMHO the film's most memorable sequence) shoots amongst others Soundwave in the same spot Starscream had hit Brawn yet we see him many times again (including making a bid for Decepticon leadership).Oh and dear, sweet Optimus--As my sisters and I sat through the tedious mishmash of gimmicky characters interacting with boring settings after Optimus' gut turning death scene, I kept thinking He'll be back in this scene So he's not coming back in this scene, he'll be back in the next scene--The camera finally pulls back and the movie ends and--WHAT IN THE HECK???
