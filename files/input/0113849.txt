The lightweight plot focuses on a beautiful, elegant villa in the summer of 1937 where Miss Bentley has already spent sixteen summers with her father. Adored by the staff, she spends her first summer there after her father has died, and on her first day, she is immediately drawn to the polite but rather pompous Major Wilshaw. In typical movie-only fashion, they meet repeatedly, awkwardly and fractiously, in particular, over a tennis match where she defeats the major with ease in front of a most enthusiastic group. There is unavoidable but unspoken chemistry between the two, but further complications ensue with the arrival of Miss Beaumont, the young, flirtatious nanny of a wealthy Italian family staying at the villa. Miss Beaumont manages to convince Wilshaw that she loves him, and he becomes instantly enamored. On her side, Miss Bentley attracts the attention of a much younger admirer named Vittorio, a local Vespa-riding lothario intent on seducing her amid his raging hormones.As you can imagine, the complications sort themselves out, but the clever way that Irvin and screenwriter Trevor Bentham handle the story, while patently old-fashioned, is also charming and sometimes quite perceptive about how more mature people approach love. In a rare comedic turn that immediately recalls Kate Hepburn circa 1955's Summertime, Vanessa Redgrave redefines any preconceived image one would have of a spinster, as she brings buoyant energy and a blessed lack of self-consciousness to the independent Miss Bentley. Even though she makes no attempt at assimilating into the period with her most contemporary look, she shows off a deft skill for romantic foreplay for likely the first time since she was a mod swinger in the 1960's with movies like Morgan!. Her athleticism is also impressive whether on the tennis court or in the lake swimming the backstroke, though her rather androgynous look wouldn't seem like it would attract the not altogether unwelcome attentions of horny Italian boys.The other points of the triangle are not as fully drawn. Edward Fox plays the major with a stiff upper lip and glowers appropriately in every scene where he loses his dignity - which is often. Fresh off Pulp Fiction, Uma Thurman plays a man-eating vamp in broad strokes, and her constant delight in humiliating the major gets tiresome. Her beauty, however, is inarguable and Wilshaw's obsession understandable. There is some intriguing casting on the sidelines - as the moony Vittorio, Alessandro Gassman (son of actor Vittorio Gassman) would play the viral maniac in Transporter 2 a decade later; and the proprietress of the villa, Signora Fascioli, is played by Alida Valli 46 years after her seductive turn as Harry Lime's lover Anna in Carol Reed's The Third Man with only her still-sultry eyes recognizable (sadly she passed away today - April 22, 2006). The beauty of Lake Como is captured in all its shimmering light by cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis, and Nicola Piovani's music score provides the right evocative flavor for the period. It's a sweet, entertaining movie, brief at 91 minutes, and definitely for viewers fond of travelogue movies like Mike Newell's Enchanted April and Audrey Wells' Under the Tuscan Sun. The 2003 DVD has no extras.

And this movie fulfills that desire on many fronts and also kept me guessing from beginning to end.The performances of the cast were extraordinary in the most difficult of materials, an understated script and the repressive natures of the leads. Vanessa Redgrave -playing Miss Bentley, a beyond middle-age spinster of uncertain age - does much with this. In her outwardly almost flirtatious behaviour you catch the loneliness within, but barely. You determine she does have an interest in pursuing the major, she hears his voice in a dining room and then goes in slow pursuit but practically stands him up on the first 'date' and for no earthly reason we can determine.Edward Fox - playing Major Wilsaw a retired colonel from WW1 - has the major down pat, the peacocky walk, the clipped sentences, the fear lurking behind the eyes, all embodying the pre-war world of 1937 in Italy on Lake Como. Uma Thurman, in one of her first 'airings' plays Miss Beaumont, a young woman taking a position as a nanny to a wealthy Italian family staying at the same resort as Miss Bentley and Major Wilshaw who flirts one thinks rather cruelly with the Major leading him on in boredom but does she, we wonder, when the movie takes off in unexpected directions.Vanessa is sexy and wonderful, you sense there is an unstated other life underlying her character as there is with Major Wilshaw. Uma is the ing√©nue of a kind, an unmanageable young woman, incorrigible as another era would have it, sent to straighten herself out in Europe far away from disgracing her family in America. She is the innocent abroad, or is she. She assumes an avid interest in the photographs Miss Bentley takes of the young man in love with Miss Bentley (a scene contrived by Miss Bentley) and is astounded at Miss Bentley's capacity to captivate. It meanders along from there with beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable tennis game. Too slow moving for many tastes. Wonderful eccentric characters - too odd for some - played to the hilt by a stellar cast. 8 out of 10. "},{"Title":"Delightful film...

"}{"Title":"A quiet, understated film, but nevertheless a good one","Date":"15 May 2009","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" H.E. Bates has never really been a popular author in the cinema- there have been far more adaptations of his works on television- but in 1995 there appeared both A Month by the Lake and The Feast of July, the first feature films based on his writings since Dulcima and The Triple Echo in the early seventies. The reason why these two films both came out at that time is doubtless the temporary revival of interest in his works provoked by The Darling Buds of May, the highly popular television adaptation of his Larkin Family series of comic novels.A Month by the Lake, based on a story from Bates' collection The Grapes of Paradise, is set in the Italy of the 1930s; to be precise, by Lake Como in April 1937, the very month in which Edward Fox, one of its stars, was born. Rather unusually in a youth-obsessed cinema, its theme is the growth of love between two middle-aged people, both British guests at an elegant lakeside hotel. Miss Bentley is a spinster who, on the first day of her month's holiday, meets Major Wilshaw, a retired Army officer. This is not, however, a straightforward romance. Even in middle age the path of love does not always run smoothly, and complications arise in the shape of two other characters. Miss Beaumont, an American nanny working for a rich Italian family, flirts shamelessly with the Major. Vittorio, a handsome young Italian, flirts equally shamelessly with both Miss Bentley and Miss Beaumont. (Vittorio, incidentally, is the only major character whose Christian name we discover. The others, in keeping with Anglo-Saxon conventions of this era, address each other by their titles and surnames alone. Perhaps Italians were more relaxed about such matters).This film is considerably better than the film version of The Feast of July, which turns a fine novel into a dull piece of rustic gloom and misery, but it does have its faults. The action tends to drag at times, particularly in the first half. The character of the Major changes rather abruptly; at first he seems like a rude, petulant man, especially after Miss Bentley beats him at tennis, and then suddenly becomes charming towards her. It is something of a convention in comedies such as I Love Trouble and You've Got Mail that all love affairs begin with hatred at first sight, but A Month by the Lake is a drama, a genre which has generally demanded a greater degree of psychological realism than has romantic comedy.Nevertheless, it is also a film which has its virtues. It may fall within the heritage cinema category but, despite the beauties of the scenery, it is not as visually lavish as some examples of the genre. It not only visually but also emotionally subtle. This type of cinema often demands a rather different style of acting technique than does contemporary drama for the reason that earlier generations, particularly but not only in Britain, often valued emotional self-control (the so-called stiff upper lip) as a virtue, far more than most people would today. To display strong emotions, especially in public, was seen as a sign of weakness.To play heritage cinema well, therefore, demands the ability to display emotional states though subtle behavioural or verbal nuances rather than through overt histrionics. Uma Thurman, as Miss Beaumont, seems more at home here than she did in her earlier venture into historical drama, Dangerous Liaisons. Roger Ebert points out that her character's surname means beautiful mountain, but unlike Ebert I do not think that this is a reference to Thurman's physical height. Bates, after all, died in 1974, never knowing that his story would be filmed or that such a tall actress would be chosen to play the character. I think that he chose the name to emphasise that Miss Beaumont, beneath a surface playfulness, is inwardly cold and icy, and this is something which Thurman suggests well.Miss Bentley and Wilshaw, by contrast, hide strong emotions beneath an outward reticence. Like most British film actors of their generation (they were born within a few months of each other in 1937) Edward Fox and Vanessa Redgrave are both practised stars of historical drama- Redgrave, for example, starred in Agatha and Fox in The Shooting Party- , both possess the gift of being able to express emotion and mood subtly, and both make full use of that gift here. The result is a quiet, understated film, but nevertheless a very good one. 7/10 "},{"Title":"A rare and excellent movie, very recommendable.","Date":"22 May 2006","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A touching and innocent romance story.

Still it was OK for this type of movie.It is 1937, England and Europe have not completely recovered from the first WW, and now they are hearing signs that Nazi Germany may be readying for a war to try to take over Europe.

He is a queer sort, brash and tactless, but somehow Miss Bentley finds him attractive.
