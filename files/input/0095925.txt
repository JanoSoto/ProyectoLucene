[{"Title":"Stay away from Pumpkinhead, unless you're tired of living...","Date":"1 November 2003","Score":"43 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Most critics (who actually get PAID to critique films, unlike me, HA!) really hated this movie, dismissing it as yet another brainless teen slaughterfest and slamming it with either one star or a big fat turkey. I've never really understood this. Okay, it's not ever going to win an Academy Award, some of the acting is atrocious and much of the incidental music was cheesy and had me rolling my eyes, but the basic story is quite good. Six city teens on a vacation in either the Appalachians or the Ozarks, make the mistake of running over a little hillbilly boy with a motorcycle. 5 of them want to do the right thing and call the police, but the 6th, a hulking moron with a police record, takes his friends hostage. By the time he comes to his senses, it's too late. The dead boys father has been to see the local Witch, who in turn has summoned the Demon of Vengeance Pumpkinhead.There's really not a lot of gore here, and no sex whatsoever. The typical teens here actually appear to be in their early twenties, and are hardly the faceless victims you usually find in these kinds of films.  The real menace lies with the hill folk, many of whom look like the genuine article; inbred and dangerous. Lance Henriksen turns in a great performance as the dead boys father, blinded (most understandably) by grief and anger, yet still compassionate enough at last to try and reverse what he has done. The monster, Pumpkinhead, is really cool looking, created as it was by special effects man Stan Winston, who also directed. The atmosphere and mood of this movie are constantly menacing, even in the bright light of day, and Pumpkinhead seems to bring an aura of electrical storms with him wherever he goes, the sound of cicadas and the flashing of heat lightening most unsettling.  The Witches cabin in particular is a magnificent set piece. Worth seeing at least once. The professional critics are NOT always right.PS - Don't bother watching Pumpkinhead 2 Blood Wings. I've never seen a more horrible sequel with a more annoying cast of arrogant teenagers who deserved to be killed. Banal, moronic waste of film.

It has a compelling story of a father's love and the powerful grip of vengeful desires.  It is well acted, has amazing creature affects, and takes the road less traveled by most horror films.  It takes no easy ways out.  The plot prefers to turn slowly into a gnarled tale of battling with an inner demon. The lighting in the fog and the mere visual presence of the witch, Haggis, with her wispy hairs in the fire light, are genuinely creepy. I think Lance Henriksen gives one of his best performances in this film.  Definitely give it a look if you haven't yet.

Some city teens stop by at the store and get on their bikes for some fun. While this is happening Ed leaves his son to look after the shop as he delivers a item to a customer. When Ed arrives back he finds out his boy has been accidentally killed by one the careless riders. In fist of anger he seeks out an old lady who can summon up a demon which shall exact revenge on those involved in the death of his son. However, Ed starts to realise it was a bad idea and he eventually finds out that conjuring up this demon comes at a price. Oh hail, B-legend Lance Henriksen! It's Henriksen's burning conviction and special effects whiz Stan Winston's masterful monster design that lifts this B-grade monster feature out of the very ordinary mould. I can see why those factors get highly praised. Pretty much it's typical 80s horror fodder, but on that point I found this minor piece be an enthralling backwoods shocker that's effectively creepy and ominous in its set-up. The atmospheric air just has that feel of the old style monster flicks. I found it to be a vivid treasure in that department with the empty woodlands being so chillingly, foreboding in presence. The dread of it all just swallows you up! Especially the glum conclusion. The night scenes are sensationally staged with very classy touches with the moon's rays shinning through, swirling mists and the shades of blues flood the screen with great impact. Director Stan Winston (making his debut) utilizes the scenery with skillful execution by giving the film such an organic feel and producing some blinding images within some eerie and thrilling set-pieces (the transformation scene being one). Chiming in also is that of the score which creaks an unsteady terror with it's alienating chords. I thought the dark feel and slick look of the film is perfect and that's rightfully so. Though, it's not without its flaws. The main one being the scratchy writing with it being riddled with clichés, loose characters and repetition. The premise and feeble script could have done with a polish up, because the urban legend of this rural demon does make for an interesting viewing. Thrown up in the story are some thoughtful questions and a emotional edge, but still it was kinda lacking. The stock characters are reasonably an unlikeable bunch, but thank goodness Lance Henriksen gives out a powerful and hypnotic performance that you totally feel his hurt. While, the rest of the cast were modest even if their characters are vague as can be and had very little to work with. Now the other star of the film was the magnificent, but horrific looking demon that's simply grand in stature and hands out punishment with such ease by toying around with it's victims in such a cruel manner. Death scenes might be brutal, but if you want some gore out of those moments&#133; there is some bad news. There ain't any. Some blood, but no gore. But if you're looking for some suspense leading up to the kills it seems to mishandle those moments by being very foreseeable. Pacing wise the film is solid even though after the intense beginning it seems to stall for a while, well that's until Pumpkinhead reappears and things really do get going with it's quest for relentless horror. A solid and creative effort overall that relishes from it's visually brooding direction, superior lead performance and convincing monster design.

It is exceptionally well made by first time director Stan Winston who shows more skill behind the camera than one might expect from someone primarily known for special effects. Most of the lead actors do a very good job, with a few exceptions, however Lance Henriksen brings an enormous amount of credibility to the whole thing. I have great respect for character actors such as Lance and this is some of his best work. The creature itself is well conceived however it is hidden in shadows throughout most the picture which allows the actors and the story to take center stage, much to the film's benefit. Overall this is one of the best Halloween movies ever made as that is the perfect time of year to watch this movie. It's dark, it's Gothic, and it's damn cool.

So goes the poem by Ed Justin. I've never heard of it previously. I'm assuming it's more of an American pop culture thing.Stan Winston may be the man behind many of todays horror icons and creatures but how exactly does he hold up as a director? Not that great I'm afraid to say. But let's be reasonable. This film is almost 20 years old (it was completed in 1987) and Winston has no doubt improved in many ways since. But what he lacks in style he makes up for in enthusiasm.The ever-brilliant Lance Henrikson (the man with THE coolest voice in the world) is Ed Harley, a backwoods shopkeep who's Milky-Bar Kid-lookalike son is killed by reckless dirt-bikers. After this surprising sad and touching scene, Ed visits the house of a mysterious old hag who has ties with the forces of darkness. Wishing vengeance upon the bikers he is sent on a mission to dig up the remains of a demon buried in a pumpkin patch. With his blood thrown into the mix of an evil spell, the demon is soon resurrected and goes about his usual mission of killing people who deserve it.And so begins a series of scenes you've seen many times in numerous Friday the 13th films and the subsequent rip-offs. Only instead of a masked killer you get a very tall, weird looking creature that looks a lot like the Xenomorph from the Alien series. Despite Winston's usually awkward framing and cutting, he does pull off a couple of good scares and generates a decent amount of atmosphere. But the constant unnatural lighting, floodlit woods and fog effects get a bit annoying.Pumpkinhead is, essentially, a tribute to urban legends and ancient scary stories told for generations before TV and mass-communication came along. In that sense, Pumpkinhead ranks alongside other mythical characters such as Spring-heeled Jack, the Skunk-Ape, Shadow People and El Chupacabra. Many of these characters are in the public subconscious, but like I said, perhaps the Pumkinhead myth is too uncommon outside of America to make that kind of impact.Plus, there is good amount of story going untold. The whole idea of Harley and Pumpkinhead being connected through blood and bloodlust isn't developed too well and the film should have had a stronger showdown between them. The mysterious old hag could have had a bigger part too.But if you're in the mood for undemanding horror, with slight irony, mild mythology, an interesting killer and one of the coolest actors ever (Mr Henrikson, take a bow) then go for it. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or memorable.

Music is by Richard Stone and cinematography comes from Bojan Bazelli. Plot sees Henriksen play Ed Harley, a loving and devoted father raising his young son on his own after the death of his wife. His world is shattered when a group of adventure seeking teenagers accidentally kill his boy in a motorbike incident. Struck with grief and fury, Ed seeks out a mountain dwelling witch that can invoke the demon Pumpkinhead to do his vengeful bidding for him. However, calling up Pumpkinhead comes at a cost to Ed as much as it does to the teenagers it now seeks.Tho in essence it is just a creature on the loose killing the teens movie, so a stalk and slash piece if you like, Pumpkinhead is more appealing than most of its ilk. It's an old fashioned movie, rich on atmosphere, presenting a moralistic tale that's steeped in rural folklore and horror legend. It's also propelled forward by a damn great performance from Henriksen. Special effects guru Winston directs assuredly, with a strong visual sense and a knowing that as his movie shifts to the inevitable kill after kill sequence; he had to develop his protagonist first. It's during the first half where Pumpkinhead earns its stripes as Winston takes time to fully form the relationship between father and son, it's tender and very believable, so when the tragedy happens, Ed's reaction is totally understandable. We too feel vindictive such is the way Henriksen has let us feel the love.On to the second half where the magnificent creature makes its appearance and the blood starts to flow. Here the film is only let down by its relatively low budget and the fact that Winston has nowhere to go other than formula. The youths are the usual array of cocky, bickering shriekers, tho in fairness a couple of the girls here are at least scripted as being intelligent and capable of reasoning. But thankfully in amongst the carnage is Henriksen peeling off another emotional layer, as he starts to get conflicted about what he has done. A fine performance from an actor who is far better than his king of schlock reputation. Tho still rated averagely on some internet movie sites, Pumpkinhead (dreadful name in truth) has garnered, and earned, a big cult fan base. Popular enough to warrant a solid 20th Anniversary DVD release, there's a chance that it will find more fans along the way. It deserves it, if only for Henriksen, the creature, and the attention to art design and detail. And of course if you like the stalk and slash formula anyway? Well it delivers there too. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Well Made Horror with Soul!","Date":"16 January 2006","Score":"10 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This film is pretty classy for a horror film.

It's just enough to elevate this above much of the other Dead Teenager dreck that was thrown at us in the glorious eighties.First off, the monster is a doozy. Stan Winston was up to his usual standard of excelence and creativity, and he created a creature that, while not actually convincing, is alot scarier and easier to enjoy than most. Pumpkinhead is no Freddy or Michael Meyers, but he delivers.Second of all, the plot is more intelligent than I have come to expect from slasher flicks. The Kids are more thought out than most disposable teens, and their motives are more understandable. They accidently take the life of a child, but most want to do the right thing and go to the authorities. Even the Jerk who doesn't is eventually persuaded. And Harley, the father who is the real hero AND villian of the film is much more human than his actions would suggest.There is also a good twist at the end which I will not reveal here, only say that surprised me with it's subtlety, which is something you rarely see in a horror film that is more than 2/3 done.Bottom line, I was pleasently surprised with Pumpkinhead. People who don't like horror films are unlikely to be impressed with it, except on a technical level because the effects and atmosphere are superb, but horror fans looking for a harmless new thrill may find it better than expected. It's smarter, wittier and deeper than the norm.Pumpkinhead gets 6 out of 10 for technical expertise, great atmosphere and an above average story.

It surprises as an accomplished and authentic-feeling example of Southern Gothic, better than 'Deliverance,' but nowhere near as good as 'Night of the Hunter,' and also as a morality play with a streak of dark irony.Lean at 86 minutes, the film's build-up is exquisite. Lance Henriksen, excellent here as a highly physical, laconic grocery store owner in rural Rural, U.S.A, lives alone with his son, who is his sole companion after the death of his wife. The movie carefully and quite skillfully establishes the importance of this boy to his father, and this gives almost unbearable gravity to the boy's accidental death at the hands of six urban motorcycling youths. The movie's handling of this situation is brilliant and completely devoid of cheapness or exploitativeness, and the underrated Henriksen reveals himself as an actor of depth and significance.There is moral and material conflict among the youths, who retreat to their cabin. One of them, a violent and dominating thug, is on probation for DUI, and taking responsibility for the boy's death would likely yield a prison sentence. Meanwhile, Henriksen consults an old witch to unleash the titular demon, one who's only been rumored about in campfire tales and bedtime stories, to avenge his child's death, and subsequently undergoes moral turnaround himself.The last third of the film lacks weight or interest, as the demon dispatches each youth against the sudden protests of Henriksen. It's almost as though the director, Stan Winston, wanted to avoid hunt-and-slay elements altogether, and went through the motions as quickly as possible. While this is admirable, this portion of the film almost completely lacks flair.It's forgivable, though. Not many horror films are as good as this, which is concise, atmospheric, and manages to provoke both thought and genuine emotion, with wonderful supporting players like Joseph Piro and Buck Flower that augment the film's rural ambiance with an enchanting authenticity.

At the heart of all the gore and scares are a few different messages like, Be careful what you ask for, Be sure your sins will find you out, and The price of revenge is your soul. Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) is a simple farmer who runs a general store in a remote community. He keeps to himself and raises his son alone after the death of his wife. Ed's life is turned upside down when a wild group of teenagers come through town on their way to a summer cabin. His son is struck down and killed by one of them riding a dirt bike. After they flee the scene, the boy dies.Ed takes the body to a local witch who is rumored to be able to bring people back to life. She says she can't bring him back but will help the mourning father take revenge on the people who caused the senseless tragedy. She conjures the demon of vengeance, which goes by the name Pumpkinhead, to serve bloody justice on the teenagers responsible. But with every victim the creature claims, there comes a price.The movie is rated R for violence and gore, profanity, alcohol use, and frightening / intense sequences. I know many people have issues with children coming to harm in movies, but Pumpkinhead doesn't feel exploitative when it comes to this. There's also no nudity, which is surprising for a movie made in 1988 which includes a group of male and female friends on a weekend party retreat.Pumpkinhead is a truly endearing and touching film it is. I had only seen it once as a teenager and barely remembered all the gory details. With great pacing and something to say for itself, it really does succeed at being a contemporary fairy tale for today.

Ed, the child of the house's owner, then witnesses the man getting killed by a horrible monster. In the present day, Ed now has a son of his own. Teenage tourists come down to ride their dirt bikes, and accidentally run over and kill the young boy. The teenagers flee, and are forced to stay in their cabin by the guilty members of their party. Enraged, Ed seeks out a legendary witch, and she resurrects the monster Pumpkinhead to kill the teenagers. Ed soon regrets his decision, and puts himself at risk to help the teenagers.The monster looks great, a bony and towering demon with sharp claws and scary eyes, and it continues to look great as his facial features slowly change to resemble Ed. We see him from a distance in the prologue, but we don't good look at him for quite a while, making the audience anticipate his return as the film builds it up with a creepy poem and the ugly witch. As far as acting goes, the teenagers aren't that great, but they do all have pretty distinct personalities and we get to know them better than we would in many other horror films. Lance Henriksen, however, is great as Ed Harley, first vengeful over what has been done to his son, but it's a neat and unconventional move to have him change his mind and try to save the people he's put in mortal danger. Henriksen has previously worked with Stan Winston on Aliens, and it was a smart move on Winston's part to pick him for the lead in this film. It's one of Henriksen's best performances.This is a great monster movie, it's atmospheric with a great monster, and even though most of the acting isn't too good, Lance Henriksen is still great.

And, of course, praise should go to Winston and his special effects crew for creating a unique creature like Pumpkinhead to begin with.

Since then, attempts to launch the movie into a franchise have fizzled out and the movie is now more regarded as a minor cult classic of the era, not that well-known outside of the horror fandom. This is something of a shame because Pumpkinhead really is that good.The tagline referred to the movie as a grim fairy tale. The intentionally fable-tastic tone is used a bit to excuse the script's shortcomings. The story of a group of city kids coming to the country, accidentally killing a poor store owner's son, and the demonic wrath that follows is simple as simple can be. The teens are all, at best, sketchy character types. You've got the Jerk, who's insistence on not taking responsibility for the manslaughter spurns on the carnage. He's got a Little Brother (Moral Alliance Mostly Good.), a Girlfriend (Spunky, just shy of annoying), Christian Girl, Nice Girl, and Nice Guy. Of those last three, Christian Girl is easily the best performed, while the two heroic teens aren't developed much beyond disagreeing with the other characters. It's not completely unreasonable to say that these kids exist just to start the plot off and to get slaughtered.Normally, that would hold the movie back, but there are three major factors that make Pumpkinhead a genuinely good creature feature. First off, Lance Henriksen is given a real starring role. Ed Harley is the heart of the movie. Lance is such a subtle actor in this. He manages to show so much with just his face, a cock of the eye, an upward angle. Though the early scenes between him and the son are brief, they feel genuine. Henriksen prevents hokey lines about being the luckiest dad in the world from sounding contrived. Next to Bishop, it's probably his best performance. The warm, sweet musical score moves this along.As good as Henriksen is, the real star of Pumpkinhead is the monster himself. The film was directed by the late, great Stan Winston, a creature effect artist who I've always loved. His make-up team, the same team that made iconic characters in Aliens, Predator, and The Monster Squad are the ones responsible for Pumpkinhead. It's a great design, a creature reptilian and demonic, humanoid but alien. It doesn't quite fall anywhere on the recognizable animal scale. It looks so amazing. This is why CGI can never top practical creature effects Pumpkinhead looks and moves like a living thing. More then that, it has a personality. The suit actor brings even subtle cues to the monster's personality. He can snarl or have a sinister little smile. He does things like play with a victim's corpse, taunt them, carve a cross in their forehead. This is the same reason why Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein's Monster endure. They are clear, obvious, fully formed personalities. Anyway, I'm rambling but it's fair to say Pumpkinhead is one of my all time favorite movie monsters.Finally, the film simply looks fantastic, a combination of atmospheric shooting and detail oriented set designs. The color is great. The nights are clear and blue. The days are orange and brown, lived in and rural. Every set is lived in. The witch's hut is super atmospheric. The burnt out church is so friggin' cool. A demon appears in the doorway of a ruined church, fog swirling all around the blue night. Classic. The graveyard where Ed Harley digs up the demon feels like walking into another world, especially the giant burial mound. This is Southern Gothic, Hillbilly Noir. A lot of movies and shows have attempted this but few are as successful.The fable tone successfully comes through several times. The opening sequence, of a child seeing something horrible he can't really understand, sets the tone fantastically. The ending brings an ironic, mythic quality to the film.

That boy's father decides to make a deal with a witch to get vengeance on the city kids by unleashing a powerful demon. Shortly after, the man realizes he went too far and has to try and help save the kids. This is such a great horror movie with quality sets, good acting, and a creepy demon. The demon, Pumpkinhead, is very well-done for an '80s movie and feels like just another character. The sets are outstanding, especially the witches' cabin, cemetery, and old church. They really give you a rustic and eerie tone that suits the movie's overall tone. Lance Henriksen gives a great performance as a man struggling with the sudden loss of his son and the choices he makes. I think that is one of the main reasons I like the movie so much because it's not just some monster killing pretty people, it's also about this man struggling with his own inner demons. There also some memorable lines in the movie, especially from the witch, Haggis, who is very creepy. The score also fits into the movie very well and is perfect for the setting and type of movie that it is. Another important thing about the movie is that it never drags on or gets too full of itself, but it is very creative and has a surprising ending. It is definitely a must-see for any horror fan.

Yeah, its a bit cheap but it appears they knew what kind of movie they were making and put most of the money into the monster. The story saves everything cheap about the movie as it is a good story, much better than the boring Friday the 13th storyline, if there was one. The witch is as good as any I've seen in quite a while and will give you nightmares just by herself. My kids love this movie and its become part of our Halloween night viewing. There friends watch it as well and has become somewhat of a cult classic in these parts. Maybe due to us living so close to the north Georgia mountains where the scenery is a little all too familiar. Give this movie a shot when you get some time around Halloween or anytime late at night. Also get to see young Mayim Bialik before Blossom and Amy Farrah Fowler.

Originally distributed as 'Vengeance The Demon', and after negative critical appraise, this was retitled by United Artists and released under 'Pumpkinhead', but a cult audience ultimately discovered it for its powerfully dreadful mood and hideously effective creature effects. Lance Henrickson is in perfect form as a sympathetic and loving father living in a deep rural area who's little son is accidentally killed by a group of self-absorbed city slickers. With the help of a creepy old hag, Henrickson conjures up a ghastly, unstoppable demon to avenge the death of his boy. Stan Winston understands all of the angles when it comes to pulling off a chillingly atmospheric horror film as his demonic creation disposes of the perpetrators one by one. Writer. Mark Patrick Carducci conjoins caring with selfish characters giving a dualistic quality to his screenplay, and an otherwise predictable plot is compensated with a keen sense of apprehension. Its photographed with dreadful overtones of dark blue and misty orange colors, and each killing reflects a cruel discernment that is uniquely disturbing. The ending is a bit obvious, but good performances, an excellent monster, sound effects and overall quality execution make this stand out from typical 80's slashers.

For me, PUMPKINHEAD's merit is derived not from the stalk-and-chase finale, but from the intense, emotional opening act, in which the screenwriter takes time to develop an affecting father-son relationship, only to have it destroyed in a split-second by an unfortunate accident. I honestly felt for Henriksen's character because I understood the deep loss he had to endure. I will never forget the intense look of hurt and rage that flashes across the face as he's carrying his dead son into the store. The teenagers' guilt and helplessness also was very palpable and intense for me.Although I appreciated the mood & atmosphere, as well as the folklore/myth aspect of PUMPKINHEAD, I think the second half of the film, in which the kids are stalked by the beast, is less interesting and definitely less effective. The stylistic lighting and sometimes disjointed murder scenes, in which you can never quite tell what's happening (Pumpkinhead seems to scurry and fly around at will), were an admirable approach-- but I never forgot that I was watching a MOVIE. I almost wished for a more naturalistic approach, like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, for instance. (But that's just my opinion.) I also was impressed by Pumpkinhead's script, it's actually very well-structured and one seemingly minor character ends up playing an important role in the story.

One of the biggest pluses here is the fact that this one manages to introduce a rather novel and intriguing storyline for its monster that comes off very well. The idea of letting loose a horrible creature of revenge to right perceived wrongs is a fairly new twist to the typical monster-on-the-loose style films and the way this element is woven into the story makes for some pretty exciting times. It needs a plausible scenario to set events in motion which is done here with the fine scene early on that kills of the son in what looks genuinely like a true accident so there's a logical reason for the demon conjuring, a fine set-up that gives the kids something resembling a conscience and finally brings the actual point home with a practically-chilling exhumation sequence in the appropriately long-dead cemetery that not only meets the functions of the story but also gives off the feeling of appropriate unease required for such scenes. The other big part about the novel story here is the physical connection between the two, as he manages to meld together with the creature during the attack scenes which is quite an inventive feeling here. There's also some good times here with this one featuring some really enjoyable stalking here with this one featuring some rather intense chases here with the creature going after the gang through the woods which results in great moments at the cabin and the abandoned church which provide this one with some thrilling action, nice suspense and a series of chilling encounters all packed with great gore and bloody kills. Combined here with the spectacular special effects for the creature and it's enough to overcome the one flaw present which is the nonsensical action that occurs in the later half. Many of the scenes here make no sense and come at a complete reversal from what was told before. This is really the only part here that doesn't really work.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and intense violent themes toward children.

Inspired by a poem by Ed Justin, it has a story co-credited to makeup effects maestro Stan Winston, making a creditable directing debut.Lance Henriksen, delivering a typically strong performance, is rural grocer Ed Harley, who loses his adorable young son Billy (Matthew Hurley) when the boy is accidentally run down by reckless city folk. Ed becomes consumed with the thought of vengeance, and calls upon a local character, frightening crone Haggis (Florence Schauffler) to call upon a demon named Pumpkinhead - a demon Ed had glimpsed as a child.The short running time (87 minutes) is indicative of how well the story flows and how Winston and company are able to refrain from indulging in any sort of filler. Granted, the young victims are not fleshed out very much, but neither are they treated as purely one-dimensional individuals, and it is possible to feel some sympathy as they are stalked and brutalized by Pumpkinhead, a cool monster played with great physical menace by effects expert Tom Woodruff, Jr. Also, for a horror film this does have a certain amount of emotional resonance; it's genuinely sad when the little boy dies.The cast is above average for this sort of thing; supporting Henriksen quite capably are people like Jeff East (Superman The Movie) and John DiAquino ('SeaQuest DSV'), while others such as stuntman Dick Warlock, George Buck Flower (in one of his more substantial roles and most enjoyable performances), Brian Bremer, and Lee de Broux also make solid contributions in supporting and bit parts. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is very moody and striking, and the music by Richard Stone is simply superb. Among the best scenes is one in which Pumpkinhead stalks his way through the remains of a church and smashes a cross, indicating that there is seemingly no safe place to hide from him. The final twist is a good one, and worth waiting for.Horror aficionados should find Pumpkinhead to be a superior production, and damn entertaining every step of the way.

It is not perfect, with a plodding last third(though the very end is great) and some under-characterised exposition. However, there is so much to like about Pumpkinhead. The best two assets were the atmosphere and Pumpkinhead himself. The atmosphere has that sense of eeriness and the scares and killings(not relying on cheap gore like the sequels did thankfully) are genuinely creepy. Pumpkinhead is wonderfully played by Lance Henrikssen, the monster does look good and moves methodically while having that sense of dread. For my tastes, he was too ruthless in the sequels which diluted that sense for me. The sets look beautiful, and the music is very haunting. The story unfolds slowly, but necessarily for the tension to be more effective, and the script and characters are decent, not the most well-developed but likable all the same and all of them have a point to the story.

There are haunted houses, misty pumpkin fields and old ageing structures which resemble the houses from The Cabinet of Dr. Calligari. The creature Pumpkinhead is certainly creepy looking, but he is far from scary. He moves slower than a snail and his attacks are rather torpid. Despite a fearsome set of teeth, the demon is better at killing people by throwing them around in hilarious ways rather than doing something more horror worthy like biting heads or limbs off.This creature will not go down as one of Stan Winston's best creations, and the movie will certainly not go down as one of the best indie horrors, but it might be worth a look at for horror geeks.

When some city folk disturb his way of life and accidentally strip away his reason for being away from him, he sells his soul and summons the legendary demon, Pumpkinhead to do his bidding. Ah, the sacrifices parents make for their children.Being that Winston's prior experience was in the background, crafting and perfecting all manner of special effects and the sort things that go bump in the night, it's no surprise that his film focuses more on the monster than it does its characters. Aside from Henriksen, who colors his character as much as he can with a good, stern grimace, the victims of Pumpkinhead himself as about as cardboard as '80s horror movie characters get. Even the teens Jason mowed down in many a Friday The 13th had a little more dimension to the ones here. All we know about these kids is that the jerk leading the pack is really good at riding a dirt bike, so his sins are forgiven by his friends. But not by Pumpkinhead, who wastes no time laying them to waste in the film's tight 88 minute run-time.What the film lacks in character development, it more than makes up for in the visual department. Not only is Pumpkinhead himself a glorious chunk of animatronic genius, but the film itself has an ominous, almost Gothic atmosphere, which meshes surprisingly well with the dusty, old-timey setting it's couched in. Winston sure knew how to make things look and function well and Pumpkinhead is a testament to that.

And so she releases pumpkinhead, a nine foot tall friggin monster of a creature that looks like a xenomorph crossed with gollum and, with just a touch of inbred dragon. This thing mercilessly hunts down not only the kid who ran Ed's son over, but turns it's bloodlust to the rest of the pack too, and anyone who gets in the way. By the time Ed realizes what he's unleashed, it's too late. There's some killer god gore scenes as the physically imposing creature wreaks havoc, snapping necks and drinking blood and all sorts of goodies. Henriksen gives the movie a gravity it almost doesn't deserve, being at its core a monster flick, yet his earnest emotion and anger is welcome, giving the story that human element among the grisly chaos. Nothing brings us atmosphere like an 80's horror flick, and unlike the genre movies of today, they still stand as testaments to quality, effects, hard work and pure passion for bringing a grotesque story like this to life.

City slicks arrive in a backwoods town with their motorbikes for the weekend, soon an angry father will be driving his beat-up truck up a dirt road to where an old crone is supposed to live and able to conjure demons, his son's body in the seat next to him.The monster is really the center of attraction, this places it in a genealogy of films where the monster is the horrific urge as it takes shape, becomes sight. In The Fly remake, love tainted by even the tiniest speck of doubt (a fly that enters the chamber with him) can produce a monster on the other end. In La Bete, the beast that despoils the maiden is her sexually-charged nightmare of a loveless marriage ahead of her. Alien is perhaps the most abstract of all; something the void spits out that mirrors our struggle to reason with it.Here it's all so very clear which detracts from deeper involvement; the monster is his vengeance taking shape in the woods. A lot of care was paid to the design, the film is directed by an SFX man, he delivers. Along the way he references some of the iconography, ET for the newly conjured, Alien for the emerging silhouette. The beast's face is strategically built to somewhat resemble Henriksen's to drive home more the connection. It's ideal Halloween fare, simple and works, too simple perhaps. When the conjured thing carries out the task, the father falls on the ground and suffers the vision of what he now realizes is wrong and horrible so we can have the moral denouement of the fable about the perils of desire.Having an SFX man who is new in the director's chair means that vision doesn't really drive the thing, the way even the similar Evil Dead is driven. It could have been spacier, more atmospheric, this cuts straight to the chase, but it's bolted together in a way it stands.

And who is Pumpkinhead you ask. Well, he's kind of like the alien's Earth-dwelling cousin, who you can summon to reap vengeance on anyone who you think deserves it (for example a load of selfish rich teenagers who just crushed your only child with a motorbike). And now we have our movie.The big nasty monster (with his not-particularly scary-sounding name) now stalks and eliminates the teens, one by one. This is one of those film which you will either love or hate, due to it having as much going for it, as it does downsides. First, the positive... Lance Henrikson as leading man - an actor that doesn't often get top billing, but always turns in a decent performance no matter what the film. Plus the movie is directed by Stan Winston (better know for his special effects). Although there's nothing special in the direction, the creature itself is damn good and it's nice to see a monster on screen that's not computer-generated.The downside is largely the teens. They're pretty dumb and you probably won't care much about even the nicest of them. Plus whoever wrote the dialogue for them can't write for young people - they tend to spout a load of clichés and banal sentences like they're reading from an autocue.All in all, Pumpkinhead is pretty fun. It probably won't find much of an audience by today's standards, but if you have an appreciation for classic horror and general 'monster-munching' movies, then you might enjoy this one. It's not overly long and the creature just about justifies a watch on its own.A generous 7/10, based on the fact that I'm nostalgic about when I saw it back in the eighties.

There is no doubt that Mr. Winston was one of the elite of his time when it came to making creatures in cinema. Surprisingly, this particular horror film is Stan Winston's directorial debut and although he isn't an actual story telling visionary like Stephen King or Clive Barker, it is clear that he tried to make it match to the other forms of horror that were already released. Unfortunately, the demon Pumpkinhead is probably one of the lesser-known horror villains in recent memory. If anything, it is a well made guilty pleasure horror film for most.The story is about widower countryman Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen), a loving father who's son Billy, means everything to him. One day when a group of traveling city kids pass by and accidentally kill Billy, Ed calls upon a demon named Pumpkinhead to take his vengeance on the people who killed his son. But that's not all, apparently with resurrecting this creature come some extremely unpleasant side effects. Which in fact, these side effects can get kind of confusing. It's not to say that the writing is bad but there wasn't any clarification on what was happening with these side effects. Plus, there was a character in the film that could have explained this. It's not like no one knew how Pumpkinhead does his work. Other than that, the writing is fine.Even for the slew of no name actors that took part in the film give believable performances. When the city kids realize they hit Billy, the nervousness and tension feels real between all of them. Also what's cool is that Jeff East, the actor who played Young Clark Kent in Richard Donner's Superman (1978) is in here too. Lance Henriksen no doubt puts in a good performance as the emotional father who grieves over the only thing that meant something to him. Perhaps what gave this film an interesting edge is that the location isn't the normal setting. The story takes place on rural landscape. Nothing feels cleanly - yeah sure the setting wasn't clean in Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) either, but it was only in certain places. Here, everywhere feels dirty, inside and out. It's a different feel that most horror films don't have anymore.This pretty much goes hand-in-hand with set decorator Kurt Gauger's work, which gives the backgrounds a very dusty rural feel. Helping that feeling come around full circle is Richard Stone's score to the film. He doesn't create a main theme, but his incorporation of instruments that sound like they belong on a farm match the setting and images with ease. He even includes some emotional tunes. However, his ability to help bring out the horror elements to the film is underdeveloped. Thankfully, Pumpkinhead himself looks like a force that shouldn't be messed with - especially for 1988. When the cicadas sound, you know he's around. Although according to sources, that Stan Winston didn't have any time to inject his input into the concept, the design of Pumpkinhead is somewhat of a knock off. Much of the structure looks similar to that of the Alien (1979) franchise - which Winston did work on. I guess it's difficult to come up with a design to a creature called Pumpkinhead. It is a little off putting. As for gore goes, the death scenes are in the middle. Some can be graphic while others are cut too early to determine whether it was. Adding to the sometimes hard to see visuals are the dual color tones that are frequently used; dark blue for the wilderness and orange red for the inside of houses. I don't know if there's a deeper meaning to it but it may make viewers wish that there were more of a color palette to the film. Unfortunately, with all these factors accounted for, the actual terror factor of this film is quite low unless you are extremely young or you're not a horror fan in general. It's still a good movie but it's not scary like it could've been.Even with creature effects master, Stan Winston directing, Pumpkinhead rarely scares. That's not to say it isn't entertaining though. The performances are believable, the sets feel real and the creature itself is presented professionally.

Due to a childhood experience, Harley doesn't turn to God for help but to a backwoods witch who has the power to resurrect 'Pumpkinhead,' a menacing demon that can only function in the natural realm via the spirit of hateful revenge, in this case Ed Harley's vengeance. Havoc ensues.The best thing Pumpkinhead has going for it is an outstanding monster that towers over its powerless victims, created by special effects artist Stan Winston in his directorial debut. Really, the creature is as good or better than the Alien/Aliens monsters.Another strong point is the link between the creature and one of the characters and what has to be done to possibly end its reign of terror The spirit of revenge can only be terminated by the spirit of selfless sacrifice, which is the Christ spirit.Other positives include a solid cast, a totally serious & creepy vibe throughout and quality backwoods locations (California).The only real negative is that, soon after the monster is released and starts its rampage (at around the 50-minute mark), the film clearly loses its footing and tempts the viewer to tune out, but it thankfully gets back on track.Although the creature is great and the way it functions is original, the basic plot is, of course, old hat, i.e. youths chased by some boogeyman in the deep woods. In that sense, Pumpkinhead is reminiscent of the 80's Friday the 13th flicks, mainly the first two, since they were the most serious (with the 3rd installment a semi-goofy vibe was introduced), but the Friday flicks have better women and are overall more entertaining IMHO.GRADE C+ (although the creature, Henriksen and the creepy ambiance all rate A+) "},{"Title":"A solid 80's monster film","Date":"28 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Pumpkinhead is a solid 80's horror film that stars the legendary Lance Henrisken as a backwoods father seeking vengeance for his murdered son.

My major problem with this movie is the setup is not nearly as riveting as it likes to believe it is. It doesn't take advantage of the immense potential that it has. I would have liked to see a bit of a longer movie. More build up of frustration, pain and angst from Henriksen's character would have done this movies wonders.

In Pumpkinhead, we meet a backwoods grocer named Ed Harley (finely portrayed by Lance Henriksen), who makes a deal with a witch woman called Haggis after his young son is killed in a hit-and-run accident. The witch (arguably one of the nastiest looking in screen history) thus unleashes the eponymous demon to mete vengeance on the dirt-biking city kids. Pumpkinhead itself, it must be said, is a rather pleasing creation (even though Winston did not contribute to its construction), vaguely resembling the alien from Aliens and, not coincidentally, Ed Harley himself; it is hardly the walking jack-o'-lantern you might be expecting! Winston's film is more impressive in its first half, with some touching sequences between Ed and his cute son, a very spooky visit to the witch's abode on Black Ridge, and a gripping scene of the demon rebirthing. The second half of the picture strikes this viewer as being more conventional, with the kids--an unfortunately undifferentiated lot--getting slaughtered one by one by ol' Pumpkinhead, who might as well be Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger at this point. Still, first-timer Winston keeps things moving nicely, utilizes some great-looking nighttime cinematography, and keeps his picture taut and exciting. With its hillbilly setting and awesome monster, Pumpkinhead turns out to be a fairly unique, superior example of imaginative, modern-day horror.

The film, revolving around a father's invocation of a demon to avenge his son, made good use of its rural West Virginia setting. The region's underdevelopment and poverty added to the creepiness, and made the characters' acceptance of magic and demons seem semi-plausible.Based on this, I went ahead and got the film from Netflix. When I watched the second half, I was profoundly disappointed. The film effectively degenerates into an extended chase sequence, and you can predict pretty easily who lives and dies.

By accident, one of the young men fatally injures the little boy of a shop keeper. He, seeking for revenge, visits a witch who awakens a monster named Pumpkinhead to life, and the monster starts his devastating tour.So, from this not really exciting plot, I would agree with all the people who have given this movie a lower rating - if there would not be a major issue that lifts this movie way above similar productions. If you compare, on the one side, Pumpkinhead with the Golem, solely from the standpoint that they both are monsters, the Golem is a cognitive robot who has no own will. What he does and does not depends wholly on his creator and master. If you compare, on the other side, Pumpkinhead with the Terminator, the latter is both a cognitive and a volitive robot, he is not only a regular robot but also has his own will. Now, Pumpkinhead itself (himself?, like the Golem, is a cognitive robot, but unlike this, he also disposes of free will. However, this will he disposes of, is not his own will, but the will of the revenge-seeking father. Thus, from the standpoint of robotics, Pumpkinhead takes a middle position between the non-volitive Golem and the full-volitive Terminator, still being dependent on the symbiosis with a living being.This alone is extraordinary in the history of horror, and for that, the movie deserves a higher rating. However, at the end, an even bigger surprise waits for the audience In order to stop the ghost that he wanted to be called himself, the shop keeper realizes that only his own death can kill Pumpkinhead - or better to say put him back to sleep until the next awakening will come. (Being dependent on volitive symbiosis, Pumpkinhead most possibly is unable to die.) When the shop-keeper and therefore also Pumpkinhead are dead, the camera shows that the latter has around his neck a lace that was given to the shop keeper by his little boy. It follows, that Pumpkinhead is nothing else than the shop keepers Alter Ego. Since the existence of volitive robots is unimaginable for most people, they use an Alter Ego as a projection of a real person in the sense of a substitute and as an explanation of the unexplainable. But this unexplainable will turn into reality in the not so far away future in one of the next generations of robots.

It is one of those rare horror films that does more than merely provide an assortment of sadistic death sequences for shock value, as so many others do in this genre, but being all that they're good for. It not only features tremendous special effects by Oscar-winner Stan Winston that center upon the most ideal monster, and performances that are beyond exceptional (most notably by our leading man, Lance Henriksen, who I think, despite of his appearance in much more highly budgeted theatrical films, delivered his finest performance in this one); in addition, it has an extraordinary intellectual and well-written, riveting plot line that make this one of the most beloved horror films of all time, with a growing fan cult following despite it being released over ten years ago.This grim, highly evocative and compelling picture, which was critically-praised as being stylish and atmospheric, will have you frozen with fear until the very last moment! As you watch this impassive and vicious creature with ghastly appearance that can't possibly get anymore authentic than they already are, in pursue of its victims in whom it could once again take pleasure of dragging its massive claws all throughout as it previously has following several other resurrections, there is no doubt that your jaws wouldn't have dropped and eyes wouldn't have practically hung out of their sockets; it really is likely that blinking is something you may forget to do here. And it's even the littlest things that make this film so momentous, such as, prior to the demon's awakening, the part of the film where Ed Harley, emotionally-driven, attempts to journey up to the mountains where an actual witch is believed to live yet feared by all, who do not dare to enter her grounds, for they are aware of the evil force that lies within her and her abilities to turn lives of the innocence upside-down.

Lance Henriksen gives arguably the best performance of his life, being a character who could be any one of us in similar circumstances. The hillbilly scene where the old man warns him ... you'll send your self to hell, and then the hillbilly kid tells him about Haggis the witch, That old woman scares the **** out of me are both palpable in their foreshadowing of the appearance of the monstrous Pumpkinhead. The Biblical overtones of the plot give a legendary aspect to it, and the scenes at Haggis' house are mystical and visceral in their portrayal of evil. My favorite plot device is that Pumpkinhead slowly starts resembling Lance Henricksen, showing that unchecked revenge twists and destroys even the Avenger! A disturbing, yet satisfying horror film on many levels. If you liked this flick, I also think you also might like WOLFEN, or PROPHECY (although both are slightly marred by environmental preaching).

The story flows perfectly and doesn't follow the usual horror clichés. When a mans son is killed by city folk, he wants revenge. He seeks the help of an old woman who unleashes Pumpkinhead, a demon that will bring vengeance for him. Pumpkinhead kills the one responsible for the boys death, and his friends too. The father realises this isn't right and sets out to destroy Pumpkinhead. But there is only one way to destroy Pumpkinhead...(I won't spoil it)... and so the cycle continues. Pumpkinhead is an interesting and enjoyable film with a monster thrown in. In a way the monster sort of spoils the integrity of the film, but I suppose in the 80's it was hard to create a 'credible' monster. Watch this if you're looking for something different from the usual slasher clichés, it makes a nice change and is definitely rewarding.

I do, and they terrify me. I dread the day my mother officially becomes old. I don't know what I might do.The star of this movie from a horror point of view therefore isn't the redneck father, the kid or even the pumpkinheaded creature but the creepy old bint in the hut. I don't know why Stan Winston hasn't done more directing. He has managed to create the freakiest of old freaks in the hag (appropriately called Haggis) who has the reputation around inbred town of having powers, and no they aren't talking about electricity.The story surrounds the death of a little boy run over by Evil City Folk(tm). After the boy dies the father seeks out the aforementioned abomination to conjure up a demon to avenge his family. Cue lots of running around the woods by scared teenagers, blood. screams and no nudity. Which was unfortunate for all involved.Visually the movie is stunning. It almost looks like a pastel drawing and moves like a comic book. The contrast between the eery blues and warm orange and reds is striking. The overall effect is to produce an atmosphere which is the strongest part of the film. The story isn't the most original, but does contain some nice twists. Lance Henricson of course is the man, although his facial expressions while holding his dead son are bizarre and confusing to put it mildly. The supporting cast aren't much cop and are just fodder for the creature as par the course for films like this. The creature itself is pretty neat. Its not mindblowing and can look incredibly awkward at times. If remade today I think this is one instance that CGI could make a huge improvement, although I would still keep the suit for close up shots. It would be criminal not too.These may sounds like criticisms but the whole film comes together to create something which is greater then the sum of its parts. Its as charming as a horror film can be, creepy and beautifully shot. The ultimate halloween film and deserving of cult classic status without a doubt.

The film then goes into automatic, offing all the ne'er-do-well teenagers until Lance is happy.Okay, the plot is basically the same as every other schlocker  for some reason or another, someone gets their feelings hurt (on varying degrees) and the clique that started trouble is methodically hunted down and killed one by one, usually each in grandiose fashion (depending on whether or not they're in some sort of factory or warehouse).  There is ALWAYS (no exceptions whatsoever) at least *some* premarital, crazy, teenage sex going on in the movies (which may or may not be interrupted by a death scene).Pumpkinhead follows this almost to a tee (replace factory/warehouse with tool shed).  This film was never anything more than letting Winston live out his directing fantasy so he'd keep making badass animatronics for James Cameron.  Sure, Henrickson's character has a right to be miffed and has a right to want vengeance, but the only problem I had with the rest of it was I didn't like the Pumpkinhead character.  He moved a little better than the special effects in Evil Dead 2, and wasn't anymore original than Jason or even the friggin' Ghoulies.  The reason this didn't work was because you weren't rooting for anyone.  I was waiting for those darn pests to get gutted with some bravado, but I'm left with the personality-less PH.Bottom line is that the only way for Pumpkinhead to work is if you rename the villain Leprechaun.

Pumpkinhead is a complete and total 80s horror flick all the way through, and if you're tired of modernized torture horror and dumb ripoff slashers, throw this on as a reminder of why you loved the horror genre in the first place.I think the best thing about this is that it isn't just for fans of one specific type of horror. There was slasher horror and there were monster movies, and maybe a few odd-man-out occult flicks, but Pumpkinhead doesn't really fall into any of those, rather settling to sit on the divider between them. I guess you could call this a monster movie more than anything, but you've got more than enough elements of the slasher and occult types of films in there too, so it's pretty much up to the viewer. Watch it as what you like. No matter what, though, no horror fan can deny that this rules, being both totally old school and boasting a somewhat new twist on the films it took influence from. The monster might seem cheesy or awkward, but I grew to appreciate it the same as I did other horror icons like Jason and Michael Myers, which says it all. The kills are brutal yet not overdone (learn a lesson here, Mr. Eli Roth!), and the characters are generally enjoyable and not too shallow (at least not compared to the random teens in Friday the 13th flicks).This might not be the best film from a critical standpoint, but as a horror fan, I can't give this anything but a perfect score. With a great setting, a healthy helping of mozzarella cheese, some classic 80s blood and guts, a monster that is as much cheesy as it is cool, and a certain spark that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole demonic thrill ride of the movie, Pumpkinhead will fit right in on your shelf next to Friday the 13th, Halloween and Sleepaway Camp.

Many would argue that the technology wasn't available but this simply isn't true; just look at John Carpenter's The Thing. You can certainly tell this film hasn't aged very well. Let's talk about our monster. Pumpkin Head is a devilish agent of vengeance that can't be called off. The effects for this fellow are decent enough. I think with a better budget PumpkinHead could have been a monster more along the lines of the Xenomorph from Alien; a creepy and unique beast. The themes behind Pumkin Head are actually really good. The real shame here is that this film wasn't executed by a more talented cast and crew (Lance Henriksen aside). I could really see this film being successful if only it had been better executed. The cast of bland teenagers takes away what originality you gained from PumpkinHead himself and really make's the film feel more like a Friday the 13th-esque slasher flick.

It's not bad enough to be comically bad, but it's not good enough to be good. it falls in this odd crack that doesn't fulfill anybody. It's so meh that it's hardly even worth reviewing, but heck, why not.Basic story, it's the fifties, a guy is running away from something, and is begging to be let into a house. the father says no while the kid is scared in his room. flash forward to 89. now the kid is a father (who looks a lot like Clint Eastwood) who runs a produce stand in the desert/south with his son (who looks like that kid from little vampire). A bunch of rowdy teens come from some place to do...something. this is never really explained. they start to motorbike and one of them runs over the son's toe and he dies. (Seriously it's quite possibly the worst motorcycle death scene i've ever seen in a movie) everybody runs away because apparently the guy who killed him by accident was drinking and doesn't want to go to jail. only one person stays behind to look after the child, but i swear, i seriously hope these teens never become doctors. the kid's not moving or breathing and they say oh i'm sure he'll be fine and run away. ah. gotta love 80's medicine. anyway, after the father finds the dead kid he runs to find his neighbors the dirty hillbillies and asks where he can find the resident witch. after a few hems and haws, he's taken there and tries to get the witch to revive his son. she says she can't so he does the next best thing. summon a demon of ancient evil to kill the ones who did this to him. Which is odd because technically one of them actually stayed with the kid till the father came so shouldn't he have been excused? whatever, it's pretty stupid.Anyway, back in teenage retardville the guy who killed the kid is all freaking out and beating up his friends so they won't tell anyone and locking them in closets. Soon Pumpkinhead (yes that's actually the name of the demon) closes in on them and starts to kill them. what's mildly amusing is that he kills 3 people the exact same way. by sitting on the roof and pulling them by the neck to the roof. you'd think they'd learn to NOT go near the roof. oh well. so after a while of lame killins, we see that Mr. Eastwood is somehow connected to pumpkinhead and when he feels pain so does pumpkinhead etc.The last two characters left are some chick and a guy that looks like art Garfunkel. He gets stepped on but lives, Eastwood realizes what he did was bad and realizes he's linked so he shoots himself, and then the girl finishes him off and pumpkinhead dies, and the ol' momma fortuna (last unicorn reference ftw) buries Eastwood's remains and......roll credits.The problem with this movie is it follows the standard format of lots of teens we don't know their names or care about proceed to be stupid, and then die. and that worst part is we don't know these characters enough to even care whether they live or die. it's one of those, die so the movie can end deals.Another problem i had was that the guy's name is pumpkinhead. Why is he called pumpkinhead? oh. apparently because he was buried in a pumpkin patch so he's called pumpkinhead despite the fact that he looks like something Jim Henson put together while on crack and in hell. that's the name of the Friday the 13th movies being called 'Crystal lake Knee' or nightmare on elm street being 'elm street butt cheek'. it's a stupid concept for a name.This movie is frustrating, long, and boring. But it's not TERRIBLE. i wouldn't say rent it, but if it's a choice between this and lionsgate, give this a shot. Pumpkinhead gets 4 necks pulled to the roof, out of 10.

It's pitch-perfect in every sense of the word. The lighting and atmosphere is as malevolent as Dario Argento's Suspiria. But I would state that to not show this to kids under six, obviously they will probably get a lot of nightmares from seeing it. This movie itself is terrific as a whole. The concept is terrific and the ending is equally powerful but questions leave much of the audience spellbound to what was going on. What truly deliver is Lance Henriksen's performance as Ed Harley and the backwoods witch he visits creates this sense of hopelessness and gloom that the audience will almost never see what's coming next! But the story itself (MAJOR FLAW) is bogged down with all those horror movie clichés, like going outside when you know there's a creature out there.As a whole, the movie is terrific but the one thing that I felt that was not good at all was the fact that the DVD of the movie was in full screen, it wasn't digitally-remastered, and the fact that the video transfer makes it look like a Super 8 film but I guess that sense captured the realism of a monster that few knew 'existed'. Awesome. Cruel. Devious. Pure As Venom. I give Pumpkinhead 9 out of 10.

A man's son is accidentally killed by a motorcycle when a group of teens come in from the city to have some country-fun but this lessons their ability to have a good time. When the father finds out what happened he's outraged and seeks out a local witch doctor to conjur up a legend in the area to take revenge upon the city folk. He is aware of the legend because he saw it as a kid, it's name is Pumpkinhead because it comes from a graveyard where there is a pumpkin patch. The creature resembles aliens from other Winston movies but he does a good job of slowly revealing it as the movie goes on to build up the suspense. The reason this movie works is because it's scary and not necessarily gruesome. Winston doesn't waste time showing us un-necessary gore & blood but instead builds on the story. I believe this was Winston's 1st directorial effort and he really does a good job with what could have been senseless and tasteless. He also gets good efforts from his cast especially Lance Henrickson as the father and the performances are not wooden and hollow like in a lot of these type of movies. All in all, a well done effort by a new director. Sure, it's not Oscar material but fun none-the-less.

Pumpkinhead is an acquired taste, it's not really scary enough for horror fans but still too gory for children who might enjoy the fairytale elements. However, special effects aficionados and fans of quirky horror will have a great time watching this film.Pumpkinhead is like a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale on acid. In short Ed lives alone with his son Billy in a small town. A group of teenagers stop at Ed's store and one of them accidentally kills Billy by running him over with his dirt bike. Filled with rage, Ed goes to visit Haggis, the town witch, who instructs Ed on how to awaken Pumpkinhead, a demon who avenges wronged townspeople. When Pumpkinhead successfully begins to cut, snap and impale the teenagers, Ed has a change of heart and sets out to kill the demon before it finishes its task.Stan Winston does a great job in his directorial debut. The film is atmospheric, fast paced and entertaining. The Pumpkinhead creature itself is adorable. I'm not sure how involved Stan was with creature's design but surely having a special effects maestro behind the camera was a major asset. I really like the scene in which Pumkinhead is revived and transforms from an old corpse to a cute ET like creature and then into the final devil-tailed demon. The effects are very impressive for a film made in the 80s.The film also benefits from a great lead performance by Lance Hendriksen. He is sympathetic without being overly sentimental and takes the role very seriously, adding some much needed gravity to the proceedings. The actual killings are a bit uninspired, with the exception of one impaling, and the reason for Ed's change of heart is never really clear. I always found it a bit mean that Ed turns on Pumpkinhead, who would have been happily asleep in his pumpkin patch if Ed hadn't dragged him down to see Haggis.Pumpkinhead is a strange and wonderful film. I wish Stan Winston would direct more often. I guess he is still recovering from directing Michael Jackson's Ghosts.

I would suggest this to parents who have kids interested in horror (but are considered too young to watch the nasty stuff). It does have an R rating, meaning that it has some violent scenes (which really aren't that gory compared to the majority of horror films), as well as some harsh language (which I guarantee from personal experience kids pick up more of from school than anywhere else). Still, you might wonder why I would consider an R-rated horror film to be suitable for any kids at all. When I was a child, I had a love of horror films (a love that continues in adult years). Some of the films I used to sneak peeks at or even watch entirely (which is very easy for kids to do) were way bloodier than this is at all. Pumpkinhead has many advantages over the cheezy slasher flicks that have existed for no reason other than to show violence and sex with no plot and make money. It has a good message, does not make the violence out to be a cool thing (or a source for laughs), and has better acting and writing than any crappy Friday the 13th movie. I believe this got its R rating for the brief scenes of violence (which are devoid of nearly all detail, the only gore being more brief and sparse than anything else in the film) and harsh language. In other words, this is a not a film that relies on violence to be enjoyable. Still, I would only suggest this to parents of kids who are open-minded (meaning they don't blame every social ill on targets as pointless to target as horror films) and they are SURE that it won't scare the kid to death, for a lot of people get into horror films because they like to be scared. This movie has a big, realistic monster and works as a great horror movie, meaning that it would freak any kid out who doesn't have any interest in these films. If your kid is like I was and can name off a series of nine horror movies with their exact subtitles, chances are this movie won't kill them.

The first thing anyone can say about Pumpkinhead is What a spectacular monster.  The vengeful Pumpkinhead is one of the most original and awesome movie monsters.  Along with the creature effects, Lance Henriksen proves why he's a cult movie hero.  He really shines here.  Henriksen gives such a good performance, especially that expression when he finds his son's body, I mean, you can see the hate on his face.  Other scenes that really stand out are when Pumpkinhead picks Kerry Remsen up by the head and drags her up on the roof as well as the first time we meet old woman Haggis.  That scene is genuinely spooky with the firelight shining through her wispy hair.  Another helping factor is the presence of one of my favorite genre actors, Buck Flower.  She can't help him.  All she can do is take you straight to hell.  This is probably his best performance, and it's not in a John Carpenter movie (for which he's best known).  The climax of the film is quite fitting.  Although it's a frightening movie, it's often times very dramatic and works on many different levels.  Skip the sequel.

It may take a little while before the story really swifts into action-gear, but at least the introduction of the characters and the build up towards why the titular demon gets summoned is well-crafted and involving. Widower Ed Harley lives with his young son and owns a grocery store in the rural outback. His peaceful life abruptly comes to an end when a bunch of city-teenagers accidentally run over his beloved son with their motorcycles. Overcome with grief and fury, Ed seeks contact with a local witch capable of resurrecting a powerful demon to extract blood-vengeance. The hideous demon with superhuman strength immediately goes after the teenagers and isolates the entire area with petrifying anguish. Ed soon regrets having unleashed this supernatural evil and teams up with the last remaining teenagers to destroy it. The titular demon's head isn't exactly shaped like a pumpkin, he merely owes his name to the fact his remainders were buried in a fields were pumpkins are cultivated. He's a tall, relentless and bloodthirsty creature that looks an awful lot like the extraterrestrial monsters in Aliens. This shouldn't really come as a surprise, since the talented special effects team was responsible for both movies. Director Stan Winston is an effects artist as well, and thus he perfectly knows to depict the demon at its most menacing. And not only the creature's design is scary! The ominous forests, the superb lighting and the superstitious supportive characters all contribute to increase the tension-level as well. Lance Henriksen starred in numerous low-budget horror features that aren't worth bothering, but Pumpkinhead easily ranks among his best roles. His imposing charisma and cheekbones do most of the acting here, but Lance nevertheless remains a mighty fine action hero.

The grief-stricken father visits an old witch & trades his soul in order to revive an ancient three-metre-tall demon (known as Pumpkinhead) to avenge his son's death.During the late 1980s & early 1990s, there was a trend for special-effects people to direct their own films. Tom Savini, the genius behind the makeup for Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, helmed the remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1990, Chris Walas did THE FLY II, Bob Keen directed PROTEUS & John Carl Buechler made Friday THE 13TH PART VII THE NEW BLOOD. For Pumpkinhead, Oscar-winning effects man Stan Winston co-writes & directs, as well as designing the titular creature.Which brings me to say this the Pumpkinhead creature is undoubtedly one of the most awesome creatures I have ever seen. Three metres tall, with a head shaped like a&#x85; well, a pumpkin (it IS called Pumpkinhead, duh!), white eyes & long claws that can wrap around a man's head, the creature comes to spectacular life & does what any self-respecting monster would do &#x96; it kills! However, that is where the film dies. The teenage victims are so faceless, you could substitute them for cardboard cutouts & still get the same effect (there is also a lack of gore, so gorehounds will feel cheated).

Genre legend Lance Henriksen does a superb job playing the grief-stricken father who has to sell his soul to get revenge (although, he could just buy a shotgun, about a hundred rounds of ammo & kill those teenagers without needing to pay the same price), Winston throwing a cool plot device where Henriksen can only stop the demon by offing himself.

Perhaps the simplicity of the story turns people off, but it's the simplicity of the plot that truly intrigues me. Pumpkinhead is a classic tale of revenge carried out by a backwoods legendary monster myth. This tale has been written of in literature around the world for thousands of years and is brought to life here effectively.Admittedly, revenge films and horror films, are some of my absolute favorite genres. Pumpkinhead combines these two genres and mixes them with the ancient fable of a backwoods monster that can be conjured to exact revenge for those that have been wronged by others. I think it's a great combination. In addition to a strong basic plot line, the film has a wonderful backwoods atmosphere, which is presented wonderfully through the work of Set Designer Kurt Gauger. Pumpkinhead is full of atmospheric charm, carried out by an effective sound score, well executed southern accents, and excellent costuming by Leslie Ballard.The acting is solid, headed up by Lance Henriksen, George Flower, Jeff East, and Florence Schauffler as Haggis. Perhaps one might be able to point out several semi-weak performances, but overall the acting IS strong. Stan Winston does an incredible job with the monster effects.

Pumpkinhead itself is something of an employee- it's merely a torture-happy bounty hunter or hitman from another dimension.The true horror is the evil that lives in Ed Harley, that would MAKE him go to Haggis and get her to help him. This to me is displayed plainly as the creature takes on Ed's physical characteristics, as well as how he is bound to the creature psychically. The powerful price Haggis speaks of to him does not solely consist of ending-up in hell for invoking the demon- it's becoming the demon itself.

Before Sleepy Hollow and I Know What You Did Last Summer, there was Pumpkinhead.Satisfying, solid horror tale with a winning sense of what works. The majority of the film takes place at night, so director Winston takes full advantage of the potential mood. A unique decision not to let the effects run rampant distinguishes the feel from the look. The only deterrent from masterpiece status is the fact that the movie seems to leave out a few important plot points. Most obvious is the strange behavior of the father character after the death of his son. He bounces from mood to action to emotion without key changes.*** out of **** "}{"Title":"If only more horror films were this good.","Date":"24 June 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  SPOLIER ALERTIf only most horror movies were as good as this dark look at the evil that lies within vengeance.

Also of note is the horrid witch presented adroitly with concomitant owls, spiders and a memorable husky voice (`What is it you want, Ed Harley?').  The film also has a series of tenants (the creature only attacks those who it is called upon to or those that get in its way, the monster and the person requesting revenge are mystically intertwined, etc) that are for the most part adhered to, a rule often violated by many horror flicks and therefore engenders their downfall.	A good storyline even overcomes the quotidian group of young people that must be viciously killed one by one.  Oh yeah Lance Henriksen is good too. "},{"Title":"The movie for Halloween.

They have collaborated on such films as Terminator and Aliens.  But this film puts both of them in a different light.  Winston as a first time director and Henriksen as the star, expected to carry the picture on his shoulders. And even though this film will not go down as a classic like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacer, I give it kudos for being creepy, atmospheric, stylistic and scary in some parts.Henriksen plays a father that loses ( his son is killed by their playful and irresponsible shenanigans ) his son to a bunch of kids.  Even though it was an accident he knows about a legend of some kind of swamp witch that can summon up some ancient monster to avenge death.  And he is so grief sticken that he doesn't take heed to the warning that the lady gives to him.  Of course from here on out the film is filled with various killing scenarios. So we all know basically what is going to happen.  I mean a horror movie can only follow certain formulas, so don't expect anything earth shattering in the way this film is put together.  But what you can expect is that the film does a pretty good job of trying to scare us.  Stan Winston has spent time with some of the greats ( James Cameron for one ) and he seems to use some similar techniques as say Aliens.  We have a few shots of the villain creeping and slithering towards its hapless victims.  And what we also have is great atmosphere perpetrated by the swamp scenario.  The old witch that exists deep in the woods is stuff that folk lore is made of.  And if you have seen Blair Witch, it is actually kind of fitting that this witch lives deep in the woods.  Maybe she is the witch that haunts the woods in Maryland.  Wouldn't that be something?I really enjoyed this film and it honestly benefits from Winston's eye for detail and Henriksen's tormented performance of the mourning father with a conscience.  If you like a movie that has a mythical monster hell bent on destruction, a witch that is pure evil, a father that is trying to vindicate his son's death, great atmosphere, a murky, sweltering swampy feel, revenge as a theme, comeuppance as a theory ( what goes around comes around ) and some great dialogue, then this is the film for you.  I personally found it entertaining and fun.  It will never be as scary as a Jaws or Blair Witch, but it sure has fun trying, and as I said, it has one of the coolest lines in the history of horror films.When Henriksen realizes the impact of what he has done, he begs the witch to help him stop the terror.  She tells him that she cannot stop it and he replies,  God damn you lady.  God damn you!    He already had son!  He ALREADY has!!!I love that line.

It makes Pumpkinhead a very uneven genre movie, that still has got a good reputation due to Stan Winston's involvement.The movie proofs though that directing is an craft on its own. Sure you can be Stan Winston and have created some of the worlds best known and best looking monsters and creatures but that doesn't mean you can direct a good genre movie as well.The movie itself basically has all of the right required genre ingredients in it. A monster, a revenge plot, a couple of teenagers, some other odd creepy looking folks, dark settings and whatever more you can expect from a genre movie such as this one. The movie handles all of its ingredients well in its first halve, when the movie is still more of a moody and mysterious one but in the second halve it just relies too much on its monster, the killings and its gore. It was real disappointing and I literally lost interest in this movie during its second halve.This is also due to the fact that you just don't care much for the teenagers within this movie and you can't even tell who is who, not even after a while, since the characters remain mostly cardboard ones and they are not being handled and develop properly within the movie.Still the movie has Lance Lance Henriksen in it though, even from the time when he was still a quite big actor and didn't had the reputation for starring mostly in B-junk. His presence adds quite a lot and the movie truly benefits from it.Like you would expect from a movie to which Stan Winston was involved with, it's a good looking movie, with good effects and make-up.

In a tragic accident Joel knocks over & kills Ed's young son Billy (Matthew Hurley), Ed is distraught while the teenagers decide to split for the cabin. Ed seeks out a witch named Haggis (Florence Schauffler) who resurrects an ancient demon known as Pumpkinhead to extract revenge on those Ed feels is responsible for his son's death. It's not long before the teenagers find themselves being stalked & killed by a hell sent monster...Directed by Stan Winston, usually better known for his special effects work on films such as Aliens (1986), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991), Batman Returns (1992), Lake Placid (1999) & the Jurassic Park films (1993 - 2001), Pumpkinhead isn't too bad a film at all. The script by Mark Patrick Carducci & Gary Gerani is based on an eight line poem by Ed Justin & lays the morality on thick & fast, from the question whether the act of revenge is worse than the original act to whether it's all worth it in the end to how to handle grief. The film tries to take these issues & themes & stick them in what is essentially a standard 'monster running around killing teenagers' film. It does a decent enough job but you can't help but feel that it's a bit patchy. Once Pumpkinhead gets going it never lets up & moves along at a nice pace. One thing I didn't like about Pumpkinhead is that by the end it seemed so far removed from reality & 'staged' that I had lost the feeling I had with many of the character's, the downbeat climax may not please everyone.Director Winston does a good job here, at night out in the woods he films everything with a blue misty hue as the moonlight shines through the trees & shafts of blue light shine through small cabin windows, inside the primitive log cabins he uses a warm orange glow made by candlelight to illuminate the outline of objects. I absolutely loved the scenes of Pumpkinhead walking through a derelict Church as the rays of moonlight shine through the outline of a cross & through the broken walls. The Pumpkinhead creature effects are amazing as one would expect, they are almost flawless & Pumpkinhead surely has to be one of the finest, best looking & well realised monsters from a horror film ever. Pumpkinhead reminds strongly of another Winston creation, the Alien. The violence, gore & killings are a disappointment though, there is virtually no blood & there is no build up to any of the kills, someone will be walking along Pumpkinhead will grab them from nowhere & kill them which means there's no tension whatsoever.With a supposed budget of about $3,500,000 Pumpkinhead is a visually nice film throughout with strong & distinct colour schemes, brilliant creature effects & is generally well made. The acting is pretty good with Hendriksen putting in another fine performance.Pumpkinhead isn't a perfect film by any means as it's a bit of a mismash, but it still entertains for 85 minutes & that's really all you can hope for.

You can hardly overlook what Winston's main occupation had been so far. Pumpkinhead, the monster itself, does look pretty neat (even if its design is totally ripped off of H.R. Giger's Alien), but that doesn't mean that we should see the creature as often as we do. In fact, Winston seems so proud of the job his make-up team has done that he wants to show as much of it as possible and we all know that less is often more when it comes to horror movies. Pumpkinhead leaves nothing to your imagination and that's not scary at all. In the whole movie there are hardly any effective jumps, because Winston fails to create any kind of suspense or atmosphere. The score gives it all away beforehand and most of the sets look so cheap, they could have been taken right out of an episode of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (a series more horrific than Pumpkinhead could ever hope to be). And don't expect much gore, either. The most explicit death scene you'll see is one in which a guy get's stabbed and thrown into the air, which isn't as exciting as it might sound. However, Pumpkinhead suffers the most from its bad script in combination with horrible editing. What could have been a half-decent story, was totally ruined by unbelievable characters, idiotic dialog and silly cuts from one scene to the next. By 1989 such mistakes just weren't forgivable anymore. Seriously, this is the kind of movie a bunch of teenagers would make if you'd give them the equipment and teach them a thing or two about how to handle it. For anybody over the age of 14 Pumpkinhead is hardly enjoyable unless you have a liking for cheesy 80's horror flicks (like I do). Everybody else should stay away.

Ed then seeks revenge by visiting an backwoods witch named Haggis hoping she can bring the child back. When she tells him the child's death is irrevocable, he then begs her for vengeance on these City Folk who committed the deed. Defying the consequences of doing such, Ed demands that she invoke Pumpkinhead a monstrously clawed fanged, sneering, demon that emerges from within the husk of a corpse that when alive had cried out for vengeance for a wrong done to it, that is buried in an old pumpkin patch cemetery called Razor Back Hollow. The monstrous demon then sets out to dispatch the guilty parties. When he regrets the deal he has made, he finds he has no control over the monstrous creature & even worse, the creature cannot even be killed until it's mission is finished. PUMPKINHEAD is far & away one of the best monster movies to emerge from the 1980's! Special effects artist turned director (the late) STAN WINSTON, knows his stuff when it comes to crafting a really good horror tale. He manages to deliver several scenes of suspense & tension & delivers some really cool lighting schemes & manages to invoke an aura of dread over the proceedings. The relationship between Harley & his son is very sweet & touching & truly heartfelt, it truly felt tragic when his son gets badly injured & dies & his desire for vengeance is also felt & unlike a lot of 1980's horror movie fare, PUMPKINHEAD also delivers in the acting department, with Henriksen himself being the real stand out in what is surely one of his top five best performances in his career. Another thing that makes PUMPKINHEAD head above shoulders on the competition, is in it's teen characters, despite being somewhat disappointing character wise (which I will get into below) PUMPKINHEAD scores big in this department by making the kids sympathetic, over the accident of Harley's son, unlike the road a lot of film-makers of that era would take by making the kids emotionless & non caring over what they done, one truly feels bad for the teens who feel bad & are scared over what happened. The one who causes the death of Harley's son accidentally, is at first portrayed as a juvenile delinquent who only cares for himself & thus earns the audiences wrath for him to get his in the first half of the film, only for him to change midway & feel remorse, with an attempt to turn himself in until the carnage erupts. The Pumpkinhead monster suit is a very imaginative piece of work & is a very impressive design (played by special effects artist TOM WOODRUFF JR.) the character of Haggis is really creepy & the make-up done on her is fantastic (She's even uglier looking than Pumpkinhead!) the creature is seen mostly in the last half, but while this could so easily have been a hindrance, it's not, the story is so interesting that one really doesn't seem to notice that the film really doesn't start to heat up until the forty minute mark & this doesn't even register to the viewer until the film is over. The score is really cool as well.On the downside of things however, while PUMPKINHEAD manages to be a really fun monster movie, it does suffer from a few inadequacies, my main problem is with the teen characters, in particular the teen hero & heroine of the piece, who are rather bland, it's hard to invest in any real emotion into the proceedings & what they are going through when they are completely one dimensional. The deaths are also pretty uneventful, many of them are done off screen with the few that are seen nothing to special. It's here that I felt that the film could have been better executed, the deaths of those responsible for Harley's son's death should have been an event after the tense build up in the story that led up to them & despite the story there is very little gore seen in the film & despite the creature picking off those responsible, for some odd reason it beats up & drags the lead teen hero around & doesn't kill him, which I found a little hard to believe especially when the creature was quickly dispatching the other teen characters early on the film.All in all, PUMPKINHEAD is (at least for the time it was made) a highly inventive & original horror thriller, with an interesting story, a terrifying monster & plenty of edge of you're seat scary & suspenseful moments that would rival some of the best, scariest moments in horror history & a fun film for horror fans.

The man is distraught and turns to an old lady to get his revenge on the ones he feels is responsible for his son's death.  This one is okay, but it needed better pacing or something.  None of the deaths are all that good and they are not spaced well enough.  Everyone basically gets killed very quickly as this is not a particularly long movie.  Lance Henrickson is good as the father who is out for revenge, there is not anyone else in the cast that really stands out.  Well, the old woman stands out a bit, but that has less to do with her acting ability and more to how she looks.  There is a monster in this one and it looks pretty good, but it isn't seen all that much.  All in all this one has a rather depressing tone to it, and the ending really accentuates the depressing mood in this one.  However, it is worth watching, certainly more so than the sequel, which I did not think was as bad as some do, but I do think it is bad.  In the end this is an okay, but pretty standard revenge horror movie with a monster twist.

Not exactly a gross out, but the hairs on your neck will rise.Backing up Henriksen's great performance are Cynthia Bain, Kimberly Ross, Jeff East and Florence Schauffler as the witch, Haggis.

I got it from blockbuster with mates for a laugh and it didn't let us down. This movie is laugh out loud bad. From the cruddy acting to the terrible special effects and the lame names (Haggis? Pumpkinhead?!! Come on!) this is a really bad movie. The only reason i'm giving it one star is because I can't give it zero. It is never scary, as the plot is boring and the gory bits are so unconvincing. This movie isn't meant to be funny, but like other terrible movies/shows (eg. Passions) it you can't help but laugh at these C-grade actors in this Z-grade production. I could've made better sh*t in the toilet. If you want to have a good laugh at some of the crap cinema spews out, by all means take a look. But don't expect anything at all, except to laugh at some absolute rubbish.

Even so, the design of the titular creature is rather disappointing &#150; given that it's just another ALIEN (1979) clone &#150; but admittedly its rampage is creepily effective. Lance Henriksen stars as a man whose son is killed in a motoring accident and, having witnessed an attack by Pumpkinhead as a child &#150; this particular boogeyman is usually conjured up for purposes of revenge &#150; he now makes it go after the group of teens (ex-Superman Jeff East among them) involved in the boy's death. Interestingly, Henriksen is able to 'feel' the creature's wrath (and, eventually, has second thoughts about the request he made to the witch who revived it); however, the final suggestion that it may have been him all along is rather baffling &#150; since, as I said, Henriksen winds up confronting the monster himself! Director Winston is best-known as a special effects wizard, though the film isn't particularly gory. As is the norm for such boogeyman fare, it was later followed by a host of obscure sequels.

A 15-year old who has never seen a horror movie before in his life may perhaps be frightened, but not many others. The characters are so uninteresting that you don't really care what happens to them, except for the boy who is killed in the beginning. There is no suspense once the monster is out, and its killings are about as suspenseful as the unwrapping of a piece of bubblegum. We are supposed to believe just like that that coincidentally, a few miles from the place of the accident that killed the boy, a witch and her buried, recyclable, revivable monster is available for revenge on order, just like you buy a sandwich. The movie is fairly predictable, and even the slightly less predictable ending leaves you totally indifferent, simply with a relief that the torture of watching such trash is over. The real horror is that I wasted about an hour and a half of my life with this garbage. "}{"Title":"Decent 80s Horror","Date":"14 May 2011","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Pumpkinhead (1988)** (out of 4) Oscar-winning make-up artist Stan Winston made his directorial debut in this mildly entertaining horror effort that really seems like a throwback to the horror films of the 1950s. In the film Lance Henriksen plays a country man whose young son is accidentally killed by some city folks when he runs out in front of their dirt bikes. The country man goes to a gypsy woman and soon they unleash the title character to seek revenge on those responsible for the kid's death. PUMPKINHEAD isn't a very good movie but at the same time there are some interesting moments and some nice direction by the newcomer. I think the best thing the film has going for it is the look of the actual monster, which seemed to have been mildly influenced by the creature in PREDATOR. I liked the fact that it appears like the thing was a throwback to the type of monsters you'd see in those drive-in flicks from the 1950s. The creature doesn't contain much gore but instead it makes its money on the terrific looking bone structure and a great looking face. Another plus is that the film really does allow its main character to build himself up. I was surprised to see how much attention was given to the grieving father after his son is killed. I thought Henriksen was very effective as the father and especially in the scenes where he's carrying around his dead son's body just looking for a way to get revenge. The other supporting actors are all decent in their parts but then again they're not really being asked to do Shakespeare. The film has a fairly dark tone as you won't fine any comedy or even hints at humor, which is another plus. I think the film really is a morality tale and asks whether seeking revenge is just as bad as the original act itself. These elements are hinted at but they're never explored too much. What really keeps the film from being a lot better is the fact that not much ever happens. There are six guilty people and three of them are bumped off in the matter of minutes and when the real guilty guy gets his it happens so face and in such a tame way that you somewhat feel cheated. The screenplay goes a tad bit overboard making this guy a complete bum and then when he finally meets Pumpkinhead they let him off rather easy. The horror elements don't start until late in the film and even when they are happening you can tell that the MPAA must have said no to certain shots.

Right off the bat, a man is desperately pleading with his neighbor to answer the door and let him in, that his life is in danger. He's begging the neighbor. The guy inside is a Christian. The man outside shouts, What kind of Christian are you? He isn't let in, and minutes later is killed. Here we go - one more example of a needless religious cheap shot by filmmakers, as a Christian is shown in a negative, hypercritical light.Take that, and ridiculous profanity which includes 10 usage's of the Lord's name in vain in the first hour, and this pumpkin VHS was hurled in the garbage can.
