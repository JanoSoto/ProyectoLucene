I still remember when it came out and maybe it's just nostalgia because I watched it so many times when I was nine years old, but I still enjoy watching it.  It does a pretty good job at catching the look and feel of the late 80s.  All the hairstyles and clothing are pretty dated but to me, that's all part of the fun. It all starts when our guys, Richard and Larry, discover a $2 million insurance fraud scam in their company.  When they report it to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser) he seems grateful and invites them to his beach house for labor day weekend.  As it turns out, Bernie is the one doing the scamming and has hired a mob hitman to take them out.  Little does Bernie know, that the mob has decided that Bernie has been a little too careless and they have decided to take him out instead.  So, by the time Richard and Larry reach the island, they discover that Bernie is dead from what looks like a drug-overdose.  Instead of calling the cops, the less than bright Larry, decides it better to pretend that he didn't die.  This will work since all of the island partyers are pretty self-absorbed and clueless.  This is where it starts getting funny.Since the hitman is still on the island, he keeps seeing Bernie, who he thought he killed and keeps re-killing him. It's hilarious, because the boys really don't have a clue that the hitman is even around.  Watching them lug a dead corpse around, making him look alive, is one of the highlights.  The fact that all of the islanders believe he's alive is even funnier.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was Andrew McCarthy's performance as Larry.  His slacker part killed me and he has some really funny lines.  What ever happened to him?  Jonathan Silverman also does a great job with an underwritten part.  He plays the ulcer-bound Richard who SO tries to be the moral center of the situation.  Terry Kiser is incredible, as always and he plays a dead guy VERY well.  Some of the stuff that he has to do, I really can't see anyone else pulling off as well.  My favorite scenes came when Bernie was alive.  The guy is such an unbelievable jerk, he's actually fun to hate.  Ignore the other comments on here, and go get this one.  It's great for some laughs and I STILL get a lot out of it everytime I watch it.  A great semi-black comedy.  Go pick it up and look for the sequel.  I enjoyed it as well, although not quite as much.

This review will contain SPOILERS, so discontinue reading if you do not wish to know the story.The tragic anti-hero is Bernie, a man who seemingly has it all.  He has a great NYC apartment, a house at the beach, a boat, a high-priced sports car, women falling at his feet, and a great toupee.  He is the symbol of 1980s material success.  Any of us would love to be in his position, right?Perhaps not, for all great tragedies possess a fall from grace.  Bernie is successful because of his involvement in the NYC organized crime underground.  This combined with his lack of self-control in regards to the Don's girlfriend results in his untimely end.The tragedy is this in death, no one notices.  Bernie's supposed friends continue to use his boat, party at his house, drink his booze, and yet no one realizes he is dead.  The woman who indirectly caused his death defiles and molests his corpse without noticing. This is an insult not only to his person, but his sexual prowess as well.  It would seem Bernie lacked any real emotional attachments.  Instead, he plunged himself into the seedy world of 1980s materialism.  It was this world that would not only cause his death, but would also insult his humanity through the implication that his life was irrelevant.Indeed, Bernie became in death what he could not attain in life, a hero.  While dead, Bernie's corpse protects two losers from meeting their own untimely ends at the hands of both the New York mafia and Neptune's realm.  In death, Bernie was able to give pleasure to all those around him through his possessions and, in the case of his girlfriend, his body.  However philanthropy and necrophilia aside, all of these redeeming acts are meaningless because when those around him find out that he is really dead, some do not believe while others express shock.  However the shock is not from losing a dear friend, but from the realization that they were too absorbed in their material lifestyle to take notice of the recently departed.The tale of Bernie is a tragic one.  A man unloved in life and death, let his story guide you.  For it is not the material success that brings one happiness and love, rather it is the depth of friendship.

Maybe that's because most of the people are constantly brained washed by Hollywood type comedies - sweet and romantic or alternatively rude and full of body parts /smells/sounds/etc. But wait - those comedies also have to educate us, always at the end of the movie, with a deeper message - the meaning of life, love, god, peace and happiness to all the world, blah, blah, blah...

Bernie invites the two losers out to his beach-house in the hopes of them being eliminated.  However, he is killed instead and when Silverman and McCarthy discover his body they pretend like he is still alive so they can get the great weekend that their late boss promised them.  A truly original idea carries this film which is sick in one sense, but amazingly funny in another.  Silverman and McCarthy make a surprisingly effective comedy team.  However it is Terry Kiser, in one of the most under-rated roles ever seen during the history of the cinema, that makes the film work as well as it can.  His uncanny ability to play a stiff corpse for nearly the whole film is truly revolutionary.  If there was ever a performance that was overlooked by the Academy, it may be Kiser's role here (do not laugh).  Overall the film over-achieves and is well-worth watching at least once.  3.5 out of 5 stars.

Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor. There was the amusing film (based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel) THE WRONG BOX, which was elegantly done, and was quite good. There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England, called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a life of it's own.Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films. It isn't. It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning. A good example in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's continental cooking attempts. Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims, and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife (who makes some good suggestions) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes. It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film. The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry. The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse, alone or with each other. They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff.The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film. After all, how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot.In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands (the antics of Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Ralph Richardson, and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes). The fact the body gets mislaid, when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore, concerning a tontine. The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine. In short the body is an element, but not the center of the joke.WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this. The corpse is the center and movement of the plot, but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed, and what Hitch missed. The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body, but producing it. In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people, for different reasons, but several (Cook and Moore) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't. In short the body has movement despite being a body. Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true, but repetitive movement at best. One exception, but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house. Why should it be in the tub? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that.In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead.Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax, the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy (as Larry Waters) and Jonathan Silverman (as Richard Parker) work for as accountants. They discover a huge discrepancy in the books, and make the mistake of trusting this information to Bernie. They don't realize he and his partner have been looting the company. Bernie invites them to his home in the Hamptons for the weekend (where he secretly plans to bump them off). What he does not realize is that his partner has decided to bump him off, so Don Calfa (as Pacho, the hit-man) shoots Bernie, and leaves his corpse in the house. He thinks that the two visitors or someone else will report the finding of the dead body. When Waters and Parker show up, they discover the dead man, and they are aware of his plot against them. Should they call the police? They decide they would be suspected. So the best thing is to make it appear that Bernie is still alive, and that he is having an active, fun-filled weekend with the two fellows. With plenty of people seeing and speaking to Bernie during the weekend, they will make sure that when they leave, nobody will suspect them. Of course, as time passes, Pacho can't understand the failure of anyone to discover the murder. He keeps returning and killing the living Bernie again and again and again. But Bernie keeps surviving to be seen limboing, swimming, and even water-skiing (my favorite part of the film).From a comedy about a dead body it becomes a comedy about frustration for the gunman, and of inventiveness by the two young heroes. It also is a smörgåsbord of prat falls, blows to the head, and unnatural natural accidents for actor Terry Kaiser. His performance as the all too lively when dead Bernie is one of the funniest silent comic jobs in recent movies, as his semi-smile and sunglasses make him seem crocked more than dead to everyone dancing on the beach front at his house. It is certainly more interesting than that of the actor who was Harry in Hitch's film - who just had to lay on the ground or get carried somewhere. Again, a clever grasp of the possibilities of the situation in reverse, in a well written and directed film like BERNIE'S, beats out the unimaginative use of the corpse as a simple prop even if the director is (otherwise) a master of cinema elsewhere.

They present the info to their boss who's so grateful he invites them to his kick ass house for Labor Day weekend.  When they show up they find him dead and decide it would benefit both of them to let the parties go on with everyone thinking Kiser is still kickin'.  Contrary to what most say, the core of this film is not the dead body antics.  The real attraction here is the rappor between McCarthy and Silverman, who play very well off each other because their characters are such opposites.  And occasionally Kiser is thrown into the mix and the three make one of the more odder comdey teams.  When they do drag him along, its pretty good stuff, with them trying to fake everyone out that hes walking or waving.  And then the battering of the body, which is hard to not laugh at.  When Bernies being dragged or bounced or dropped its perfectly silly.  Even before the main action starts, theres some good stuff in the beginning dealing with Silvermans love life and McCarthys constant annoyance of him about it.  So at almost every point in the film theres usually something to laugh at.

Bernie winds up getting killed before they get there.  The rest of the movie involves the hijinks that occur when Richard and Larry decide to pretend Bernie is still alive so they can enjoy their weekend in paradise.  Much of the gags include Bernie's lifeless body being dragged about and posed.  What's surprising is that much of the gags actually work.  It's a one-joke movie that manages to sustain through the one and a half hours.  Pay special attention to the boat scene -- on first viewing my sisters and I were roaring with laughter.

The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend.It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead.Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house.Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film.Weekend at Bernie's is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.

These two dorks at an insurance company find out someone is embezzling money from the company. Well, unbeknownst to them, it is their boss the sleaze-ball Bernie who is in bed with the Mafia, literally and figuratively, bedding the mob bosses girlfriend, never a good idea. Bernie asks the Mafioso to rub out the two morons but the boss knows about Bernie and his girlfriend so he orders the hit on Bernie instead. Bernie invites the dweebs out to his beach house, ostensibly to thank them, but really to have them killed there by the hit-man. Well, the hit-man comically and bloodlessly kills Bernie. Now from this point on you must forget all your knowledge of human pathology after death or it will anger you. Yes, I know rigor mortis and the coloring change. Lighten up, its a comedy; the two guys are so frightened they take Bernie around with them everywhere. This often requires wires, vacuuming his hairpiece but it is quite funny, trust me. Catherine Mary Stewart turns in a great performance as a girl in love with Silverman but quite angry after he took her home to his parent's apartment and pretended, in the middle of the night, that it was his. This came crashing down when his dad got up, in his boxers, to raid the fridge. Silverman pretended it was his butler and Stewart stormed out.When she runs into them at Bernie's, she suspects right away these two nerds are up to something. Bernie never speaks, yet they fool her most of the movie. There is a hilarious sub plot where the hit-man keeps seeing Bernie, apparently still alive, out in a golf cart with these geeks. He keeps coming back killing Bernie over and over strangling, shooting, pushing off of things. He returns to the Ferry and usually is almost out of sight and there is Bernie again with the guys. By the end of the movie, he is having a nervous breakdown and the mobsters think he has lost it. Parents the humor is black as night but all the violence is bloodless. There is an off camera scene of necrophilia with Bernie's mob girlfriend but it is all implied. There is a great depth here with the Yuppie culture of the 80's being mocked. The crowds of parasites partying at Bernie's beach house are utterly oblivious to his being dead and never speaking. The guys make his head nod or arms wave and that is enough for them.The point is how narcissistic these people are and indifferent to everyone around them. He simply provides booze, a pool and a big house; they couldn't care less about him. It is my favorite comedy, after Uncle Buck, from the 80's. It doesn't have the moral depth of that movie, it is very, very funny. McCarthy and Silverman are constantly arguing with each other and messing everything up. Watch for McCarthy swatting flies on Bernie while cheating at Monopoly with him in a lawn chair, inexplicably with a large mixed drink? I watch it over every couple of months. It is on DVD not Blu Ray yet. A Classic From The 80s.

These phrases don't even begin to do justice to the masterpiece that is, Weekend at Bernie's. Where do I begin? Is it the life changing story, the celebration of love, or the affirmation of all that makes us human. Weekend at Bernie's provides not only an insight into death, but into life itself. Ordinary people would take this movie at face value, but it takes a truly enlightened mind to appreciate all that is Weekend at Bernie's. In death, Bernie Lomax, an ordinary CEO, caught up in the corrupt ways of today's modern business, has somehow taught us to fully appreciate all that we have. Whether we are a millionaire with a smokin' hot hosemonster girlfriend like Bernie, or bumbling, bottom of the ladder cubical slaves, such as Larry and Richard, we can all learn a little something from the life and death of Bermie Lomax. That leads me into my next point, Lomax. Bernie Lomax, cut down in his prime. But the writer, Robert Klane, has crafted quite an irony. His very name speaks of oxymorons. Lo-max. Bernie had it all, a successful insurance business, money, cars, woman, anything he wanted, Bernie could have. But while he was at the max of his life, he was also at the lo. Under this gilded facade, lied a troubled soul. What drives such a man, to such depths? My only gripe, is that the director was not able to delve more into the past of Bernie. Rumor has it that the original script was not so much a story, but an epic, rivaling such classics as Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and putting to shame The Best Years of Our Lives. In the movie, as well as in real life, Bernie touched the lives of many. Larry and Ricard were two cogs of corporate society, trying to claw their way to the top. Little did they know that Bernie had other plans. However, as I watched the movie, I wondered to myself How can we blame him? Today's society has corrupted us all, and all Bernie wanted to do was protect his interests. If anything, Richard and Larry are the real villains of this film. They allowed themselves to be subjected to oppression of today' business world. After all, did they not parade Bernie's corpse around for personal gain? In the end, I've learned so much from Weekend at Bernie's. What you see as silly, mindless entertainment, I see as a masterpiece of cinema. Don't let yourself be persuaded otherwise. Please, for your sake, and mine, see this film. It will change your life.

It turns out their Bernie is actually stealing from the company and invite them both to his house to have them both killed. However, Bernie is the one who ends up dead.

What does matter is that this movie is an absolute scream!Larry (superbly played by Andrew McCarthy) is my fave but Richard (Jonathan Silverman) also manages to amuse me with his inability to make up his mind. And I have to salute Terry Kiser, the best dead body I've ever seen!Ok it's already been pointed out that it isn't exactly the most realistic plot in the world. I mean, you usually would know if you were sitting next to a rotting, ice-cold corpse. But even so, it's a movie (!), and you don't really question sci-fi flics for being unrealistic do you? So why criticize this one for it.The movie had a good build-up and showed an impressive flow of interesting characters, i.e. the party goers were a hoot. Also Larry and Richard show an amazing ability to work under pressure and come up with various clever solutions how to keep Bernie on the move. What you essentially need to see Weekend at Bernie's is an open mind and a very strong sense of humour. Because of all the gags about dead bodies it may be offensive to some, especially those who get hung up on the need for realism. I however am not such a person therefor I continue to watch it and laugh my a$$ off.My rating 9½ / 10 "},{"Title":"Good 80's Comedy!","Date":"25 May 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman, Terry Kiser, Catherine Mary Stewart and Don Calfa star in this 1989 comedy. Richard Parker (Silverman) and Larry Wilson (McCarthy) are 2 New York guys who discover false policies written for the insurance company they work for. They inform their boss, Bernie Lomax (Kiser) and he rewards them by inviting them to his island beach house for Labor Day weekend. It turns out Bernie is the one stealing from the company and decides to have them killed. Bernie is killed instead before Richard and Larry arrive. They soon discover that Bernie is dead, but try making him look alive where he's still the life of the party. Stewart (The Last Starfighter) plays Gwen, Richard's co-worker & love interest, Calfa (Return of the Living Dead) plays Paulie, a mob thug sent to kill Bernie and the film's director, Ted Kotcheff (First Blood) also makes an appearance as Richard's father.

When I eventually rented the VHS tape a few months later it really appealed to my dark sense of humor and I ended up watching it a zillion times. In the 25 years since its release it has become very dated. It's not dated BADLY, but it has aged more than other films of the period.Corporate slackers Richard and Larry (Ted Mosby prototype Jonathan Silverman and 80s person Andrew McCarthy) discover a $4,000,000 fraud hidden away in the cooked books. Their attempt to impress their boss Bernie Lomax (a lovably smug Terry Kiser) with their find leads to an invitation to his Hampton Island home for a summer weekend of babes, booze, and boats. The duo don't realize that they've stumbled on Bernie's embezzlement scam and that he intends to have them quietly killed by the Mob (the organized crime connections are never fully detailed or understood). Mob Boss Vito instead arranges for Bernie to be killed, thus washing his hands of him.Upon arriving at Bernie's lavish home Richard and Larry discover that he ain't quite breathing and most definitely has ceased living. For a variety of reasons they plot to create the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which proves to be easier done than said as his vacuous, drunken neighbors are more interested in drinking his champagne and mooching parties from him than actually being friends.Despite the dark subject matter Weekend at Bernie's plays it safe for the most part, never pushing past its PG-13 boundaries. The physicality of Kiser's performance is impressive as well as funny. You really do believe he is dead and he's brilliant at keeping a straight face (or a smirking one as he dies during a brief moment of pleasure) while being tossed and thrown around. You wouldn't think that playing a dead body would be hard but Kiser's comic timing and skill really pay off.The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears.What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family-friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Skip the sequel. Enjoy this movie for what it is, though it could have been better if it were a few shades darker. And lookout for a hilarious cameo from the director as Richard's dad/butler.

The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of Hampton Island to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities.As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community.

It begins with a very hot day, and I was just watching it at one hot summer. Its atmosphere is so light, like a real weekend yet for only an hour and a half.There is something innocent, charming, and so nostalgic about the 1980s. I don't know exactly, but definitely it was aesthetically nicer and calmer. It's my nature to love that polished painting with all its sweet tinges out of those day's movies. God, what's about the 1980s to adore it like that? Hmm.. I'll look to the enjoyable little movie to understand..There is intensive sense of beauty all over it, like the bright colors of the sets or the swim suits, and the bodies in the swim suits as well !, so the sightly villa (great presence for the sea in the background most of the time). Look at the apartment of the 1960s' décor too, it got some snug decision. Even (Catherine Mary Stewart) herself, she was representing perfectly the 1980s' beauty as tender and too cute, (just like 'Cynthia Gibb' from the same era) you can say that again about her shape, haircut, and of course clothes, I'm a crazy person when it comes to the 1980s' vivid modes, so how about seeing her into that dazzling swim suit, I think.. It's only in the 1980s ! Plus, there was no dirty jokes, bad tasting, and no nastiness. Truly this movie looks genius to make a pure laughable time through what's supposed to be dark element, and without the usual tons of filthiness of our very own age where whenever you're about to watch a comedy you must think abusive ! The script handled it well as for a 90 min movie. It was good and plain. They consumed all the possible situations yet without extension or any huge ambitions demand huger budget. One of the best ideas was that desperate killer whom kills the same target again and again to watch him alive and kicking afterwards every time. However there was some kind of straying before the climax, as we were watching a chase of unseen killer ! In a long sequence without even music?, moreover knowing everything through the recorded phone call, that was easy to a cheesy extent !, and finally I didn't quite like (or catch on) the successful sex with the dead man ?! (Jonathan Silverman) and (Andrew McCarthy) made a fine job, but they weren't that charismatic, nor that creatively comedians. (Terry Kiser) was maybe half of the show as Mr. scene stealer all along. He totally mastered it as a dead-man in-a-comedy, only to compete with (Vincent Gardenia) in the great comedy (Fire Sale - 1977). I think (Kiser) here was something all the method acting's schools must watch and learn. I loved, the most, the last scene, it was hilarious and epitomized the whole thing gracefully.Maybe one of the movie's secrets is that great chance which it gives you to live the ultimate revenge on your boss (the one who conspired to have you killed !).In one week, I watched (Superman 3 - 1983), (Police Academy 6 - 1989), (Short Circuit 2 - 1988), then (Weekend at Bernie's - 1989). It is heaven already for one of the eighties lovers. And if you're not, just watch (Weekend..) in a summer day with your fan turned on, and believe me, you'll feel the sea breath coming out of the screen to cool you off.The worst thing about it is that after finishing it I would come back to my usual life which's close to Bernie's one..

Maybe it's just the comical originality of the plot that made it stand out among 80's comedies for me.  What I truly love about this movie is that it's one where you can sit back and relax without putting any deep concentration into the plot...which can be a breath of fresh air at times.  I tend to be a sucker for this genre if you will.The story starts by introducing us to the main characters, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard, (Jonathon Silverman) two lovable losers who are tired of being the bottom-feeders of their company.  But after discovering that an employee is embezzling money, they notify their boss, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser).  As a debt of gratitude, he invites them to his weekend beach house on Hampton Island.  But when they arrive, they discover he's dead.  The movie gets more and more hilarious from there on as they spend the weekend pretending that he didn't die.This flick has so many funny moments that I don't know where to begin.  I loved how Larry and Richard tied their shoelaces to Bernie's in order to get him places, and how Larry smashed the champagne bottle over the head of the gardener who he thought was trying to kill him (every man has his breaking point) That's slapstick at it's finest.  Also, I found it hysterical how stupid the people on the island were.  Not one of them ever had a single clue that Lomax was dead even though two guys were carrying him around 24 hours a day. However, my favourite was the rivalry between the deceased Bernie and paranoid mob-hitman Paulie, who, after enjoying the fact the Bernie was dead numerous times, discovered the next moment he was still alive.  Incidentally, it was Bernie who spelled Paulie's downfall in the end.  Funny.This film is not to be taken seriously, and if you take it seriously, you take life too seriously.  It's one of my personal favourites, and the only reason it doesn't get a higher rating is because my reviews do not rely solely on entertainment.

The cast is rather good in this one as Andrew McCarthy is rather good in his role as the more slacker friend. Johnathon Silverman is his usual self too. No one else of real note stars in this movie, however the guy who did Bernie was rather good when he was alive and dead.

When I was a kid I remember it coming out in theaters and being a fairly popular film, but not being really interested at the time. I was eight and considering 'Ninja Turtles', 'Batman', and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' all came out that year, I can guess why a random comedy title with no action figures to sell it to children took the backseat (Although 'Last Crusade' of the three, still holds up and, ironically, had no action figures). However, several years later, mid-nineties, I caught the finale of the sequel (probably on USA Network), I was in full 80's retro mode, and what I saw was enjoyable enough for me to want to look up the '89 original.Based on situational (the sit in sitcom) humor, rather than slapstick, or non-sequitir), I laughed at several of the jokes the first couple of viewings, but what really makes this one stand the test of time are the unique underpinnings of the story, in which death itself actually becomes the joke.This may or may not be intentional, again it's played as a lighthearted comedy where mob assassins (the great Don Calfa ('Return of the Living Dead'1984) are depicted as bumbling buffoons who can't recognize corpses, but that's also an interesting aspect of the story. NO ONE notices that Bernie (Terry Kiser, Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood1987, Three's Company1977) is deceased, despite the obviousness of it. We laugh at the notion that Richard (Jonathan Silverman) and Larry's (Andrew McCarthy) inventive but still unabashedly idiotic plan to make it appear as if their boss is alive, succeeds to a degree, but it's a sad epitaph for Bernie Lomax, a thieving and probably compulsive broker and financier, whose greed seems to have afforded him much popularity, but no friends to go along with it, which casts lowly, struggling desk-jockeys Richard and Larry in an even more sympathetic light.Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy are great as the two often clueless friends who stumble over an accounting error, and thinking that someone is embezzling money from Lomax's firm, they report it to good ol' Bern, who turns out to be the culprit. Bernie invites them over for a weekend at his luxurious island beach house with the intention of killing them, however Bernie's mob ties catch up with him and the guys arrive to find their boss dead. What to do, what to do...It's got a good soundtrack and score, and the island (filmed at Bald Head Island, NC) is beautiful. Also features the awesome Catherine Mary Stewart, of the cult classic 'Night of the Comet' (1984), in a small role as Richard's love interest, Gwen... and a hilariously evil kid obsessed with giving the dead a proper burial.Funny and unique comedy. If you've got the balls to look death in the face and LAUGH at his cheap wig, check out 'Weekend at Bernie's'. I also highly recommend the sequel, which forays into the supernatural (i.e. zombies and voodoo).

I was also seventeen then,so I've sometimes wondered if I'd care for this much now(I'm not sure,but it seems I'd seen this intermittently in the years since,but I don't recall sitting through this in at least a decade). My answer isyes,but only in the sense that it's great,seemingly brain-dead(pun unintended)slapstick that can cleanse the palate,particularly after watching dark,disturbing material or if one is need of a pick-me-up.For some odd reason,the producers decided(And were able to get the stars to reunite)to make a sequel which was released in 1993.

Praising them for spotting cash being stolen from the business,Lomax offers Wilson & Parker to join him at his seaside beach house for the weekend. Accepting the offer,the guys get set for a well-deserved break.Unknown to Wilson and Parker,Lomax is actually the person behind the irregularities.Wanting to keep things quiet,Lomax talks to gangsters Vito and Marty,and asks them to kill Wilson and Parker at his beach house.Unhappy with how Lomax has treated them,the gangsters decide to kill Lomax.Arriving on the island with dreams of sun,sea and girls,Parker & Wilson begin to think that they will have to change their plans,when they enter the beach house and discover Lomax's dead body.View on the filmPlacing the boys in the middle of The City director Ted Kotcheff (who also has a very funny cameo) and cinematographer François Protat gives Lomax house and office a decadent appearance,with the endless sun and shining mirrors blinding Parker & Wilson from seeing any danger be reflected.Along with packing the screen with gorgeous bikini-clad girls,Kotcheff gives the title a sharp black Comedy edge,thanks to the wild slap-stick being threaded to Wilson and Parker's desperate attempt to make Lomax look revived.Opening with the guys being down on their luck,the first half of the screenplay by Robert Klane hilariously show Wilson and Parker's desire to move up the corporate ladder,by constantly going back and forth over if they should report their great bosses death,or if they should continuing to pretend he is alive.As the guys take increasingly drastic measures to cover Lomax's murder,Klane struggles to keep the fresh atmosphere of the slap-stick drying up,as Parker and Wilson start to go round in circles that become increasingly worn out.Whilst he does look like a mannequin,the scenes of Bernie being thrown out of the building and falling flat on his face were actually done by a real stuntman-who broke some ribs during filming! Joined by a sassy Catherine Mary Stewart as Gwen Saunders, Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman give great performances as Wilson & Parker,with McCarthy laying charismatic laid-back charms on Wilson,which is counted by the biting his fingernails fear that Silverman grips Parker in,as they head off for a murderous weekend with Bernie.

They ignore his dead body when bodacious babes come into their sight. Otherwise, they use him as a prop to have fun at parties. They are primarily concerned with their own primal instincts, rather than the safety of others. By others I mean the Boss' mistress who ends up having sex with his dead corpse. This is necrophelia, and is illegal, although she had no idea (???). Sure, there are many plot holes (rigor mortis anyone?

In fact the opening sequence with the trip to beach itself sets the initial expectations high.Catherine Mary Stewart provides the eye candy throughout the movie, 80s style, and also serves up a decent performance. heheThe movie in fact follows through with one funny scene after the other taking a swipe at corporate America, the mafia, the glitterati etc.Then Bernie dies,....... and the movie gets even funnier as one after the other we are subjected to people interacting with Bernie as if he were actually alive.Hell I would like to go as far as saying that Bernie did better when he was dead then when he was alive.The movie peaks when Bernie meets his mistress and gives one of the best performance of his lives. That scene will clearly be one of the most memorable scenes in comedy movie history.However we do have a few memorable sequences such as the drunk bargaining, the parents house etc.Unfortunately it all goes downhill from there, with the abusive, bratty kid providing the only relief, when we are subjected to scene after scene of the same variety (oxymoron).This movie does the cardinal sin of the one joke movie and doesn't realise when to quit.

It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain.Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living.Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is playing Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown.The plot Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings.Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him.They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him.The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies.What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent.Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right.Starring Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by Ted Kotcheff.

The Police Academy series will be remembered for producing one or two fun (if daft) films before the series turned farcical in how dire it was. With Weekend at Bernie's, the pattern was repeated, albeit on a smaller scale. The reason is that before eventually producing a shocking sequel, the original would begin as a laid back comedy which would eventually loose direction and loose all appeal three quarters of the way through.In Weekend at Bernie's, two friends, Larry and Richard, are invited to spend the weekend at the beach house of their boss Bernie Lomax. Before their arrival however, Bernie is murdered. Fearing they might be next, and being highly aware of just how little people are noticing Lomax's state of health, the two friends decide to present Bernie as being alive and well. From this moment onwards, Bernie's corpse is battered, tangled and beaten as the two friends resort to obscure ways to keep up the appearance of life in Lomax.I remember watching this film many years ago and loving it. I think when I was younger, the satire of materialism never occured to me as I was more concerned with the juvenile ways in which Bernie Lomax's dead body was treated. This film made me laugh a lot, and I think that was partly why I'd bought it mid 2003. If memory serves me correctly, I'd seen it for cheap in a shop and been reminded of how it had made me feel. Skip forward then to June 2004 and my views on this piece of cinema have changed slightly. I confess here and now that for aspects of this film, I did find myself laughing. Weekend at Bernie's begins as a good film, setting up characters and the hidden potentials well. Sadly though, after the first half of this film, it begins to dip as the jokes start to dry up. It feels like the creators of this film realised that there were only so many jokes which could be made with a dead body, and yet they chose to ignore this and repeat themselves. From the moment the two friends adventures in the film turn from trying to enjoy themselves to trying to stay alive, the film looses something in it's interpretation. This is a huge shame really. Whilst the decade of the 1980s didn't have anything particularly great going for them, there were a few comedies which really had potential. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off, we were presented with a warm hearted comedy which delivered brilliantly, in contrast with that film though, Weekend at Bernie's feels lacking in it's potential and a slight disappointment.All in all, if your at a friends house and they suggest to you that you should watch Weekend at Bernie's, then nod enthusiastically and enjoy the first half of the film. Just remember to have some cards or something else to do for when the film goes downhill though. Disappointing "},{"Title":"Genius.

Nostalgia sets in with the fashions and the music of its era, and familiar faces re-appear after we have seen their careers gradually collapse. Unfortunately for Ted Kotcheff's Weekend at Bernie's, it is the same cringe-inducing, one-joke farce it was 24 years ago. There was a real chance for some dark comedy here, given that the set up isn't a bad idea if you have the correct writers behind it. However, Norman Mailer did not write Weekend at Bernie's, Robert Klane did, and he was responsible for such classics as National Lampoon's European Vacation (1985), Folks! (1992), and, most unforgivably, Weekend at Bernie's II (1993).Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) are two young, eager lower-level employees at a New York insurance firm. When Richard discovers that an employee has stolen 2 million dollars from the company, he and Larry think they're on their way to a promotion and take the findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser). As a reward, Bernie invites them to stay at his island beach-house, but secretly, Bernie is behind the theft and has hired a mob hit-man to take them both out. However, Bernie himself is assassinated for sleeping with the mob boss' wife, and with party-seeking friends quickly turning up at the beach- house, Larry and Richard must maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive and well if they want to party.It seems strange that their has never been (to my mind) a decent comedy involving a dead body. Perhaps the presence of a cadaver is too macabre a subject to raise any laughs, or, as with Weekend at Bernie's, there's not much you can do with it apart from move its limbs and head in an attempt to squeeze out some laughs. And that pretty much sums up this film, raising the question of how moronic can these people be to not realise Bernie is dead? Perhaps it's because, inexplicably, rigor mortis fails to set in at any point and his bowels do not drop. This may even be forgiven if we had anyone to root for, but, as hard as McCarthy and Silverman try, their characters are nothing more than incompetent goofballs chasing that ever-so-80's dream of climbing the corporate ladder. 100 minutes of pure pain.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"AWFUL!","Date":"8 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I liked this  movie when I was a little kid but then I watched it again a few weeks ago and I was so bored with it.

The premise--two wacky guys try to pretend their dead boss is not only still alive, but still the life of the party--may sound like it has potential on paper. But once the title character dies we suddenly realize that there is not much more you can do with a dead body than carry it around, move its head back and forth, wave its arms in the air, and so on. And that's exactly what happens here. For about an hour and a half.Andrew McCarthy shows some genuine talent playing the smarmy smooth-operator Larry, and Jonathan Silverman is equally adept as Larry's straight-arrow buddy, Richard. Even Terry Kiser is about as good at playing a dead guy as anyone could hope for. But in the end, this is a physical comedy, an action-oriented film, and the only action possible is for McCarthy and Silverman to carry a limp Kiser around while attempting to make funny remarks about what they are doing. Excessive performances by other characters, particularly the party-goers and mob killer, only serve to remind us that this is the comedic equivalent of a melodrama that has no plot.Perhaps with a more intelligent screenplay and a little less reliance on physical comedy Weekend at Bernie's could have had potential.

The movie is solely based on the one joke of a guy being dead, and no one noticing it. This might have worked if it was considerably shorter(like, an hour and a half shorter, if not more) but it just isn't funny when it's put into a two hour movie. Normally I love black humor, but this was just way too far out. The whole joke depends on everyone in the vicinity, who sees the body being total retards, and that just seems like a stretch. The plot is far-fetched and hardly funny(at all). The characters are walking, talking cliches. The actors all lack any charisma or on-screen chemistry(with each other). The humor relies solely on a lot of mix-ups, one more ridiculous and unrealistic than the other; yes, arguably, a lot of comedies use unrealistic scenes or plot items, however, the movie lacks any sort of realism at all, it might as well have taken place in outer space, that wouldn't have made it any more far-fetched. The whole dead guy who everyone thinks is alive is just not that funny, especially because when he was alive, he seemed to be walking and talking constantly, yet no one suspects anything when he suddenly stops reacting. The movie has so many ridiculous and unfunny scenes that it's hard to keep count of them. Some of the humor is also slap-stick, and while I've never liked slap-stick, I can honestly say that it has been done so much better, so many times. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless I seriously loathe them, and want them to experience the horror of this pile of crap. Avoid at all costs, and I DO mean ALL COSTS. 1/10 "},{"Title":"Slow and ultra predictable.

Everything happens 10 seconds after you already know it's going to happen - but then is not quite as funny as you imagined it.Apparently written/directed/edited by people who've never done comedy before, unless was simply a pacing problem due to lack of script - like a half hour episode that was padded out to be much longer. Every shot seems to have the pre- and post-roll frames kept in, like they didn't have any choice in editing due to a lack of material.The two leads are untrained, unseasoned and unbearable, and the writer doesn't seem to have been allowed time to finish or given a script editor. Style doesn't even redeem itself for its age, as there are plenty of contemporaneous black comedies/dumb comedies from its period that are paced and have enough jokes to fill a movie - you know, comedy movies written by experienced comedy writers, performed by skilled comedy players - those guys you have to pay fees to.A quick note on the baffling following this movie has - what's intolerable is not that some say they enjoyed it (each to their own, I've no problem with that), it's the hyperbole people use, praising it to the extent they give the impression they believe the memorability of the film was deliberate, as if the movie makers might count themselves amongst those who find the movie funny. Seriously, this movie paid mortgages, guys, it didn't make people proud (or laugh). The 2 leads barely worked again, and neither did the writer. Why? Because they suck. Obviously. Get a grip!Bottom line - were you stoned (or 10) when you watched this? Then try watching it again - especially before coming here and telling people it's good.I've laughed more at a funeral.

Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible.For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast.I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.
