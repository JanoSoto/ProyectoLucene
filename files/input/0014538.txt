My favorite was the chariot race held in the sand. That had a number of clever things in the segment. The brief bit with the lion was funny, too, sort of a parody of the Biblical story of Daniel in the lion's den.They were smart only going five minutes or so with each age and then going back with the story each time. Each age had four or five segments in total.Nothing hilarious but definitely worth your time if you are checking out silent film comedies "},{"Title":"Underappreciated Keaton Comedy","Date":"18 May 2000","Score":"17 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Loosely intended as a satire of D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a full length comedy feature.  The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening book scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film. Keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it didn't succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three two-reelers. Fortunately, The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's film.  There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines.  They are simple boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl plots, but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre.  However, I don't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy.  No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best.  In addition, Wallace Beery's appearance as Keaton's rival adds to this film's appeal. Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920's cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie.

It does not have quite the number of sustained chase/stunt sequences as in most of Keaton's features, but instead there are a lot of fine subtle gags of all different kinds.In each of the Three Ages, Buster and Wallace Beery vie for the affections of the same woman, with amusing and unpredictable results.  The simple romantic triangle theme sets up a lot of good material, on the one hand lending itself to a lot of gags about the unchanging nature of romantic courtship, and on the other hand being used for a lot of deliberate anachronisms that are often extremely funny.  Beery makes a nice foil for Keaton, and the girl's parents also have some good moments.This one usually gets lost in the crowd among so many brilliant Keaton masterpieces, but it works very well and is definitely worth seeing for any fan of silent comedy.

I'm beginning to think that we all need to see a lot of him, which is why I wandered into this. It seems to have been made only because they had access to a Roman set. The setup is that a courtship story is presented in three eras a cave-man setup, a Roman context and a modern one. All are based on film notions of those eras of course. Unlike most movie humor of the time, the joke here isn't in embellishing the story with humorous decoration. Its in the difference among the stories. Its a clever piece of what I call folding, and you will see at least one scene here that I swear is quoted in Rashomon.So there's the idea of the thing, which is worthwhile, but now I've explained it, you hardly have to see it. The jokes are trite. But there is one scene that I recall over and over. I think Keaton did it elsewhere and several others too, but here it is the best.He's driving a car, a rickety one to his girl's house. (This is in the modern setting, obviously.) He hits a bump and the car falls to pieces. And I just don't mean the wheels fall off, the car quite literally disassembles into the parts that went into the factory and there he sits among hundreds of items. I have no idea how he did this. The car really is moving as a car, and then in an instant it is in pieces.Wonderful.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

In fact, he plays it rather safe, like a swimmer putting his foot in the water before he makes a dive. Unlike his next film Our Hospitality (1923), this movie feels more like an extension of the collection of two reelers he made in the first three years of the 1920s.The film's structure is meant to lampoon that of DW Griffith's mammoth epic Intolerance (1916). The entire movie has three parallel stories showcasing Buster's attempts to win a young lady in three different periods prehistory, the Roman empire, and the then modern day. In each period he does battle with Wallace Beery over the girl, whose parents always find Beery a worthier mate. In the end, Beery is always revealed as a brute and it's up to Buster to rescue the girl from his evil designs.Most of the gags in the prehistoric and Roman ages are anachronistic, such as IDs on stone tablets and a sun dial wristwatch. They're cute, but not terribly funny. There are still some good bits of slapstick though, such as a chariot race, Buster's unplanned fall from a roof, and some funny antics at a restaurant. The sets in the Roman age are marvelous too.The leading lady Margaret Leahy is adequate. She was a beauty contest winner originally meant to play a supporting role in Norma Talmadge's Within the Law (1923), however, her lack of acting ability caused Norma to push her onto her brother-in-law Keaton, since it was believed one did not need an acting ability to do well in a comedy. While she's not nearly as charming as someone like Sybil Seely or Kathryn McGuire, Leahy is all right, just a little wooden. She leaves no impression, but then again, the love interest role in most Keaton films is thankless anyway.All in all, this film is decent. This is without a doubt one of the lesser BK pictures, but it's still a cute romp.

Buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages the Stone Age, The Roman Age, and the Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different ages. In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the caveman stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat, two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as Mel Brooks' History of the World Part I. The underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing Although the times may have-a-changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to win the girl (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's modern times to now.

Although I do love The General considered one of the greatest comedies of all time, I find Three Ages far more dynamic, funny, interesting and way better than 1926's classic.Keaton's target here is love and its definition in a humored and simple presentation. He takes us through three different eras in history to show the challenges a romantic man (all played by Buster) has to go through while fighting for the woman of his dreams (Margaret Leahy), the ones he truly loves. The story of love is presented in a Pre-Historic period, then at the Roman Empire and last in the present day at the time of the movie's release, 1920's. It's the same issue presented again and again, just the problems that vary a little. Love, l'amour, amor all we need in times of need, greed and speed. It was the goal back at millions of years ago, still is in our current time and always will be in future times.I admire Three Ages for its intelligence, a movie that directly or indirectly was the source of inspiration of many posterior films, successful or not. This is like Bill Forsyth's Being Human but with humor; and just like History of the World - Part I but only about love's evolution. Can we say that the famous between McFly versus Tannen through three different periods are somewhat similar than this film? Yes, I think so. Keaton fights against Wallace Beery in all the historic periods just like Michael J. Fox will deal with Thomas F. Wilson in 1955, 1985 and 2015 in Zemeckis classic.Forget all this conjectures; let us focus on the content. It's funny and gets funnier by the minute. Hilarious moments that can be found here are the priceless chariot race where Keaton uses of his geniality to win the race; his friendship with a lion that was supposed to eat him; the amazing stunts he pulls in the final moments of the last segment, jumping between buildings; his fighting schemes to defeat his cavemen enemies. Everything is so well made that is impossible not feel something with it. And there's a good and amusing discussion of what love really is and how its concept changes just a little with time and evolution (the very last moment explains it all). Gotta love this funny and precious gem. 10/10 "}{"Title":"Not one of Buster's Best","Date":"24 July 2009","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" For me, Keaton's decision to make a parody of Griffith's Intolerance so that if the feature (his first) failed he could re-edit and release it as three two-reelers is what diminishes the enjoyment for me. The film jumps back and forth between the three time periods, and so all of them seem to be over before they've really begun, and the film has something of a disjointed feel. Perhaps this is because the film does actually feel as if it is three two-reelers spliced together rather than an actual feature.The comedy is unevenly paced, but when it hits the mark it is near-perfect. Highlights include Keaton's drunken encounter with Wallace Beery, other diners, and a crab at a restaurant, and the jaw-dropping leap from one roof to another at what looks like hundreds of feet above the ground (apparently the buildings were short sets placed on a bridge overlooking a view of Los Angeles. Just as well, because Keaton failed to make the leap successfully and fell from the second building, a real-life mishap that remains in the film). Keaton slides through a window, across a room, down a pole (at this point we realise he is in a fire station although he doesn't) and lands on the back of a fire engine that returns him to the police station from which he has just escaped. The whole sequence is both side-splitting and astounding. The look on Keaton's face as he looks quizzically up at the pole he has just descended is priceless. Perhaps because of his status as a comic genius we tend to forget how good an actor Keaton was .I liked the modern sequence best, and had it been released as a short I believe it would be considered one of his classics. The caveman sequence is OK, but the Roman era story tends to drag.It's been well publicised that this was competition winner Margaret Leahy's only film because she was so untalented as an actress, and it's true she doesn't light any fires while on-screen. But the impact of her ineptitude in front of the camera is cleverly avoided by the likes of Keaton and Beery merely acting around her as if she were just another prop.Overall, this isn't one of Keaton's best - although that is probably because this is his first feature. Keaton himself thought it was just OK and, given his instinctive sense for what works, perhaps that should tell us all we need to know...

Griffith could have made any movie he wanted to after the enormous financial success of The Birth of a Nation; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date, Intolerance. He took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form, and the well-known financial train wreck resulted. Buster Keaton doesn't take that kind of a risk with Three Ages, a parody of Intolerance. This is Keaton's first feature-length film of his own (he only acted in The Saphead). He had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this feature into three separate shorts, which Griffith did do with Intolerance. Keaton didn't have to. Chaplin had already succeeded with feature-length comedies, so if Keaton was taking a risk here, it was completely calculated.Chaplin had already done a parody of another film, too, with Burlesque on Carmen (1915). Keaton appears to allude to that parody, as well. The wrestling scene in the Ancient Rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in Chaplin's burlesque. The comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same, too. Furthermore, Chaplin's film imitated the glossy style of DeMille's Carmen, and Chaplin's film seemed a tribute to that film. Keaton doesn't attempt the radical editing, narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody, but it seems respectful of Intolerance nonetheless. At least, the stories aren't told completely straightforward as in other Intolerance-inspired works, such as Dreyer's Leaves from Satan's Book (Blade af Satans bog, 1921) and Fritz Lang's Destiny (Der Müde Tod, 1921). There is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes.Where Keaton did take risks, however, is in his physical, daredevil comedy. That's Keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode. Reportedly, he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again. And, it wasn't just Keaton who took risks; the anachronistic baseball gag, for example, was rather dangerous. Thus, although in a different way, Keaton, like Griffith, took risks with his big film. And, I think they both succeeded.

He made three twenty-minute stories with the idea he could always release them as separate shorts if the feature idea didn't pan out. The problem with this is the high bar set by other Buster shorts, like The High Sign and The Scarecrow. Only the '20s section contains material you'd expect from such a master. The Roman section has a funny scene with a lion which is nevertheless underdeveloped, while the caveman stuff is a subtle as a club in the head.Despite the unevenness of the feature, you kind of need the three sections running together for their context. Like how Joe Roberts as the girl's father is the heavy in the first two sections, but a meek servant of his stern wife's will in the modern-day story. Or how a Ben-Hur style chariot race devolves into a football scrimmage when we move along in time.The 1920s section is, like I said, the best part here. While the historical-period stuff may be parodying D. W. Griffith's Intolerance, I get the feeling Buster here is playing off the work of fellow screen clown Harold Lloyd, whose never-say-die gumption Buster mimics to nearly tragic effect. Like Lloyd, Buster just won't quit. One attempted building-leap stunt, which actually went wrong in filming but was kept, works in retrospect because it's the sort of thing you always expected would happen to Lloyd, but never did, at least when the cameras were rolling.I also love Buster's five-minute drunk act in a restaurant, which includes some funny Prohibition humor. A woman sitting next to Buster starts to fix her make-up, so Buster whips out some shaving cream right there and joins her. Buster unknowingly orders crab, then freaks when the boiled crustacean is brought to his table.The other segments work just well enough as excuses for gags, even when the gags are somewhat thin in places. Leahy's a bit of a lump as the leading lady; apparently her career after this wasn't much more than Buster's other leading lady Brown Eyes from Go West enjoyed. Leahy does sell one good joke, her final scene in the Stone Age sequence. Beery's a bit too heavy for this role; one wishes Roberts had been given the job instead.Overall, I like the film; it's funny in an unassuming way, and better than many other history spoofs of more recent vintage. Still, Three Ages is best viewed today as a placeholder for much better Buster work to come.

Most of the jokes are lame and they were lame and predictable even by 1923 standards, after all Keaton himself had done better work and devised more spectacular and amazing physical stunts and gags in his previous work, and try as it might, Three Ages simply can't compete for entertainment factor with something like The High Sign, Cops or The Electric House.The three segments, each taking place in the Stone Age, ancient Rome and modern times, overlap one after the other, which means we go back and forth from one age to the other instead of each playing in its entirety. But unavoidably, as the story calls for Keaton to rehash the same plot in each story to prove the flimsy premise that the only constant in human history is love, the three segments are predictable and not even their juxtaposition and anachronisms are good for a laugh. When Keaton ups the ante in the final reel, Three Ages comes closer to hitting the mark, but whereas the buildup in one-reelers was ten minutes, here it's more than half an hour.
