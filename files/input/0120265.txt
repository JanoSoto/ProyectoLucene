We can see him drive around in his jeep, in a wasteland near Tehran. He stops from time to time, in order to ask people if they would like to do a little job for him. But even the money he eagerly offers does not help him to inspire their confidence People are on their guards against this queer middle-aged man, who is obviously just looking for a homosexual pick-up.It takes a whole while until he finally reveals his secret He is determined to commit suicide and has already dug a hole in the earth where he wants his body to be buried. The only thing that worries him now is that he needs somebody to fill up his grave.Now that we know what he is after our interest must inevitably concentrate on the reasons for his death wish. But, strangely enough, none explanation whatsoever is  offered.Such a contravention of audience expectation has led to a massive rejection of the movie. Even renowned critics like Roger Ebert find it excruciatingly boring and rather helplessly ask themselves whether it wouldn't help to know more about Badii.But doesn't the mere fact that, for most of the movie's running time, we just see a car driving in the wasteland give us a clue about its signification and therefore the answer we are looking for?This wasteland is a barren landscape, its dusty vastness inspires nothing but sadness. Its dryness is the opposite of life; fertility seems impossible in such an arid and joyless desert. It is therefore the ideal background for any suicide attempt.As we do not get any psychological information about Badii and the reasons for his death wish are not revealed, we must look for other means of expression. The significance of a true work of art is not necessarily to be found in explicit words. If the main character does not speak we therefore must have a closer look at the landscape that surrounds him in order to find a hidden meaning.In the first part of the jeep's journey we can only notice its utter desolation. Then, when Badii has finally found a man that seems to be willing to cooperate, a surprising change takes place Green trees and bushes emerge and, along with the now audible twittering of birds, give sign of life. At the same time the man in the car, who only accepted Badii's offer because of economic reasons, sings life's praises in order to make Badii discover not only the taste of cherries but also renounce his suicide plan.The portrayal of landscape seems to reflect the inner state of the characters the desolate hopelessness of a suicide candidate is followed by an uncompromisingly positive attitude to life. And, significantly, this replacement is actually provoked by the picked-up man, as it was him who told Badii to take the detour.The same contrast is also present in the penultimate scene. We see Badii lying down in his grave, and then the screen is invaded by complete darkness. This must definitely be the end, we feel, Badii's death wish after all has triumphed. But once again Kiarostami wondrously succeeds in surprising us. We hear the noise of rain, it is flooding down upon the dry wasteland. And although the movie in the end does not offer a clear answer, there is at least a ray of hope This rain may come just in time to instil new life into a dried up human soul.

Instead, I wound up fascinated.  The state can't help Mr. Badii, the church can't help him...and even though nature, in the form of Mr. Bagheri, tries, we do not know if it succeeds. Absolutely fascinating.  It shows that a director doesn't need $200,000,000 and a raft of special effects and explosions to make a good film.As for the shot-on-video ending, it's entirely possible that it's there to appease the Iranian censors.  Look!  Here's Mr. Badii!  Alive and well. It's just a movie!  Another subtle commentary on the state of affairs in Iran today, I'll wager.  At least, that's how I chose to see it.It seems to me that the title reflects Douglas Adams' techniques for flying--fall, and then distract yourself so that you don't hit the ground. It's not that the taste of cherry makes life worth living, per se, it's that simple things can distract you from your cares.This movie was well-shot, well-directed, well-acted, and well-written.

Kiarostami uses a simple cinematic style consisting of real-time long takes and basic cutting between two characters (the only conversations are between two people at a time) but his camera always seems to be in the exact place it needs to be, capturing both the close-up nuances of the actors and their smallness against the Iranian landscape. (Many of the exterior shots are of a lone Range Rover driving on the outskirts of an unnamed city.) The elegant story concerns a man (Mr. Badii, played with a haunting lyricism by Homayon Ershadi) wishing to commit suicide and trying to find someone who will assist him by arriving the next day to see if he is alive or dead. He selects only men he determines to be in a state of financial crisis and who are dedicated to their families or their religion and to whom payment will bring relief. Each man rejects the notion of suicide, representing, in turn, fear of the unknown, religious and moral conviction, and faith in the goodness of life; and although Mr. Badii gives no reason for his desire to die, irregardless of his unhappiness it's clear he wishes to return to the earth which has borne humankind. Kiarostami refuses to pass judgment against his gentle characters' decisions, giving each person respect and dignity even when they're unable to put their convictions into meaningful words they're good men asked to assume an enormous responsibility they do not understand. The film concludes with subtle, beautiful ambiguity (we never learn Mr. Badii's fate and the coda is an odd excerpt of the filmmakers at work) and its power is a result of the reflection that comes afterward. A unique experience, not to be missed.

This is probably of his fresh use of ideas and spiritual/humanism way to directing and writing his films. His work, according to the director himself, is reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky (who had made the most spiritual films ever made), Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Theo Angelopoulos and Frederico Fellini (although I would also add directors like, Yasujiro Ozu) who want the audience to let the film live in their minds soons after, letting them fill some details of the story. This technique reminds me both of the short stories of Anton Chekhov and South-Asian Minimalism, such as the 'Palm-Hands Stories' of Yasunari Kawabata (Nobel-Prize laureate), where less is more. His methods of rubbing the line between fiction and nonfiction is an excellent way, a common theme in his films. Taste of Cherry is one of his best films (then again, I have only seen four of them). It is also very demanding, especially the ending, which might be a disappointment (he did made a alternate ending, though, without that video thing at the end, as an experiment in one festival screening). There are many things to notice in this film (1) The helicopter sounds in the background (some spiritual metaphor?) (2) Earth and Naturalism (there's a lot of earth and dust in this movie, and the far shot of the grave reminded me of a painting by Manet). (3) The acting. The actor remainds almost stone-faced throughout the movie, again showing by concealing. Trivia The actor, Mr. Badii, was not actually face-to-face with most of his passengers. For the first passenger, the soldier was face-to-face with Kiarostami himself for the whole segment (you never see Mr. Badii and the Soldier in one same shot). In fact, none of the passengers, at the beginning (except probably the taxonomist) knew that he was in a movie. Kiarostami revealed that only to them later (except for the soldier, who actually did ran off). The seminarian actually believed truly that Kiarostami was going to kill himself. Overall, this is an excellent movie. But, it is not the sort one can compare its quality with others (just like one cannot compare the works of David Lynch with others), since it has its own style to it. However, I was confused at one point when the taxonomist said 'Mulberry' instead of 'Cherry', but then again, perhaps he wasn't actually refering to the same thing.

What makes the film very interesting for a Western viewer is that I find closer to Kiarostami's Iran after each of his films that I watch, and become more informed to it. We learn intimate details about the lives of several Iranians.Throughout the film I found that, although like many of his films it was quite slow-paced, it contained the extraordinarily rich dialog that is expected of a Kiarostami film. His films advance through their rich dialog while using the dusty Iranian landscape as their backdrop. I found a lot of the cinematography to be terrific, viewing the city from a distance and looking into the dusty foot-hills on the outskirts of Tehran. It is more than poetic to see a man at the end of his rope searching through the dust and faces of Tehran's poor laborers for answers about life and death. In many ways, the film is a large metaphor for the human state of affairs.The film culminates very well, and we all eventually find our own taste of cherry in the film. I always feel as if Kiarostami's films are a very philosophical experience, and are quite personal. In this sense, Kiarostami's films are amongst the best that I have seen.However, they are undoubtedly slower paced than other films, and they require the viewer to detach himself from any western stereotypes that he has about film. This would not be a good film for somebody expecting action or a typical Western film, but rather, this would be a film that I would recommend only to those who are in the mood for an insightful, philosophical film that shows an alternative view of life. Overall, it was an emotionally powerful film that will stick out in my memory as all Kiarostami films do.

As a result, The Taste of Cherry offers various interpretations, assumptions and even controversies. According to Kiarostami, In general, I think movies and art should take us away from daily life, should take us to another state, even though daily life is where this flight is launched from. I think these words are very valuable to understand Kiarostami's work. He always tried to take his viewers to another state, to a world outside, to arouse their ability of thinking and imagining. As a critic writes, His cinema carries the utmost respect for an audience as a collection of thinking, intellectualizing individuals never does he resort to devices intended to blatantly arouse the audience's emotions, edit didactically to make a political point, or instruct via an obvious narrative structure.Mr. Badii, a middle aged man wants to commit suicide. He is searching for a person who will agree to bury his body if he finally succeeds to kill himself. He had already dug up a whole for himself, where he will lie down after taking lots of sleeping pills. All the other person has to do is to bury him. But before that he must make sure that he is dead. Mr. Badii is ready to offer a large sum of money to the person who will help him out. In the beginning we see the worried and nervous looking face of Mr. Badii, riding his car, desperately searching for something. For few minutes we don't understand his mission, what he wants, what he is searching. First he stops at a construction site, asks a young man for something. The young man without saying anything disappears. Then we see him talking to a man carrying plastic bags to sell in a recycle factory. Till now we have no idea what is going on, but the worried face of Badii and his weary inspection of the arid landscape of Tehran entail the viewer that something is going to happen. Gradually we come to know about his mission when he talks about it in detail, to a shy soldier whom he picks up from the road. The Soldier Runs away after hearing the plan though, when he gets a chance.Next he finds a seminarist, an Afghan, who has come to Iran in order to find a job. He patiently listens to Badii and tries to understand him. But seminarist is also firm in his belief. He reminds him that according to Koran, committing suicide is prohibited and this is something that he won't do. Mr. Badii's quest goes on. Finally he finds a taxidermist working at the natural science museum, who agrees to help him. The Taxidermist doesn't seem to have a religious problem, but he is strictly against the idea of committing suicide But no matter what he says, Mr. Badii seems very certain about his decision. Before leaving, the Taxidermist promises him that he will surely do the job.Next we see Mr.Badii at night, driving to the hill in the dark. He lies in the hole and closes his eyes. The screen gets completely dark; we only hear the sound of rain. It stays like this for a while and then we see daylight. We hear the military march and then we see the cameraman with a tripod. After that Kiarostami himself, ordering through the walkie-talkie, followed by the protagonist, Mr. Badii, evidently much more relaxed, offering a cigarette to Kiarostami. The film ends there.The viewer eagerly watching is left disappointed. Well, this is the time for the viewers to start thinking, provided that the viewers are not disappointed to the extent of throwing their shoes.But really, what kind of ending of The Taste of Cherry can satisfy the viewer. What are the possibilities? Mr. Badii closes his eyes, and the screen gets dark. Next morning we see the taxidermist. He either finds him dead or alive. If he is alive, taxidermist would probably arrange for something and take him to his house, where he would take proper care of him till Mr. Badii gets all right. Or the second one, he comes and finds him dead. He takes the money, buries him accordingly and gets on with his life. Which one of the two is satisfying for the viewer? Probably none of them, I mean, we can always think of a third or a fourth possibility if we are creative enough, say for example, next morning we see, it is the taxidermist who is laying inside the hole, and get to know that Mr. Badii is a ground-breaking serial killer. Well, that would surely be a compelling Hollywood mambo-jumbo, isn't it? What is important here is to understand that Mr. Badii wants to commit suicide. His desire of death, his urge to finish his life is important. No matter what the others say, whatever they argue - he is determined. He finds no purpose in living, he Chooses to end it. Whether he successfully dies or not is inconsequential.Why did he want to commit suicide? A vital question unanswered in the film. Kiarostami did not want to go into this. For him the entire project was more of a spiritual one in nature than psychological. When asked about the speculation that Iranian authorities might stop the film from viewing because it dealt with suicide, Kiarostami said, There was controversy about the movie, but after I talked with the authorities, they accepted the fact that this is not a movie about suicide-it's about the choice we have in life, to end it whenever we want. We have a door we can open at any time, but we choose to stay &#x85; The movie is about the possibility of living, and how we have the choice to live. Life isn't forced on us. That's the main theme of the movie.

Don't get me wrong, the characters in A Taste of Cherry are interesting as well, but the majority of the film takes place within the confines one setting (the interior of an automobile), almost like a stage play.  And if you're gonna have nothing but talking heads throughout, the characters better be so interesting that it'll cause us to transcend the claustrophobia of one setting.  I felt the concept was interesting--a man who's down on his luck searching for someone to kill and bury him.  Sounds like a very difficult task, since whoever does it (if they get caught) will be charged with homicide.  Whether or not it was the victim's consent, murder is murder.  But there were two thoughts that kept running through my head throughout the film.  The first was why did he want to commit suicide in the first place?  We know nothing about this man's backstory, so how are we able to feel sympathy for his anguish and connect with him?  I thought it might've been a gimmick to create tension and cause a gasp in the audience when we finally learn why he wanted to do it.  But that wasn't the case.  The second question was why did he lack the guts to kill himself?  Sure, many people--no matter how serious they are about suicide--would lack the guts to actually run the razor across their wrists or shoot themselves in the head.  It's not uncommon.  But I wanted to know his reason.  Without previous exposition of his character, the audience is left in the dark.  I did not hate the film, because for the most part it held my attention and some of the dialogue (which I later found out was improvised) was quite colorful.  I also liked certain shots--for example, the shot of the sun rising at dawn.  The sun is a bright shade of red, which probably symbolizes the cherry that the old preacher was talking about.  And then the plot twist came.  Some audiences might have a detailed explanation about what it was supposed to mean and symbolize, but I simply felt it was a cop-out.  It was as much a cop-out as showing someone waking up from a dream.  So by the end I was totally baffled, and not in the good way.  And before I conclude I must commend the main actor for his fine performance which was rich in emotion, even during the scenes in which he had no dialogue.  The other performances were good too, but his stood out the most in my mind.

This is particularly true when evaluating the work of director Abbas Kiarostami, with many critics over-using words like deep, meditative, thoughtful and transcendent. Certainly, those particular platitudes can be labelled at much of Kiarostami's work, particularly Homework (1989), And Life Goes On (1991) and Under the Olive Trees (1994), however, I felt that this film, for me, was really trying too hard to live up to words like tranquil, hypnotic, pensive and so on, but instead, came across more like a film student's attempt to pastiche the style of European art cinema. To me, the film seems a little stilted, and I suppose a label like ostentatious might, just this once, be entirely accurate.The film adopts throughout an almost Bergmanesque stance on the idea of life and death (I see this film as something of a companion piece to Bergman's 1957 film Wild Strawberries) with the central character setting out on an odyssey of self-discover that may, perhaps, lead him to the ultimate in self-destruction. So, in some respects, I suppose the film could be seen as a road movie, albeit, a road-movie in the European tradition; owing more to films like the aforementioned Wild Strawberries and Wim Wenders' Kings of the Road (1976) than something like Thelma and Louise (1991) or Driving Miss Daisy (1988) (although, having said that, I guess you could make a mental link between the allusions of the journey of a life and the idea of life lessons being passed on between driver and passenger to the themes and characteristics of the previously noted Jessica Tandy picture). However, A Taste of Cherry (1997) lacks the vibrancy and the sense of evocation and cultural landscape usual found in European road-films, whilst also fudging the central issue of a character on the road through life to instigate his own death.The film ultimately seems rather slight; refusing to diverge from the central character's point of view as he progresses on his journey. Along the way he ponders the passing landscape and enjoys (or endures, depending on how you look at it) a series of deep, philosophical conversation with the passengers he picks up, which for me, were a little like the conversation scenes in Wild Strawberries, only much more laboured. It is here in these conversational scenes that the life and death aspect of the story intensifies, as our lead protagonist confesses to each passenger that he plans to eventually commit suicide and, the only reason he offered a lift to each respective passenger in the first place, was in the hope that they would tend to his body after the act has been committed. I suppose this is to further the theoretical and philosophical discourse at the heart of the film, although, for me, the weight of Kiarostami's dialog and ideas - coupled with the earnest qualities of the performers and the no-nonsense direction, made the film hard to take and the character hard to identify with. Again, I was reminded of Bergman's great masterpiece, and the journey that his character Isaac Borg takes - culminating with that beautifully enriching final scene that seemed to make the whole film work on an entirely different level - only this time, without the sentiment and sense of emotional involvement.A Taste of Cherry is a very cold and clinical film - seeming more like an intellectual exercise than something we could watch in order to reap something back - with both the prosaic acting style and the minimum of camera angles, editing coverage, etc (the film usually has two single-camera shots of each actor speaking separately - never interacting on screen to further stress the idea of dislocation). Then there's the ending; I'm not going to reveal what happens (thought it has been discussed in much detail on various other websites if you want to have a look around), though, suffice to say, it breaks down every shard of passion and humanity that the film had been struggling to maintain, with Kiarostami feeling the urge to completely deconstruct the film in a way not too dissimilar to what Jodorowski did at the end of The Holy Mountain (1973).As with the majority of Kiarostami's work, A Taste of Cherry seems heavily indebted to the films of Yasujiro Ozu (particularly Tokyo Story and Floating Weeds) with shades of Bergman and also Tarkovsky (I think there might be a distant echo of Nostalgia here); though for me personally, it felt more like a cold and technical imitation of those filmmakers, as opposed to something that could rival them. This is a slow, laboured and difficult film, certain to alienate many viewers through its endless philosophical dialogue, single-camera in-car set-ups (also employed in Kiarostami's 2002 short-form confessional work, Ten) and overall lack of emotional involvement; though it will certainly be of some interest to other art-house connoisseurs and ardent fans of Kiarostami and his particular style.

I've wrestled with this film since the moment I saw it three days ago now. Initially, I thought it was a very artful and well made film that flopped at the end (and not, mind you, at the infamous final scene, but a bit earlier). I liked a lot of it, but was frustrated and downright angry over a good bit of it, as well. I broke down and read the review of my arch nemesis, Jonathan Rosenbaum. I actually liked what he said quite a bit, to my surprise. Although he couldn't convince me that A Taste of Cherry was good, he did a lot to interpret the film, especially its odd final sequence. But even though Rosenbaum's review originally raised my appreciation for the film, the more I thought about it the more it shrank in stature.Taste of Cherry is a sort of a humanist allegory. Mr. Badii is unhappy and wants to end his life. We never know why, because Kiarostami wants him to stand for anybody. The audience is supposed to see themselves in the role. Mr. Badii drives around a landscape, barren of everything but some bits of construction equipment. He is looking for someone to bury him after he commits suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. First he picks up a young soldier, who is frightened at the proposal and ends up fleeing from his Range Rover. His second passenger is a seminary student who reminds him that the Koran preaches against suicide. Badii is unconvinced. Is it not a sin to be unhappy? he queries (I don't think it is in any religion that I know of, but we'll leave that alone).Up to this point, I thought it was a very good movie. Then a third passenger enters the film. He agrees to do it because he desperately needs the large amount of money Badii is offering. But as he is driven to his workplace, the man desperately tries to convince Badii that life is worth living. He tells a story in 1960 he, too, decided that life was not worth living and tried to take his life after a big argument with his wife. He was going to hang himself from a mulberry tree. But, after he tastes one of the mulberries, he decides that life is too sweet to end it like that. If you die, Mr. Badii, you will never taste cherries again. How can you go through with it? For me, the film's potential greatness died at that sentiment. Cliche! I shouted. Well, the more I think about it, the more the word cliche doesn't fit. Of course, I was reminded of the Chinese parable of the man who was chased by a tiger. He escapes by climbing down a steep cliff. But on the ground below there is another tiger, so he's screwed either way. But on the cliff he finds some wild strawberries, and they turn out to be the sweetest he's ever tasted. You see, it's not quite the same thing. So the word I was looking for, the one I should have shouted, was not Cliche! but Trite!Kiarostami isn't so shameless that he has Mr. Badii immediately decide not to kill himself. In fact, we never really find out if he does or not. However, after listening to his third passenger, we see sparks of the will to live appear in Badii's manner. If not the will to live, the notion that existence is beautiful. Even if Badii dies, he dies with the thought that the world contains much beauty. This is too easy. I mean, it's very easy to depict a character whose problems are deliberately left unspoken and then give him this kind of revelation. If this film brightens your day, fine, but realize what it's saying and how morally simplistic it all is. You might prefer Taste of Cherry to It's a Wonderful Life, which has more or less the same message, but that says more about you than it does either of those films. One of the biggest reasons that Taste of Cherry fails is that it is so figurative. It asks us not to identify with a character, but with, I guess, ourselves. It's a Wonderful Life depicts a man who sees that life is worth living because of all of the character's accomplishments. We can see ourselves in George Bailey, but he himself is, without a doubt, a fleshed-out character. We understand exactly why George Bailey's life is wonderful.But life is not wonderful for everybody. Troubles have a scale, and sometimes nonexistance looks like it might be a whole lot sweeter than the taste of cherries. Take Leaving Las Vegas, for instance (perhaps renamed Taste of Liquor?). Unlike Taste of Cherry, this film - and it's American, Lord help us - pulls not a punch. We have only the vaguest idea why Ben Sanderson has decided to commit suicide, but we know he's decided and he's not turning back. Leaving Las Vegas is about an individual. He actually finds what might be happiness, but he knows it's as fleeting as anything else in his world.  The film isn't an allegory, so it doesn't presume to tell us how to feel. I'd also point to Louis Malle's masterpiece The Fire Within. The main character in that film, Alain Leroy, having decided on suicide, visits all of his friends one last time. The more he talks to them, the more he is convinced that he is right in his decision. Again, the film is about an individual and is not interested in sentimentality. It's an argument for suicide. What it depicts is an individual's choice. It is not interested in the kind of sentimentality of Abbas Kiarostami. Both The Fire Within and Leaving Las Vegas realize that it will take a whole hell of a lot more than a bowl of tasty fruit to make life worth living. What Taste of Cherry represents is cheap, esoteric art movie sentiment. 5/10.

But like most purely improvised films, there's a rather low ratio of insights to the amount of screen time spent struggling to come up with something interesting.  (Actually, only one of the characters really manages to be interesting at all.)  Likewise, some of the shots of Mr. Badii driving around aimlessly have a certain Antonioniesque hypnotic effect, but most of them look no more interesting than random video you might have shot yourself in the industrial part of town.  There are critics who call this kind of untouched-by-art realism genius, who say that Kiarostami is making us think, reconsider the very nature of cinema, and so on.  To my mind, the message of the film-- the taste of cherry makes life worth living-- is no more or less profound than, say, Woody Allen rattling off a few of the things that make life worth living in Manhattan, or the epiphany the kid in American Beauty gets from a plastic bag.  (Likewise the message that it's all only a movie.  Never woulda guessed.)  And critics who find such a message shallow in a piece of slick entertainment, but deep when it's in a deliberately unentertaining art film, need to reexamine their critical principles, or lighten up a little-- or at least go see again the work of real art Kiarostami alludes to in his title, Wild Strawberries, which has more depth of characterization and emotional richness in any five minutes than this manages to scrounge up in an hour and a half.

It's a movie of such unparalleled tedium that to pronounce its name may drive people to enter a monastic order in search of stimulus. It is like watching paint remain wet.Astonishingly, A Taste of Cherry (as it translates) won the Palm D'Or at Cannes. It was a decision motivated by politics and pseudery that exemplifies the worst Cannes jury decisions. (Zut alors. Zis film, it was made in Iran. Mon dieu, what's it like? Well, it's quite boring, but it could be the start of a Middle Eastern renaissance.)Critics have fawned over the film for its simplicity, but the 95 minutes is a vacuum of Proustian proportions and was, for me, substantially less stimulating than watching the back of the head of the man sat in front of me at the cinema. No one can argue that this film is not boring. It's possible to contend that boredom was Abbas Kiarostami's intention, but if you're going to make that argument then you need to justify it. Does the uneventful nature of the film provide a useful backdrop to the subject? Absolutely not.The plot - a parable depicting a man's quest to find someone who will bury him after he commits suicide - moves with glacial speed. Each candidate explains at length the metaphysical problems with being complicit in such an act, but the monologues are no more sophisticated (and a great deal less articulate) than a pub conversation with a clutch of philosophy students. The most depressing thing is the way it is filmed. At the beginning of most of the shots, you see the main character's jeep trundling from one side of the screen to the other. Nothing interesting is happening now, you think to yourself as the protagonist explains yet again what he wants his passenger to do, but perhaps we will reach a dramatic moment at the end of the shot. The jeep duly reaches the end of the frame, only for the film to cut to a near-identical shot of the same jeep crossing the same drab and dusty landscape with the same uneventful monologue.Even if you strip away the boredom, there is precious little underneath unless you engage in the most polo-necked type of film criticism. I have read one review that claimed that the protagonist's stone-faced performance was showing by concealing. Another suggested that the failure to explain the character's motivation for killing himself made him an everyman. There is, I suggest, an element of the emperor's new clothes about this.A Taste of Cherry deals with metaphysics, but that does not make it profound. Viewers who can sit through it are open minded, but that does not make them intellectual. Don't go and see this on the say-so of an impressionable pseud. Don't go and see it at all.

The problem is he doesn't have anyone to bury him. After a few unsuccessful encounters with men who misconstrue his unspoken proposition, he picks up a young Kurdish soldier in need of a lift. Having offered the young recruit a generous sum in return for the work, the boy leaps out of the car and flees across the hillside where Badii has already dug his grave. His second prospective candidate is an Afghan seminarian, who objects on religious grounds, quoting from scripture to dissuade him. The third is an Azeri taxidermist who accepts the offer as he needs the money for his sick child, but nonetheless tries to deter him from carrying out his plan. He confesses that he too once planned to hang himself from a mulberry tree, but upon tasting the mulberries, chose life. As darkness falls over the city, Badii climbs into his grave and closes his eyes, and darkness falls upon us as the clouds open up.Abbas Kiarostami's minimalist meditation on the circle of life is notable for its use of long shots, such as in the closing sequences. The film is punctuated throughout by shots of Badii's car traversing the winding hilly roads, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. The visual distancing stands in contrast to the sound of the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground as though non-diegetic. This fusion of distance with proximity, like the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, generates suspense in the most mundane of moments.'Taste of Cherry' confounded Western audiences accustomed to dramatic performances and emotional manipulation, with its apparent absence of explanation or conclusion. It is never explained why Badii wants to commit suicide but he tells the seminarian that Allah wouldn't want any of his children to suffer so much. We never see him take his pills but when the rains fall on his open grave we are encouraged to believe that he has 'tasted the cherries' and re-evaluated life. In his circuitous search for meaning, it could be said that the soldier represents the state; the seminarian, religion; and Azeri, what can happen but also what has gone before. Badii is in turn ignored; told to continue living but not given any reason to; and finally, told to experience nature and appreciate the little things. The theocracy has little to offer him.The Iran depicted herein is a melting pot, or cultural mosaic, of other Muslim world countries. We assume Badii is ethnically Persian, but his fellow travellers all hail from foreign lands. Perhaps this signifies the finity of the revolutionary state, in that no one has a vested stake in it's perpetuation. All three nations represented were embroiled in conflict at this time, and maybe it was three foreign perspectives who had known conflict which Badii needed. Much has been said of the very final scene which I neglected to mention above as I do not myself consider it part of the narrative. It consists of camcorder footage of the director and crew shooting scenes of the Army on patrol and would seem to me to be a disclaimer for the Iranian censors who I imagine would be concerned with the film's themes (it's only a movie). And it's inclusion in the Western release would seem to highlight this issue for foreign audiences.

Iranian cinema is something I am just starting to explore and surely appreciate, but this film failed to draw me in as say Gabbeh, Dayareh or Color of Paradise did.Of course the lead character, is intentionally enigmatic; opaque to us in terms of why he might seek suicide. The landscape is a harsh, bitter orange, almost as if he were in some form of hell already. For me, never having a connection with this lead character, pushes me towards those he encounters...but they too are distant. Indeed the point of the first two, is their wanting to maintain that distance. Contrast this with the film Goodbye, Solo (coincidentally by an Iranian-American, or perhaps vice versa), where the depth of the characters, despite a remote lead, was remarkable. But of course that was in English, so perhaps Farsi-speakers would resonate more here with the characters.Certainly the third passenger, was the most fascinating. And the fact that his job is a taxidermist, quite a nice touch. And perhaps more familiarity with the Koran would have helped me in the echoes of the film.Anyways, this film reminds me of stage play (it was not one originally), which works fine for me typically but I think for some viewers that can be a bit of a turn-off. The slow pace is also mentioned, but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work, so again that is not what failed for me. I saw this *before* reading Jonathan Rosenbaum's Movie Wars where he frequently cites this film as one of his all-time favorites.I think this is a great film for film critics, as it is an open film in a way, open to wide-ranging interpretation. Is the filmmaker himself embarking on his own suicide of sorts in making this film in/for Iran? I mentioned the taxidermist, one who preserves the dead in a life-like state, and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting and/or killing other people, but when it comes to a single person, that is more trying.So perhaps there is more open than the grave in this film, regrettably at this point I am a casual casualty. Perhaps watching this with others instead of solo would have helped me, alas I say Goodbye to this buy hopefully another hello to Kiarostomi.4/10 Thurston Hunger "},{"Title":"What a bummer ending","Date":"20 November 2001","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I had such high  prospects for this movie as I became engrosed in the main character, and his obsession to take his own life.

The reddish tone given throughout to maintain the graveness of the matter, and the greenish tone at the end to depict wellness, is excellent! Of course, the director has due contribution in it.Homayon Ershadi has done such naturalistic acting that it is a lesson of acting for actors and directors. This is mainly the genius of Kiarostami. Most of the scenes were improvised, as mentioned in the trivia section.Kiarostami has maintained the tempo of the film in a very beautiful way. His use of voice overs is unique. But most of all, the best part about the film is the way he reveals characters' faces at the climax of a conversation/scene. He is a directors' director.Now getting down to business. The movie is too slow. Such long shots with so many pans and tilts, so many similar looking shots, too many voice overs, the monotony of a car just driving around the hills, same angle of camera inside car etc. The saddest part of the film is when the protagonist leaves home in the night and is standing on the hill. It's so dark that you can't see a thing. And God! That scene is so long. Why do you take a shot if you aren't showing anything? But the let down of the film is the ending.

No example better suits this than when Abbas Kiarostami's Taste of Cherry premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. The audience reacted colorfully with cheers and jeers. It was awarded the prestigious Palme D'Or for its excellence. The critics hailed it as a work of genius, except for one. The great Roger Ebert. In fact, he hated it. He called it a lifeless drone and excruciatingly boring. He even placed it in his Most Hated Films list. How could a critic of such fascinating intellect and unmitigated love for all of cinema have such harsh words for Taste of Cherry? What was not to understand? Or like? Sitting down to watch this picture for the first time, I felt uncertain, but entirely interested. I've gone through an entire semester of watching so many classic pictures of the world. Some of them have become one of my all-time favorites, and others, you couldn't pay me to watch again. Kiarostami didn't impress me too much with Where is the Friend's Home? In fact, if I were to call a film a lifeless drone, that would be the one. Actually, it would be more like The Color of Pomegranates, sorry, I'm not quite over that one. Regardless, Taste of Cherry, I found to be a surprisingly sweet end to the semester. It's far from a perfect film, but it's far from anything I would say is boring or bad. If anything, it left a very good impression of Kiarostami for me. The entire film has me wondering about our main character, Mr. Baadi. Who is he? Why is he driving around the Tehran countryside? Why is he constantly looking for hitchhikers to pick up? More importantly, and much to the very point on everyone's minds, why does he want to commit suicide so bad? Every time he picks up a new stranger, he tries to reel them into being his accomplice for his suicide attempt. He just wants someone to bury with. Nobody really understands why. It's not like he's a depressed man of any sort, especially due to how calm he seems as he's talking to the people he is driving. Kiarostami brilliantly tells us nothing about Mr. Baadi's character, except for the fact that he is an awfully lonely man, who just wants to die. It makes the majority of the film's existence seem gloomy and introspectively miserable. Mr. Baadi's truck, almost in itself, seems to symbolize his isolation from the world, the darkness that lurks inside his head, and the shell to which he is about to hide himself in as he lays in his grave. Its almost as if Mr. Baadi is looking to be isolated from the rest of the world forever, but looks for one last companion to join him. It is unclear if he likes company or not, but what is clear is that Baadi seriously has a death wish, and not in the Charles Bronson kind of way. The only section of the film that left me cold was the end. A few minutes before we get a fantastic final scene in which Baadi buries himself in the spot in which he told his passengers to meet him. It's in the early hours in the morning. Kiarostami holds onto a shot of Baadi staring out into the distance, which is framed absolutely beautifully. Then, as Baadi reaches down and lies in the hole, he simply waits, and stares up at the moon. This scene is so peaceful, but so incredibly eerie and sad at the same time. The sense of death was imminent, even though his accomplice never showed up. This would have been the perfect spot to end the picture. But the picture doesn't end. Instead, we are treated to some B-Roll footage of the film. Why did Kiarostami felt the need to put this in? Some have argued that this helps blur the line between reality and fiction for the audience. Some have argued that it lightened up the ending of the film in order to assure the audience that everything was OK in the end, but did a movie like this really warrant such an ending? If anything at all, it just seems really overly self-serving of Kiarostami. Like he just wanted to place himself in the picture somewhere, ala Alfred Hitchcock. I hear that most of what he believes in himself is what inspires him to make movies, so I'm guessing that Kiarostami is one very narcissistic director. The B-Roll footage just didn't work at all with me. It didn't make me feel happier coming out of the film, because I was happy with where it left off to begin with. OK, fine, I like a bit of grimness with my movies. Don't we all, though? Taste of Cherry is a sublime piece of art house cinema, and unquestionably, the masterpiece of Kiarostami. It's a striking soliloquy about the preciousness of life, and the unrequited friendship of others in our darkest hours. It's not a bright film of any sort, but in examining the dark context of suicide, it goes about it with class and fascination.

However to be perfectly honest I found this film incredibly boring and tough to sit through, mainly because of the cinematic strategy used throughout. The film implements a lot of long static takes, most of which are in the same location, which elongates the time and space of this film to give it what I would describe as a real life pace. That combined with very little to no extreme time jumps makes it feel like we are simply watching a complete day of this man's life, which in terms of making this film feel real helps a lot, but making it entertaining, however, hinders it quite a bit. It seems obvious to me that the director, Abbas Kiarostami, wanted to draw importance to his messages by making the situation they're framed in as real feeling as possible, but when you sacrifice entertainment value to do so it's my belief that you're only preventing your message from getting across to the audience.The film has a pretty ambiguous ending; we as an audience are left to wonder whether or not Mr. Badii really killed himself followed by behind the scenes footage of Kiarostami and his crew making the movie. While it's my belief that he did kill himself, I can honestly say that at the end of the movie I couldn't have cared less either way. Kiarostami does little to nothing in terms of characterization to get us to sympathize with Mr. Badii, and the fact that we as an audience aren't made out to root for Mr. Badii as a character is what fuels my belief that he did indeed kill himself. It also keeps the audience from wanting to engage in any discussion over the material, which I'm sure is not what Kiarostami intended on. I assume the behind the scenes at the end was some sort of reminder from Kiarostami that we are indeed watching a movie (maybe as some sort of disclaimer?). However I agree with Roger Ebert in his review of the film when he said, and I'm paraphrasing, something along the lines of we don't need to be reminded at the end that this is a movie because the slow and boring pace throughout is reminder enough. At the end of the day I understand what Kiarostami was going for and applaud him for trying to make his film feel as real as possible, but it's the lack of entertainment value that kept me from truly enjoying it, and after all we are in the entertainment industry.

There is definitely more of a cowardice behind the use of a gun, and the soldier embodies this by fleeing the car before answering if he will help Mr. Badii.The film has a brilliant structure, making it seem like three stages of life. We have the young soldier, representing that we fear death in youth. Then we have a slightly older man who has a religious background who explains the problem with suicide. This represents an awareness of death, but the man trying to convince Badii that suicide is a sin shows not necessarily coming to terms with death just yet.The final conversation is the longest, and it revolves around an older taxidermist. Not only is he closer to death than Badii, he is familiar with death since he is a taxidermist. He is also extremely wise and has a lot to say about why Badii should reconsider, but he also accepts the job, showing an acceptance of death. It is also important to note that the film takes place over one long day, and with night coming at the end of this day it represents the ending of life in a sense.This is a really brilliant movie with such a strange ending that I still do not quite understand. I would have liked if the film had ended when they day ended rather than the ending that reflects on filmmaking. In my opinion, this is a near-perfect film.

I found the ending of this film particularly uplifting, a celebration of life as movement and light, as opposed to death as darkness and immobility (a more powerful argument against suicide than so many that are theological) suggesting that life is, after all, just a film, or more importantly that the value of life is precisely in that it is, for what it's worth, a film with a beginning and an ending and no definitive meaning. The music in the end reminds one of the Heideggerian Being-towards-Death, how the beauty of movement and life is in its finitude - much like a film. Kiarostami is as ever a genius for capturing such complexity and so many abstract concepts into one brief film and with so much naturalness.

Basically middle aged Iranian man Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) is driving through Tehran in his car looking for someone to help him, and he is offering a large sum of money for whoever will do the job he is asking, he wants to commit suicide, and he is looking for someone to bury his body after he is dead, in a spot he has already chosen. He picks up random people as prospective candidates, starting with friendly conversation, getting to know more about them, and then eventually one by one he reveals his plan to them, all he needs them to do is cover him with earth in the grave he has dug, their reactions all seem different. The young and shy Kurdish soldier (Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari) is quickly shocked by the proposal and refusing to do the job runs away from the car, the Afghan seminarist (Mir Hossein Noori) is against a man killing himself for religious reasons and also refuses to do the job, but the third man, an Azeri taxidermist (Abdolrahman Bagheri), does not object. The taxidermist is willing to do the job, because he needs the money to give to his sick child, but he tries to persuade Mr. Badii not to kill himself, because he attempted suicide himself and only stopped after tasting mulberries (this is obviously the meaning behind the title), but he agrees he will cover his body if he finds him in the grave and dead in the morning. That night Mr. Badii leaves his car and walks in the darkness to the grave, a thunderstorm is beginning, but he lies in the hole, and he presumably kills himself, as the film blacks out, and the final shots of the film are behind the scenes camcorder footage of the crew making the film. In the leading role Ershadi gives a compelling performance, it is interesting you do not find out why the character wishes to kill himself, but on the other hand it adds to the intrigue of him trying to find someone willing to put him in the ground after he's done himself in, based on morality and mortality it is a fascinating story and most watchable drama.

On one side it's a minimalist melodrama about a man determined to commit suicide, who drives in a jeep looking for people who will bury him. Most of the shots are just characters siting in a car talking or wide desert sequences. The only sound you hear is the dialogue between the driver and all the people he tries to employ for the desperate deed he tries to execute . But on the other hand this film is one of the most multi-interpretational allegories ever made. In this minimalism there are many philosophical and religious themes conveyed and most of the objects here are symbols evoking the state of the characters mind. For me this film is a journey of a confused man, about whom we don't know much except that he wants to commit suicide for some reason. He encounters people, from different ages, ethnic groups, social classes with different world-views, opinions and reasons. He asks each of them the same thing please bury me under a cherry tree and I will give you money for the task. But even though we don't know specifics about this man, the environment in which he lives evokes a lot about the meaning of his life and the choice (or perhaps not a choice?) of ending his existence.For the most part of the film, the main character sits in a car - a claustrophobic car. It brings the sense of imprisonment, limited possibilities, routine and simply something mechanical, un-interesting and that I think is why he wants to commit suicide, to liberate himself, end these airless conditions that is his existence. Suicide is an escape of this life, but during the film the main character escapes this car as well, after re-thinking all the opinions the people he tries to employ, bring him to mind. The other people, society try to make him re-think his position of committing suicide, they want him to liberate himself by going to this society and other people, and thats what partially happens when the main character runs after the seminarian. The later made him start to question and told him he could find meaning in society, nearby other people. The empty desert (wasteland, void) is the place where he drives around in his car and exists. He seeks a reason for his living, but he only encounters vacuum and dust. He meaninglessly drives around looking for something, someone that will save him. The people try that, but they don't fully succeed, because near the end of the the main character lays himself in his grave, near the cherry tree.The cherry tree (which we never actually see!), can either symbolize a portal, passage to another place (a non-wasteland one) or simply death, beautiful, but lonely and tragic. He wants to get in that cherry tree, but he doesn't know where it leads to. Its the only fruitful thing in that wasteland, and the driver knows that and that's why he wants to enter it. And that's also what he finally does, the people didn't convince him to go to society, another escape from the car and wasteland.The thunder and rain open the gate. We don't know if he did go through that gate... that's where the epilogue comes in. It's filmed in green and shows the film crew. Perhaps that's the place where he went to... we don't know really. Some sort of afterlife? Redemption or meditation?It's one of the best journeys of a man trying to get out of his meaningless life. The film also explores worldviews of different people, in particular their view on suicide. And then there is so much more language can't describe. The watching process itself might bore you a little, but let that not turn you away from this masterpiece, because its though- provoking and rewarding.9.5/10 Highly Recommended "},{"Title":"Slow and good start but gradually became boring.","Date":"25 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Abbas Kiarostami has his own language of cinema. The story will look to be great when you will read a synopsis somewhere (actually it is great) and you will know already that it is going to be slow. The story is about a man searching for someone to bury him after he dies. Well he is going for a suicide. In his search he meets a lot of people. The film depicts his meet with them. What you are going to see are questions about right and wrong.PROS The film has an intriguing subject. The screenplay however does not have charming twists or anything like that which will keep you on edge of the seat. The car is moving through a path and you hear and think about the dialogs. You have a lot of time in the film itself to watch and think of what the person feels. The film is not made for a commercial audience. It is made for the purpose of explaining some situation. You cannot expect excitement in these films. It takes you through the dilemma of a man while he is trying to find a person to bury him. Another thing to focus on is the different types of people that he meets. There are moments when you will feel that the real reason to make the film is exploring human behavior, his ideas. It's not that you'll get entirely bored but if you are a patient viewer than you will slowly get to the root of the film.CONS The character of the lead actor was explored from a different angle and it would have been good if we were given an insight in his past life. It is OK that the main focus of the film is to explore human nature but the man is trying to do this thing and his character will look confusing to the audience because they don't know enough about him.VERDICT Commercial viewers should refrain.

It's great in all of its simplicity. It's a movie that is taking a humble and honest approach to its subject and doesn't ever goes overboard with anything. The story remains small and simplistic at all times and none of the emotions or story developments feel forced.It's also being a small and humble movie with all of its settings and characters. Most of the movie is set at the same location and it only features a handful of characters in it.The movie is being also especially great with its cinematography and storytelling. It rather not shows or tells you certain things, so that the movie almost constantly forces you to use you our mind to make things up and put certain things together. Sometimes the camera isn't even focusing on the person talking, or the person is off screen entirely. It's a special sort of approach that worked out just great for this particular movie.It's also being a quite interesting one with its themes. The movie focuses on a man that wants to commit suicide and is searching for a man to bury him, once the deed is done. This is however a movie set in an Islamic country, in which suicide is considered to be a mortal sin. This, amongst other things, provides the movie with some provocative moments and exchanges of dialog between the man and the different characters he meets on his search. And it luckily is not a movie that tries to have a moral in it or tries to teach you anything about life. It's instead being one that really allows you to make up your own mind about its subject and the themes it handles.Truly one great and provoking movie, that doesn't ever gets pretentious or overdoes certain things.8/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"In some ways bad, in some ways really good","Date":"9 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I admire the style and goal of this film. It's not an easy job to make a good movie with such a small budget and with such a tight focus. There are no gimmicks or flashy tricks here. It really is just a man driving through town and its surroundings, talking to people and trying to fulfill his final mission. That's ambitious. And at some points it really works. The early scenes especially, where we're only beginning to know this strange, slightly uncomfortable, but also very charismatic man, are really good and I enjoyed the mystery.Unfortunately the narrative isn't that great. The movie has a tendency to jump from one important scene to another with no bridges, no explanations. I'm sure there are people who would say that the movie doesn't need those bridges. I disagree. A true master of his craft may be able to tell a story without them, but for most of us, those bridges and story-telling techniques are there for a reason. They are needed to make the story flow more smoothly. To leave them out altogether makes the movie seem jumpy and jarring, as if there wasn't enough time to film certain scenes. On the other hand, the ending scene feels completely unnecessary and stylistically broken.Still, the movie has its upsides. The dialogue, for the most parts, is really good and captivating, as are the actors. The movie has its own unique style, the lack of music fits the mood and I actually enjoyed the story, unevenly told as it might have been. So yeah, just slightly below average, but worth a watch, in my opinion.

He is initially mistaken as a homosexual cruising for sex, a misunderstanding that Kiarostami even ribaldly encourages Through suggestive dialogue. A seminary student refuses to help him because suicide is a sin. I must say that I was very disappointed by these 40 minutes plus. Shooting so much of the film inside the car as Mr. Badi drives around is a waste of the possibilities of cinema. Furthermore, there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors, as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat, and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors, as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi, and though Ershadi eventually established a film career, this was his first role.The film does become stronger in the second half, when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran, a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thought-provoking instead of merely awkward, and as a glance at discussion forums will show, the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately, the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film (which I won't spoil here) feels to me like a cop-out, not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.If you like the Iranian Second Wave, then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'm-e gilas at least once. However, in spite of its winning of the Palme d'Or, I do not feel this is an especially great film.

Taste of Cherry is the best Iranian film I've ever seen but then again that's not saying much since I've only seen two others 'The Afghan Alphabet' which was more of a documentary showing us Afghan children talking about how great Allah and the Quran is and how 'un-great' the west is. The other is 'Gabbeh' which felt more like a documentary what with its thirty second takes of goats grazing, chickens roaming and women washing their clothes.So, you could say Taste of Cherry being the best Iranian film I've seen isn't saying much but it's better than that. Another thing is the film's plot A guy is driving around Tehran's outskirts trying to find someone that'll bury him as he's chosen to commit suicide. Again, this doesn't sound like much but it is so much more than it sounds thus, is underestimated. This brilliantly simple concept is played with and utilised in an impressive and effective manner but what is perhaps the most impressive, however, is that the film never feels forced nor does it at any point self-raise itself beyond that level of 'too artsy-fartsy'.Although the other two Iranian films I've seen could be called art films due to long takes and emphasis on the ordinary, Taste of Cherry does these two things with the distinct feeling that there is purpose behind it &#150; the long takes of the Range Rover weaving in and out of the dusty mountains on a relatively sparse quarry on a public holiday are there to make us feel like ground is being covered and the film is advancing as our focus Mr. Badii is telling us and his passenger about his plan &#150; this was much more effective as it was entertaining to watch than a goat grazing in a field for no apparent reason.The film also uses its timing and concept to good effect. The audience are clueless to as to why he's driving around looking for people so desperately; one person tells him to go away aggressively, one wearing a U.C.L.A. top tells him passively and he even talks to some random children half way through it all. Also, his actual plan when announced to a young soldier is the first time we hear of it so the director is cleverly trying to place us in the young man's position which is rather effective. Along with this, the plan is only gone through in a laborious fashion twice, after the first time &#150; we know exactly what his situation is and what he wants.Apart from some of these great things, it also gets the basics right the director makes great use of the location, the atmosphere is as tense in the early part as it is desperate and depressing in the second part and although amateurs, even the acting pulls through. You can argue that most foreign films are enjoyable over ones we're familiar with since it's such a change and they just seem more sophisticated- this isn't always the case as they can fall flat on their faces to some audiences but if you can look past the silly 'behind the scenes' ending, Taste of Cherry holds up with an ambiguous ending and just as a well made film.

Is it right to kill yourself if while you live you hurt your family? The film of A Taste of Cherry by Abbas Kiarostami begins with Badii, a middle-age man, driving around the outskirts of Tehran looking for someone, someone compassionate offering them a large sum of money, to help with his deed &#150; to commit suicide. The concept of suicide becomes universal and the film opens the idea of the meaning of life and death.The cinematography is very sharp with its crisp color of the desert land of Iran. The yellow and orange soil surrounds the people in the film and the small green trees become part of earth, almost indistinguishable. As Baddi searches for a compassionate man the tension grows. The viewer wants to know why, the reasons, he wants to commit suicide. The first two men reject his offer without knowing the job he wants them to do. Later, the young soldier is frightened by Baddi thinking he is a madman and runs off after learning about the job. The next man is a seminarist and has some compassion, but clearly does not help him because he believes it is wrong. He tries to lecture Badii that according to the Imam and Koran, suicide is a sin. But as we go on with the film we begin to wonder that maybe the reasons are no longer necessary, but it is now the question of the desire to commit suicide. The last man agrees to assist him and tells him that he once did try to commit suicide, but once he has a taste of cherry, the smallest goodness of everyday life, he did not.The way that the film is shot, using mostly medium close-ups in a desolate area, and most of the conversation taking place in Baddi's car, makes the viewer uncomfortable, but attentive. The dark theme of the film, somewhat like the poets of the romantic era, depicts the natural landscape of Tehran &#150; the soil, trees, and rocks &#150; with the doubt of a man to live and choosing death. This negative capability compels the viewer to try to understand Baddi.The ending of the story makes the viewer believe that this is only a movie within a movie, much like the French New Wave films of Goddard and Truffaut. Yet, the story raises expectations and makes the viewer hope that Badii will change his mind, but Kiarostami leaves it up to the reader to fill up the blanks in the story.

Produced in a society where freedom of speech is not protected and where a fundamentalist religious cabal controls the government and the media, the film is surely trying to ask us to read between the lines on various points.In particular, I found myself wondering if it was attempting to address, not so much the morality of suicide, but perhaps that of homosexuality. For the first full 20 or 30 minutes of the film, we get the distinct impression that the leading man is looking for a sexual hookup rather than for what he allegedly turns out to be seeking. He initially hits on innocent-looking young men in need of money. The violent reaction he gets from one fellow indicates that at least one of his targets has interpreted his intentions in just this light.The overtly sensual film title and the not-too-subtle imagery of the hole the hero wants to be buried in seem fairly suggestive as well. And rather oddly at one point, he discusses suicide as if it were something calculated to make him happy... rather than dead.In any case, I don't really believe that coded socio-political subtext can really serve to make a movie more artistically successful than it would be on its more basic merits.

While Godard's brand of realism creates a sense of ambiguity along with a sense of discomfort in his audience (Bande a part - Band of Outsiders), Kiarostami achieves the same sense of ambiguity while taking his viewer to an uncommonly tranquil if not peaceful place! It's astonishing that this movie is ultimately about suicide and after wards one feels exhilarated! Kiarostami never even shares with us why Mr. Badii is trying to kill himself and we as the audience never feel that we need to know! I suppose that underscores Kiarostami's mastery of narrative.Kiarostami is obviously a very heavy intellectual deeply rooted in the Iranian literary tradition of the 1930-1980 period. The literature of this period produced the likes of Hedayat, Chubak and Alavi as great examples of writers who explored realism as a genre. I feel we see quite a bit of those writers in Kiarostami's movies. The hallmark of the genre is its attempt to withhold moral judgment on its characters at the expense of leaving the reader/viewer with a deep sense of ambiguity, and Kiarostami is extremely successful at this task in his recent movies. It's all the more remarkable when we realize that Kiarostami started out as a children's film maker and in his early movies he had to communicate very clear and unambiguous messages. Even some of his well known earlier works (Traveler, 1974) were done in that tradition. But in his recent movies, while he maintains the simple, easy style of a children's movie, he has achieved the mastery of realism by leaving out any attempt to judge his characters and in so doing has achieved a state of purity that is extremely rare among his peers.If you're looking for a movie to offer a very complicated plot or one to move you to the edge of your seat, this isn't it! If you're looking for a movie that will linger in your mind and make you wonder, then this may well be it!

This humanization contrasts with the disturbing storyline of a man who wants to kill himself and begs numerous strangers to have the decency to assure that he is buried.  The film counterposes the suicidal man's request for basic decency in an indecent act (suicide), the hesitation of the characters to associate themselves with such an act, and the dignified presentation of these characters by the director.

Sure, it's very long and slow (not in the 2001 A Space Odyssey sort of way, this is literally 2 hours or so of a man driving on the same road while talking to different people), but that didn't bother me all that much. What bothered me was the ending. To be fair, the ending was a complete joke. We witnessed the sad life of a suicidal man that seems to have no hope. We could even feel the pain of the man, and when he met somebody that finally gave him some hope I was looking forward to a great, touching ending. What do we get? The film crew that walks around like nothing happened. We don't get to know what happens to the man, he's just walking around with the cameramen. What? I know some people would say that's some kind of ingenious idea, but to me it's just pathetic. In a movie like this, that builds the tragedy of a man in a slow-paced, psychological sort of way the ending is the most important part.

Eschewing famous actors, a soundtrack, special effects, rapid cutting, psychological and back-story explanations of character, marketing, and every other device Hollywood has to offer, Kiarostami confronts suffering, death, and possible redemption.The protagonist drives around a dusty wasteland, looking for help in committing suicide. Neither a soldier nor a seminary student will help him. A doctor asks him if he is willing to surrender all of the physical and emotional immediacies of life-- the taste of cherry-- just to end his unspecified suffering. Crows flap. Maginficent colour bleeds from the sun. The man takes too many sleeping pills and lies down in the grave he's dug, as the sounds of rain and nature, along with darkness, envelope him.Fascinating is Kiarostami's coda. What does it mean? Does he suggest that what we've seen has been nothing more than the film-maker's visual trickery, and that our emotional investment in the protagonist has been in vain? Has the protagonist become merely an actor? Has there in fact been death and re-birth? Kiarostami has said that he finds Quentin Tarrantino far more interesting than his films, which he has described as too forceful. His own work suggests the opposite of the American's work that the hypnotic rhythms of daily life, verging on boring, open the mind to new possibilities, ones that creep back to us in the days and weeks after a viewing. Kiarostami's films only seem simple and boring, but they resonate the way Tarkovsky and Kieslowki's finest work does.

In A Taste of Cherry Kiorastami reveals his sheer talent of innovation. Most Iranian movies are thrilling in that they are confined to one specific story which is related using a series of incidents taking the audience straight towards its conclusion. During that time, the director uses various cultural and humane references to cinematically enrich his film. Here, Abbas Kiorastami uses the Iranian landscape and simple moments from its culture to bring the worldwide audiences to Iran for about 95 minutes. The cinematography is predominant and keeps our attention to the flow of images. This movie has been masterfully screen-written by Kiorastami who makes the audience meditate on life and death while trying to unravel the mysteries the movie carries. The mysteries are never solved but perhaps if they had been, the audience might have felt deeper sympathy for the protagonist. There are a few setbacks in the movie the director might have overlooked. At the beginning during his pursuit of a helper it was implied to me that the protagonist is homosexual. The way in which he approached men on the road gave me that feeling. I think that is an unnecessary issue to the plot. Overall, the movie, in its tranquility, made me meditate on its themes and to develop a fascination with the ways of Kiorastami!!!

He is wrestling with killing himself, yet he needs someone to properly bury him.There is a cultural bias at work in this film that I wish I understood better.  I don't profess any expertise in Muslim culture and I would love to understand either the cultural or scriptural underpinnings of the film.  Still, a simple human decency is on display here that extends well beyond the cultural settings of the film.  Indeed, these people are not the Muslims I see portrayed on television every day.At six in the morning, come and call me twice, he says to a poor soldier who could use the six months wages Badii offers.  If I reply, take my hand. If I don't, throw in 20 spades of earth.I can't do this for you, replies the soldier.  You can't throw earth on someone.Badii is banking on this somehow.  As he grapples with his moral dilemma, he seems to be casting about looking for someone to give him any reason to continue.Badii, you see, is an everyman, grappling with the big questions and suffering this life while praying God for solace.  As such, the viewer doesn't even need to know the protagonist's particular anguish, but can fill in the blanks themselves.

A very painful movie. It is quite good for about two-thirds of its run, then falls into a pit of cliches, then cops out, THEN ends as vilely as imaginable. A man wants to commit suicide for reasons unexplained (a total gimmick, but I can except it). He picks up three strangers, asking them to bury his corpse for a large sum of money.  For a director who is supposed to be so far out of mainstream, his view of morality is offensively common. It's a lot like It's a Wonderful Life, except less honest with the audience. The first man is afraid of the duty, so he simply runs away when the chance arises. The second man is a man of religion, and attempts to explain why suicide is wrong. The third man is the Arabic version of Forrest Gump. He agrees to do it because he needs the money, but when the main character gives him a ride home the third man does his utmost to convince him that life is worth living. He tells how he went to hang himself on a mulberry tree but decided life is worth living because he tastes how sweet the mulberries are. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. How cloying can you get? I guess in Iran life is less like a box of chocolates and more like a bowl of fruit. At least the main character doesn't succumb instantly to this man's annoying ploys, but we can see his determination shrinking. Does he do it? We don't know. I guess it's up to us. I don't complain about this, really, but it's a gimmick, as well. After the film fades to black, it comes up again on scenes of the film being made. This does nothing unless you're determined to make it do something. I'm sure one can masturbate some meaning out of this, but that would just be playing into the hands of Kiarostami's chic fans. Look, if you want a film about suicide that really pulls no punches and actually has a modicum of thought to it, see Louis Malle's excellent The Fire Within.As much bad stuff as I can say about it, I do have to admit that the film is stunningly directed and made, if not at all well written.

To start, I feel this is an amazing movie, with exceptional acting and a very interesting and original concept. The characters had a lot of depth and were very interesting; no stereotypes.Let's begin with the misunderstanding of the man's search. He was not looking for someone to kill him. He had already decided he wanted to commit suicide. He was looking for someone to throw dirt on him after he had died a ritualistic thing and a matter of respect. It is not a plot hole.Secondly, it is not necessary to know the man's past. It is true, Kiarostami did not reveal the man's reason for suicide and, instead began the story with his search for a person to aid him without flashing back. But the point of the story is not to obtain sympathy for his misfortunes and his want of suicide. That would have made for a boring and unoriginal tear-jerker with no artistic integrity as a story. Any sympathy felt in the movie is derived from the character's difficulty in finding someone to help him. Even then, that role was so well acted and expressive that you really did feel bad for him especially since he was containing his pain after every declination. The focus of this story was more philosophical and psychological and I respect it greatly for that. It isn't necessary to have everything explained to you; I don't know why people want everything explained to them without room for interpretation and why stories must be formulaic to avoid criticism.As for the ending... One must understand that this movie was not made in America or Europe. The morals of that society may be more restrictive of artistic expression. The depiction of the behind the scenes aspect was not a plot twist but a way of relieving the gravity of the situation in order to make the topic of the film more acceptable. Suicide may not be as acceptable to the Iranian public (or government) as a movie theme when compared to the thematic freedoms we enjoy in America and Europe.Phenomenal film.

Perhaps it appeals to those who are bored to death of watching the regular commercial Hollywood films, those who can't stomach really strong films and those who wish to create non-existent depths in a very one dimensional film.

I am a great lover of '60's cinema (Godard, Bunuel, Antonioni,etc.) and have found myself bemoaning the return of straight narrative as the strategy of even most of the most gifted filmmakers. But Iranian cinema in general, and Kiarostami in particular seemed to have found a way to question narrative structures while keeping covenant with them. The ambiguity between what is constructed and what actually happened was a strategy that kept me on my toes while viewing these films. But Taste of Cherry, in my opinion, announces the beginning of the decadent and self-conscious period in Iranian cinema. We start to know that this kind of post-modern event (in this film, the ending) is going to take place, and, in fact, the film seems to be rather smoothly constructed towards that point. Iranian film begins to seem very Cannes friendly. This doesn't change the enormous achievement of this film. We can't (for example) blame late Beethoven for the fact that his changing the composer's role and position has led (in the almost 200 years since) to so much overblown, ego - driven music. All of this is what Adorno and Horkheimer called the Dialectic of Enlightenment. Mastery becomes gradually vise like and degenerates as it tightens. And the fact is, Iranian films since the time of this film have pandered more and more to Western expectations of them. Michael Galasso's score for Secret Ballot was a real shock - the sparse use of music in Iranian films was one of the elements that had created a different kind of attention - one was not lulled. And I was lulled by the use of the mother wit trope in this film. An illiterate ethnic minority character talks about the little things that make life worth living. So unfortunately similar to the role of mere facilitator that Blacks have so often in American films (not just old ones either - see That Thing You Do!, for example...). Thank Goodness for the po-mo ending. It keeps the film from going in the direction of a philosophical film which engages with the pros and cons of suicide.

Rather, we are already confronted with what he would want to happen with his life.Meanwhile, in TE, we have known beforehand what motivated Mr. Yamashita to adopt an introspective and reclusive attitudethe interrelated feelings of pain, guilt, anger, shame and resentment over his wife's unfaithfulness and the murderous act that was instigated by it.It's the classic narrative device of cause-and-effect, of showing what happened and what needs to be done.(Another film I can think of where this was shown fluently and masterfully is Claude Chabrol's 'Story of Women'.)But other than the anti-heroes' psychological and emotional make-up, the thing that's worthy of our attention in the two films is the way they uphold the beauty and value of life, how they make, in one way or another, a few shimmers of light penetrate through the dark corners of Mr. Badii's and Mr. Yamashita's lives.The end result may be essentially different in the two cases, but what actually counts are the efforts shown--mainly by the people around them--to effect a shift in outlook and attitude toward life of the two desperate and pessimistic souls.They may have missed their goal, but at least they worked for it.In TC, the people whom Mr. Badii has asked for help have paradoxically made their part in altering his morbid aim through their own life stories (as he gets to converse with them)--that is, that just like Mr. Badii's, theirs is a life also full of struggles and woes (some are mundane, while some are crucial), but that they haven't thought (or so it seems) of ending it through their own hands.Life has still more to offer, with some of them just being overlooked because of their ordinariness, like the sweet taste of cherry, as pointed out to Mr. Badii by the museum curator.Ironically, this last man is the only one to have finally consented to his plan.While in TE, the greatest chance for renewal and redemption is laid before Mr. Yamashita in the person of the young woman, whose love, acceptance and forgiveness can be easily seen and felt, if only the former would finally free himself from the phantasmagoric world he has built for himself and his one and only confidante--the eel.This is further aggravated by the ghosts that are always there to haunt him (some are formed by his own mind, while some are simply around, like a fellow inmate who now works as a garbage collector).Though the definitive moment of release and realization (the film's climax) still happens, we aren't completely sure as to the new steps Mr. Yamashita would take.There's simply no and-they-lived-happily-ever-after type of ending here.Mr. Badii and Mr. Yamashita are two dark souls in search of light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's not certain whether they are actually willing to reach such a destination.But we can assuredly say that the persons who brought them to life on the big screen--who else but Kiarostami and Imamura--do have an immense faith in the preciousness and richness of life, despite all the adversities and challenges, be they of a catastrophic (like in their two early masterpieces--the atomic bombing in Imamura's 'Black Rain' and the earthquake in Kiarostami's 'And Life Goes On') or of a personal level (as seen in their award-winning films).The two directors' filmic style is to emphasize the one thing that matters most by making it absent in their characters' lives.It's having to experience emptiness in order to yearn for something.

But he's not looking for any Tom, Dick and Harry to complete his wishes, which we learn to involve his suicide, and for the chosen one to return to the location to call out his name twice. If he was to respond, then the helper is to assist him out of a self-dug hole. Otherwise, 20 shovels of sand is needed to bury Mr Badii, and the helper can make away with his car load of cash, with absolutely no strings attached thereafter.Shot mostly within the interior of his vehicle, and rarely, if not never do we see the characters interaction within the same camera frame, the narrative's punctuated with plenty of solitude and contemplative silence when Badii is on his own in search of his mark, and then filled with plenty of dialogue depending on who's making the case &#x96; Badii in trying to convince those whom he had conned into hopping into his travelling vehicle, or those that he had roped in to help &#x96; a Kurd, an Afghan and a Turk, attempting to either escape, or trying their best to talk him out of his thought. During those moments the film becomes a an extremely talky one within the close confines of the car, and leaves you constantly wondering who would finally have the upper hand.I appreciated the last one best, from which the title is sort of touched upon. The Turkish taxidermist who once shared the same thoughts about ending his own life, and it becomes a moving piece on life itself, how with all its problems and troubles, is still something worth seeing out properly. We see the extremes of characters just amongst those three in Badii's car, where one is frightened enough to pretend that he seemed indifferent, and wanted to bail out and go back to the safety net of his routine life, uninterrupted by life's sudden challenge, and the other extreme that one preaches why he would not support Badii's quest, but does not go beyond mere words. Then there are those who are stuck in the middle, where money plays a key into covering one's heart, because it's needed to facilitate a personal gain.Given my continuous curiosity of the landscapes in Tehran, Iran, where this film was shot in, it doesn't show you much beyond the brown-orange environment of a construction site that Badii frequently uses, going almost to the top where he intends to end his life at. It seems as bleak as Badii's mission can be, with Kiarostami never flinching into giving you additional clues as to the background of this man with the singular passion, which admittedly does waver a little, leaving the ending open ended, with the coda making it all a little more complicated. To me, that little scene looked more like a making-of documentary that couldn't find its proper place in a DVD extra.In any case, if time and the National Library permits, I'm likely to be picking up more of Kiarostami's works to see if indeed they're my cup of tea, or otherwise.

I guess I missed the point. I found it rather tedious. There are more Huh?s in the dialog than any other movie. The lead, who is supposedly sorely depressed, looks more bored than anything else. See this film at a coffee house. It will help keep you awake, and the artsy people will be an appreciative audience.

I derived that he's a leading figure in Iranian cinema, but never got around to watching one of his movies until now (so I can't compare it to the rest of his movies). I'm not sure how to describe Ta'm e guilass (called Taste of Cherry in English). The plot centers on a man driving around the outskirts of Tehran looking for someone to bury him after he commits suicide; when he finds someone, the person gives him a most unusual piece of advice.Is there a philosophical aspect to this? So it seems, but they throw it at you so that it's hard to digest. I should identify that this is not a movie for people with short attention spans aside from moving very slowly, there's hardly any soundtrack. Of course, one could argue that this is a more accurate portrayal of life (and what our lives mean). Probably the main thing that I picked up from the movie is that people's everyday lives in Iran don't look much different from people's everyday lives in the United States. Sure, they have some strict religious laws, but people still go to work and school, children still play around on the side of the road, and it even looked like prisoners were performing manual labor.So, it's worth seeing. But just remember that this is one movie sure to overload your mind. A thinking person's movie indeed, but involving more thought than anyone would know what to do with. "},{"Title":"Come on! You know it's garbage!","Date":"9 January 2002","Score":"12 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I hate this movie. It belongs to the same category as To Vlemma tou Odyssea (Ulysses' Gaze) A movie that is terribly boring and still has its head up in the clouds. There's a nice German word for those kind of movies Gescheitscheisserfilm. Its one thing for a movie just to be boring - but it's insulting when a director tries to sell it as high art, as a thinking movie. This is no thinking piece, it's a piece of garbage.And a terribly boring one. The film's final insult? The end The camera zooms out and you see the film crew. For what? To prove that this is just a film? Well as if we didn't know. The whole film feels so artificial that you are always aware that you're watching a movie.And a terribly boring one. Why do people think it's any good? Perhaps because it's a foreign film? Because the director is Iranian? Well I'd rather watch Showgirls again than to live through that torture again. Or The Postman. Or Battlefield Earth ... well ok, not that one.Rating 1/10 ... and for a very good review of this movie, check out Roger Ebert. He absolutely nails it.

The main character meets two men he asks for assistance with his suicide, both of whom refuse. Then there is a scene where he comes across a big piece of road construction or rock crushing equipment, where he parks his vehicle and sits for a while. A worker asks him to move his vehicle so the construction vehicle can perform it's work, and the man gets up, apparently to move the vehicle. The next moment shows the man in his car talking to someone, who is not seen for a few minutes, but is clearly the third man he picks up to help him with the suicide. But what I assume would be the first part of that sequence, where he meets the third man, is not shown. I wonder if TCM omitted that part, since otherwise the film moves in a perfectly linear fashion. "},{"Title":"Good","Date":"18 September 2008","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" There is the old, and often neglected, nostrum about 'gilding the lily.' I was reminded of this watching Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed 1997 film Taste Of Cherry (Ta'm E Guilass), co-winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, for while it comes close to being a great film for the bulk of its running time of 99 minutes (not the oft-claimed 95 minutes), its much discussed ending, of breaking the fourth wall (ala Ingmar Bergman, circa the 1960s) to reveal what has just been witnessed is all a film, is one of the worst endings for a film of quality I've seen; perhaps even worse than the tacked on uplifting ending to Akira Kurosawa's otherwise stellar Rashomon. The basic problem with the ending is that, unlike in Bergman's run of self-conscious films (Persona, Hour Of The Wolf, Shame), the big 'revelation' that the film is a film comes after we've sat through it; assuming that even such a fourth wall braking could surprise one in these times. Even worse is that it undermines the penultimate scene, which is a better- if not great ending, but one which would arguably qualify Taste Of Cherry as a great film overall. And it is an all Kiarostami film, good or bad, as he produced, wrote, and edited, as well as directed it.Critics, pro and con, have prattled on about Kiarostami's meaning or intent, in regard to the videotaped, not filmed, ending of verdant hills (contrasting with the rest of the film's ruddy barren rock landscapes), but always seem to miss the result, which is that it emotionally deflates the whole story. They claim things such as Kiarostami's abnegation of preachiness, a disdain for tearjerking, some psychological reason why the reveal of the film's fictive nature, at its end, is profound, or his desire to make indeterminacy the film's major motif. Yet, before the ending of the film, it is not preachy, jerks no tears, is clearly fictive, and the penultimate scene spells out indeterminacy far more powerfully and cogently than the ending does. When confronted by such realities as this it is always amusing to watch fans of an artist alibi for failure when the simplest answer is simply failure- that Kiarostami did not believe enough in his film to let it end at its best point. And what the filmmaker desired to achieve, if any aside from himself could divine such a thing, is immaterial to the viewer.Taste Of Cherry has moments of rapturous almost pure cinema, where the visuals alone can sustain the film and indeed do last longer than the lesser parts of the film, but, ultimately, that quality and its often clever script, are undone by the ending. It does not ruin the film, in terms of making it a bad film, but it does keep it from the elusive goal of greatness, for it plays out as an attempt at innovation when, in reality, it was already decades passé (as well as being inappropriate to end the film). Kiarostami's film views the human from a telescopic and microscopic position, and which is the more revealing is debatable. That such an innovative approach is substantially ruined by the poor ending is a shame, even if as human as the dilemma it traces.

You will be very sorry. Being an Iranian American, I am a big fan of Iranian cinema, and I went into this expecting something a little different. I knew it would be darker and slower than most movies. (sigh) I had no idea. The darkness didn't bother me. But the slowness was EXCRUCIATING. There were long stretches where the main character would literally just sit there. Staring. And staring. Contemplating. And thinking. This movie was about an hour longer than it needed to be. Finally, at the end, he's lying in this grave waiting to die. It gets dark. You hear a little rain, then a lot of rain. The screen is black. For about 3 minutes you're staring at a black screen and listening to rain. Romantic if you're in the mood, but if you've just sat through 2 hours of awful movie, you want the thing to end. Then, in what can only be called a feat of cinematic insanity, we get a behind the scenes look at the movie. Complete nonsense. I have never spent 2 more pointless hours in my life. And believe me, the rest of my family felt the exact same way. I sat there for the last 3 fourths of the movie thinking, Am I really watching this? Something mildly interesting IS going to happen, right? NO. "}]
