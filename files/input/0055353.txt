They speak to you on such a level and you identify with such intensity that by the end of the film, your nerves and emotion are raw.Is Raisin in the Sun a play about racial prejudice? Yes indeed, an important one too. No story illustrates the ignorance of 'restricted neighborhoods' better. No film offers the ugliness of white arrogance and presumption, something that still lives and breathes in this country.For me personally, this is also a movie about being a man.This movie illustrates so well how men are composed. We honor the father, love the mother and protect the traditions that raised you. Mixed in with all of that and no less important, are our dreams and aspirations.This movie teaches us, with immense power and clarity, that to be a man, to be a real man, you must never sell out your pride. Never. No matter how badly your dreams have been shattered, your pride and your manhood belong to no one. Simple, basic redemption lies within that truth.It's an important lesson, a deep lesson, that men of today (including myself) need to remind themselves of from time to time. There is a pride within all men. It can be stubborn, it can be arrogant and it can be so full of dreams that it can lead to bitter heartbreak. But it is there, burning in all men and it's our most treasured asset. I can't think of a contemporary play that illustrates more strongly, the struggle and rites of manhood in American culture today. How ironic and perhaps appropriate that the film is written by a woman. It is after all the women in this film who patiently wait for Walter to find himself. The love, faith and patience of the women in this film, illustrate the grace, power and importance women have in all our lives, regardless of our gender.   A Raisin in the Sun, is a marvelous film and brilliant play. It is, from my perspective, an American classic and I believe one of the most underrated American plays of all time. I recommend it to any man that is struggling to find themselves or trying to recapture what is real and what is untouchable within our souls and within our dreams.

What indeed DOES happen to a dream deferred?  Each of the adult main characters has a dream about what should be done with the $10,000 insurance policy paid after the Younger patriarch's death, and each person's dream is challenged.  I most identify with the character of Beneatha, the doctor-to-be in a time when few women, and even fewer Black women, could achieve this dream. This is a story of dreams, of family, of strength, of sacrifice, of mistakes and of recovery from the consequences of those mistakes.  Whenever I need a dose of inspiration, when things in my own life seem too difficult to conquer, I watch A Raisin in the Sun and feel strong again.  The acting in this film is so incredibly moving that there are parts (and I won't give them away) that are so disheartening and sad that they still move me to tears, after all these years and after all the times I have watched it.

There are wonderful lines like Seems God saw fit to give the black man nothing but dreams - but He sure saw fit to give'em children to make the dream seem worthwhile.

This movie shows every hardship that black families went through in the fifties. A Raisin in the Sun movie is a remake of Lorraine Hansberry's classic stage play of how a black family tries to escape from their crowded apartment life to a house in an all white neighborhood. Sidney Politer delivered his usual outstanding performance in this film, which sends a message about the limited opportunities open to blacks in this time period. My favorite character was Mama, played by Claudia McNeil. She did an excellent job showing how the mother is always the backbone of black families through every trial and tribulation. I am not usually a fan of black and white movies, but this movie displayed a wonderful storyline for me to understand the struggle they went through. There was never a movie that I can think of that was this excellent with one set most of the movie and was in black and white. The part of the movie that meant a lot to me is how Mama took the money she received and did something with it that would benefit the whole family. Overall, each main character portrayed a strong black person. For example, Walter Lee realized that he is suppose to follow behind his father and be a strong black man and raise a family. Ruth always stood by her husband no matter his wrongs, Beneatha was a young black student going to college to be doctor and Mama was just their for any of her family member's and remain strong for everyone.

That could be said for every one of them. They all knew exactly what to do with the script from their previous work on the stage play version. Unfortunately, when their face is blown up 10 times on the big screen, so are their actions, and some scenes, because of this, come off a little too over the top dramatic than they should be realistically. The story is a simple one, but actually pretty interesting, and most of the time this is entertaining to watch.The Younger family has just lost a member. Lena Momma Younger's (Claudia McNeil) husband died, and because of this the government is giving the family 10,000 dollars. Momma wants to buy a house and move the family out of their tiny apartment into a nice white neighborhood. Walter (Sidney Potier) has the dream of taking the money to start a liquor store. Beneatha (Diana Sands) wants to go to college on this money. The family has problems, and though no real plot is apparent, the characters make the film.The direction on this is great. The music only adds to it, and helps out greatly in scenes trying to be dramatic. The actors play the scenes off well usually, though as stated earlier, a few times they almost come off campy instead of serious and dramatic. Most of the time this wasn't the case though, and these actor's performances shouldn't be nitpicked like I'm doing, and most won't even notice the over the top goofiness. The writing is very good, and is straight out of the play. The entertainment value is high, though some scenes seem to drag, another better scene generally follows.Overall, this is not a masterpiece. The play is good, the acting is great, the cheese level is fairly low, and Raisin has a true human touch to it that makes the audience feel for these poor characters, and it's a very hard trait to emulate.My rating *** out of ****. 120 mins.

Based on the play made in 1959 by an African-American playwright and painter Lorraine Hansberry. Raisin in the Sun was the first drama written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway. Young Lorraine grew up in a Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood and her own experiences lead to the play's story. She got the title of the play by finding it in a Langston Hughes's poem book 'Harlem' which is quotes in the poem 'A dream deferred'. The title, 'Raisin in the Sun' referred in the original poem about the hundreds of African American slaves that work in the hot sun in the cotton fields whom dream dry up like a raisin. In the play and the movie, its symbolism the frustration of blacks working trying to make a better life for themselves, but in the end, their dream are forgotten or put off due to the mixer of racism and classism. The movie story is about a working-class family called the Youngers. Living in a lousy apartment for decades, they want to and wish to leave the place behind. The central idea of the play is concerned with fighting off the myth of black contentment. It shows the stress of being in poverty when the large family is crammed into a small apartment. The plot get going when the family finds out that Lena AKA Mama (Claudia McNeil) got an insurance check for $10,000. Each members of the family find themselves having their own version of what to do with an insurance check. Walter Lee (Sidney Poitler) a poor chauffeur, dreams of making a fortune by investing the money in a liquor business against the wishes of both his wife and the mother. Sidney Poitler does a great job as Walter. It's one of his best roles in my opinion. You can see the want in his eyes. The pain, he goes through when it doesn't come his way. Powerful. Beneatha (Diana Sands), his flighty college student sister also wants the money so that she can be a doctor and live in Africa with one of her two boyfriends. One is a boy, George Murchison (Louis Gossett), a wealthy Negro concerned with appearances and material, while the second, Joseph Asagai (Ivan Dixon), is a native African that inspires her intellectually and spiritually. Great symbolism with Beneatha's hair in the film. When the movie begins, Beneatha has straightened hair. Midway through the play, after Asagai visits her and questions her hairstyle, she cuts her Caucasian-seeming hair for the new radical afro represents her embracing of her African heritage. Beneatha's cutting of her hair is a very powerful social statement in the 1960's, as she symbolically declares that natural black is beautiful and wouldn't conform to the style society dictates at the time. It's become a symbol of her anti-assimilationist beliefs. The film dealt with the talk about racism, not only with whites and blacks, but also black against black. One of the first major allusions to any sort of racism appears with the character of George Murchison. When the wealthy George enters the picture, the Younger family sees the differences in race and grouped him with snobbish white people. Mama dreams of buying a home in all-white neighborhood with her money, but fears that they would be faced with racist neighbors, and people trying to buy them out to prevent the neighborhood's integration. One such person trying to buy them out is Karl Aka Mark Linder (John Fielder) whom openly states the racism present in the neighborhood that Mama wants to live. While he at first sugarcoats his words, he tells the Youngers that they are not wanted in the neighborhood because they are Negroes. Mama's choice soon become troublesome, as one choice can lead them into deeply poverty or salvation. A Raisin in the Sun is essentially about dreams, as the main characters struggle to deal with the oppressive circumstances that rule their lives, both with happiness and depression. The movie follows a good amount of themes such as the need to fight racial discrimination in a powerfully demonstrates of the family strength. By having a strong family, it shows that the African American community, that the importance of family is key to success. One great thing about the movie is how little, they change from the play. Most of the movie takes place in the home. Was the bar scene really needed? Not really, the producers could had shown Walter's alcoholic nature, just with him coming home with a bottle, and we would get the same results. But by showing the audience how cramped the apartment is, we get how badly they are struggling. Plus, it's nice to see a movie with few cuts scenes. Director Daniel Petrie did a great job. I would had love to see more of Mama's plant. In the play, Mama's plant represents both Mama's care and her dream for her family. Still, the movie does a great job with dealing with other issues, such as abortion, greed, and the lack of religion. The movie follows the play very well. While, 2008's TV movie 'A Raisin in the Sun' does a good job as well. It's doesn't beat this movie by acting standards and scene delivery. While, one might label this as a 'black people' movie, I found its subject matter, universal. I think this film dealt with everything any common folk might have to deal with, and that's why I think the movie is so well-made.

However, instead of providing the answer to their problems, it creates a new set that threatens to tear them apart.Sidney Poitier got himself noticed with this flick, and it's not hard to see why. While it wasn't his breakthrough movie &#150; he'd been around for years, and had co-starred with Curtis in The Defiant Ones a couple of years before &#150; it was the film that led to him obtaining starring roles rather than supporting ones. He brings an exuberance to the screen here that few actors can match, and stalks the cramped set like a panther as he rages against his lot in life. His isn't a likable character, and yet it's a measure of Poitier's talent that, even though he tends to overact at times, he still manages to make the character a sympathetic one. Claudia McNeil, reprising her stage role, vies with Poitier for domination of the screen at times, but it is a contest that benefits the film rather than creating conflict, and both Ruby Dee as Poitier's long-suffering wife and the ill-fated Diana Sands as his feisty sister are overshadowed by the principle actors' performances.Films like this require a level of compromise on the part of the viewer than doesn't come easy to me. While the film itself is undeniably powerful and the rare quality of the writing can't be faulted, the relentless emoting and dramatic expression of deceptively complex themes and ideas begin to wear one down after a while. By their very nature they can only fail to be representative of the people they depict because the ideas expressed are rarely more than passing observations to those who do not devote the deep thought to such matters that are necessary for the creation of such a literate piece of work. In fact, praise of the writing in a play/film like this is a double-edged sword when you think about it the 'real' people represented by the Youngers may feel trapped in the same way as Hansberry's characters, but it's unlikely that they would be able to articulate their feelings in the way the Youngers do. In this sense then, such films are unrealistic, and too often the ultimate nobility of the characters &#150; as witnessed in the concluding scenes in A Raisin In The Sun &#150; fails to ring true. There are few people who would have not taken the white racist's money when faced with the hardship that the Youngers are about to endure, and it would be the easiest thing in the world for anyone to convincingly justify such an act. Perhaps that's simply a sign of the changing times, but something tells me otherwise, and for that reason, Walter's change of heart fails to convince. But then if he didn't have a change of heart, what kind of film &#150; and message &#150; would we be left with?

Lena Younger (Claudia McNeil) is the strong, God-fearing matriarch of the family who is patiently awaiting the arrival of a $10,000 insurance check she is receiving because of the death of her husband. Walter Lee Younger (Sidney Poitier) is Lena's son, a chauffeur who wants to change his life by getting his mother to give him the money so that he can invest it in part ownership of a liquor store. Ruth Younger (Ruby Dee) is Walter Lee's level-headed wife and family referee, who has just learned she is pregnant with her second child; Beneatha Younger (Diana Sands), Walter Lee's sister, is a radical-thinking college student, , who wants to be a doctor someday and torn between her comfortable relationship with George (Louis Gossett) and an African student (Ivan Dixon) who is turning Beneatha's head by exposing her to her African heritage.This film sizzles primarily due to the conflict created between Lena and Walter Lee from Lena's belief that liquor is just a tool of the devil and Walter Lee's belief that his father would have wanted him to use the money to be more than a chauffeur and be the captain of his own destiny.As expected, a 1961 film with an all-black cast was filmed on a shoestring budget, but the powerhouse performances make this film appointment viewing. Next to To Sir with Love, this is my favorite Poitier performance...he is intense and riveting despite the fact that Poitier's screen persona is so much more intelligent than the character he is playing and yet he doesn't make a single false or affected move on screen. McNeil, Dee, and Sands provide solid support to Poitier, who completely dominates this film, but they never allow Poitier to blow them off the screen either. Loved Gossett as Beneatha's tight-ass fiancée too.The film works due to a compelling story and a charismatic performance from Poitier that makes this film still watchable after all these years.

The odd thing, probably something that speaks to the heart of African American audiences, is that this family has been in the country for six generations and still doesn't have anything to show for it because of racism in the country. The movie is full of deep well made characters, each with internal conflicts, who are all having conflicts with each other. The movie is essentially about politics within a family household, who is the leader and has the power, and who gets to decide what is best for the family. Each of the characters seem to have their own personal agenda and there is conflict between the characters that exist outside of the squabble for the $10,000. The film manages depicts the many avenues that the family members (and African Americans in that era) are trying to explore to escape poverty to achieve a better future. This film taught me something new, every time a different character enters a scene a new scene begins. The scene takes on a different tone and adds a new conflict to drive the scene without changing the setting or time, it's done just by introducing a different character through the door. Ultimately the film was wonderful but I felt some of the end scenes dragged on a little too long and kept me waiting too long for the final resolution. The last scenes leading up to Walter's final decision weren't filled with tension or conflict like the previous scenes, it was literally them just waiting and sobbing, something that could of been cut down. Still this is a great film that is a must see for any up and coming screen writer, I highly recommend it.

A Raisin In The Sun was ahead of its time, tackling issues that blacks could easily relate to, dealing also with the more universal issues of racism, social status, the American dream and family values. Beloved actor Sidney Pottier, the first successful black dramatic actor to win an Oscar, is quite young and relatively unknown at the time of this movie, but already showing sparks of a great actor. The role of Walter Younger was a vehicle for his dramatic stylings and several scenes seem tailor-made for him such as Walter's reaction when supposed friend Willy Harris backs off from the plan of running the liquor store and takes his money, his humbling prayer on his knees monologue and his confrontation with Karl Linder refusing to take his money and opting to move into the all-white neighborhood. Frankly, the strength of this movie should have been better recognized in its time. Although it enjoyed immense success in Broadway to both black and white audiences, it should have won Best Picture in 1961 when it was released in theaters- without a question!! Lorraine Hansberry herself, and only a few years before her death of cancer, wrote the screenplay to this movie herself, omitting some longer portions in the stage play but keeping its powerful theme intact.Though Sidney is the major star here, the rest of the actors are equally as impressive and powerful in their performances, rounding out the ideal cast for this play. Not even the later made-for-TV stage play (also with Pottier and different cast) compares to the effectiveness of this movie, which benefits from the viewer seeing the house they bought in the beautiful upper-class suburb, seeing Walter work as a chauffeur, the sights of 50's urban life and the bar/jazz club that Walter frequented with Willy Harris and Bobo. The dream house is suddenly more real now that we see it instead of just hearing about it. I especially found the actress in the role of Beneatha to be quite talented and lively. I just love the scene in which she dons Nigerian robes and together with a drunk Walter enact a tribal war cry. Another fine moment is when Beneatha declares her atheism (what does God have to do with it ? Man makes his own miracles) and the Christian-bred Mama slaps her and tells her In this house there is still God. Beneatha said a bold statement in the 50's, which was still very Christian- after all this was the same time as The Ten Commandments with Charleton Heston) Other controversial topics, though hinted at in subtlety, is abortion - Ruth, Walter's wife, gets pregnant with his baby and cannot decide whether to keep it or abort it because having another mouth to feed would cost more money. This is a great movie of superior quality and it has fine touching music, acting and a powerful message about staying together as a family, aiming high for your dreams, being proud of your roots and heritage and standing up to inhuman, callous racism.

On the one hand it features an all-black cast, which is a notable achievement for 1961. Yet, at the same time, it shows the plight of the black woman -- even the black man, who feels oppressed, pushes the women in his life down rather than raise them up.There should only be one feeling between men and women, but this belief is because all the women in novels have been written by men.The Nigerian, who speaks fluent English, tries to pick up a young American woman, calling her one for whom bread is not enough. He raises the interesting point that languages do not translate well, but his fluent English clearly suggests he is a man who knows the sense of his words.

Having seen this before in the late '80s, not to mention the recent 2008 TV movie version starring Felicia Rashad and Sean Combs, this version has lost none of its power. Poitier has never shown greater range in his profession than here and Ms. McNeil is a great tower of strength as the matriarch of the household. And Ms. Dee and Ms. Sands add their own worthy contributions to the material. And Fiedler, as the only Caucasian in the cast, brings his own reluctant characterization to the proceedings. It's also nice to see such supporting performances as those of Dixon, Gossett, and Joel Fluellen add to the overall atmosphere. So on that note, this version of A Raisin in the Sun comes highly recommended. P.S. Other people of color that appeared here Roy Glenn as Willie Harris, Ray Stubbs as a bartender, and Stephen Perry as the child Travis Younger.

He shares a small two-bedroom tenement apartment in Chicago with his wife, his son, who is forced to sleep on the couch, and his mother and sister, who share the other bedroom.Even though he has a steady job as a chauffeur for a wealthy white family, the other adults are forced to engage in part-time work in stereotypical jobs, such as kitchen, maid and laundry work. His sister, a part-time student, has dreams of becoming a doctor, while Sidney has dreams of making it big in some emerging business opportunity, as a friend did in dry cleaning.Most of the film takes place in the small apartment, so we feel both the claustrophobia and despair of their situation. The mother immigrated there from the deep south when a teen, in order to escape racism and to find some opportunity for advancement out of poverty, which until her husband's death has been an elusive and unattainable dream.The play and film begin as a glimmer of hope is on its way in the form of a life insurance check for ten thousand following the death of his father, who also lived in the apartment for most of his adult life as well. His mother, played by Claudia McNeil in a Golden Globe and BAFTA nominated performance as the new head of the family, hasn't decided yet what to do with all the money, while the rest of the family dreams what it could mean to each of them. Along the way we get to see a very young Lou Gossett, Jr., and Ivan Dixon in small parts as romantic interests of the sister.It may seem a little stagy, but it's obvious that director Petrie wanted to keep the feel and intimacy of the play. At times it seems a bit overemotional perhaps, with some acting bordering on histrionics; nevertheless, the entire cast turns in excellent, heart-rending performances, led by Poitier and Ruby Dee as his wife. This is a tough pill to swallow, but if you've grown up poor or within a minority, it feels right on target and gives honest expression to the plight of the economically deprived in this over-abundant yet unequal nation. Given the current economic climate, it truly seems that some things never change.

We see how the desperation of their existence drives every member of the family to do rash things, and how they have to fight racism every step of the way.Watching the movie, it struck me how A Raisin in the Sun must have looked when it debuted on Broadway, and then in cinemas. You see, this movie depicts not only an African-American family, but also a man from Africa, who helps the sister start thinking seriously about her heritage, and so she begins saying things that I would have expected to hear from Malcolm X. Moreover, the husband (Sidney Poitier) asks the sister's friend about why he wears faggoty-looking white shoes. By that point, how many movies had employed derogatory language, much less anything about homosexuality? Without a doubt, this has to be seen as one of the movies representing the new path that cinema was taking in the 1960s, focusing more on real-life issues than escapism. And it is definitely one that I recommend. Also starring Ruby Dee, Diana Sands, Claudia McNeil, Roy Glenn, Louis Gossett, Ivan Dixon and Stephen Perry.

The plot revolves around a black family's determined fight, to escape poverty. The Younger family is headed by stalwart Matriarch, Lena Younger. Lena shares her run-down tenement apartment in Chicago, with her son Walter, his wife Ruth, their son Travis, and Lena's daughter Beneatha.After her husband dies, Lena is entitled to receive a tidy sum of insurance money, that her husband had willed to her. The rest of the family, also eagerly awaits the arrival of Lena's insurance check. Especially Walter, who wants Lena to use some of the money, to help him start his own liquor store. Lena decides to use some of her insurance money, to buy a modest home in an all-white neighborhood, and to donate the rest of it, to her local church. Walter is crushed by Lena's decision. Lena later decides to give Walter some of the money, to give him a chance to realize his dream of owning a business. But Lena soon regrets her decision to give money to Walter, after he loses it, because of his crooked business partner. Lena and her family, must also decide if they really want to move into a white neighborhood. Especially after white homeowners there, try to offer the Youngers lots of money, if they agree not to move into the neighborhood. The entire cast of this film, is positively magnificent. Especially Sydney Poitier as Walter Younger. Sydney conveys Walter's anguish, with an amazing depth and clarity. This is Sydney's best film, and a must-see for his serious fans. Claudia McNeil is perfect in her role, as the strong-willed Lena Younger, who acts as the Younger family's moral compass.This powerful, moving film, is unforgettable. And I highly recommend it, to anyone who loves classic American drama films.

The movie has different facets, relationship between siblings, racism, ethics (the liquor business) etc. The movie certainly swings between the feel of a movie and a stage play especially in Poitier's character. The mother role has also been performed well, almost unbending on issues related to family and ethics.

It is apparent that some comments were written by people who have no idea what life is like for Black families in such a situation, and certainly identical for any family in the same predicament.That it was released in 1961 speaks to the long-boiling rage felt in Afro-American communities in the United States. Sidney Poiter (Walter Lee Young), Ruby Dee (Ruth Younger), Diana Sands (Beantha Younger) and all of the other actors bring the heat from Lorraine Hansberry's script, under Daniel Petrie's direction - however, the heart of the tale belongs to MaMa (Claudia McNeil). Although there must have been - and are - strong ladies of the same courage and wisdom even today, mostly seen in The South. No doubt, women of all races have these matriarchs to keep the family together, no matter where in the world.There is nothing to denigrate this film, if you understand life's difficulties. It is as relevant today and it was when it was released. I rate it at 50, and don't care to see the other versions of it - this movie-version of A Raisin in the Sun can't, in my opinion, be improved upon, no matter who played the roles.To watch it is a valuable lesson for life, because it graphically depicts how greedily foolish we all are where money is concerned. It is also a classic solution to how we can rise above our own foolishness's. It should be watched by entire families, together, so they can readily see how their relationships affect the entire clan. Bravo to all of these actors-actresses!!!

Although Hansberry's childhood was a great deal more middle class than that of the Younger family who is the subject of the play, she captures the black urban experience of the civil rights era brilliantly. Some of the things written in A Raisin In The Sun were experienced by Hansberry personally, most particularly her own family's struggle to move into the white suburbs.Columbia Pictures had the good sense to hire Lorraine Hansberry to write the screenplay and convert her play which all takes place in the Younger family apartment in the south side of Chicago for the screen. There are a few brief scenes added outside the apartment. But what really holds the interest is the dialog between the four main characters in the apartment. It's a lot like Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night with souls laid bare. The apartment itself almost becomes a character, a home but also the symbol of a kind of prison the Youngers want to break out of.The four main characters are Walter Younger, Jr., his wife Ruth, his sister Berneatha, and mother Lena, played by Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee, Diana Sands, and Claudia McNeil respectively who all came over from Broadway. Through McNeil's performance particularly, but the others as well, the family patriarch Walter Younger also comes alive. What has happened is that he has recently died and the family is awaiting a $10,000.00 insurance check, courtesy of his years of service with the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first primarily black union to organize in the USA. Poitier is working as a chauffeur, both Dee and McNeil work and have worked as domestics, Sands is a young college student with the ideas of her time, but she's also been spoiled a whole lot. Each has their own idea of what to do with the insurance money. The conflict and what eventually does happen divides and then unites the family in the end.A Raisin In The Sun ran for 530 performances on Broadway during the 1959-60 season and earned a flock of Tony Award nominations including Best Actor for Poitier and Best Actress for McNeil. Coming out as it did during the Civil Rights era it was as timely a literary masterpiece as there ever was. When it concluded its Broadway run, film production with just about the entire cast from Broadway commenced.A couple of other players who would make their marks later on were in A Raisin In The Sun. Lou Gossett, Jr. years before his Oscar plays a young and naive college kid who is interested in Sands. But she's far more interested in Ivan Dixon who is from Nigeria way before he joined the cast of Hogan's Heroes. Though it is firmly set in the times it was written in, as drama A Raisin In The Sun is positively eternal. It's as flawless a transfer from stage to film as you'll ever see.

You really feel the frustrations, heartaches, and pain of the poor black family struggling to make ends meet and come together, and it's a very powerful situation. Mousey John Fiedler was the perfect actor to play the disingenuous and creepy man trying to buy back a home that the family has purchased in an exclusively white neighborhood.

One thing I did not notice before is that the son is 35 years old.  I always thought he was younger. To me that changes his character and the way I look at him.  He is way too old to act the way he did. And I believe his mother babied him too much and made excuses for him. I wonder if that is also a lesson to be had. He has a wife who works like a dog a young son and a kid on the way and he  acts like a teenager. He and the mother made me angry this time around.

It is a shame Diana Sands died so young,  what a great loss. It was very interesting to see the neighborhood welcoming  idiot.  I know this happens,  but I feel it is less subtle in real life.
