And it's also just one darned enjoyable flick. I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure. True, it is pure cornball, but I have grown to love it, and I watch it regularly every year around Halloween, since (naturally) several channels on TV routinely feature it as part of that select batch of Halloween pictures that just scream for annual broadcasting.Extremely well filmed (IMHO), I am always really amazed at how nice it is to see it again each year &#150; it holds up well and looks fantastic even today, after 13 years.From a physical perspective, Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) - with that showgirl figure and that over-the-top tight-fitting black costume - just grabs your attention with both, um, *hands*, from the get go, and never lets go. But there's much more to revel in here than just her physical assets her acting, her ditzy charm and irreverent risqu√© sense of humor will just have you lapping it up. In short, you'll just love Elvira from top to bottom (unlike the townies in the story, many of whom decidedly did not take kindly to her sudden arrival in their up-tight little burg in Massachusetts).This movie is just busting out all over with titillating, slightly off-color humor (or off-colour humour for those of you on the other side of the Atlantic) from start to finish. There are many funny and memorable lines in this movie of the double-entendre variety; it's hard to keep abreast of them all. (I'd list a few of my racier favorites here, but in the interest of not offending the delicate sensibilities of anyone reading this who is NOT into that sort of humor, well, it might be best for you to just go watch the movie and compile your own list).I can't say anything bad about this movie at all, except that sadly it does end, and you are left wanting more (of Elvira). LOTS more. Alas, c'est la vie.

This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When all is said & done that's the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie & forget your troubles. It even has a simple & kind moral message at no extra charge. I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She did not really steal her schtick from Vampira any more than Vampira did from the original, Theda Bara. This sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; we need more of these kind of movies. There are never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes a wonderful refined malice. I could find no technical faults. The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets.

Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook.

Morgan Sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world.my thoughts I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie, her charms are put to good use.I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining.W. Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira.What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film, and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film.If you love Elvira, you will love this flick.

Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station's owner gets fresh with her. She's now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started. Things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house in need of repairs, a dog, and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt, and again it seems Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. Elvira's Uncle Vinnie (W. Morgan Sheppard), presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and a couple very effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power. Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs, and parodies. The film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (of Grease.) There are also nice special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is delightfully, YES!

Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts.

I mean best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she has travelled from Los Angeles in order to attend the reading of her Great Aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the town council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty) who has her eye on Bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as Elvira. And, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.This movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.I've seen this movie countless times and I never ever get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the whole movie.

With no money Elvira decides to stick around & sell the house but the conservative locals think Elvira is immoral, cheap & bad for the town so lead by the righteous Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg) they start a campaign to oust her from Fallwall. Meanwhile Elvira's evil Satan worshipping uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard) is plotting to get his hands on Elvira's cookbook ,which is in fact a book of powerful spells, by any means necessary...Directed by James Signorelli I thought Elvira, Mistress of the Dark was a decent watchable family comedy horror. I have to state straight away that I am perhaps at a disadvantage as here in the UK we have no exposure to the character Elvira unlike in the States where I think she gave introductions to horror films, right? Anyway I'm not sure as we don't, & never had, have anything like that here & I have never seen the Elvira character in anything before this. The script by Sam Egan, John Paragon & Peterson is silly & really plays the comedy elements up, I'd have perhaps preferred the horror angle to come through a bit more, I mean wasn't she a horror film hostess? Having said that it provides fair entertainment & a some mildly amusing moments here & there & at least it knows what it is & has no aspirations to be anything else other than a collection of puns, boob jokes, sexual innuendo & slapstick. As a whole Elvira, Mistress of the Dark works quite well with likable character's, just enough horror to maintain my interest & Elvira herself is pretty charismatic, very sexy in her skin tight low cut dress, high heels & I wouldn't mind her introducing my horror films. Look out for her Las Vegas show at the end where she twirls some tassel's attached to her breasts, even managing one at a time.Director Signorelli keeps things moving at a nice pace, the jokes & puns come thick & fast & it never becomes dull or boring. There is one effective jump scene that involves a slimy creature that feels like it belongs in a different film. Forget about any violence, someone has their hand cut off with an axe & Elvira throws her high heeled shoe at someone & the heel becomes impaled in their forehead! I did think he overdid the sentimentality a little at the mushy feel good ending though.With a healthy budget of about $7,500,000 I must admit I'm not sure where all the money went, there are few special effects, no big name actors or huge action scenes. Anyway, it's well made & Elvira's spooky house, inside & out, looks cool which probably cost a few quid to make. The acting is OK & everyone comes across as likable enough, Elvira obviously steals the show with her outfits & attitude.Elvira, Mistress of the dark is a nice enough way to pass 95 odd minutes & offers a few amusing moments. A lot of the jokes feel dated & the overall story is weak but I still think it's worth a watch.

I could all-but recite every line, every joke and see everything coming two chapters ahead. And that's not a bad thing; I still laughed out loud all over again in a movie that's 25-years-old this September.(And speaking of which &#x96; where is the 25th Anniversary BluRay Special Edition for this absolute classic?)It helps that I used to watch her show, about her hosting and commenting on terribly bad and unintentionally hilarious B-movies, live &#x96; and watched it for different reasons most boys did my age. It also helps that I transitioned, following her, into Mystery Science Theater 3000. But, none of that accounts for the full-movie she helped write here. In fact, aside from the opening act (the set-up,) a few mentions of movies she likes, a brief live-edition in the midsection and the spoof of making a movie mimicking her B-movies, the movie really stands on its own.Yeah, that didn't come out right. But, what I mentioned was only part of the whole experience. And though it's not entirely based on an original idea, Cassandra Peterson's Elvira has such great wit, delivery and charisma, it makes the old setup fresh and very funny.Elvira's fired from her show (see description above) and lucks out with perfect timing of her Great Aunt's passing and an inheritance that might fund her Las Vegas' Flamingo show.

Will Elvira, and her new followers, be able to stop such a warlock?In truth, and as stated it's been approximately 20 years since I last saw this, I didn't know I would still roll with laughter. Also, I didn't think I'd see her as a hypocrite constantly she flirts, flaunts her huge&#x85;attributes and then bashes whoever makes a sexual move toward her. I did think she was a hypocrite, until it made sense She was mocking, very cleverly, indeed, women who either have big breasts, or buy them, make advances and then shuns those who take the bait. Smart girl. Cassandra, that is.Anyhoo, this movie meant a lot to me growing up. It defined a lot of my own humor and I still, to this day, use the lines in my every day routines. There are so many to mention, but the number one quote I unabashedly repeat constantlyHey, does anyone know what that movie was about?

True her act is almost a one joke routine, with the audience almost expecting a wardrobe malfunction at any time -- but she does make me laugh big time. The slight plot here has Elvira quitting her movie hosting job, and heading for New England to retrieve an inheritance from her great aunt. The townsfolk there, lead by self-righteous Edie McClurg take an instant dislike to her, and make great effort to drive her out of town. Elvira soon befriends local teenagers, flirts with a brainless hunk, has a confrontation with her evil uncle, and eventually takes on the entire town.There are some pretty big laughs contained in here, and Peterson's delivery is always spot-on and her facial expressions are priceless. Most of the jokes are risqu√©, usually centered around her highly visible cleavage and her over-active libido. She makes the most of her talents in some very funny ways, like in the fantasy sequence at the beginning where she imagines herself as a winning contestant on a TV game show. She exhibits such excitement here that she can barely contain herself, leaping up and down repeatedly with her arms windmilling. It's quite a sight, and a testament to the strength of duct tape.Edie McClurg supports Peterson nicely, playing Chastity Pariah, the biggest prude in town, who has some very funny moments. There's even an homage to Carrie, a movie featuring one of McClurg's early film appearances. Jeff Conaway looks absolutely wasted here in his role as a low-life henchman, and considering what became public knowledge about his substance abuse -- he most likely was. A bonus is some cool musical sequences at the end, where Elvira does gymnastics, sings heavy metal, and, actually, raps. Fans of cheesy 1980's music video would really appreciate the poor to bad taste exhibited in these scenes.It's surprisingly funny, and still delivers its obvious message of tolerance. Elvira, Mistress of the Dark is a 1980's cult classic that even today lets Elvira keep us all abreast of her remarkable talents.*** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Jungian Camp","Date":"5 January 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.Best Quote Bob Redding How's your head? Elvira I haven't had any complaints.

Steve Martin, pay attention, you are falling in this category again for some reason.Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly. Done at a quick pace, with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn't the Philedelphia Story, it entertains from start to finish. Brain Donors is another that fits right in this category (sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes).One point of contention - the ending. It seems the writers/director had no idea how to finish a comedy. The ending tries to be a love story, somewhat undermining the quirky fast-paced dialogue up to that point. Then there is the tassle scene. Whereas this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over the top and out of place it's like a shock. One more rewrite for the ending was needed.This is not comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail.

It's very 1980's, with lots of really (and I mean REALLY) corny sexual innuendo.In spite of this, Mistress of the Dark goes out of its way to portray Elvira herself as more than just a piece of eye candy -- I believe the word the kids today would use is sex positive. Elvira knows what she wants and kicks every guy to the curb that would dare take advantage of her. Even though she plays up the role of a bimbo on occasion, she's often smarter and tougher than that.If you can deal with that, then this ends up being a pretty alright movie to watch around Halloween. Granted, it's a little dull; The production value feels very basic cable despite this movie's theatrical release. The raunchy humor isn't quite raunchy enough and the pace of the movie is a little too slow. It's a movie that's trying to have bite, but ends up being more of a nibble.The real problem is how the movie beats you over the head with how cool Elvira is meant to be. She's here to show these prudish normies what's up, with her hot rod and her heavy metal and her snarky attitude. It ends up being kind of overbearing at times, with Elvira breaking the fourth wall multiple times to address the audience directly.But I still get some enjoyment out of it.

I knew she was a horror host in the 80s and some of the 90s and she took off a lot more than any others did (unless you count MST3K) and...that probably would've been it. So, rather curiously and in a way that I can't really explain why, I decided to watch this to get a firm foundation for her character and maybe her show. In the end, it was quite an enjoyable little film.Okay so the plot will probably sound familiar in one way or another - A horror show host named Elvira quits her job as a horror host at a local TV station after finding out its being bought by a pervert who wants to take sexual advantage of her and wants to start up a show in Vegas but to achieve that, she has to come up with $50 000 and, by coincidence, her Great Aunt has just died and the reading of her will is in a few days in a town thats...conservative, to say the least. She is mostly treated badly from everyone there with the exceptions being the teenagers of the town and the local film theater manager, whose the love interest. And it turns out her inheritance is the house from The Munsters (no joke, its the same house!), a punk rock dog and a recipe book which her only other relative (her Great Uncle) wants to get his hands on, on the grounds that its a spell recipe book and wants to use it to become the Master of the Dark.Okay, whats good here? Well a lot of the jokes do hit the nail in the head, most of the time, in getting a laugh however corny they may be, its a surprisingly creative way to make a film about a horror host, all the actors do well for their parts and its great to just see the film play out. What do I mean by that? A lot of the time Elvira has a conspiracy planned against her by the head of the town, Chastity Pariah. Maybe its different for some people but the amount of times the supposed moral figure of the town proves just how insane she is and how Elvira the harlot is probably one of the few voices of reason in the entire film is just funny to me. My favourite scene is just as Elvira discovers she's a witch and she can do all this, the townsfolk that have all wronged her have a morality picnic, as a celebration of the fact that they've kept their morals and values in check. She puts in a potion she brewed up which...turns it into an orgy (well as much of an orgy as you can get from an M rating) (also, while I'm doing this, as much as it will be hard to believe, considering Elvira's reputation the whole 'turning the picnic into an orgy was completely by accident!) and the very next scene is of a town meeting where they constantly blame the other person they were with for coming on to them and being sex crazed deviants. Again, your opinion may vary on how funny that is.Whats bad? I'm not going to act like there isn't anything. Sometimes the fantasy sequences are a bit tedious, some of the jokes didn't quite make it with a few leaving me groaning but the worst thing, for me at least, was that after everything's done, spoiler alert, Elvira achieves her dream of going to Vegas and we see what her act is. Which goes on for 4 minutes and while the film wasn't awful by this stage my reaction was along the lines of Movie...your over. Why are we focusing on this when its not even funny?So is it for everyone? No. The best way to describe this film is imagine if Hocus Pocus (1993) and The Addams Family (1991) had a child that happened to star one of the most successful horror hosts ever. Get that image in your head, add a tonne of cheese to it (yes, even more than either of those two films had combined) and thats this movie. So if your in the right mood, go check it out.

Ellen Dunning (Robin) gets an honorable mention on the female front. While only half the humor works (the other half being groan-inducing) there are several laugh-out-loud sequences, like the parodying of The Price Is Right and Flashdance. Christians might find the portrayal of the intolerant townsfolk offensive, but (1.) the movie's a comedy/parody, not a depiction of real-life; anyone who takes this seriously needs to visit the psych ward; (2.) the movie amusingly denounces counterfeit religiosity, i.e. sterile legalism, and not Christendom itself; and (3.) the ending pretty much makes up for the negative portrayal.What I find somewhat annoying is the continual wisecracking that pegs Elvira as a loose woman, to put it nicely. While her long black dress reveals mega-cleavage and the upper part of one leg, it's not exactly prostitute attire; plus the story shows Elvira interested in only ONE guy, which hardly constitutes a loose woman.BOTTOM LINE This is a worthwhile turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-good-time flick with Elvira.

In between we get all kinds of silly humour such as a dog with a punk hairstyle, an orgiastic picnic with Edie McClurg(need I say more?), a rather tame and pedestrian romance with some imbecile in town, Elvira quipping one-liners like the sleazy Oscar Wilde of her time, and breasts. more breasts. More cleavage. More suggestive uses for those breasts. We get innuendo by the truckload. Naturally all this makes for a silly and stupid film, but Cassandra Peterson as Elvira is indeed more than two large fleshy orbs - she has other talents. She is funny. She can act - at least for a film like this. She has a great screen persona. Sure, the sophomoric obsession with her bazooms, her bosom, her jugs, her boobs, her mammaries, her ample bounty get a bit tiresome for me(and I assure you I am not only a big fan but a dedicated one with regard to those assets), but they are funny an not really made to be anything other than that. There is absolutely nothing erotic here. Elvira is having fun and likes people to see her - much of her - having fun. There are lots of pretty good verbal and visual gags throughout.

And yes, I include myself in that general statement.This movie sees Elvira heading to a small town to claim an inheritance from a relative she didn't even know about. The town is run by prudes and hypocrites and it's not long until Elvira is putting some noses out of joint. There's also some nonsense about a family recipe book that contains some powerful spells but, let's be honest here, this film is about two things and Elvira/Cassandra is smart enough to be in on the joke.Breasts. Almost every scene, gag and second comment relates in some way to Elvira's breasts. If you know that's coming then you have no reason to complain when that's what the movie delivers. The jokes may make you groan and may be completely obvious but everyone involved delivers the creaky material with a gusto and good humour that means you have to be a real stick-in-the-mud to sit and watch events unfold without even the smallest of grins breaking out on occasion.With support from people such as Kurt Fuller and the great Edie McClurg, there are some genuine laughs amongst the groansome gags, and the script and direction are good enough for the material, basically pushing everything aside to leave the stage clear for those breast gags. And the biggest gag of all is that it's all just, relatively harmless, teasing. Elvira may talk the talk and walk the walk but in some ways she's just an old-fashioned gal wanting some harmless fun on her own terms.

A few years ago, I did manage to watch Elvira's Haunted Hills (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much. Was it really that forgettable, or should I give it another watch? I actually really do feel like re-watching it now, as this first Elvira film from '88 really convinced me. Though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work, might be Sam Egan and John Paragon with their contributions to the script, there really is no way to deny it Cassandra Peterson has a great feel for comedy (she also co-wrote the screenplay).When Elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a Great Aunt (she never heard of before), she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in Las Vegas. Out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she travels to a quiet New England town. But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat. In less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour. To make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected A rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle. But what she doesn't know, and her evil uncle Vincent Albot does, is that her Great Aunt was a witch, and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable. And if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time Elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.It's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes, witty one-liners, movie references, inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story. Simple, of course, but coherent. While other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the Naked Gun films, for example), this film doesn't. A lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80's, but not a lot of them actually worked. Let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point (Killer Party, although I'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly (Saturday the 14th). Although Elvira is more comedy than horror, it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of Falwell between newborn witch Elvira and evil uncle wizard Talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and Elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment.I'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny. One of the first giggles I got was during the opening credits already, when Daniel Greene's name appeared. Daniel who? Oh yes, I recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face). How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you've seen... Atomic Cyborg aka Fists of Steel! But if you haven't seen Atomic Cyborg, then I'm sorry, but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one. And on a side-note I never could have imagined Elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station. Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.

She hosted and presented classic American horror films, many of them campy, while providing her own quips and humorous remarks. Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success. In 1988, her first film was released. Playing herself, she's stuck hosting monster movie shows but longs for her own show in Las Vegas and make big money. Her agent Manny proves a disappointment. It's not long before she inherits a mansion from a deceased relative, a pet dog and a book of recipes. She comes to claim her inheritance in a small Nevada town - she was on her way to Vegas and became lost - and soon stirs things up in the sedate community. Outspoken conservative town council woman Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg) soon sees her as a threat to the decency and values of the small town. Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town. She falls for Bob Redding (Daniel Greene) the town handyman/carpenter, but before any real relationship can bloom, she finds herself in deep trouble. Vincent Talbot (William Morgan Sheppard) an eerie older man who is also set to inherit part of the fortune of Elvira's relative is in fact an age-old sorcerer who has a personal vendetta against Elvira's aunt and Elvira herself. He is aware that the so-called recipe book is actually a book of powerful magic, a power he wishes to claim for himself. He schemes to bring down Elvira by having the town burn her at the stake. How will Elvira get out of this one ? The movie was no real success at the box office, drawing a crowd of mostly young audiences familiar with the Elvira show on cable. Truth be told, this is a funny and feel-good movie. The script is chalk full of all kinds of jokes, some bad, some good, lots of sexual innuendo, visual jokes and overall campiness i.e. the hilarious last scene in which Elvira has finally got her own strip show in Vegas. This film is a cult classic of sorts, catering to Elvira fans. You couldn't enjoy this film otherwise. It's also a look back at pop culture of the 80's. Elvira was as much an icon of the 80's as was Alf, Vicky the Robot, Hulk Hogan, Mr. T and Madonna.

She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result.The plot is flyweight. Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on the old book. Throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go.No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining. It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out.DVD quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge.

No wonder that the high school students in the small town she lives in love her.  They relate to her.  A small woman and a target for ridicule, Elvira has no special powers to protect herself and from time to time she requires help.  Despite it all she goes forward with confidence.  Changing her style is something she hasn't even thought about.  She is who she is and for that she becomes a role model.  The comedy in Mistress is always low-brow, often crude.  After her debut as the town's movie hostess ends in disaster she comments 'so much for my big opening,' followed by a series of double takes; after falling off a ladder she is asked 'how is your head?'  'I've had no complaints' she answers.  After the half way point there is a neat scene involving a creature effect that is quite good and reminds me of many of the comedy horror films of the eighties (Phantasm comes to mind).

Admittedly, it is very silly, but it's hard to imagine anybody going into this expecting anything different. The cast plays the material for all that it's worth.Cassandra co-wrote the script, with her fellow Groundlings castmate John Paragon and Sam Egan. The idea is that TV horror host Elvira loses her job and desperately needs money in order to put on a Vegas production. Wouldn't you know it, a relative dies, a great aunt named Morgana, who lived in a small town named Falwell. Elvira shakes up the ultra conservative nature of this place, which is loathe to permit people to actually have fun. Ultimately, she must deal with a variety of nemeses stuck up Patty (Susan Kellermann), local busybody Chastity Pariah (ever lovable Edie McClurg), and her own great uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard). Vincent wants to get his hands on the book that Elvira inherited; Elvira thinks it's just a boring old recipe book but Vincent knows different.Cassandra is full aware of her greatest assets, with dozens of breast jokes for the occasion. She's as fun as she's ever been playing this character, fully embracing the campy approach and its loving mockery of low budget horror. The special effects are generally quite amusing, especially the pot monster. Daniel Greene is perfectly likable as Elviras' hunky nice guy love interest Bob Redding, and there's a number of familiar faces in this supporting cast Kris Kamm, Ira Heiden, William Duell, Jeff Conaway, Frank Collison, Kurt Fuller, and Hugh Gillin.

Her show Movie Macabre never aired here in Europe, however, and I never really bothered to seek out her long-feature films because they look so &#x85; silly.

Mrs. Cassandra Elvira Peterson, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film, undoubtedly knows her cinematic trash and clearly treasures devotion for B-movies, but the film itself unfortunately is just a gigantically juvenile farce focusing on her very own bosom (which is quite impressive notwithstanding) instead of a cool tribute to genre movies. Elvira's offensively witty one-liners and revealing outfits actually take the attention away from the inexistent and mundane plot. When Elvira gets fired from her TV job in Los Angeles, she finally hopes to start her very own show in Las Vegas, but she needs 50k$ for that to happen. But then she gets a letter announcing her great aunt has died and Elvira's name is mentioned in the will.

Whilst hanging around waiting for her broken down car, Elvira befriends the younger generation of Fallwell and discovers that her deceased aunt was actually a good witch who wanted to prevent her malignant brother Vincent Talbot from obtaining her magic powers.

The second half tries to be a little more involving, with a dumb but funny cooking interlude, an exciting edition of the yearly Fallwell summer picnic and a genuine old-fashioned New England with hunt.

Elvira shows up in the small town where many of the old-fashioned locals look down on her but even worse is the fact that this old house contains a recipe book, which brings with it all sorts of spells and monsters. I've never been a fan of horror hosts and I never was a fan of Elvira so I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I had heard many negative things about this over the years and while the film is pretty bad it also has a certain charm that keeps it somewhat watchable. The entire screenplay is bizarre to say the least because it's never quite sure what type of film it wants to be. I say this because it's kept kid friendly but at the same time you've got all sorts of strange sexual talk that really stands out because you're not expecting to hear it in a movie like this and when you do hear it, it just stands out from everything else going on. All the boob jokes aimed at Elvira is expected and I think a good argument could be made that the film producers would have been much better served had the film gone for a tad bit darker and more adult natured film. The horror elements are all rather weak but I think fans of the genre will get a few smiles out of seeing some cult movies shown here including IT CONQUERED THE WORLD and ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOS. There's also a pretty funny joke involving the first potion that Elvira cooks out. As for Peterson, I'd be lying if I said she gave a good performance but she is good at the character she created and there's no question she can play the part well. The supporting players are all good in their parts but no one really stands out and takes over the film. ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK has a little charm but certainly not enough to carry a fairly weak story.

Nothing much goes on here except some silly gags and inept performances from all around. Sad to see the always likable McClurg in such drivel.  "}]
