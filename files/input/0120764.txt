The second the talking space suit appeared, I knew this was going to be very bad. Too often what happens is that the makers of some films get seduced with the ability of special effects and forget the story. At that point, it was no longer a movie of the beloved My Favorite Martian we have enjoyed from the TV series but a cartoon. I highly recommend people watch the old TV series when it is on in syndication or if its available on DVD, because those shows focused on story and what little special effects that were done in the TV series were strongly carried by the acting, writing and direction.

Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case, either. Soon everyone in television is stalking Tim, hoping for a story about a true alien. What's a man to do? For those who loved the old television show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. Its truly, undeniably awful, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat, too. Daniels is okay as the earthling but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien, overacting up a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, set, and production details. Even if your children see the cover and beg for this film, convince them to pick out another flick at the video store. Be assured, kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore, so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days instead.

His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal. His ranting, groaning, grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character.The director must have thought that fast movements, screaming dialogue and one-take slapstick had some similarity to comedy.  Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants.Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script.  I think the writer used It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script.  As manic as that 1963 classic is, it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children.  I just am not sure whose children it was made for.  Certainly no self-respecting, card-carrying child I know!If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian, why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic?

In the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-Martin.The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film.

Supporting roles are cardboard at best. Daniels plays the foil and unfortunately falls flat. Elizabeth Hurley as another reporter is a mere prop but thankfully she provides great eye candy.

Although I am 17, I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.The special effects are rather substandard, and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.Now I will say I liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and Elizabeth Hurley's character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.Overall, as much I wanted to like this movie, I was left unimpressed. Instead of being fun, it came across as pointless, and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"Not totally successful movie of the 1963 TV series.","Date":"3 May 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" I don't believe remakes of TV series are intended to be great movies, just good entertainment for those who remember the TV series.

And, Jeff Daniels is fine as Tim O'Hara, who eventually befriends Uncle Martin.As the scientists investigate some clues from the crash site, where Uncle Martin's space ship had ended up, several references are made to an incident in 1964, which may have involved aliens but had never been solved.

Also, it seemed that Jeff Daniels' character Tim O'Hara was an older version of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly as they both played second fiddle to Christopher Lloyd. I found this film to be lacking in some areas such as laughter. Since this film is based on a television show, I'm sure that the director wanted to make the film as if it were an original. I thought that everything in this film was predictable; from its landing and the doctor who is after Uncle Martin to the traditional happy ending.With this being said, it was entertaining and enjoyable for younger audiences, but not for people around my age.

It was action-packed, well acted, childish, energetic and has a suitable plot. But this is supposed to be a comedy, and I did not laugh very much in this picture, nor did I find the majority of it very amusing. While the movie will certainly satisfy kids, if I thought this film was too wide, then I can't imagine the average adult surviving it.The film stars Jeff Daniels as a TV reporter named Tim O'Hara. in the movie, Tim has just had a very bad day. On his way home from work, he sees a bright light coming from the nighttime sky. Then what looks like an airplane crashes on the beach shore only feet from is car. In amazement, and curiosity, he walks over to investigate precariously.What he finds is nothing, except an object that looks like a toy spaceship. He is soon joined in his search by his co-worker named Brace Channing, played by Elizabeth Hurley. She listens to what Tim saw, investigate, smokes, though here cigarette on the ground, thinks Tim is a nut-case, and storms away disappointedly.We find out later that the toy Tim found is really an actual UFO that belongs to a creature from outer space, who used a shrinking device to make it really small. The alien takes the from of a human with his special capabilities. His name becomes Uncle Martin in a state of panic and confusion trying to cover up his existence.Uncle Martin is very strange. He dresses in a galactic space suit that has feelings, can talk, move, fight, and spank people in the behind that he demonstrates in one scene several times. He also has a name Zoot. Martin also can make his favorite foods fly around an area and land in his mouth, and chew gum that turns him into different life forms. If humans eat chew it, however, they will turn into ugly extraterrestrials.At first, being a TV reporter, Tim only uses Martin so he can capture his species on camera, thus be responsible for the biggest story in history. But after a while, the script requires him to start to like Martin, and realize that the press would look him in a cell, destroying his care-free life.The film has some very nice moments in it. The special effects are also first rate, including scenes where a shrunken car ride into the sewer and end up in the toilet of a fat man's house, who really has to go. The alien effects are also first rate. Thus, My Favorite Martian is not at all a bad movie.But I have a real hard time calling it Good.

I found this film to be lacking in some areas such as laughter. Since this film is based on a television show, I'm sure that the director wanted to make the film as if it were an original.

A city on Mars!        On earth, in Santa Barbera lived a young reporter, Tim O'Hara, who drove his bulky old car to work one morning. His boss, Mr. Channing, assigned him to report on the shuttle launch that night. Tim's partner, and Mr. Channing's daughter, Brace was the reporter while Tim told her what to say. He made the mistake of saying she was beautiful through the speaker which Brace said to Captain Dalton. En route home, Tim witnessed a space ship crash, but found nothing when going toinvestigate, so he got back in his car to go home, but it wouldn't start. The pilot of the crashed ship, a martian named Martin, had shrunk the ship, took human form and jumped in Tim's trunk. He finally made it home. Martin followed. Martin and Tim were soon acquainted. Martin wore a suit, Zoot, that talked. Constantly.        Martin's ship was damaged and it had to be repaired. All the while, Tim video taped Martin in hopes of exploiting him, but soon changed his mind; Dr. Elliot Coleye became obsessed with finding the alien from the crash sight; Tim soon found out what happened when Martin ate ice cream. He also found out, that same day, that martians only sleep 30 seconds. Martin soon learns that ship was equipt with a device that will cause it to detonate unless it was taken off earth in a matter of hours. But soon Martin was kidnapped by Dr. Coleye, so Tim with the help of his girlfriend, Lizzie, help him out.Suddenly, Martin is reunited with an old friend Nineenert.

Once viewed as a major threat, television has lately, it seems, and with some sweet irony, become more and more a source of salvation for the movie industry, providing a seemingly limitless supply of once-popular series to serve as inspiration for big budget, usually special-effects laden feature films. The fact that the quality of these films is, almost without exception, abysmally low simply underlines the fact that TV may just be exacting its sweet revenge for the earlier mistreatment it endured at the hands of its cinematic big brother.  The only compensation for those of us moviegoers who serve as innocent bystanders to the proceedings is the knowledge that even this bone yard will someday have been picked clean &#150; and none too soon!Evidence of this cheering possibility is indeed mounting as reflected in `My Favorite Martian,' a film which arises from the total impoverishment of ideas that is decimating big budget filmmaking.  Faced as they may be with a creative dry well, must Hollywood producers really be forced to dig this low to get something onto the screen?  Based on a mediocre TV series in which Bill Bixby and Ray Walston played, respectively, a regular guy and his martian pal, this film strands a collection of otherwise able performers - Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Elizabeth Hurley, Daryl Hannah and Wallace Shawn, all of whom have been showcased to far better advantage elsewhere &#150; in a half-witted screenplay that mistakes undisciplined loudness and tumult for cleverness and wit.  Although the cast members do their valiant best, particularly Lloyd as the martian, all they can really do is run around in a chaotic frenzy vainly hoping to ride roughshod over the lame jokes and laboriously contrived setups.   There are, actually, a few flashes of humor as Uncle Martin heads out to confront this alien world of Santa Barbara, but the whole endeavor soon grows wearying as the filmmakers speed up the action to the point of hyperventilating exhaustion.  Even the clever use of Ray Walston, the original Uncle Martin in the series, can't rescue the film from its own glaring inadequacies.  Children may be amused by the movie's lowbrow comic antics, but adults, both those with fond memories of the original series and those without, had best steer clear of this particular homage.  One wonders in trepidation just how many yet-to-be-produced scripts derived from dated TV series still litter the offices of studio executives.  It's enough to make one wish the movie industry in the 1950's had won the battle in the first place!

First and foremost, why anyone thought this lesser-sitcom material would ever make even a half-decent motion picture.  In the kooky 60's teleplay, the unique idea of Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3.Any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the unworldly visitor.  The conceit that Martians have antenna seemed dopey back then. Now it seems positively idiotic.  Yet, Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Martin sports the metallic appendages.  In an early shot, the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim works at is supposed to make us think martian! When's the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, eh?Disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth-wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named Zoot! Yes, you read that correctly - Uncle Martin's silver space suit speaks. He is supposed to be a real hilarious cut-up!  Figure again.  I got stretch socks that are funnier than Zoot.  Whenever the action lags (and it lags constantly), computer graphics are put into play to liven things up.  Tim is here played by the amiable Jeff Daniels, who can't (or won't) do anything to save this floudering mess.  Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role.  Even Ray Walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings - all to no avail.

I remember the ads for it. I remembering thinking it had a great cast and great potential in this time of lousy Disney films. And then it landed on earth in the form of a movie. My Favorite Martian. I waited till it came out on video, rented it, and watched it. And then it was over.I wasn't exactly disappointed, but I was a bit let down. It has a lot of talent, a lot of material, and an okay outcome. It took some heat upon its release, but it really wasn't that bad. It was a bit less than I expected, but it was still entertaining.It stars Jeff Daniels (''Dumb and Dumber''), as a TV producer named Tim O'Hara. One day he views a space ship come out of the atmosphere and watches it crash in front of him. As he investigates, a martian appears. The martian (Christopher Doc Brown Lloyd) assumes the name Uncle Martin (get it, Martin, Martian?). Tim takes Uncle Martin and his space suit, named Zoot, (which/who becomes a character itself/himself/herself) back to his home. But what Tim doesn't know is that Uncle Martin and Zoot are capable of instant shape-shifting, and depending on what color of extraterrestrial gumball they're chewing, Martin (and the humans) can turn into a variety of monsters. This film could seriously boost the sales of chewing gum to young children, preferably young boys between the ages of 6-12. But back on subject now...Along with this tale (loosely based on the 1960s television show by the same name) is a sappy love story. Tim is in love with a reporter named Brace (Elizabeth Hurley). The romance is put on hold at separate times during the film, and so we never truly get a handle on the whole bit. Tim is in love with Brace one moment, Lizzie (Daryl Hannah), his technician, the next moment. Call it romance. Call it love. Call it manipulating the audience.The villains are all government scientists, led by Coleye (as in e. coli), a government-something-or-other who is seemingly mystified and obsesses with martians. Coleye is played by Wallace Shawn, whose film credits include The Princess Bride and Toy Story. I've always admired him on-screen because he is a small screen presence, yet at the same time a strong one. He rarely plays a leading man, and in the rare ocassion he does, the film is a flop (see a film of his where his kid rents a new father). Wallace Shawn is one of the most underrated yet distinguished co-stars out there, and he demands just as much credit as the other actors on board, since he does very well with his character, who chases Tim and ''Uncle Martin'' because he wants to prove there is intelligent life on other planets. Uncle Martin, on the other hand, only wants to lay low, be friends with Tim and Lizzie, repair his spaceship and go home. Then he discovers ice cream, and all he wants to do is eat ice cream. (The side effects of ice cream are like alcohol to our bodies; Uncle Martin runs around and wrecks the ice cream shop, completely intoxicated. Must be the sugar-rush in the vanilla and chocolate.) In fact, the scene where Martin wrecks the ice cream shop was shown many times on the TV spots and trailers, and it made the film look more promising than the outcome.There are some good moments in ''My Favorite Martian,'' including the ice cream shop segment. It looks as if everyone who made this film had a lot of fun. Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Daniels are cheery and happy the whole way through, which may be a good enough reason to see this film. But as I watch it, I can't help but compare it to other family films I've seen that are so many times more compelling, interesting and smart than My Favorite Martian.

The Martian, who is in human form plus antennae, can't leave the Earth because his spaceship has broken down.Walston turns up again in this film, again as a Martian but only peripherally this time; a hang around Martian, only serving to bring on vague feelings of nostalgia, yearnings for the simpler days of very expensive black and white, valve driven televisions and gentlemanly behaviour. There's little of the charm of the TV series in this film version.Walston's part is taken by Christopher Lloyd (the madcap scientist in the Back To The Future films) and the Bill Bixby part is played by the nearly always good Jeff Daniels (Dumb And Dumber).Christopher Lloyd's hyperactive portrayal of Uncle Martin is the problem with My Favorite Martian, a performance more reminiscent of a Looney Tunes character rather than the well mannered, concerned spaceman we were treated with years ago. It must  be supposed that every other character in the film measured and toned itself against this  new manic Uncle Martin.If there's any truth in that old adage delivered to children about not pulling faces in case the wind changes then Lloyd is in grave danger. And so must be Jeff Daniels  (I wonder if he drinks Jack?) My Favorite Martian wasn't entertaining, even if you weren't around in the sixties. Subtlety is appreciated even by children.In fact almost no one at all will enjoy My Favorite Martian unless perhaps a minority of minors, but who's going to bother to take them? There are a couple of entertaining moments, one involving a fat arse and a 1962 Plymouth Valiant, the other to do with a particularly loathsome digital monster, but that's all.Then there's Elizabeth Hurley, delivering her usual English version of a big haired American bimbo. Her attempts at acting have of late become even more frantic and embarrassing. Check out this effort along with the ones in Ed TV and Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me to see what I mean.And My Favorite Martian manages even to be more offensive. At one stage Hurley has been tied to a chair in a room. The obnoxious baddie called E. Coleye (get it) played by Wallace Shawn locks himself into the room with her to do what? It wasn't funny. It wasn't mentioned again.Then there's the digital character Zoot, the Martian's space suit who develops a thing about washing machines. He was just plain boring even if he was well wrung.

There were a few good laughs but not enough to justify the money spent.  I am very upset with Disney for including the sexually oriented material in this movie. Disney used to be an icon for wholesome family entertainment.  Thumbs down to Disney!!!  The whole talking suit bit was drawn out and boring and seemed to be included just to fill time.  Christopher Lloyd did a horrible job as a Martian.  On a lighter note, it was good how they worked in the original series.

Christopher Lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role, although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help.   Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this movie, especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with Robin Williams's often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy.

It truly represents the incredible complacency of Disney live-action film-making.  It is billed as a family film, but is really nothing of the sort.  It is chock-full of vulgarities that adults and children alike will surely find distasteful. Vulgarities in a film are acceptable under two circumstances1.) They are in a film from a genre where one might reasonably expect to find them (i.e., a comedy).2.) They are used in the service of a plot, to create comedic situations.There's Something About Mary is an example of a relatively vulgar film whose vulgarities met both of the above requirements, and a result, it was funny, and offensive to only a few overly-sensitive people.However, My Favorite Martian is neither funny nor is it a comedy aimed at an older audience.  All of the jokes fail miserably - neither I nor my nine-year-old son emitted even a chuckle during the showing of this movie. I saw this film on my vacation (in Florida) - and none of my fellow movie-goers laughed, either.On the other hand, I am not so sure I should be surprised.  Disney live-action features are usually of a very poor quality - flat jokes, non-existent plot, overly vulgar for the target audience, and completely pointless.  However, I think this one brings the genre to new depths.  It strives too hard for laughs that it does not get, and the thin plot, which is in danger of disappearing entirely at many points, cannot even support the lame gags that it contrives so desperately.  I came out of the theater fatigued and depressed, having had my senses assaulted and my mind insulted by this terrible film.  My young son had a similar opinion of this filmEveryone involved in the production of this film _should_ be heavily fined by the governing body of American cinema, but sadly that is not a possibility.  Apparently the American First Amendment has its drawbacks as well as its advantages, because the makers of this film will be laughing all the way to the bank, as they say.All members of the cast turned in what are easily the worst performances of their careers.  Apparently they too knew that this movie was a dud, and rushed through their parts as quickly as possible, hoping that the day would come soon when the paycheck would arrive and the world forget that they were even in this movie.  This is quite clear from the way the actors sleepwalked through their performances, even Christopher Llyod, who is repeating his Back To The Future bit for an audience that the director hopes will be too young to remember the original.The question of why Disney made this film is not very puzzling at all. This film is a work, as they say, of obligation rather than inspiration. There are three good reasons to make a film, and one bad oneGood Reasons To Make A Film1.) To make a lasting contribution to cinema. 2.) To present a social commentary and perhaps further a cause. 3.) To make people think and feel. 4.) To make people laugh.5th And Wrong Reason To Make A Film5.) $$$,$$$,$$$My Favorite Martian (every time I retype that title, it depresses me a little more) was clearly made for reason number 5.  Disney decided it needed a little more cash, so it churned out another formula live-action film, hoping that there would be enough decent people out there fooled by the tag family film to take the bait and thus generate some quick and easy money.Lame jokes, vulgarity, bad acting, unfailing adherence to a formula, _cheesy_ special effects, and thin plot - this is the Disney recipe for a live-action movie.  Unless you want to spend 7 bucks or so to be bombasted by the above ingredients for two uncomfortable and neverending hours - DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. "},{"Title":"Cable Ready ...

Well, far from being perfect, My Favorite Martian is a terrifically funny movie for all its worth. Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Daniels bounce off each other hilariously, and Elizabeth Hurley makes a hilarious supporting role as a snobbish reporter whose dad runs the TV studio.You know the gist of the plot - a Martian lands on Earth and winds up in the home of a struggling reporter, who becomes conflicted on whether or not to expose him.That's all there is to it, really. There is a lot of comedy and romance. All these reviews are way, WAY too harsh! I love intelligent movies as much as the next man and I can't stand overly brainless junk, but this movie really is neither; it's wedged far inbetween. My Favorite Martian is an innocent, fun flick with a lot of humour that makes me, a 25-year old man, laugh a lot at. Think of it as Rocketman's less-wacky little brother and you're on the right track.

Bad reviewers, they tend to pick apart movies they personally don't like but it doesn't matter. I have found movies that have been given bad reviews often much to my liking and I have bought collector's editions of them later when they became available.  It was a good movie, in my opinion, so I gave it a 10. If you don't think so, then give it a lower rating.

Basically life for Tim O'Hara (Jeff Daniels) is terrible at the moment, being fired from his job as a news producer by Mr. Channing (Godzilla's Michael Lerner), father of his girlfriend, reporter Brace Channing (Elizabeth Hurley). Then his life changes when he discovers a martian crash landed to Earth, this alien forms into a human and becomes Uncle Martin (Christopher Lloyd), and he stays with him while he fixes his ship. It starts as a complicated situation where Tim has to keep an eye on Martin and his walking talking silver space suit Zoot (Wayne Knight), and he films the alien in his true form while in the jacuzzi. But this relationship slowly turns into a fond friendship as the antics of the alien grow on the Tim, and he cannot bring himself round to revealing this huge story to the world, despite how much it would do for him. Of course, after some crazy antics involving Zoot flirting with women's clothing, Martin stuffing his face with floating ice cream, and his ability to change his appearance into his friend in front of Tim's new girlfriend Lizzie (Daryl Hannah), the truth does nearly come out. Ruthless reporter Brace manages to find the secret filming in Tim's house and takes it to break the story, and this comes at the wrong time, because Martin reveals if he doesn't leave the planet soon his ship will explode. In the end the nasty Coleye (Toy Story's Wallace Shawn) who wants to catch an alien gets his comeuppance, and Martin was planning to go back to Mars, but he can't find it in himself to leave his friend Tim. Also starring Christine Ebersole as Mrs. Brown, Jeremy Hotz as Billy, Ray Walston as Armitan and Ace Ventura Pet Detective's Troy Evans as Captain Dalton. It might have some good names in the cast, and it might have some alright special effects in moments, but neither of these things do the film any favours whatsoever, it is overly childish and a most appallingly predictable story based on a television show, a ridiculous and pointless family science-fiction comedy. Poor! "},{"Title":"Not my favorite Martian but not my worst either ..

While its stay on our planet, it will create friendly ties with humans.But, unlike ET which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is only fun. It is indeed a pure Dysney production its core audience are children & the movie is more more in the visual than in the message.Thus, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the town, a cosmic stray toaster) and the casting is experimented, with special mentions to Doc, who rejuvenates in a Mac Fly character, and to Hurley, who seems open to auto-derision.Ice on the cake the main title is scored by Danny Elfman, and like every other great composer, you recognize his voice before he is even credited.

As I was watching, I drew comparisons to another Christopher Lloyd film called Back To The Future. In both films he played a character that is into fixing things as well as using vehicles as means of transportation between worlds. Also, it seemed that Jeff Daniels' character Tim O'Hara was an older version of Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly as they both played second fiddle to Christopher Lloyd. I found this film to be lacking in some areas such as laughter. Since this film is based on a television show, I'm sure that the director wanted to make the film as if it were an original. I thought that everything in this film was predictable; from its landing and the doctor who is after Uncle Martin to the traditional happy ending.With this being said, it was entertaining and enjoyable for younger audiences, but not for people around my age. I guess since this is meant for children it is not supposed to be such a thinking movie, but come on I would have appreciated it more if it gave the older audience something more to chew on as we sat through the film. This is one remake that could have been better if it were not made.
