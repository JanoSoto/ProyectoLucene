When viewing this, prepare yourself for a stellar performance from Hector Elizondo and even Hogan Familiy's Jason Bateman (fully!).  You can expect to find Sinbad keeping it real and to the max.  If comedy is your vice than prepare to get naughty because Rob Schneider's one-liners from the press box gave my knee a bruise from slapping it so hard.

Easy. Good movies have no expiration date, and this is certainly one of them. At the time, the NCAA was going through all sorts of problems with player bribes, payoffs, faked grades, violations from steroids to hookers to cars for the players. This movie was brave enough to face these problems and gives an accurate picture of trying to build a football team from a bunch of wanna be's and never were's. Scott Bakula is perfect in the role, neither attempting to affect a fake Texas drawl nor over playing the role. Hector Elizondo and Robert Loggia, two veteran actors who could easily dominate the film, instead add their considerable talents to make the film believable. Several great touches are added, including Rob Schneider as the announcer for the games, and the appearance of a prison team arranged by Dean Elias (Larry Miller, the schmuck you love to hate) adds an extreme and interesting comic scene. Dick Butkus, Earl Campbell, Roger Craig, Ben Davidson, Tony Dorsett, Evander Holyfield, Ed Too Tall Jones, Jim Kelly, Jerry Rice, Hershel Walker, and Randy White are the prison football players, and if you have to ask who they are, you need to head over to the NFL Hall of Fame (Except for Evander Holyfield, former Heavyweight Champion of the World). The film is cohesive, the language is minimal, and the violence is limited to the football field, practice, and a slight altercation between two teams at Billy Bob's. Collectible if you are a fan of good sports movies, and definitely a great film for the family on a Saturday night.

I can not believe this film is so old, however. I was thinking this thing was made in 1995 or 96, but it came out in 91 while I was still in high school. The film actually predates Quantum Leap, a television show that features the star in this one Scott Bakula. Speaking of Scott, here is the case of a guy that just seems like he should of been a major star in Hollywood, but it just never materialized for him. He is great in this one as an older man who returns to college because he had to leave college prematurely the previous time. A coach in charge of rebuilding the football program recruits him as the team has few players and no real quarterback. The dean of the school is against the coach the whole way and is sort of the villain of the piece, but here is one of the kinks. I find it refreshing that a dean would want to focus on education rather than the gridiron. As much as I enjoy football, to often the educational program takes a backseat to a bunch of jocks who should not even be at the college except they are good at sports. Meanwhile, those who go to the school trying to pay their way and in the need of loans have to keep having their tuition raised to pay for things such as stadiums. Enough of my rant, the film is rather good, but is unbelievable. Suffice to say, there is no way a team that has so few players that some have to play offense and defense is going to compete against the number one team in the country. So just think of it as a Hollywood sports comedy, totally unrealistic, but worth a few laughs, unless of course it is Sinbad making the jokes.

However, his father died after football season was over and Paul felt obligated to take over the family farm. Therefore, he turned down scholarships and never went to college. But, now Texas State wants him, wants him badly. The university has had a long history of NCAA violations and, consequently, is having trouble recruiting players. But, with a new, straight-arrow coach (Hector Elizondo), his assistant (Robert Loggia), and a dedicated college president, Texas State is trying to turn the tide. Paul, although he is now 34, agrees to join the team and the freshman class. Wouldn't you know it, though, he soon has a run-in with an attractive female professor (Harley Jane Kozak), who refuses to accept his growing interest in her. And, with a ragtag roster of only 17 players, playing both offense and defense, can they win any games? This is a fine football flick with some elements of romance thrown in, too, to please any viewer. The cast is very nice, with Bakula, Elizondo, Loggia, Sinbad, a tiny-bit- pretentious Kozak, a lovely Kathy Ireland, a very funny Rob Schneider, and a hilarious Larry Miller whooping it up all the way. The football scenes are quite fine as well, which should please any true gridiron fan. Yes, unfortunately, the film looks dated, with its out of fashion costumes and its mediocre camera work. The Texas setting, however, is rather welcome. All in all, if you love the game-with-a-pigskin, you must arrange to view this one. You will find it greatly entertaining.

But I need to add an oddity.The movie team, the Texas State University Fighting Armadillos, battles to a pounding against the Southwest Texas State Bobcats in one game. The point I want to make is that the REAL Southwest Texas State in San Marcos, TX changed its name in real life to Texas State University--San Marcos (the --San Marcos designation has also recently been dropped). So, in the movie, the problematic TSU university team in green and white plays its own real-life future alter ego, the real maroon-and-gold SWT Bobcats, complete with cheerleaders. The Armadillo mascot for Texas State in the movie is fictitious, but the Bobcats are real. Since the movie was made in 1991 and the name change took place in 2003, the two movie opponent school names -- before anyone knew about the future name change -- eventually became the same university in reality.Footnote I graduated from Southwest Texas State in 1978 in journalism, with a minor in art. When the name change happened, the Alumni Association wrote and asked if I wanted a new diploma with the new college name, which I did opt for. So they sent me a new diploma with the new school name. I now have two diplomas from the same university (different names) with the same degree and minor. According to WOAI-AM radio station in San Antonio, the total cost of the name change and resulting associated do-overs (stationary letterheads, repainting, etc) was $350,000, paid for by private donations.

SPOILER ALERT!!! In 1990, The Texas State Fightin' Armadillos won the Division 1-A National Championship at the Cotton Bowl, and six months later, Texas State were penalized with the Death Penalty by the NCAA for violating their policies, which included illegal drug use, illegal payments to the players from boosters, grade tampering,and various recruting violations. Head Coach Ed Straight Arrow Gennaro (Hector Elizondo) is rehired by Texas State University President Carver Purcell (United States Senator Fred Thompson).  The old players were expelled, and the old coaches were fired.  As a part of the Death Penalty probation, Texas State loses all of their scholarships, blacked out on Television, and are banned from Bowl Games. Gennaro hires an assistant coach by the name of Wally Rig Riggendorf (Robert Loggia) and they conduct a open tryout to assemble a new team from the actual student body. Coach Rig drove 200 miles from campus to recruit Paul Blake(Scott Bakula), a 34-year old Quarterback who did not play in college. Before the first game, the team was cut down to only 17 players after the dean found out that some players did not make the grade. To field a full squad, Coach Gennaro brought back Iron Man football, where players play on both Offense and Defense.  After being blown out by Southwest Texas in the first game 65-0, the Armadillos lost eight games in a row, all blow outs. In the ninth game of the season against the Kansas Jayhawks, Kicker Lucy Draper (Kathy Ireland), kicked a game-tying field goal at the end to tie Kansas three points apiece.  Two weeks before the final game, the Armadillos get into a bar room brawl with the Texas Colts, led by their captain Harlan Flat Top Myers. As for the game, The Armadillos trailed 21 to 0 at halftime when Coach Rig gave a profanity-laced pep talk to the players and it worked. Before the end of third quarter,Dean Elias (Larry Miller) was fired when he tried to get the test scores from the players thrown out.  By the fourth quarter, Texas State was down by 7 and made a big play on defense to get the ball back. The Armadillos move down field and scored a touchdown with no time remaining to cut the Colt lead to one. After scoring they decided to go for two on a fake field goal. Blake passes to Charlie Banks, a player who was a walk on the previous year , but did not play, who caught the game-winning 2-point conversion to win by one point 22-21. The Texas State Fightin' Armadillos finished the season with one win, eight losses, and one tie.

No?! well it sure as hell seems like it as the ever cuddly Scott Bakula portrays the same character he's always ever portrayed with the exact same haircut too...geez dude!. So lets not beat around the bush here, this is the late in the day 'Major League' clone that shamelessly rips every clich√©d idea from that film whilst attempting to look all innocent by turning it into a college football flick.The plot is different of course, but end of the day it still involves a coach and his assistant trying to muster together a half decent team which ultimately ends up being a bunch of misfits, freaks, girls and Scott Bakula. From there on we get all the regular sports clich√©s and predictable fluff such as the team losing all the time, losing faith in their coach, a soppy romance, a rival team of assholes, the resurgence of the team and one man behind the scenes taking joy in the teams failure and trying to amplify it.I think the problem with this film other than the fact its a lame clone, is they simply haven't created any fun characters to follow or care about. As I've already said Bakula plays the same character he always does, then you have a bloke who thinks he's a samurai warrior, the nerdy guy with specs, a huge Samoan guy, an Aussie?! (why would an Aussie be there?), a black guy who can't catch, a ex-military obsessed bloke, a female kicker and finally the hilarious comedian Sinbad...add sarcastic quips here. There are of course other faceless jock meathead players also.Hell to even make sure they copied every single aspect of 'Major League' they even have a light-hearted announcer for the games...and its Rob Schneider! oh the quality. I really shouldn't keep going on about the similarities but its impossible not too! just look at the films poster, its identical in every way! unbelievable!.The only big change in this film is the team doesn't actually win any league or championship in the end, they lose a load, tie a game and their final game of the season they manage to beat the top team but that's it. They presumably still end up near the bottom of their group or league, so we don't get the obligatory montage of wins when they turn their game around. What we do get is a sickly bit of crap when their coach goes into hospital of a suspected heart attack just in time for the final big game against the top team. We then get a vomit inducing scene where second in command Loggia tells the team to go and win it for the coach, possibly his last wish on Earth. Personally I thought this was all a set up to get the team to play well, or at least Loggia's character was exaggerating the illness and the coaches last words on purpose. Nope it was all for real, the illness isn't as bad as suspected, but the shitty clich√©d corny attempt at a rousing emotional scene was indeed for real.This really is a prime example of an early 90's straight to the videoshop piece of turd trying to leech off the success of another earlier franchise. There are literately no redeeming features anywhere I can think of, its not funny, its not cheeky or rude as suggested by the poster, you have no interest in any characters, even the game sequences aren't very good or exciting...its just poorly made trash that didn't need to be made.2/10 "},{"Title":"The Major League of Football movies.","Date":"26 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sport","Review":" This is a very good flick, and Scott Bakula has always been one of my favorite actors.I first saw this film on TV as a child and recently picked up the DVD in a bargain bin and just re-watched it.

For anyone who stops to analyze what is on the screen, though &#150; especially any type of sports fan whatsoever, the credibility lasts about two minutes.SPOILERS AHEAD!Of course, the premise is that fictitious Texas State University, the defending NCAA D-I national champion, has been hit with a titanic NCAA penalty for numerous infractions and has lost all football scholarships, coaches, returning players, etc. Former coach Ed `Straight Arrow' Gennero (Hector Elizondo) is lured back to coaching to try to put the pieces back together &#150; without cheating, as his predecessors had done.

The only teensie little problem is that NCAA D-I athletes have (I believe) FIVE YEARS in which to play their four years. There ARE NO 34-year-old NCAA D-I athletes &#150; unless I am totally confused. Later, chemistry professor Andre Krimm (Sinbad), a one-time high school star and opponent of Blake's, also agrees to don the pads again and use that long-refrigerated `eligibility' of his.The lack of credibility continues. Thanks to the dean's strong efforts to destroy the program (ludicrous to say the least, considering that the national championship the season before had undoubtedly put millions of dollars &#150; or hundreds of thousands, at least &#150;  in the school's coffers), the squad drops to a mere 17 players before the season opener. Yet somehow those 17 &#150; including the two 30-plus dudes and several other real losers-manage to survive 10 weeks of top quality D-I football without injuries?  AND, after losing 63-0 in the opener, manage to play (I'm going from memory, here.) top teams to scores of 42-6 and 32-12, I believe. Folks, no D-I football team today takes it easy on ANY creampuff! Everyone rolls up scores and pads statistics every chance they get. This bunch would have been losing by 120 points or more EVERYtime out!Which brings me to my major point. This film would have had a LITTLE credibility, a little believability, had it been set in the NAIA, or perhaps a junior college or NCAA, D-III. MAYBE in the NAIA, 17 players off the street, with a 34-year-old quarterback could go 1-8-1 and pull one huge upset at the end. Maybe. And maybe a member of the women's soccer team (Kathy Ireland) could walk in, win the kicking job and boot a game-tying field goal in a monsoon. However, Hollywood apparently doesn't believe (and maybe with reason) that viewers would connect with a small college. For the movie-going audience to understand that this is college football, they believe, it has to be not only a D-I team, but the defending national champion, for viewers to follow. As it is, they make it very difficult for one who IS a sports fan to get through the impossible scenarios and enjoy what is basically a decent movie.Elizando, Loggia, Bakula, and Harley Jane Kozak (playing Professor Suzanne Carter, Blake's romantic interest), none of whom I had even HEARD of, all turn in strong performances, as do many of the dysfunctional football players. Overall, it is an endearing movie, despite the implausible happenings and so-so action sequences. One of the highlights of the film is the hilarious Texas State play-by-play man (who I cannot find in the cast credits). In one sequence, when the other team charges in, blocking an Armadillo punt as soon as it leaves the punter's foot and swatting it several yards behind him, he proclaims smoothly `THAT one didn't have much hang time on it. I think they MAY have gotten a piece of that one!'Once again, for those too tired to analyze or those who don't really follow college sports, you may be charmed by this film. But the sports geek who knows that Walter Payton is the all-time NAIA football scoring leader, NOT the NCAA scoring leader, will need group therapy by the fourth quarter.

Team gets on probation - coach finds 34-year-old quarterback to bring them back - team is a bunch of losers - they win the big game. You know, the usual stuff these sports films are made of, but unlike Hoosiers, there is not much going on outside the lockeroom or off the field.I only watched it because one of the minor stars is coming to town to give a speech and I wanted to see his part. It was about 10 seconds long.Kathy Ireland was there with a small part and Fred Dalton Thompson was there too, again with a small part. The rest of the cast is forgettable. Well, I hate to admit it, but Rob Schneider was a little funny.

Like Redford, Bakula was pushed out of sports 16 years ago and returns to be a star in his later years when everyone thinks he is past his prime. Yes, 16 years in both films. I could say it was like The Replacements but that seems almost too easy.A lot of things about the film are really stupid. Using Kathy Ireland as a kicker was just an excuse to put a hot girl in a locker room. Having a teacher coincidentally be a woman with a crush on Bakula from his high school years is a stretch. And in general, the movie served no point... the team has no chance of winning, so the best they can hope for is to not be skunked.Bakula is a great actor, but very dated in this film with his goofy jean jacket. Sinbad was Sinbad, and not the one from Houseguest but the unfunny one from the 1980s. Kathy Ireland was a better actress than I expected. The best actor? Strangely, Rob Schneider, who is probably known best for his dumb characters from Saturday Night Live and subsequent bad movies. In this, a young Schneider plays an announcer who is lovable and funny... comparable to Bob Uecker from Major League.This film was okay, but I have no interest in seeing it again and if you choose to watch it, you don't have my blessing.

A lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. Other than that it's a very mediocre movie. They should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism. Instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. When will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic?Not recommended, unless it's for free on t.v.

This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie isn't even a half a star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller?? Sinbad, couldn't act if he tried. Rob Schneider's one liners completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and of film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.

It stars Scott Bakula, Sinbad, Jason Bateman, Rob Schneider, and the director of Mr. Mom.  What's not to like?Okay, ideally all those factors should cancel each other out, but... no.  This is a moderately entertaining movie at best; not worth a rental, but in the top-tier of movies they show ad-nauseum on basic cable.  Comedy Central should add this one to their rotation.  I'm not kidding.It's a footnote on the resume of every actor involved, with the exception of the Unversity of North Texas campus, in scenic Denton, 30 miles north of Dallas/Ft. Worth.  Much of the campus has changed since 1991 (including the football stadium), and the telescope Sinbad teaches with has been moved, with bemusement, to the UNT Observatory, 20 minutes north of campus.Sometime later in the 21st Century, when North Texas gains a little more notoriety, people will point and remember famous alums such as Peter Weller, Roy Orbison, Mean Joe Greene and Stone Cold Steve Austin... and they'll remember this movie.  Six points for the Location Scout.Three points for the guys who wrote the script (a few good lines, and Kathy Ireland in tights), and no points for the director.
