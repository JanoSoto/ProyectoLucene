[{"Title":"Dr. P.U.","Date":"14 March 2002","Score":"45 out of 64 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This is only the second time I've been irritated enough to write a review, the other was Trixie.First of all, I'm a fan of The Player and of Short Cuts, among other Altman movies.  So when I was at first annoyed and angered by the beginning of this movie, I passed it off to his soon-to-come deeper agenda, which in Dr. T... never arrives.I loathe this movie.  Let me count the ways1. (Most importantly) We are led to empathize with a man who believes he loves too much, too hard, and hence, the consequences.  This, if played out, would be great, as he gets his come-uppance, realizes the self-delusion and that his life and ways with women is a lie.  But that's not what happens. We are supposed to feel sorry for and sympathize with him the entire way, even as he cheats, avoids true responsibility and, despite what the ending is supposed to say, never changes.  Rather than the boy-birth being a sign of evolution/change/enlightenment, it debunks all that came before, in fact saying that all these women were the problem all along.  Instead of being a witty examination of flawed Dallas women, it concludes with a tacked-on non-epiphany, which by its very existence makes everything before it misogynistic, and none of the characters likeable.2.  Watch how many times Altman works in gratuitous nudity, like an 11 yr. old peeping tom.  When he shows Janine Turner's derriere-crack, at the end of her scene, it's not Richard Gere following it with his eyes,  it's the CAMERA, as if to say, hey, look at this -- like a little elbow in our sides.3.  He does the same thing often at the end of scenes, swinging the camera with a wink to pick up a sign, a heavy-handed metaphor or scene-link that is beginning film school pretentious artifice at its worst.4.  The editing and cinematography again is of the film-school variety, and at often times is like a rough cut.5.  Helen Hunt, who for years has been trying to convince us she's newly sexy, is so self-conscious that we never can buy into any kind of character.  I am sick of her flinging her hair.6.  The camera holds so long on the golf sequences, as if to say - these actors really can play golf, which they really don't very well.  But it becomes a call-attention lingering as opposed to a mere setting for dialogue.7.  The overly intrusive soundtrack by Lyle Lovett may be close to the worst in history.  Not only does it blot out large sequences of dialogue, and call attention to itself mindlessly at every turn, it actually has lyrics which say exactly what's going on in the scene.8.  The writing and dialogue are extremely sophomoric; very few times do the people seem real in what they're saying, and often they resort to movie cliche-speak.9.  Gere has a few good real moments, but the direction hurts him as well.10.  Altman's trademark everyone speaking at once, in this movie is contrived and annoying.11. (And maybe worst of all) this movie made me replay all the movies of Altman that I really like and see that many of tendencies above that I criticize are prevalent in ALL of his movies, now tempering my enjoyment of them.  I now see a old lecher with a misogynistic bent and an arrested development, calling attention to his weaknesses in a pretentious and juvenile way.

It might just be my defense of Robert Altman, but I think that this is a good comedy. Dr. T who devotes his life to taking care of women, but never considers how they could take care of themselves. He loves everything about women, and women love him. However, nothing he can do can protect them in the end.The problem is that this film was presented as a movie for women a date movie that you can drag a boyfriend or husband to in order to prove love and devotion. The film is actually examining women, their needs and relationships with or without a strong male figure. This isn't a chick flick; it's an analytic comedy. So, the intended movie date turns out to be a disappointment for both parties who have no idea what to expect.The only positive aspect of this whole misunderstanding is that now, years later, Dr. T ends up on the cheap rack at any DVD store. So don't rent it, buy it, give it another look and even if you don't like it, sell it for even cheaper. When this movie is available for less than a dollar, no one will have any excuse not to watch it. Several of the people will end up actually liking it.

It shows in his movies; women are often the main characters, and his films offer up a variety of interesting roles for actresses. Dr. T and the Women is almost entirely about women, modern day wealthy Texas women. Richard Gere plays Dr. Sully Travis a very successful and popular Dallas gynecologist. Not only is he surrounded by women all day at work, but his family consists entirely of women. Only a couple of male buddies enter into his closed, female dominated life. And like all good Altman movies there are plenty of quirky characters and intersecting plotlines.The problem is that the plotlines aren't that interesting or original. Dr. T's wife develops a rare mental disorder that affects only the wealthy, and must be institutionalized. The new female golf pro comes on to Dr. T, as does his nurse. His soon-to-be-married daughter is slowly realizing that she may be a lesbian. And so on.For Altman fans, Dr. T and the Women is not a bad rental. The director has done better, but it's still Altman. Others, less interested, might want to give this a pass.

Richard Gere comes off a serious person and his acting is perfect, which I wasn't expecting at all.  The film was very well made and ended on a note I thought was much more sincere than anything I've seen in movies recently.  The dialogue and plot took me two sittings to absorb.Having said that, I gotta admit, people will hate this film.  Like most Altman pieces, the plot is not driven by outside events so much as it's driven by how characters feel and act towards each other.  Dr. T is a rather extreme example of this, where almost nothing happens but the spectacular collapse of a wedding, a failed relationship, and a short-story magic ending.  The arc of the plot is the growth of the Richard Gere character from a needy person who has been unconsciously trying to make himself the center of a kingdom of dependent women into a person who finds new meaning in his work with people.  Dr. T begins the movie as a man who is perfectly happy.  He's an overwhelming professional success with an attractive family and nothing but more of expensive happiness to look forward to.  But he's immersed in demanding women.  He has spent his whole life trying to put women on pedestals so that he can bask in their praise and affection.  This isn't exactly evil, but the movie shows how his life begins to unravel as a result of this basically sexist outlook he has devoted his life to.  After what must have been decades of relentless smothering, his wife reverts to a childlike state.  (An expensive psychiatrist assures him that it's from having a life that's `too perfect,' which is probably a way of telling him what's wrong without saying exactly why.)  His heroic efforts as an OB/GYN have led his patients to make unreasonable demands on him that make his job a hell.  He appears to have gotten the needs of his daughters backwards as far as which one requires more attention.  His time-bomb sister-in-law has moved into his home with her gaggle of little girls.  Just as all of this comes apart, he runs into a woman from outside Dr. T's kingdom.  Helen Hunt plays a woman who doesn't need him and won't let herself rely on his courtesies and affections.  He tells her frankly that he's never met any woman like her, which is a sad thing really.  Then it all falls apart and in his lowest moment he's wrenched away from the mess he's made of his life by a tornado out of The Wizard of Oz (people can believe in Yoda, clips of ammo that never empty, accept a deluge of frogs from the sky, and that a man can be just a little jarred after shooting himself in the head to kill Tyler Durden, but a magic tornado is too much&#133;)  Dr. T finds himself without his expensive status symbols or his dependent entourage of hypochondriacs, in a place without even a phone.  He does his job and he doesn't even get a girl.  It's a boy and it's all new to him and that fills him with joy.There are other Altman traits will drive people up the wall - the plot that feels like sprawl the first time through, the lack of signposts to obviously sympathetic characters, insistence on sorting moral ambiguities, doing satire in a PC world where even the shopping classes can't be made fun of, the layers of dialogue and so on.  What I try to tell people that are new to Altman is that he pretty much invented the TV drama forms we respect.  E.R. and Hill Street Blues and any number of TV dramas thrive off Altman's formula - which is to pick an interesting locale, drop a ton of characters in, and set them in motion.  Events happen, but the real drama is watching the characters interact every week.  The Hollywood film industry has moved in the opposite direction, which is soap opera.  There you take a big cast of canned personalities, drop them in an upper income setting and write some love story or coming-of-age bit around the quest/monsters/gun fights that actually make them move from scene to scene.  Neither is inherently better, but the multiplex has gravitated towards the second so completely that most people are utterly confused when seeing the first.Unless you're interested in seeing a movie about a man who is forced to change the values he built his life on with the best intentions, you'll hate it.  If you dig seeing that dramatized, Dr. T is fairly unique.Also, I wish Altman had some pull with whoever is doing the advertising for his films.  Marketing Dr. T as a screwball comedy and Gosford Park as a whodunit has probably done more damage to his reputation than anything else.  Illiterate marketing is almost as big a problem as trailers that give the best parts of movies away - I wish the studios would be a little more thoughtful about it.

I will tell you what is up! Set your appointment book and schedule a visit to see `Dr. T & The Women'- the latest film by Director Robert Altman. Richard Gere stars as a gynecologist who must deal with the neurotic women in his life a mentally-impaired childlike wife, a witty golf pro mistress, a champagne sipping sister, a lesbian daughter, a kennedy-assassination obsessed control freak daughter, and of course his hypochondriac-impatient patients. The film is full of `altmanrisms'- an overlapping dialogue, a catastrophic occurrence in a public event, and of course satirical viewpoints of a certain profession. Gere saves his career again with a remarkable performance. However, it was Laura Dern's work as the champagne sipping sister that still hungover in my mind after I watched the movie. It was a very critical condition that academy award voters overlooked her brilliant acting. Altman again is able to get some well-known actors to appear in his movies- Farrah Fawcett, Helen Hunt, Tara Reid, Liv Tyler, Kate Hudson,  and Shelley Long are the other female players involved in this one.  The one headache I had with `Dr T. & The Women' was the somber characterizations of Dr. T's male buddies. These characters should have been rescheduled to another movie. All in all, Director Robert Altman (in my viewpoint one of the smartest directors of all time) was able to complete a successful cinematic operation on `Dr T. &  The Women.' So take two hours, go see this movie, and call me in the morning. **** Good  "},{"Title":"Scrambled Ovaries","Date":"14 October 2000","Score":"28 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Robert Altman is frustratingly inconsistent, and here is at his worst. His very personal style has three characteristics1. Many-threaded storylines and characters, many of which raise questions that are not answered in the play. When done well, you get the impression of moving through the world with a curious voyeurism, dipping into many lives which are intriguing enough to learn more about. Except for the youngest daughter, none of these women are worth digging more into. The misogynism could have been an advantage; here it is cheap.2. Spontaneous acting. Altman doesn't tell his actors what to do, trusting them to bring something fresh. In the best case, the differing visions of the actors add to the manyhued effect described above. But you need powerful actors like he had in Cookie's Fortune. These folks, some of whom are fine when given direction, simply can't synthesize.3. Wonderful tracking shots (which move from character to character so enhance the two effects noted above). Check out the first shot in The Player. That alone is worth the admission. Here, we have a busily choreographed shot at the beginning and a dizzy pullback at the end, but neither to any useful effect.Avoid this film. The master was asleep.

Everything is still so linear. &#x96; Robert Altman Altman's technique is so alien, that most viewers automatically dismiss his films as being shoddily put together, which is a shame, because he really is one of the most consistently interesting directors out there.Typically, Altman begins by constructing an environment (military hospital, theatre, rodeo, diner etc), introducing a large cast, inserting some self referential performance within a performance (play, wedding, radio show, etc) and then adopting a style in which the whole cinematic world flows independently of what we see. In other words, his plots seem to unfold even when we don't watch, his camera floating from one nodule to the next, stumbling upon bits and pieces of a story. But the story is itself non-defined, and it's up to us to synthesise the pieces and make it all coherent.The environment in this case is Dallas, Texas, a world which Altman viciously reduces to a set of stereotypes (Altman is always at his most mean-spirited in his supposedly lighter, more comedic movies). This is a cartoon world of gas guzzling, upper class Texans, giant SUVs, vapid students, expensive clothing, Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, JFK conspiracy theorists and so forth. Even the film's lead character is cast solely as to allow Altman to exploit Richard Gere's iconography (Gere has made a career out of playing suave womanizers).The film begins with a horde of women bickering in a gynaecologist's reception room. Their voices overlap and overlap until we're left with nothing but annoying static. It's up to Dr. T, a smooth, suave and sexy gynaecologist (played by Richard Gere, of course), to untangle all this noise and please his woman, satisfying their needs and fulfilling their various emotional problems.The very next scene works as a counterpoint. Dr T's mentally unstable wife walks through a shopping mall, takes off all her clothes and dances in a fountain. No surprise that she's under a shop sign which links her to a deity. She's not only a goddess, an innocent nymph who exists only to be naked, worshipped, twirl and look pretty, but another up-market commodity. As one psychologist says in the film, she's been loved and pampered too much, Dr T putting his wife on such a high a pedestal that she eventually regresses to a childlike state, unable to do anything for herself.What follows are a number of symbolic little scenes. The men in the film are dumb carnalists who hunt and shoot flying golf balls, whilst the women are all ditsy airheads, drunks, lesbians or vacuous shopaholics. The women of Dallas are also fighting for a Dallas freeway to be named after a woman, an act which Dr T himself supports; anything to keep the ladies happy.Existing outside all these characters is a woman played by Helen Hunt. She's a retired golf pro, far more calm and collected than all the idiotic characters swirling around her. As a professional golfer, she's literally in command of all the balls in the film. She and Gere forge a romance, but she abruptly calls it off when he offers to provide and take care of all her needs. Why would I want that? she says with a shrug. Helen Hunt - the only female huntsman in the film - knows that men hide their dependency needs and narcissistic vulnerability behind a fairly primitive phallic chauvinism. She's also aware that men symbolically control their women through phallic mastery, supremacy and dependence.The film then becomes a sort of feminist tract, Hunt's character raising the issue of female empowerment and opining that women should follow their hearts, reject society's expectations, be independent, be strong and be as sexually promiscuous as men. Another character in the film, played by Kate Hudson, exhibits this same character arc she turns her back on marriage and various authority figures (breaks the rules, answers phone in class etc) and embraces a lesbian love affair.But while the film advocates a form of women's liberation and suggests that women strongly dependent on men accomplish nothing (naming a freeway after a woman isn't a point for feminism, it's just a way to further placate loudmouths), such things are hardly new. It's been over half a century since the largest feminist movements, and if Altman genuinely wished to say something about womanhood, he'd have done so decades ago.No, what the film's really doing is presenting Dallas as the last bastion against the feminist revolution, and Gere, who thinks he's some smooth lover of women, as an unwitting ally of the anti-feminists. Worship at the alter of the uterus, in other words, and you reduce woman to the various stereotypes in the film. You remove their complexity, their desires. The alcoholism and vacuity of the women in the film is the direct result of men fawning over them.But the film goes further than this; so much so that you might even call it anti-feminist. Remove the chivalrous romantics like Gere, Altman says, and you're left with a world of Helen Hunts, family units destroyed, everyone sexually liberated, self-centric and cold. After realising this, Gere drives off into the rain, is sucked into a magical tornado (yes this really happens) and delivers a young Mexican woman's baby. In graphic detail, we see a child emerging from a bloody womb, a scene which immediately and violently clashes with everything we've seen before. Romance is gone, in other words, and replaced with cold biology.And yet Gere finds some nobility in his newfound role. Holding a blood smeared baby in his hands he allows himself a smile. He still worships at the altar, but that altar is no longer pretty. 8/10 &#x96; Excellent. Incidentally, Doctor T's name, Sullivan Travis, alludes to Preston Sturges Sullivan's Travels, both films about a character learning their true value and contribution to society.

I'm no high-art film critic, but I had the advance warning, of sorts, of having watched the previews on the VHS edition of this movie (of all things), which let me know not to expect anything ordinary from it.  Plus it's Robert Altman, right?  So I went into it expecting not to take things at face value -- and that's what you have to do to enjoy this movie.  The idea is that you have this man who treats women with love, respect, and chivalry.  He is surrounded by demanding women all day long, and yet the focus on the individual patients whose encounters with him we witness shows the truth of something he says to his friends every woman is unique.  And then we see the different ways in which the women respond  His office manager falls in love with him.  His patients demand more and more (and are very well-directed).  His wife goes insane because she's loved too much (a diagnosis as obviously unrealistic as hers HAS to have been written into the story for a reason).  His daughters rely on him, shock him, disappoint him.  His sister-in-law takes advantage of his hospitality while drinking herself into a stupor.  His girlfriend (who is kind of a man's woman) rejects his chivalrous overtures (I'll do it! I'll get it!), is the only self-sufficient woman in the film, and ultimately rejects his offer for an interdependent relationship.  All these combine to create a world whose stresses pile up until a surreal conclusion whisks Dr. T away to a completely different world... where straight away he's put back to work, and he delivers a boy.  And who can blame him for being relieved.Overall this is a movie I'm glad I saw once; it was an interesting experience.  Kudos to Richard Gere for probably the best acting I've ever seen him do.

(Major spoilers to follow)In Short Cuts, Altman brilliantly explored the multifaceted ways in which men's hostility, aggression and violence towards women effected women. This film is the flipside. Dr. T. takes care of all his wife's needs, both physical and emotional, to such an extent that she has an emotional breakdown, receding into a childlike state. Beyond this is the love, compassion and support he has for all the women in his life daughters, sister-in-law, nieces, staff, patients. At the same time, he falls for Helen Hunt's character, the new golf pro at his club - up until now the only place where he is with men. She is the exact opposite of all other women in his life strong, independent and self-sufficient. When, in climactic scene, he builds up a huge romantic speech where he promises to take care of her, she makes it clear she has no desire or need to be taken care of. Here lies the central irony of the film, and it is one of the most profound statements I've ever seen on film regarding the illusions of men about women and how it effects women.

It is probably unhelpful to approach it as though it was a full-blooded satire on wealthy Texas women. For a start, the target is too easy - like the floating and walking birds Dr T and his buddies seem to think it's fair to shoot at - and in any case the focus of the film is not the Women of the title, but Dr T.Richard Gere gives a typically charming and understated, performance as Dr T (for Travis), who is surrounded by women whom he likes and respects in private life, and cares for in his professional life as a gynecologist, but no more understands than most men. Farrah Fawcett gives a touching portrayal as his wife, who retreats into childhood to escape his smothering affection. Helen Hunt, as an independently-minded, intelligent golf pro, provides a refreshing change - both for Dr T and the audience - from the empty-headed shopaholics who people much of the movie. Laura Dern, Kate Hudson and Shelley Long sparkle as, respectively, Dr T's sister-in-law, daughter and receptionist. (As we might expect from Altman, the city of Dallas also plays a leading role; and the best casting is definitely that of Eric Ryan as the birth baby; Eric enters the IMDb actors data base at the tender age of zero!)This is a long way from the vintage Altman of Mash, Nashville and The Player; but is still richer than most Hollywood fare.

You won't have seen another movie like it. I can't stop thinking about it. If Truffaut were alive, he'd remind us that if the ending seems inconsistent to us, it might mean there's an underlying rhythm in the movie we've missed, or perhaps we're not thinking outside the square.(spoilers ahead - if you haven't seen film, don't read)It seems that we are lead to believe in the inherent good of Dr T, and that he's wasting his efforts bestowing it on a bunch of loony ungrateful women. If this were just a narrative movie without anything to say at all, i think Dr T would have just had a happy ending with Helen Hunt's character. I was quite shocked when he didn't. This further twist seems to reinforce a message that no woman can be trusted by a good man. And the minute a man gets close to understanding and appreciating women (if anyone had the opportunity to do this, it was Dr T), he is either repulsed or rejected by them. The Freudian-sounding complex that Dr T's wife contracts came about (in the world of the film, which is a bit like Fellini's City of Women) because she was too appreciated, too understood, too loved by Dr T! The minute he finds a woman who appeals to him for her seeming lack of femanine qualities (Helen Hunt exists in a man's world. She is selfless around men, she walks naked in front of Dr T, and it is she who initiates the sexual encounter) - she disappoints him.The movie often makes light of women's troubles everything from accusing women of seeing a gynacologist for sexual gratification, to lousy, jealous bickering.I was amazed that the original script was written by a woman. But then again, with Robert Altman films this usually doesn't dictate the final product, which is born of improvisation and collaboration with actors on set. The final product they have produced in this case is quite a cynical, dark, misogynistic film. The furthest thing from a comedy. And this is mainly given by the ending. The ending feels like the place where Altman really took over and thought of a way to wrap things up. It seems as if improvisation and collaboration produced the movie up until the wedding scene - and only at the end did they decide how it would end. Only once they'd grown so irritated by all the female characters they'd created!Yet witnessing a live birth on screen is absolutely astonishing - and this is optimistic, reminding us of the miracle of birth. But, once again, the final scene in Mexico seems only to serve as a prelude to Dr T's line Its a boy. The entire end sequence is a genocide of women enacted. At the wedding, while the storm is going, Dr T strikes up a big grin suddenly, he seems to see something, have some epiphany. Why is he laughing? Its not anything obvious to us - what should be funny about this chaotic situation? The answer perhaps is given by what happens next, the ending. Dr T has just witnessed his daughter effectively marry another woman (they kiss at the alter and run down the aisle together, acting out a mock-wedding), symbolising women all running off together and keeping themselves entertained. At this point Dr T strikes up his grin, and gets in the wedding car ALONE (representing MAN). Still clinging to some last vestige of marriage, he goes to see Helen Hunt, and the final woman of the film, the blokiest woman, is still, after all, a woman - she lets him down. At this point, Dr T drives off towards a mythical scene, rather more like The Wizard of Oz than anything we've been prepared for in this movie. He is swept up in a hurricane and lands the next morning in Mexico, like the opening of The Tempest, and the closing of Shakespeare in Love. We expect him to say, What land is this? as he is discovered in what appears to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and indeed represents one. What has figuratively happened is Dr T has left all the women he has known behind, to be ravaged by the hurricane, or what you will. The filmmakers have literally wiped out every female character we have come to know, and we are left with Dr T, presumably free of the City of Women. Then he is led by some mexican children, who discover him and his number plate which tells them he's a doctor, to a hut where a woman is in labour. He takes off his wedding ring, delivers the child and declares with a resounding laugh Its a boy! Its a boy! We realise what Dr T was laughing about at the wedding. He's realised that men are better off without women. His friends were right all along.Perhaps not an entirely pleasant or regular ending, but after reading my analysis, i think it makes a whole lot more sense in the world of the movie, where women are, on the whole, a nightmare. Tara Reid's character does not exactly fit into this framework. She seemed like quite a pleasant girl. But is this perhaps why her character seemed not to respect the sombre event of the assassination of JFK? Is this why the tone in her voice and the atmosphere of her grassy-knoll tour invited us to laugh at these events? To get us to dislike her?I say it is an incredible film because i'll probably see it again, and because it was almost entirely refreshing and unexpected. I like Altman's style, which feels like free-jazz - a collection of elements which crescendo in the office scenes to a polyphony not usually seen in movies. This kind of chaos is impossible to script and make look unscripted. These moments are the gold in Altman's canon. Despite all its mysogynistic flavours, its quite an enjoyable movie - and you don't realise how negatively someone (who is the author of this work? when its collaboratively produced the term author is irrelevant - Altman is more like a conductor than an author) regarded these female characters till the ending. As the film progresses the portrait of each of them gets clearer and darker, in a moral sense. At the same time they are all still shallow characatures at the end of the movie. The only character we really get to know is Dr T. Perhaps this is because someone knew from the beginning he would be the only one to survive the hurricane.

I found this film to be an intelligent and winning comedy about a doctor who actually loves and respects his female patients as well as the various females in his life. Richard Gere has rarely been more appealing on screen as the doc of the title and he is surrounded by an impressive group of actresses at the top of their game. Helen Hunt plays the golf pro he falls for. Laura Dern is very funny as his alcoholic sister-in-law. Shelley Long has some funny moments as his office manager who harbors a secret crush on her boss. Kate Hudson and Tara Reid play Doctor T's daughters and in a brief but memorable cameo, Farrah Fawcett as Gere's mentally unstable wife who ends up institutionalized. This film is a little more structured than most of Altmann's previous work and doesn't require the usual work necessary to enjoy an Altmann film and the straight forward scripting is a big help. I know a lot of people found the ending troubling, but to me it was classic Altmann...a little crazy, a little off-center, and leaving questions unanswered...something we Altmann fans have come to expect of him.

There were odd moments here and there in this that struck me as being decidedly Capraesque...Gere is PERFECT as the guy who - without arrogance - is convinced that he can be every woman's knight in shining armour... Trouble is, they don't NEED any 'convincing'! So, what exactly happens when you take a guy like this and show him a woman who is, by the best information available, completely self-sufficient?

Worse than that, this movie is such a insult to women, and all humanity, it left me a lasting psychological wound that still makes me angry today.To be fair, the only culprit is the script. The acting was fine. I can only assume Richard Gere and Helen Hunt did it for the money. The story is utterly pointless and worthless. The movie depicts all women as selfish psychos and, by respecting them, Richard Gere loses everything in life.

Robert Altman was there, as were Richard Gere and Shelley Long, two of the film's stars. The theatre was buzzing with excitement as the movie started (big starry film premiers are still a novelty in a city like Chicago), and by the time it ended, you could almost physically feel the deflation in the auditorium as everyone realized at the same time that the film was a bomb.Because I went into the film so hyped and the movie tanks so badly toward its end, I came out thinking it was probably Altman's worst film. After re-watching it on DVD a few days ago, I realize now that the film isn't nearly as disastrous as I remember it being. The final 15 minutes still stink, but all of the movie leading up to those final moments isn't that bad.Those who call Altman a misogynist are being unfair to him; his body of work contains a large collection of fully realized female characters. If they are frequently treated badly in his films (and many of them are), it's important to remember that it's the male characters treating them that way, not Altman. If anything, a running theme in Altman's work is the crap women have to take from the men in their lives, and several of his films feel like atonements for all the ways boys behave badly.It's unfortunate, then, that the one film that exists almost exclusively as an homage to women and the beautiful chaos they create in the lives of men is full of female caricatures and cartoon types. Not a single female character in this movie feels like a three-dimensional creation, and it's a shame because there is plenty of talent assembled to play them. Gere actually manages to give one of the better performances of his career as the man whose picture-perfect life begins to unravel because of the unpredictable female tidal wave bearing down on him, but the screenplay doesn't bring his story or anything else to any kind of conclusion. How ironic that the film was written by a woman.Altman has always been willing to take risks, and for that I applaud him. But his experiments in this film fail badly. After sticking with a meandering story for nearly two hours, it's as if the film's creators decided they didn't know how the hell they wanted their movie to end, shrug their shoulders and give their audience the finger. The tone abruptly changes into one of slapstick comedy that comes out of nowhere, and a surreal ending that might have worked if anything leading up to it had prepared the audience for it feels stupid.The female cast includes Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett, Shelley Long, Kate Hudson, Tara Reid, Laura Dern, Lee Grant and Janine Turner. Fawcett's barely in the movie; Long and Dern, while providing many of the film's laughs, are asked to do embarrassing things; Turner apparently just turned up on the set one day and Altman set about finding something for her to do. I think we're supposed to see all of these women taken together as representing the different facets of every woman's personality, but none of the women in this movie resembles any woman I actually know.The highlight of the film comes early -- it's a tremendous single tracking shot during the opening credits set in a gynecologist's office. Everything after that is downhill.Still, the nadir of Altman's oeuvre that I measure every other film of his against is Beyond Therapy (1987), and this movie isn't nearly as bad as that. It's not even as bad as Quintet or Popeye, and I have to say that it beats A Wedding in a squeaker.Grade C "},{"Title":"Horrible!!!","Date":"20 April 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Horrible, don't waste your time.

With a cast of Richard Gere, Farrah Fawcett, Helen Hunt, Tara Reid, Liv Tyler, Kate Hudson, and Shelley Long. And Robert Altman directing .With that kind of pedigree you'd think this movie would have been an Oscar consideration, at least a top box office draw.  Yet, it got all it deserved (actually too much). This film is a great example of how a crappy story , bad editing, and poor dialogue can make great actors look foolish. It also goes to show that great actors make bad decisions. This project leads its cast blindly over a cliff like lemmings.  Fortunately most of them are good enough to survive this nightmare freefall.The Plot  What was the hell was the plot?  A gynecologist has a lot of women in his life - ALL THE TIME!  They are odd, cranky, drunk, lesbian, hypochondriac, and crazy. BIG DEAL!  There was nothing in this movie that helped me bond or even identify with Dr. Travis (and I have 3 girls, a wife, my mother-in-law lives with us, and I'm the only man in an office of six other women).  There was no real development of his character (or the story for that matter) because there were so many subplots and situations, unnecessary scenes (like all the useless uninformative waiting room crap) and minor characters to deal with.  No director (not even Altman) could fully develop such a confusing convoluted pail of swill.There was no resolution in this film. Well, that's not fair. the lesbian thing was resolved, but nothing else. We know his wife is still in the hospital - what happened to her? We know that she wanted a divorce - did anything happen with that?  The whole alcoholic sister thing was a waste of celluloid (though Laura Dern was great in the role). She had no significance, no bearing on the characters or the plot. Dr. T's buddies came off as neutered dogs worshipping their master (Dr. Travis).And the ending! What the hell was that?  He drives into a tornado, lands near a Mexican family's shack and delivers a baby boy.

She had really wanted to see this, and I mostly did too. Great cast, marvelous director, etc. What a huge disappointment! It was a silly and sloppy rip-off of the great Robert Altman's movies from the 1970's. Not just a rip-off, which is bad enough, but a poorly done one at that.Where Altman's movies had a raucous, buzzing excitement that inadvertently built the organic edifice of the movies' tones and purposes (the stories)-- this one was merely confused, loud, jabbery, and pointless. Oh wait-- Dr. T & the Women was actually directed by the real Robert Altman? Yikes! What's happened to his eye? His style? His artistic senses? Could the passage of time really be that decrimental? Can genius really become stale and pale as we get older? If that can happen with a great artist such as Altman-- what about mere mortals such as myself!

I have no problem with her portrayal of these high-society women. I am not one myself and so I cannot vouch for or against them. What I can say is that I fully expected this to have been written by a man. I mean come on- a man loves a woman so much that she reverts back to a child-like state- seemingly permanently? Get over yourself.-- A woman that seemingly has everything so she would rather live in an alternate reality as a child--- I understand that a housewife may have feelings she isn't contributing to society after her children are grown, but unless you actually have a history with mental health (and therefore this transformation is caused by other reasons) I don't buy that she would go to this extent to escape this horrible reality of having it all. I believe she might leave... go through a bit of a mid-life crisis, have some issues... lots of possibilities, but the reason she is in the state she is in, is not because her husband loved her too much. And the notion that this could be possible is absurd and extremely stupid. (Hey it's not a word used much by intellectuals, but here it applies.) Again, really? A woman wrote this? The first part establishes the main male as a wonderful, sensitive, caring man and then while his wife is away in an institution he has an affair. Yes, how supportive, nurturing and sensitive this course of action is.And the ending- his life has fallen apart so he drives into a tornado, seemingly wakes up in a Mexican desert and is unscathed, meanwhile, his car (that had no hood for protection) is torn apart. Yes, I am quite certain this tornado took him from Dallas, which unless I'm mistaken is towards the center of Texas to Mexico, again unscathed and in fact he has survived in such good shape that he is able to run to the houses in the desert directly after he awakens from the accident.And the ending- he delivers a a baby boy and laughs out loud. This is no resolution to any of the problems he has gone through- especially considering in this Hispanic home he is again, surrounded by women, only this time, they don't even speak his language. This might have been a resolution to the story if the experiences with the women in his life previously in the move have made him decide to play for the other team. However,this would seem a weird way to suggest this, not to mention,this is extremely unlikely since typically this would not be choice, but nature.The music- I half/muted any scene with the (loud, annoying) music.Perhaps if I had given it a better chance, I might have enjoyed it, however considering I felt the need to lower the volume by half, I'm guessing not.Lastly, I realize we women are all different. We have our sometimes eccentric, sometimes crazy emotional ways. Which, by the way, sometimes make up part of our charm, (I myself, for instance, believe I am a nerd, and a weird one at that) but the only female character that made an impression that did not have some serious issues (of course everyone I know has some serious issue(s), but in Films/TV/Books we need someone to look to as a good example, someone that even with her issues, seems to have it together or is on her way there)is the character played by Helen Hunt and this is cancelled out by the fact that she is not only having two affairs at one time, but one of these is to a married man with an ill wife. And trust me there are a lot of women in this film, it seems someone should have had some moral ground of some kind; perhaps Maria, the maid, but we will never know because her part was so small, however she seems the most likely.I realize, that sometimes we have to make room for no role models in comedies, because these are purely written/made for this purpose, but event though Netflix listed this as a comedy, I think for all of the conflict, it should at the very least be a dramedy, but more appropriately a drama with some comic instances.I would not recommend this movie. I think it is a waste of time. However, a few male Madmen types might find it a good excuse to treat their wives like crap in order to keep their lives from being ruined by the women they love.

After seeing this film, one might conclude that Robert Altman is to film as Jackson Pollack is to art.  The question is whether this is genius or just a compulsive eccentric flinging stuff into the frame.  My vote goes to the latter.The story is a very scattered, almost incoherent stream of foolishness that surrounds the life of Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere).  Dr. T is a prominent gynecologist in Dallas Texas and his socialite patients are among the looniest on the planet.  His wife (Farrah Fawcett) went nuts because he loved her too much and treated her too well.  His daughter (Kate Hudson) is getting married and her lesbian lover (Liv Tyler) is her maid of honor. His long time nurse (Shelley Long) is in love with him and along with his golf pro (Helen Hunt), wants to seduce him.  To top it all off his ditzy sister in law (Laura Dern) is living in his house with her three daughters.The script has comic possibilities, but Altman's bizarre presentation dissipates it into a chaotic din.  Most every scene is dominated by the constant yakity-yak of ten women tittering and chattering at once. Clearly, Altman is attempting to lampoon Texas society with his characterizations, but his free-for-all style turns it into amateurish trash of sitcomesque proportion.This film is extremely unflattering to women.  Almost all the women are portrayed as insane over-emotional, irrational, stupid, or hypochondria ridden flakes.  The only woman close to normal is Bree (Helen Hunt), and she is manipulative and self absorbed.  Dr. T, in contrast is levelheaded, rationale, reasonable, sensitive and wonderful.  His shooting pals are also seen as pretty normal guys, if not particularly bright.A treasure trove of acting talent is squandered in the cacophony.  Richard Gere plays a very lovable character, which is a novelty for him.  He is all sensitivity and vulnerability here without a hint of his normal macho impassiveness.  Helen Hunt gives another fine performance as the self-centered golf pro who seems to be Dr. T's refuge from all the crazy women that surround him, but is really using him for her own hedonistic ends.  Farrah Fawcett also gives a terrific rendition of a woman who has taken leave of her wits.  In truth, the entire all-star ensemble is fantastic.  However, great performances with a bad script and a weird director add up to nothing more than so much debris chucked into the frame.I rated this film a 3/10.  The whole is much less than the sum of the parts. For a film with this many bankable stars to gross only $13.0 million at the box office ($5 million of that in week one) is a clear indication of how poor it is.

His daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) &#x96; a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader &#x96; is getting married, but his younger daughter (Tara Reid) drops the ball that Dee Dee's a lesbian having a relationship with a former co-ed (Liv Tyler). Worse, his wife (Farrah Fawcett) reverts to a child-like state and is, consequently, placed in a mental institution. Desperate for love, the doctor turns to an independent golf pro for succor (Helen Hunt). Meanwhile, his sister-in-law is an alcoholic (Laura Dern) and his office manager is in lust with him (Shelly Long).This movie has a horrible reputation, but it's actually not bad as long as you're in the mood for a drama with amusing touches. It's far from great, but it's certainly not bad. Gere is very likable in the title role and bends over backwards to help all the women in his life. The women are likable too, although many of the peripheral ones are somewhat annoying.I find the criticism that the film is misogynistic funny in light of the fact that the screenplay was written by a woman, Anne Rapp. Others argue that the story's pointless and the ending is ridiculously unbelievable. While the latter point is true, this IS a dramedy/satire and not everything is SUPPOSED to be strictly realistic. As to the former criticism, just enjoy the ride and reflect on the plot and subplots. You may not agree with its points, and they may be elusive, but it's not pointless.While I like the film and it contains scores of beautiful women, I'm only giving it a marginal thumbs up because they could've done better on this front considering the wealth of resources they had to work with, not to mention the opening credits sequence is noticeably overlong and dull.

Though satirical in nature (the young guide who thoughtlessly points out grisly details of the Kennedy Assassination site in Dallas, the patient who absolutely has to smoke while having the most intimate exam, etc.), this is also an affectionate look at women who each has her own fantasy, her own desires, and some lucky few are able to realize them, often without the help of Dr. T. The narrative is indeed scattered, but Altman's strengths have never been homogenized storytelling; this is complex and witty fun for those in the mood. It is not a sweet little romance or does not seem to be a film about female bonding, but is a look askance at human behavior in one of it's many manifestations.

Basically Dr Sullivan Travis, Sully or Dr. T,(Richard Gere) is a handsome successful, well mannered friendly gynecologist surrounded by beautiful women who desire and admire him. He is an idealist who has the most romantic loving, but paternalistic view of women. Even the opening scene was hilarious with his busy office full of patients and staff degenerated from friendly service to bickering chaos during the opening credits.Trouble, is Sully, is going to be shown up with his well meaning idealism. His wife Kate, (Farrah Fawcett) develops this childish regression, the Hestia Complex because she is an over pampered, over loved, over doted over Southern belle. Then his super vixen daughter, who is going to be married in some upper class lush ceremony. turns out to be gay and is really in love with the main bridesmaid, the one non Texan. Since Sully's wife is now committed, and she has rejected or forgotten her whole loving family, Sully tried to find consolation with the new golf pro Bree, but she is too modern to be one of pampered belles that Sully has been conditioned to love and care for.

They are deliberately played as foolish desperate housewives, the hoi paloi of influential Dallas society. In spite of the director's awkward approach, some of the women turn in good performances. In particular, Goldie Hawn and Shelly Long bring dimension to their otherwise thinly written roles.A gynecologist is surrounded by women in every aspect of his life; work, family etc. He has some militia-style hunting buddies he hunts with, but that's it for male bonding. By the way, Elmer Fudd has a better chance of catching Bugs Bunny than these guys have of catching anything.Someone other than Richard Gere should have been cast in this role. He always looks like his mouth doesn't open properly, as if he needs jaw surgery. He has no comedic smarts, either, and ends up looking more psychotic than any of the female stereotypes. The wedding scene's predictable twist doesn't work, but the storm analogy was actually pretty good, and that would have made a fitting close to the story. But no, there is a woeful freak-out ending tacked on that pounds the whole movie into hamburger. What worked for Judy Garland in 1939 does not work for Gere this time around. 'Nuff said.Has moments, and the cast raises it far above the scripting.

Altman was considered a superbly talented and artistic film maker, but you would never know it from watching the dreadful Dr. T.Another reviewer on this site said not to expect Pretty Woman, an immensely popular Garry Marshall flick with Richard Gere. The reviewer is right. While Pretty Woman was a repulsive story of gold-hearted whores, making a gajillion bucks from Gere-loving women looking for sweet, gold-plated romance, DTATW is an unfunny, unromantic, tedious story of pampered UMC types, circling around Gere, a befuddled and oh-so-handsome gynecologist who has a psychotic wife, two bordering-on-bizarre daughters, and a budding relationship with Helen Hunt, the only woman in Dallas who isn't a neurotic and hopelessly dependent hausfrau or wannabe.Other than the feeble attempt at providing some prurient pleasure for the boys with Farrah Fawcett and Helen Hunt naked (at different times) in the background, only a hopeless metrosexual could sit through this. For the ladies, Gere looks godlike, as usual, and Robert Hays has lost his geekiness from the Airplane movies and has settled into a nice, handsome middle age.But a glimpse of skin here and Gere looking exasperated there does not a pleasant time make. There's no point to Dr. T., no center, and unless you enjoy watching Gere fall for and be manipulated by Hunt (not a bad thing if she were on the up-and-up), I can't think of anything less enjoyable than watching Altman's disastrous women's movie. Except for putting your feet in those stirrups (I have been told).

Worth watching on cable television or renting maybe.What I liked best about the film were the subtle jabs (almost tongue in cheek) at the banalities of all these upper-class women depicted.  They are so wrappedup in their boring lives.  Really the subject matter is not that interesting, and it's a testament to Altman that he can weave such an interesting essay out of thematerial.  I love the irony that Dr. T's wife has such a perfect life that it drives her into the loony bin.  This movie is comedy to be sure, but subtle almost darkcomedy, which pokes fun at the lives of these people with a straight face. I've known women like the ones in this film, and just like the women in this film they are boring and mostly unsexy.  The only women that are at all sexy are wifeKate and daughter Connie; the rest, I'd like to just bitch slap.  Most of the acting is well done.

These themes are somewhat shallow, though, and I get the feeling I should have seen something deeper, or been disappointed in Altman for not doing so.

And about Altman, I saw him give an interview a while back, on his film M*A*S*H, and he seemed to think that the most notable thing about it was that it was the first R-rated film containing the word f**k. This is a guy to expect serious social commentary from? Anyway about this movie, Helen Hunt, as usual, disappeared into her character.

This one finds Altman surrounding Richard Gere, as a wealthy Dallas OBGYN, with a variety of mostly blonde airheads who demand so much in their self-centeredness that he finds himself begging for relief. (He gets it in the film's absurd hallucinatory conclusion.) Gere is actually pretty good this time around, relaxed and casual, perhaps because the women in his life (including Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Kate Hudson, Tara Reid and--in the only sympathetic female role--Farrah Fawcett) spend their time onscreen talking over each other (Altman's trademark, albeit this time with bumbling dialogue from Anne Rapp's meaningless screenplay), embarrassing each other and generally just being unpleasant, immature girls. The whole thing revolves around the wedding plans for one of Gere's children and when you finally get there, it's essentially a revisiting of Altman's far superior `A Wedding'--much ho-hum wackiness abounds. Somewhere in the middle, Gere falls in love with golf pro Helen Hunt but, naturally, she turns out to be just as confused and conniving as the rest. Altman is living off the reputation he created from `Nashville', `McCabe & Mrs. Miller' and `California Split' but he's used up his goodwill at this point and he's become nothing more than a nasty old man with nothing better to do than bait actresses in order to `expose' them. (This time it's Hunt he convinces to undress for no good reason; in `Short Cuts' it was Julianne Moore.) It's hard to cotton to this type of fun.

Dr. T, while remaining faithful to his wife and dutifully fulfilling his obligations as doctor, father, and friend, struggles to find the right answer with women.  All of his greatest pains and joys are caused by women, and as the film progresses, Altman raises the tempo and allows several plot lines to coexist and coalesce in a nice symphony of love, confusion, and despair.  Altman, as always, displays a great awareness of the film's geography, giving us a Dallas of golf courses, shopping malls, cheerleaders, and hunting trips.

The character of Dr. T is a great send-up of men who fool themselves into thinking they are truly altruistic, but are merely patriarchs disguised as admirers of women. What the audience is meant to realise is that his seemingly selfless demeanour is just a smokescreen for the real Dr. T a man who only wants to be needed by women. He has lost the true meaning of what helping others means, and is trapped in his self-important world where his expertise is used for upper class, neurotic, highly-strung women. He has hoodwinked himself into believing that he is making a difference in the world, when all he is doing is placating his own ego by falsely complimenting his mostly unworthy patients. The women are exaggerations of a culture of spoilt brats who have nothing else to do with their time but shop and be pampered. They have  returned to a simulated childhood. Dr. T has been polarised in this culture and blinds himself by reveling in the fatherly attention he receives. Are these really *BIG* problems he deals with??? The ending makes perfect sense and is a wonderful re-birth of his new, sincere life. It's a boy! he screams in delight. He understands the meaning of life, his work, and altruistic service. The Mexico we see is a world where people *TRULY* need him, and Dr. T doesn't want to be needed merely to placate his ego.

From a Long fan's point of view, the role of Carolyn is nothing more than a guesting part in an overblown, soporific Altman film.  This isn't a slur on Long, because none of the roles played out by the 'Women' were anything to write home about.  Honestly.  Take it from me, they were all sleep-inducing. As for Carolyn, you'll either see the character as a humorous diversion from the surrounding dross or an over-the-top interpretation of another troubled woman in Dr T's life.  I'll go for the former, even though the abiding memory of Carolyn, apart from THAT scene, was of her popping her head around the door in yet another attempt to organise the doctor's hectic schedule.

I  have noted that most of the negative reviews have come from people who do not know the work of the director, Robert Altman, or from people who know and loathe the work of the same.  I consider Altman a genre unto himself.  In each movie he does, he creates characters which are too broadly drawn to be believed, so if the viewer is into realism  s/he is out of luck.  I submit that many of the negative reviewers would hate any Altman movie they saw based on lack of reality; hence, they might as well disqualify themselves as  objective reviewers.  For them to say this movie is bad, would be equivalent to my saying any given horror flick, no matter how well made, is bad just because I hate horror flicks.  It is unfair criticism.Given the above, I, a lover of Altman, will attempt to compare Dr. T to two of the best of Altman's milieu, Short Cuts, and Nashville.  What I love about Altman's movies is that each character is an archetype, and his movies are a psychological study of what happens when archetypes collide. In Short Cuts, different sets of archetypes collide to create disaster.  I love that movie because the main theme, that disaster occurs when one takes a short cut, is illustrated in several different ways with several different sets of archetypes.  In Nashville, the archetypes are satires of the country-music industry.  I don't believe there is any one main theme in Nashville, which is not as satisfying to me as Short Cuts' focus on one theme, but, in Nashville the characters Altman draws are so quirky and interesting that it comes a close second as my favorite Altman movie.Now, we come to Dr. T.  This movie, unlike most of Altman's movies, focuses on one character, Dr. T.  The psychological study is how the thinly-drawn female archetypes affect the richly-drawn main character.  Dr. T is a guy who loves women, but mistakenly, as the events in the movie point out, puts them on a pedestal.  In the short term, he is very popular with women, but, eventually, his attitude catches up with him.  His wife descends into a childlike state, because, according to a psychiatrist, she has been pampered too much.  His daughters, with whom, he has taken the role of provider and moral compass, in the end, decide that they can make decisions for themselves, and abandon him.  And, his love interest does not want to be 'taken care of', thank you.  Dr. T remains confused about women even after all of this has happened to him.    So much so, that at the end of the movie, when he delivers a baby boy, he rejoices.  Finally, someone arrives who will make sense to him.   I didn't like this movie as much as the rest of Altman's because there is so much focus on Dr. T.  I would have liked to have seen either more detail in the female characters (which would make this movie more like Nashville in the richly drawn characters), or, alternatively, I would like to see other plotlines which are independent of Dr. T, but which are tied together at the end of the movie to illustrate a similar theme (which would make this movie more like Short Cuts).But to say this movie is bad just because the characters are unrealistic, is missing the point.  That's Altman.

I thought the chaos of Dr T's life and the movie was pretty funny also although its tempo was too low at times. The film is also too long and the ending is VERY strange...

Richard Gere is excellent as a Texan gynecologist who is just so suave his clients can't keep away from him. These are the least of his female problems though! His wife (Farrah Fawcett) has had a nervous breakdown and resorted to a childlike state, his sister (Laura Dern, who is by far the best performance in the film) has found the cure for her depression over her divorce is in the bottle, his one daughter (Tara Reid) is obsessed with conspiracy theories and his other daughter (Kate Hudson) is getting married in a week but seems more interested in her maid of honour (Liv Tyler) than her intended husband. Along comes Helen Hunt as a the golf club employee with the least complicated life who automatically appeals to him. Anne Rapp's script seems poised on pointing out the fact that men like Dr. T don't understand the women around them because they regard them so highly as women that they worship and not the people with whom they share a planet (at one point Gere delivers a line that says something along the lines of `All women are sacred in their own special way and should be treated as such&#133;' not realizing that this is patronizing and probably why his wife gone insane and his daughters don't really know him), but she never lets the crux of this boil over well enough. Instead, director Robert Altman gives the film the worst ending in history that completely deviates from the entire tone of the film and serves only to enrage his audience. Shelley Long has a hilarious supporting role as Dr. T's secretary.

Some janitor(s) then pulled it all out of the trash, got a bunch of his/her/their friends together, and tried to scrape a movie together. Either that, or someone in Dallas with a lot of money bribed the studios into letting them make this movie, without hiring a (qualified) producer.The movie has a very basic (and somewhat overly done) plot - a handsome, successful doctor has a hard time dealing with all of his rich, female patients, but manages to find the woman for him - but that's all it has to offer. Granted, whoever produced this movie did manage to include an aging ladies' man of an actor, a popular-at-the-time actress (who really should have known better), an aging actress apparently willing to do anything to get a part, and a few other second-string actors/actresses, to appear in this movie, but they seemed to have forgotten to hire a director, an editor, or a writer who can write higher than the third-grade level.The movie meanders on and on, with quite a few side-plots introduced (including an aging (ex-)wife that obviously has health problems but we never find out if they're mental or physical), but the movie never really comes to a point, nor do we see any sensible conclusion to the side-plots. And, the ending is so far-fetched it borders on the realm of sci-fi/fantasy (especially if you know ANYTHING about the geography of Texas or the Southern United States).About the only good thing that can be said for this movie is that it has sunk to some all-time lows as for as the tricks it'll pull to draw in viewers.

And Helen Hunt as well.The thing is, Dr. T. loves his job, and especially delivering babies. He finds that the most wondrous part of it. This is why the end makes so much sense, despite its fantastical twist. He drives into the tornado -- Dallas society, his office, his life -- and comes out the other side, stripped down to basics, needed by the people to help with the delivery of a child. It was shocking to see it so graphically portrayed, but that was real. And Dr. T. needed to get back to the basics, back to what was real. (And thank god it's not another woman! he's relieved to find.)Not a bad movie at all. One of the more likable Robert Altman films.

His office is constantly filled with haranguing, whining women who seem totally dependent on Dr.T's medical diagnosis as an approval of their lives.  Things take a turn for the even more chaotic when his wife (the fabulously (the ditzy Farrah Fawcett) is diagnosed with a complex that quite literally translates to loving her too much.Richard Gere gives such a disarming, winning, and quietly graceful performance as Dr. T that it's perfectly juxtaposed with the overwhelming and frantic women.  The women characters, though not particularly deep or  pensive, serve only as foils to Helen Hunt's independent, thoughtful, and meaningful character, for whom Dr. T. unavoidably falls for.   Screenwriter Anne Rappe pays careful attention to detail, in both observations on women and the wealthy, and though there are sometimes one too many plot lines flowing at once, most of them are concluded nicely and with out trite neatness in the end.Handled with an easygoing charm, Altman delivers another satisfying, thoroughly entertaining, and not quite as complex film.  Richard Gere's turn as the overbearring Dr. T is his most likeable performance yet, and he serves well as the balancing point of the hectic, erratic women who fill his life with turmoil, but ultimately happiness.7 out of 10  "},{"Title":"Not Altmans best and not his worst","Date":"7 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  POSSIBLE SPOILERSI don´t know,  but I had mixed feelings as I left the  theater.

Dr. T was also written by a woman as was several of his best films (Nashville, Thieves Like Us, Cookie's Fortune)Another complaint is about the plot. Note that one characteristic of Altman's films are not the plots, but the rich and vibrant characters that inhabit them. His films are about people and what make them tick. I personally would rather watch a good film with some interesting characters doing their business than see promising characters die under the weight of the plot.Richard Gere gives one of his all time best performances. Has it been this long since he's been so good in a film? I've always thought he was a good actor, but his more recent films such as Runaway Bride had made me question myself. It is good to see him back on top.Another complaint about this film is the ***SPOILER*** lesbian storyline between Dr. T's daughter and her bridesmaid. But let me point out that an amateur would wallow in the sexual angle of this story. A witty director like Altman just observes that it happens and lets it stay at that. He doesn't dwell in the seamy, he dwells in everyday life.Dr. T and the Women is Robert Altman's best film in many years.

I hate to use the word weird, but this film is VERY weird.  It's the strangest film I've ever seen.  It is disguised as a romantic comedy with a gynecologist trying to sweep a tennis instructor off of her feet.  However, it's really an amusing spiral downward through a chaotic life.As with many films, it appears that this is one of two films out at the same time that attempts to understand women and women's effect on men.  The other film, What Women Want, was a successful mainstream film that said basically nothing so convincingly that it was difficult not to love.  This film is so bizarre that it will send home many of Brazil's biggest fans home scratching their heads.The opening title sequence sets up the mood of the film, beginning inside of an office with the secretary making small talk with a patient.  Then, she makes small talk with another patient while the first patient talks to someone else.  Eventually, the sounds of the conversations keep building and building, until by the end of the sequence, all of the voices are so loud that the sequence is confusing and nearly unbearable.  This is what the film is like from beginning to end.  It begins simply with a very soft, romantic view of the subject matter (in this film, the subject is women) and then slowly progresses into insanity with no exact conclusion.This film can be called misogynistic, and to some extent that's true.  It's written by a woman, but by the end, we see Gere's character get so worked up over the women in his life that we think they are what causes his misfortune.  However, I don't even think it's so much a movie about women; it's a film that represents women as an obsession.  Gere's character surrounds himself by women almost exclusively; even his hunting friends are associated with him through patients at the gynecologists office.  He ignores that this could be a problem in his life and goes on without dealing with the negative aspects of women and only the positive ones.The charm of this film is difficult to put your finger on.  The dialogue here isn't written in a way to flesh out the characters.  The characters are not developed by the dialogue, so it's difficult to see what their inner motives are.  Altman here tries to develop characters more by their actions and by the movements.  The film doesn't so much have plot twists as it's plot slowly twists throughout.  It begins seeming like it will be one type of movie, slowly morphing into a different type of movie, and then ending up being totally opposite of either.  We begin the film wanting to like the characters, and by the end we end up wanting to dislike them but are strangely engaged by their presence.  Nothing here ever fits together the way it seems like it should.DR T is not a perfect movie.  The one aspect of the movie that I personally would have welcomed was more of an insight to how Hunt's character was special.  The only reason we realize she's special is because Dr. T says she is.  Sure, she is different in that she wants to pursue her own career and remain the one that's in control of her life, but we weren't given the chance to see what makes her so likeable.  Hunt basically plays the exact same role as she did in What Women Want, but in that film she is given ample opportunity to have the viewer to know what about her makes her so special, so genuine, and so compassionate.  Her character in Dr. T and the Women is to be examined with the assumption that different is good, but in What Women Want it was explained why being different is good.And, although the film is about chaos, it would be nice if we were given a little bit more of a reason of why we watched the film after it was over.  The themes are all broken apart by the end, going through a fantastical ending that puts the ending sequence of Magnolia to shame.  This ending is fun, different, and thoughtful, but it leaves absolutely no sense of conclusion to what just happened.  The ending is just as much frustrating as it is entertaining.Despite the flaws, Dr. T and the Women, as long as it didn't offend you, takes too many chances for it not to be loved.  It falls on its face, of course, but gets up every time and keeps moving along.  It's unmissable by anyone that found What Women Want to have been too predictable and too mainstream.  Don't expect to leave the theater (or finish the video) settled with a proper ending, completed themes, or a firm grasp on what happened in the film.  This is a masterpiece of chaos with the Altman directing style that many of us have come to love over the years.  The film doesn't really end up saying a whole lot of anything, but that appears to be sort of the point.  9/10 "},{"Title":"Job as a ob/gyn","Date":"5 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I don't like this as much as Cookie's Fortune, which is another collaboration between Altman and Rapp, but it has its moments.

However, the images in the movie of Dr. T being suffocated by this swarm of women that surround him, and some of the various subplots (the daughter that works at the conspiracy museum, for instance) are quite diverting. I want to watch the movie again and see how it holds up the second time -- a lot of Altman's movies appeal to me even more with subsequent viewings, and I don't know if this will be one of them...

Dr. T is a simple hunter who is desperate for straightforward sex and whose gynecology work immerses him in female sex organs and surrounds him with a gaggle of complaining women. His simple world is spinning out of control as his wife loses her mind (and withdraws from him), a lesbian daughter jilts her boyfriend at the alter, a female golf pro sexually amuses herself with him, an alcoholic sister-in-law with three children (girls, of course) moves in, a lustful office manager finally reveals herself to him and another daughter constantly reminds him that she's okay while devoting her life to the JFK conspiracy theory. While the man is distressed by this complex array of characters, the women are quite happy with their condition.  The ending is a bit far-fetched, but in keeping with the movie's lighthearted intent, as the doctor is finally flung away from his women to deliver a baby boy.  Even here, though, women surround the doctor and they speak a foreign language, thus continuing the estrangement of man and woman.

Here he plays a role that will surprise most viewers, a successful doctor and a member of the Dallas upper class that is surrounded by women and is constantly devoting his time and energies to their happiness and well-being. I don't think I've ever seen a movie do such a good job at showing the amazing ability that women have to drive men insane. The best part of the movie is an extended scene in which Dr. T tries to get through a day at work in which just about everything that could possibly go wrong in his life does. This is some of the best acting Gere has ever done.      Must has been said about the scene where his wife has a form of nervous breakdown and becomes institutionalized, and this is attributed to her having everything she could ever want and being completely loved by everyone around her. To those of you who take offense to this, ask yourself why so many rich and famous people end up meeting tragic, horrible ends. Like them, Dr. T's wife feels that she doesn't deserve what she has, and that there's no point in continuing to make a contribution to her own life anymore. This is meant not as a commentary on women, but on society's upper class and its effect on human nature.     If you can keep an open mind, this one is not to be missed.

The nudity was exploitive, women were portrayed as catty airhead nymphomaniacs, and the last scene that was supposed to be so necessary to the film that the director couldn't possibly  alter it, was a complete exploitation.  I got the feeling that the director felt that having a human baby was no more sacred or deserving of respect than any animal birth that curious onlookers should be allowed to observe from the doctors point of view, which was completely unnecessary! I evidently wasn't the only woman who felt that way.

The only woman who appears to be independent is played by Helen Hunt, whose slightly mannish dress and lack of femininity don't seem coincidental--it's as though the only good woman is one who is just a bit more like a man.  Hunt reveals no charm or charisma, and her character is finally made out to be cold and thoughtless.And the ending!!  It's so unbelievable that I've chosen just to forget about it.  Some reviewers have suggested that those who dislike this film just don't get it--that it's a satire.  That may be true, but it's poorly done satire that shows no affection or understanding for its subjects.  One is hard pressed to feel that Altman can understand anything about women if he doesn't understand the fundamental truth that the majority of women do not enjoy going to the gynecologist.  Perhaps more importantly, Dr. T is a confused, incoherent mess of a film, even disregarding it's clear misogyny. I've read a few reviews that suggest this film is meant to be a love letter to women.

Altman has always been a hit-and-miss director, and lately, at the age of 75, his career seems to have been given a fresh start, with The Player and Short Cuts being enormous critical successes in the early 90s. More recently, Cookie's Fortune, a delightful satirical look at small-town life, saw him in excellent form.Dr T. and the Women can also be considered a satire, this time of Dallas high-society ladies who all meet in the microcosm of a gynaecologist's waiting room. But as a satire, this ultimately does not work. Very few laughs are to be had, and it is only the surreal climax to the story that really hits the right notes. And any film that relies on Richard Gere to carry it for two hours has to be doomed to failure. (Has Gere ever been in a good movie?)But the main criticism to be levelled at this predictable and plodding film is the sheer boredom that descends on the viewer. Let's hope that Altman comes up with a more interesting subject and a more entertaining end product next time around. And with this prolific director, you can be sure there will be a next time!

From the opening scene we are hurled into the paranoid, pill popping, cell phone blah blah, froth and frills world of Dallas rich cats whose lives are so empty because they have so much. Dr. T's wife quite understandably escapes this global insanity by slipping into a more traditional and blissful madness. Contrast patients at the mental institution with Dr. T's waiting room grotesques and the feline jungle outside in the mall. At least the ladies in the mental ward were working towards reality and not so many Barbie Dolls strutting their stuff and living their lives down cell phones.Some viewers were distressed by Altman's negative view of Dallas women which is equivalent to worrying that Goodfellas puts a nasty slant on Italian men. Anyone who thinks it through will recognise that this is a snapshot of a type, a micro world, and not for goodness sake the whole female population of Dallas.There were some engaging cameos amongst the boys who were, much like their women, trying to fill a few empty moments. The trap shooting with golf balls was a great combination of man's things and the scene where a decoy was blasted out of the water was hilarious. At least with the men I felt these macho bonding, boys' toys moments were only part of their lives and not their raison d'etre - but then, I'm a man so I would say that.An enjoyable and sharply observed film with a great number of subtle and not so subtle touches which made me smile or laugh out loud much to the confusion of the largely stony faced French audience around me.Loved the old dear trip the paranoid bitch scene - Yessss !

The Travis' other daughter, Connie (Tara Reid), is a Kennedy conspiracy buff who is jealous of the attention her sibling is receiving. Dr. T's nearly divorced, self-centred alcoholic sister-in-law, Peggy (Laura Dern), has recently moved in with her three spoiled young girls. Carolyn (Shelley Long), the head nurse at his office, is secretly madly in love with him, and the self-assured Bree (Helen Hunt), the new assistant at his country gold club, immediately wins him over, leading to a love affair occurring between the two.Enough occurs in the film to fill the running time of several movies, and often the subplots are unresolved and unfulfilled as a result of the overabundance of the plot. What keeps everything together is and the happenings engaging is the rising tension of the increasing stress of Dr. T. There are also many intriguing elements that develop its atmosphere effectively the chaotic mood in Dr. T's office; the strange quirks of the Farrah Fawcett character; the nicely subtle meet cute between the Richard Gere and Helen Hunt characters; the overwhelming variety of the anomalous females; the unexpected and fun plot twists involving his family's and friends' sexuality; and most of all, the charmingly warm and likable performance by Richard Gere.

My date and I both enjoyed this film quite a lot (she, being a Southerner, said she found the comic portrayals of nouveau riche Dallas women to be spot-on). The actors in the film simply went to town with their roles, and I thought most of the characters were very sharply written and observed. Despite farce being the prevailing aim of the movie, Altman and Rapp were careful to produce characters and situations that most of can recognize from our real lives (as scary as that may be!). In fact, I think you could tell a lot about a person based on which of this movie's characters, if any, they find sympathetic. For instance, I felt that Connie was nosy and conniving. Another reviewer thought she was the only likable character.Additionally, I loved the surrealistic, from-left-field ending. Someone described it as implausible, as though that were even remotely the point.Admittedly, this movie may not be to all tastes. But to those familiar with Altman's work and with a taste for freewheeling social satire, check it out.

It is instead a deceptively simple, yet busy, multi-layered, character study of a Truffaut-like character (the Man who Loved Women) who has nearly become a martyr to the women that surround him.Dr T. loves his wife too much, he's successful and looks like Richard Gere. He's remained faithful to the wife who has become more and more spoiled and selfish and now suffers from a fictional malady which causes her to regress to childhood behavior- which includes jumping into a fountain in a crowded mall, and stripping off all her clothes and giving up sex entirely because it's too naughty.  One of his spoiled daughters is about to get married, and about to become a famous cheerleader, the other spoiled daughter works at the Dallas Conspiracy Museum fretting about mom, her sister and just about everything.   There's a spoiled sister-in-law who's separated, drinks too much and has moved into his house with her three kids.  And there's also dozens of rich, pampered Dallas society women he treats.  You see, Dr. T is a gynecologist.Dr. T. eventually explains that to him women are saints.  When they go wrong or go bad it's a man's fault.  He's about to learn a hard lesson, that his belief is a little bit lopsided, a little bit too much of a good thing. Nobody is perfect, not even women.  And Men ... not even him, should ever be so presumptuous to believe they have the ultimate control.Now there's some critics and writers who have apparently already decided the film is more than a little misogynistic.  They need to watch the film a few more times.    There are others that have decided the film is a lighter than latte foam.  They also need to watch the film a few more times.It's far from a perfect film, and it isn't an important film with a message or one that ends with a powerful emotional wallop that sucker punches you at it's conclusion.No, this is a wonderfully written, masterfully directed, perfectly cast, brilliantly acted gem of a film.  It's almost a modern screwball comedy, the way a Sturges may have delivered one, if he had been Altman.I suspect there are several scenes the film critics are identifying or complaining about as being slightly off mark.  For me there were two.  And they were minor.  One involves a scene in which a women patient is allowed to smoke.  The smoking is over-exaggerated... like the women is actually an actresses pretending to smoke.. too quickly, too desperately.  It's one of the few phony, overly deliberate scenes in the film.      The other is when Dr. T is told a secret about his about to wed daughter Dee Dee, by his other daughter.   It plays false, because the revelation should not throw his character for quite the loop it does, in quite the way it does.The film quickly recovers from both of these brief stumbles however.A casual film-goer might take a lot of what Altman does for granted.   So permit me this obvious to many, explanation.In real life, when we are in a crowded room we can hear several conversations at once, and tune in and out of the ones we want to over-hear. However, to duplicate this on film is quite a difficult technical feat.  To wire the room properly for sound, to get everyone talking at the right volume, to get the mixing of volumes in post production and  make sure all of the conversations can be heard, to decide how they are blended in and around one another, to create believable movement... well it's a remarkable achievement.  Altman perfected this technique, and few do it as well or as successfully.  Few create entire scenes that drip with layers of texture and detail like an Altman scene often can.  Few give a feeling of depth to both foreground and background characters within the same scene.  Few give so many actors a moment here and a moment there to react or do just the right thing.  Few let us glimpse at both sides of a situation the way Altman lets us.  It can be confusing, and it isn't necessary to the plot of the film. It just adds a layer of authenticity to every shot.  Minor characters and extras may have a bit of business which is so perfectly done, such a rightly captured human moment it makes us smile with its truth.The danger of course is by making sure to get so many details right, it forces us to closely inspect every other detail of the film.  Sometimes some details aren't right.  Sometimes some details ring false, or are missed or passed over.We forgive Altman for these things in many of his films, because the stumbles are going to happen when you push so hard, to be so precise, yet remain loose enough to give your actors the room they need to act, to improvise, to find their moments.   When you trust people, be they art directors or actors, not all their decisions are going to be good ones.  But you let them make their mistakes.  You let them have their moments, good, and not so good.  You hope the not so good moments give the film a shaggy dog feel.  It's imperfections transform into making the film oh so much more precious and endearing because it isn't perfect.Altman paints as he goes.  It's a technique that is like a high wire artist in a circus working without a net.  Altman has fallen many times in the past.  But he's lived through his falls.And now with Dr T and the Women he dazzles us with a lifetime of his experience behind the camera, constructing scenes, working with actors, and proves himself a master.  He's taken for granted these days and when his films are less than they should be, critics will take to calling him a traffic manager, yet when it does work the way it's supposed to-- few call him a genius.He's not really a genius....  He's Altman.  He's been doing things the way he pleases for nearly 40 years now.  Ever since he refused to direct his third Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode in the 60's and got himself fired. Ever since he followed his smash hit Mash, with the quirky and bizarre Brewster McCloud. Ever since he directed such brilliant films as McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Long Goodbye, Thieves Like Us, and of course Nashville.  He falls right on his face with things like Quintet and Beyond Therapy. He can direct a disappointment  like  Popeye and  then  turn his back completely on Hollywood and the studios for nearly ten years to concentrate on directing little known and quirky plays like Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, Streamers, and Secret Honor.This is the guy capable of directing one of the greatest political satires ever made -- Tanner &#145;88  (For HBO) and then make a triumphant critical return to Hollywood with   The Player, follow that up with the masterpiece Short Cuts only to let nearly everyone down with Ready to Wear and Kansas City.  He then got another studio system project to direct and  fought with studio executives over his final cut of The Gingerbread Man.   The film was not thought of as a success.Then there was Cookie's Fortune, a fine quirky little ensemble piece and now a bigger quirker ensemble piece; Dr T and the Women.Altman is a film-maker who continues to do things exactly as he pleases. Even at 75, he's making controversial films which will inspire film-makers to reach beyond formulas and focus groups and create something which defies labels and perhaps even genres.  They are also tough films to market to an audience.Just look at what he does at the end of Dr. T and the Women.  He could have chosen to let the film wind down, but instead he takes a giant leap and I believe scores a huge victory for doing so.Altman is the undisputed master of creating moments that will frustrate some, exhilarate others but ultimately be precisely the type of ending the material demanded all along.The last line of the film ties into the film in a surprising, spiritual manner that couldn't be more perfect, couldn't be more simple and yet is an extreme risk which I suspect many critics will consider it a flaw.  Some may even read it incorrectly.Not everyone is going to like or even accept what Altman does.  But if you have been paying attention to the film, I trust you will respect what he does.Altman has not stunt casted, or forced any of his actors to stretch beyond what they are capable of.  Even Helen Hunt who I find to be an appealing but extremely limited actress , turns in a performance that uses her few strengths so well, you don't notice her weaknesses.Richard Gere has never been better, and probably never will be this good again.Dr. T & The Women is a quirky character study of a man who believes he understands women better than he understands himself.  He discovers he doesn't understand himself very well at all and consequently doesn't know women all that well either.There are several witty, satirical, clever and funny observations being made about a great many things in the film, but there are also some keenly made ones that speak directly to the heart and soul of the human psyche.  It's here the film becomes much more than the humorous exercise it's pretending to be most of the time.   It is here that subsequent viewings will reveal there is a lot more going on in the film than you might have originally believed.Altman has delivered not a little truffle of a film here, but a richly, layered masterpiece to be savored and enjoyed over and over again.Don't miss it.

It has no plot? Please. This is an Altman film. His schtick is to assemble a bunch of quirky characters and let it fly. Character over plot. If you want plot, stay at home. Any tv drama will suffice. I'm most concerned about people calling this film misogynistic, because that's just not true. You might see the film as sexist (that's your choice), but it is not hate-filled. WARNING SPOILERS!! STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. Dr. T works as an OB-GYN!! The film opens with a shot of him examining an older, elegantly dressed society-type woman. If there's laughter here, it's because anyone looks awkward with their pants down. But the scene quickly establishes Dr. T's professionalism and care towards the women he serves. The ending is a birth scene, a close-up. It's the real deal, here. Amazing, and beautiful! How could this be hateful?! The Dr. laughs when he sees the baby, saying, Thank God it's a boy! or something. That might sound sexist, but I see it as the opposite. He starts off at the beginning with this confident attitude that he understands women, he knows what they want. And as the film goes on, his smug (if sweet) confidence is undone. He basically suffers from good old-fashioned hubris, and by the end he's humbled. It's not that women are bad. It's that women are so wonderfully diverse and human that he's an idiot for ever having thought he could preside over them like a king. Altman pushes to make this point. He shows that the Dr. has smothered his wife when he thought he he was treating her like a queen, that he is blind to the love of his secretary even though that love was there all along, that he doesn't even really know his daughter. Topsy-turvy! The scenes with him and his hunting buddies are hilarious--the men seem to shrink as the film goes on, little faces poking out of the plants, puzzling over what women want and mean.And then there's fabulous Helen Hunt, the best actor in the film (as far as I'm concerned). She is a truly liberated woman, Dr. T's foil. She knows what she wants, she's a true grown-up. And when he tries to take her for his own, he finds he can't have her. And his daughter--the scene where she chooses at the altar is a beautiful, funny moment that establishes her liberation, too! Obviously she inspires her dad at that point, because he follows her example by wanting to run off with Hunt's character in the very next scene.This film makes perfect sense. It may have some fluffy stereotypes in the way it treats *rich* idle women, but it is no hate-fest. Memorable, surreal ending.

While we feel some sympathy toward Dr. T. - and have all felt out of control of our lives- most of the characters are caricatures and never fully developed.  Very different, I think, from the character development in Cookie's Fortune.

His typically huge ensemble cast delivered, and as usual he was able to keep the multitude of cooks from spoiling the broth. And, once again, he provided the viewers with his usual 'healthy dose of naked actresses'. This one counts complete nudity from Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett and a live birth which, according to the credits, was not faked or simulated, not to mention lighter fare.The story basically has Richard Gere as a Dallas OB-GYN  who caters exclusively to the city's upper crust women, all of whom are neurotic, obsessed and bored; they regard their status as his patients to be a necessary cog in the wheel of their social status, they count their visits to 'Dr. T' as a signifcant social function, and his patient and respectful manner both comforts them and allows then to let off self-centered steam. This client base has made him a very rich man, and he has made a loftly life for his wife, two daughters, and sister's family. Still, his life craves something else, and he can hardly wait for the daily visits to the golf course or hunting in the Texas countryside with his buddies (look for a much matured Robert Hays in this pack.)His wife, Farrah Fawcett goes nuts from too much of the pampered good life, and reverts to a child-like mental state. When she starts walking around naked in public, they put her in an institution; eventually divorce proceedings are begun by her council. One of his daughters is an almost dangerous fanatical conspiracy theorist, participating in Kennedy assasination re-enactments and spouting warning of impending gloom and doom. The other daughter has become a professional cheerleader and is planning to be married, but there is a skeleton in her closet which promised to disappoint her family and ultimately ruin everything for her father.When his wife files for divorce, the good doctor falls in love with his golf pro, Helen Hunt, and it looks like she will be his new wife. Meanwhile, his reliable chief of staff at the office, played by the always funny and excellent Shelley Long, is quietly falling head over heels for him as well.When everything crashes in on the doctor, from every angle, he drives into the heart of a violent storm.

One of these, assuredly, is Robert Altman, whose new film, Dr. T. and the Women  (***1/2) is a small gem.  Here, Richard Gere's trademark laid back performance (sometimes undisguised as downright wooden in other outings) sounds just the right note as a traditional chauvinist (albeit with the best of intentions) in New Age style and manner.   Dr. T. is a OB/GYN in Dallas serving an upper class clientele -  a handsome and beloved charmer who manages to tend his patients with a combination of affection and meticulousness that makes the chaotic ship of his practice bounce through foam to safe shores - and clearly, these women adore him as well.  Yet, he manages to be masculine without seductiveness  this is no rake with a stethoscope.  He genuinely cares for his patients, and he manages consistently to give his tireless dedication to even their smallest needs. Dr. T. also has a beautiful and charming wife (Farrah Fawcett) and two daughters (Kate Hudson and Tara Reid).  And in the midst of one daughter marrying, his wife going mad and finally becoming institutionalized from being loved too much and too well (according to the psychiatrist, played by Lee Grant), leaving her with no goals or direction (and I would add, no sense of self), and with his sense of purpose as a man challenged by a woman (Helen Hunt) to whom he is becoming increasingly romantically attached, Dr. T. begins to see the ground of his world almost literally sink beneath his feet. Some have accused this film of misogyny  I think those that do mistake content for process.  The doctor's chauvinism is sincere  he truly believes that his role as a man is to provide the women a gilded environment furnished with all manners of release from cares  materially, emotionally, and without a need to be challenged spiritually.  What occurs in this film is an elegant metaphorical demonstration of Dr. T.'s re-birth and transformation, where the good doctor discovers a masculinity independent of needing to emotionally enslave the women around him (family and patients)by enabling dependence. With Hell-paved best intentions, Dr. T. had come to over-nurture these women to the extremity of decadence, psychological regression, and in one life-shattering instance, insanity.  This film also offers an interesting parable about the limitations of materialism.  As lives fall apart or take unexpected turns, characters are presented with genuine existential dilemmas.  While this film is not heavily plotted, Dr. T. takes a journey, until by film's end we begin to experience a person emerging from the chains of mellow that had previously bound his life.  Learning to relate to a self that has no need of a woman to need him, Dr. T. begins to identify who he is as both a soul and a man.  And Altman displays this journey with customary wit, style, empathy, and compassion.

I had read that it was in his characteristic style of a lot of people interacting with very little actual plot (which I have usually enjoyed), but I was also a bit apprehensive because usually when a major star has been featured in an Altman film (remember Paul Newman in Quintet and Buffalo Bill) the results have been disappointing. Well, the good news is that this is better than the two Newman films, but it's still got problems. Throughout the film we see Dr. T becoming more and more confused in his attempts to satisfy all the women in his life, until (literally, it seems) all hell breaks loose at his daughter's wedding. Up till this point the film has been fairly naturalistic in style, and it seems to be leading up to a conclusion where he would realize that his life is a mess and try to simplify. That happens, but it's only through a Deus ex machina that's so much at odds with the style of everything that has come before that I was expecting it to turn out to be a dream. The simplified life which Dr. T seems to be embracing at the very end is dramatically appropriate, but I object to the method used to get him to that point.Anyway, the first 80% or so of the film is amiable enough that I'd recommend it to fans of Altman's style, but if you're not already a fan, skip this one and rent Short Cuts instead.

This film was interesting; we had lesbians, bisexuals, women losing their minds in a mall and dancing nude in the fountain, drunks, desperate women looking to hook Dr. T any way they could, cheerleaders, and that chick from Almost Famous. Despite the vast amount of interesting content, a movie is not good if it does not cohere to a central plot, with no more than a very few side stories that tie in to the central theme or story. Gere's character should have been at the center of this movie, and less time should have been spent with other characters. In fact, there were so many other characters, this movie felt more like a ninety-minute soap opera instead of a movie.

Dr. T contains the usual Altman trademarks which fans will savor, but it is a slow paced film that meanders, which non Altman devotees will find tedious and hard to follow.  Dr. T is an uneven effort for Altman. He tries to combine the community mosaics of Nashville and Short Cuts with the surrealism of 3 Women with mixed results. The film's strange shifts in tone will suprise and confuse viewers which I liked. But the material seem a bit slight and fluffy considering Altmans previous efforts. It lacks the cynicism, sarcastic tone and edge that made all of those great films by Altman in the 70's such brilliant and innovative masterworks. Richard Gere is competent in the lead, with an excellent ensemble cast. It has many amusing moments and subtle touches by Altman, but like his previous collaboration with Anne Rapp, Cookies Fortune is somewhat sentimental and lighter fare which I don't associate with the Master director. Overall I recommend this film to Altman completists mainly.

When You Love the Women around You, WHEN a MAN THINKS THERE IS SOMETHING Special about every woman, when he takes care of them and treats them well,  he is rewarded by, Insanity, Assassination Obsessed, Sexual Delusions of #1 office girl, and Sexual Difference Choice of daughter, AND THE ONE WE ALL THOUGHT WOULD ACCOMPANY HIM OUT OF HIS CRAZY WORLD and leave ***holes behind,  THEN..... she....  is so non-chalant about the love of a good man,,, she devastates him  too. And it was all c**p, and we fans, Paid Good Money and Spent Valuable Time BECAUSE WE THOUGHT, anything with Richard, Helen, Shelly, Farrah would be a good use of a day off.  By the way, Farrah F. had the most likable character of Dr. T's women. AND what was the NONSENSE of the tornado, and the grossness of the ending.  Someone told me about those things because I had already walked out of the theatre. THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY, swear to theatres everywhere, made me vow never to go to the theatre again.

Then he made the world safe for long movies that were not period pieces when he tickled out feet with Short Cuts.  But did anyone know what Pret-a-Porter meant when he boasted supermodels galore in 94?  Did anyone want to know?  Did anyone care?  Did Ready to Wear end up on ANYONE's home shelf as a keeper?Richard Gere is a gynecolegist.  His office is ALWAYS filled with women, who ALL have appointments, ALL need to see him RIGHT NOW, and ALL have a crush on him.  Now while, in theory this might be funny - let me paint with my beautiful brush of words what it feels like to watch upwards of 15-20 women, all in Dallas, Texas accents, ALL talking at the same time, all bickering, running in and out of slamming doors, giving orders to the staff, fighting with each other, and NOT ONE VOICE every becoming coherant enough for you to understand and focus on, but instead the entire scene plays like you are sitting in the middle of a baseball game right after a particularly exciting play that you had to be blindfolded during.  You HEAR armageddon all around you, but you have no idea what they're talking about.  And this goes on for 15 minutes at a time.PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The plot?  Gere's got a wife who's lost it (Farrah Fawcett, who proves that she has lost it when she is seen in her first big scene of the film dancing COMPLETELY NUDE in a mall fountain - why?  Well, gosh kids - SHE'S NUTS!!), one daughter getting married, but holding back a BIG SECRET (wanna know what it is?  Here's a hint - Liv Tyler appears out of nowhere - if you know what I mean), the other daughter just stands there annoyed, and Helen Hunt is the new woman in his life (it takes him the whole movie to realize, apathetically, that she is using him for sex - GEE, Gere - was that hard to figure?  She strips on your first date and has sex with you before you've had time to learn her last name - women looking for long term don't usually DO THAT - we're you the AMERICAN GIGOLO?).And did I mention dull?  Scenes flicker on the screen for five, sometimes twenty minutes at a time, and I found myself saying - Whoa - how long was i just asleep for?  Ten minutes?  Well, no matter - NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!!!. Characters do things for no reason - REPEATEDLY, and every half hour we are treated to a meandering scene with Gere going hunting with his four buddies (or was it three?  Who cares, they shared ONE personality), if only to prove that there are OTHER MEN in Dallas than Gere!!!!  Performances?  Well, everyone gives one, and as the movie is now mercifully over (while watching it, I doubted that it would be by today - my companion turned to me and asked, Is this movie TEN WEEKS LONG?), I can honestly say that the only person I remember in the film aside from the I'm BEFUDDLED, get it? Gere is Shelly Long, and only because it's been so long since I've seen her in anything, and I really like her.  But even she is reduced to trying to seduce Gere in a ridiculous scene that, like every scene in this movie - leads nowhere and accomplishes nothing.Put yourself blindfolded in a room full of screaming banshees and elevator music and have them spin you around in a chair until you vomit.  It's just like seeing, Dr. T and the Women.   One friend said, And I thought DUETS was bad.  Another friend agreed she would have rather seen Ladies Man AGAIN.  Another friend and I needed Tylenol when we got back to my place. It's just that kind of movie.  And, true to form - the critics are liking it.And that's my two cents.

I admit I was kind of embarrassed at the movie (the theatre was half full and I was the only man there) but once the movie started all that went away. The film is a very funny look at one man (played brilliantly by Richard Gere- in his only truly great performance) who is lost in a world of women.

Others have called this movie too busy, but that's what I liked about it - it moves right along with never a dull moment.  As a Texan, I had to chuckle at the portrayals of Texas women - especially the over accessorizing - what a hoot seeing Laura Dern baking while wearing six huge zebra patterned bracelets.  I'm not the biggest Dern fan, but I thought she was excellent in this movie.  And Farrah Fawcett looked great - we should all look so good in our 50's.  Even the actresses with smaller roles were excellent.  Shawne Fielding, who played the actress who says, We're all here to see Dr. T and then sits down showing her exasperation, was great - I sense a great beauty/comic acting ability in her - shades of the beautiful comics of the 40's.  I like Helen Hunt, but I didn't think she was suitable as a love interest for Richard Gere.  Her character, however, was meaningful in that she was the only women in Gere's life who could take care of herself, which seemed to baffle him.  The ending is one of those that leaves you really thinking - unexpected and provoking.  Hubby and I are still discussing and analyzing its meaning.

The opening here sets the atmosphere in the office, but lasts way too long. I noticed people in the theatre looking around, and looking bored. The characters aren't that interesting, really. I mean, how come one character (Connie, I think)   first shows her cynical side AFTER a few scenes, when she's at work  @ the JFK Conspiracy Museum? How come she doesn't have the same characteristics throughout the movie? Maybe there are simply too many people to allow any of them to make an impression. Maybe some characters could have been left on the cutting room floor.The plot could be someone confusing, if you're trying to follow along. Farrah Fawcett's character , while important to the film, doesn't really bring much to the movie. It's just a ho hum role that she could have sleptwalked through.Maybe she did.  Helen Hunt is Helen Hunt, basically the same as she is in every movie. The soundtrack, by my man Lyle Lovett, is pretty good.Not enough tobuy the cd on MCA/Curb records. One of many things that didn't make sense was the wedding scene. How come, after the storm comes, everyone goes running out to the back, towards the bar area. But after a shot of Richard Gere smiling, and Farrah Fawcett again in a fountain, the guests all come running back through the chairs, and leave running past the altar? That didn't make any sense at all to me. The ending is pretty lame and quite graphic. Unnecessarily, I think. The best part about the ending, to me, is that it meant the movie was over.

It's a form that brings out the best in him. Workingagain with Anne Rapp (who wrote the sweet Cookie's  Fortune), Altman has crafted a rich and multilayered takeon the story of Job, with a healthy dose of Fellini's 8 1/2thrown in for good measure. Richard Gere plays the Jobcharacter, a gynecologist with an undying faith in and loveof women. But the gods do everything in their power tobreak his devotion, as one calamity after another befallshim. I won't spoil the ending, but, like the Fellini film, it is akind of fantasy of death and rebirth.The movie is dense in symbolism, for those who  appreciate such things. In one scene, Gere's wife (FarrahFawcett) climbs into bed in blue jammies and, childlike,refuses sex because it's not nice. Gere places a cup oftea on her bedstand; the cup bears an image of a unicorn.The Fawcett character, we learn from her psychologist, hasmentally reverted to a state of virginity. Thus the unicornand the color blue, both symbolic of the Virgin Mary, areused to describe her sanctity, while the cup alludes to herwomb.There are many such shots of symbolic richness, but noneof them detract from the sheer entertainment of the film.Although it is bound to polarize viewers, this is one ofAltman's best.

In attendance was Director Robert Altman, writer Anne Rapp, actress Janine Turner, musician/composer Lyle Lovett, and about 100 other industry people who were involved in the production.  The movie is about an affluent Dallas gynocologist and his dysfunctional family.  I live in the city of Denton, which is about 30 miles north of Dallas.  This movie is very accurate in its depiction of the affluent Dallas crowd.  This was cool because the same flashy money people portrayed in the movie were also in the theater watching the premiere (and preparing for the after dinner party).  It made for some awkward, but very funny moments in the theater. After the screening, there was a Q&A session with Robert Altman, Anne Rapp, Janine Turner, and Lyle Lovett.  Writer Anne Rapp said that the screenplay for the film began with a four page short story.  Director Robert Altman asked her to expand the short story into a feature length screenplay.  All of the panelists and the industry audience members had nothing but kind words for actor Richard Gere.  Lyle Lovett who did the soundtrack really shined at the premiere.  He struck me as the real deal.  He seemed appreciative and grateful for the contribution he was able to make to the film.  Director Robert Altman said that he really does not enjoy watching his own films, but that he loves to watch an audience watch his films.   I won't give away any spoilers (especially the one Mr. Altman asked everyone not to give away), but the movie is excellent.  Everyone in the Dallas/Ft.

First of all, I am a huge fan of The A-Team. One of the best action television shows of the Eighties, it had outrageous stunts, hilarious stories and one of the best ensemble acting groups in recent memory.  Who could forget the late George Peppard as Hannibal Smith, the erstwhile leader with his cigar and the `I love it when a plan comes together' line.  Or Dirk Benedict, or that guy who played Mad Dog.  But the star of that show was Mr. T.  Mohawk, Gold Chains and that crazy temper!  I was under the impression that he'd been to medical school.  Mr. T with a Ph.d!  Kicking butt and making the world safe for women of all ages! Hooray Dr. T! So I have to admit that I was a little embarrassed when I'm in the theater. Guess what?  Mr. T is not in this movie at all.  It's not an action picture. In fact, the movie is about a Dallas gynecologist played by Richard Gere. His character's name is Dr. Sullivan Travis.  His friends call him Sully, but his patients call him Dr. T.  Get it?  The story goes like this.  Dr. T is the calming force in the lives of a lot of women.  There's his wife, Kate, (Farrah Fawcett, still a hottie) who is having some mental issues because of too much love from Dr. T.  There are his two daughters, single Connie (Tara Reid, uber-hottie from American Pie and Urban Legend), the conspiracy theorist, and engaged Dee Dee (Kate Hudson, currently burning up the screen as Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous), the alternate Dallas Cowboys cheerleader who is planning her upcoming wedding with her Maid of Honor, Marilyn (Liv Tyler, MIA since Armageddon hottie). Then there's his sister, Peggy (Laura Dern, plain white hottie, the ex-girlfriend of Billy Bob Thornton, currently married to Anglina (ultra-hottie) Jolie), who has moved herself and her three young daughters into Dr. T's house, and has a little bit of a drinking problem. If Dr. T's home life doesn't sound complicated enough, then wait until you see his office.  His gynecology office is a zoo.  He's dealing with crazy patients like Dorothy (Janine Turner from Northern Exposure, where did she go?) who has hot flashes and dizzy spells every week because she needs the attention, and his crazy staff headed up by Carolyn (Shelly Long, Diane from Cheers, who has been gone from Hollywood so long that I thought she was dead) who is secretly in love with Dr. T.  His only respite is on the golf course, like all good doctors.  At the country club, he meets the new golf pro, Bree (Oscar-winning semi-hottie Helen Hunt) and begins to fall in love with her.  And that's when things get interesting. This is easily Robert Altman's best movie since The Player.  It flows evenly and he gets great performances out of his performers.  I can't single out a single actress as being better than the others.  It was a great ensemble piece all the way around.   He has a great script to work from, written by Anne Rapp, who also wrote the delightful Cookie's Fortune for Altman.  I think that women audience members will definitely relate to a lot of the movie and I think that guys will too.  I don't think I am going out on a limb by saying that the movie is very, very funny.  Not Jim Carrey funny, but sly witty good comedy funny.  Watching Dr. T deal with all of the craziness around him is very entertaining.  Also, I usually hate Richard Gere, but he is doing his best work in this movie.  Maybe because he doesn't have to do a lot of `acting'.  He reacts to the storm of emotion around him, and when he finally does crack, it feels very realistic.  I liked him, something I can't say for ANY MOVIE THAT GERE HAS EVER BEEN IN.  EVER.  So don't think that this is your typical Richard Gere film.  Actually, it is the ultimate success that happens when a great director and a great script come together with  a lot of very talented people, and a movie that shouldn't be missed if you like good-natured, character-driven films.

On one hand it's a satire of the upper class similar to A Wedding (only funnier). It is also a portrait of a man going through a mid-life crisis that runs from farcial to tragic to surreal.  The relationship between Richard Gere and Helen Hunt is handled perfectly.  Both are older and wiser and proceed much differently than a younger couple would have.  As for the ending, I found it tied the movie together very well, relating back to the situation with Farrah Fawcett's character.

If I had any disappointment at all, it might have been the ending.90 percent of Dr T's patients were a horrible lot. I don't know how he put up with them with such charm and patience.

Not delight.","Date":"7 January 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" From M*A*S*H and Nashville to The Player and Gosford Park, Robert Altman has shown again and again that there is simply no other director working that can juggle so expertly a large cast and interlocking stories. But the success or failure of an Altman film ultimately rests in his ability to seamlessly combine the often disparate tones of the story; in The Player, for example, he creates a work that is, at once, a satire of Hollywood, a film noir thriller, and a romantic drama. The result is pure magic and I am hard pressed to think of another director that could have achieved such spectacular results. Alas, Dr. T and the Women is unable to decide if it is a satire of Texas' idle rich, a farce exploring the disjointed dynamics of desire and romance or a family dramedy. The comedy often works, for Altman is a smart and witty comic that never fails to make the ridiculous and the absurd touchingly human (Cynthia Stevenson's funny and heartbreaking firing in The Player comes to mind). But here the film's bouncy jazz-like rhythms keep getting undercut by melodrama that, rather than enriching the comedy, serves only to leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. This push-me, pull-you experience is both frustrating and exhausting and, when the film, at last, finally lands in its absurdist desert, you are left with disappointment not delight. Altman does not, however, fail to elicit, as always, terrific, sometimes remarkable performances from his cast. And you can't hate a film that has such a rare love for women in all their strange and wonderful variations, and an unqualified and generous love of humanity.

Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett and Kate Hudson star A successful, handsome gynaecologist, Dr Sully Travis (Richard Gere) adores women, reckoning that they are sacred creatures and should be treated as such. The ladies in his life however are proving quite a burden. His wife (Fawcett) has been placed in a local psychiatric clinic. His alcoholic sister-in-law (Dern) has pitched up with her three kids, and his cheerleading elder daughter Dee Dee (Hudson) is planning a costly wedding, though her true romantic affections lie with the maid of honour (Tyler).Striking up a friendship with the new country club golf pro (Hunt), Dr T contemplates an extra-marital affair which he hopes might offer respite from the demands of his patients and staff.   Seventy-five-year old veteran director Robert Altman, in tandem with Cookie's Fortune screenwriter Anne Rapp, delivers an uneven, yet frequently enjoyable satire on Dallas society, and in particular those expensively pampered females who have time and money to burn. A loose riff on the biblical story of Job, the patriarch whose patience was tested by bizarre events, Dr T And The Women sees Altman employing his trademark overlapping dialogue and fluid tracking shots to convey one of his favourite themes - how meaningless chatter has replaced meaningful communication in modern society. There are so many players in this farce that some of the characters, particularly Fawcett's and Dern's, remain disappointingly superficial, and there's an element of cruelty about the way the women get stripped bare, both metaphorically and literally. Gere though produces an amiably bemused performance, and the gale-force ending takes a fantastical leap away from straightforward realism. Verdict An uneven but broadly enjoyable social satire that showcases decent performances by a quality cast, even if director Altman doesn't give all his characters quite the attention they deserve.

The story is convoluted, slow paced, makes no sense, unbelievable events happen, it begins to touch on character development but then just...stops.Dr. T stars Richard Gere (who I liked most in An Officer and A Gentleman) and a well known supporting cast (Helen Hunt, Shelley Long, Janine Turner, Farrah Fawcett, Robert Hays, Andy Richter, Laura Dern, Kate Hudson, and Liv Tyler). It was directed by Robert Altman. I didn't even bother reading credits after it was over but, judging from the situations and dialog, I'd guess this was supposed to be an adaptation of somebody's novel. I think it's supposed to be a satire about Dallas' nouveau riche, and how one Gynecologist must deal with all these various women (patients, co-workers, and family) in Texas high society.(Spoilers Below) The first 3/4 of the movie were barely tolerable. Characters are introduced in the first 15 minutes, and we quickly learn to care less about anything that happens to these people for the rest of the movie. They aren't interesting, they aren't developed well, and I could hardly figure out anyone's motivations. For example Peggy (Laura Dern) apparently has a drinking problem. She's seen drinking wine and champagne throughout the movie, occasionally slurs, and even has one scene where she stumbles and falls in the good Doctor's office...and then that's it. We don't learn anymore about her or her drinking problem than that. Another example Connie (Tara Reid) keeps telling her dad (Richard Gere) that everything's okay with me...really, it is. at various times in the movie. For no reason at all. We have no knowledge of why she's saying that or any evidence that there's something else going on and she's really not okay and she's actually about to kill herself or something. There are many other instances such as these in the movie and it makes you say huh? more than a few times.In almost every scene involving 3 or more women throughout the entire movie, Robert Altman used some trick where he'd have all of the women talking at the same time, and would choreograph the scene so that you could still (more or less) follow the storyline. At first, it was mildly amusing to see all these women talking at once in the Doctor's office. After about the tenth time seeing women clucking infernally like hens in the Mall, the Dress store, Tiffany's, a bridal shower, etc, it became a teeth-clenching chore to watch and made me want to rip out somebody's larnyx just so they'd shutup. Hey, Altman, ever heard of enough is enough?Farrah Fawcett plays Dr. T's wife Kate, who goes crazy and strips naked in the mall, dancing around in the fountain at the beginning of the movie. She's eventually put into a mental hospital, where she stays throughout the rest of the movie. Nothing really happens with her and Dr. T never really shows much interest in trying to understand what's wrong with his wife or help her in any way. Instead, he ends up cheating on her with Bree (Helen Hunt), a golf instructor new to the town.If the first 3/4 of the movie was barely tolerable, the last 1/4 was absolutely, positively ludicrous. Let me tell you what happens, and you tell me if it sounds plausible1. At Daughter Dee Dee's (Kate Hudson's) outdoor wedding she suddenly decides, while standing at the altar, that she wants to be with her lesbian lover Marilyn (Liv Tyler) instead of marry her boyfriend.2. Meanwhile, it just started to rain on the wedding party. And not just any rain...a huge, stormy, thundering downpour. (seems to me that somebody having a outdoor wedding would have paid at least mild attention to the weather reports for their wedding day)3. While everyone is scrambling for cover from the rain, Carolyn (Shelley Long), Dr. T's long time office manager, runs up to him and says I've always wanted to be a pastry chef, so I'm quitting my job. Uh, right. This event doesn't seem the least bit preposterously stupid or out of place, does it?4. Dr. T suddenly decides that he wants to spend the rest of his life with Bree, whom he has known for maybe 2 or 3 romantic evenings. He rushes from the wedding, jumps in his car and drives to her house to tell her the good news. She rebuffs him, however, and he leaves in a huff.5. He's so upset about this ill turn of events that he drives out into the raging storm, where (inexplicably) there are no other cars on the usually crowded freeways around Dallas.6. But wait! Now he's suddenly driving toward a...a...TORNADO! Yes, that's right, no tornado watches in Texas, apparently, just a instant tornado. It get's better, though.7. He and his car get swept up in the tornado, twirled around so many times, then apparently dropped down somewhere in MEXICO! (so this tornado carried him at least 800 miles from Dallas to Mexico? bwahahaha!). Anyway, the storm clears.8. Some time later, 3 little spanish speaking girls find him laying near his car and they help him get to his feet (YOU MEAN HE'S STILL ALIVE?????????) and take him to their village where, as luck would have it, THE VILLAGERS HAPPEN TO NEED A GYNECOLOGIST JUST THIS VERY MINUTE! One of the local girls is having a baby and, even though none of them speak english (and he doesn't speak spanish) they all just happen to know he's a gynecologist, they let him come into their house, and wait for him to deliver the girl's baby (methinks that maybe they would have already had arrangements in place to have this baby delivered. I mean, they've had 9 months to organize themselves, right? Or maybe they were just expecting a gynecologist to magically fall out of the sky at the right moment).whew! This was absolutely unbelievable. What am I supposed to think about this movie, especially after the embarrassingly stupid ending?I thinks it stinks, and I'm going to hold a grudge for a long time about wasting my $4 and 2 hours on this horrible piece of junk movie.How could people have seriously given this movie a 5 out of 10 rating??

I think a lot of people wereexpecting What Women Want here and that's not what Dr. T. is,by any means.Altman has captured the essence of a man surrounded bywomen, and the man's attempt to try to do what is best for everywoman in his life and ending up, pleasing no one-- includinghimself.  Dr. T has to juggle the needs of his wife, daughters,mistress, receptionist, patients, etc. and can't always be everythingfor everyone.  One example is when Peggy (Laura Dern) and DeeDee (Kate Hudson) are in his office, trying to tell Dr. T. two storiesat the same time and are arguing over who gets to talk to him,overlapping stories and alternating between arguing with eachother and talking to Dr. T.A lot of people said that the female characters weren't developedenough, weren't brought out enough and sometimes, that wastrue.  But it did allow us to focus on Dr. Travis's struggles and howeach relationship with each woman affected his overall sanity andunintentionally wreaked more havoc on his life.

There is the older wife, played by Farrah Fawcett, who gets a rare diagnose, retreating to a child's state of mind, caused by to too much love from her family and husband. There's the drunken sister in law (played all right by Laura Dern), the two daughters, where one is getting married even though being a lesbian, and the other jealous, and a bit prescient. The golf pro, played by Helen Hunt, a no-problem ever happy girl who fears commitment and the more serious part of life. And finally Mr T, the charming gynaecologist, who thinks he knows all about women (but knows nothing), and blames himself for loving his wife to much; but none the less, has no trouble having an affair, while the wife is at the mental hospital playing child.This movie is clearly made with the purpose to make a quick buck.

By contrast, the woefully awful, obscenity saturated, cynical, laughably pretentious and misanthropic `Magnolia' got plenty of praise from many of the same audiences and critics! And that guy was attempting to imitate Altman in embarrassingly inept fashion! Go figure the absurdities of the American movie-going public! But you have to understand that Altman's film doesn't peddle the over-the-top, sleaze-ball attraction of Tom Cruise grinding his pelvis and referring to women in the most degrading fashion imaginable; and yet, lo and behold, it's Altman's gentle satire that was labeled &#145;misogynist' by some because it didn't show any thoroughly exaggerated male characters like P.T. Anderson's not-likely-to-be-remotely- real (except maybe on the Jerry Springer show but that show's all exaggerated for effect anyway and not pretending to be profound) even-as-a-writer-for-Hustler-magazine buffoon, and instead, concentrated mainly on a few, well-drawn and realistic shallow women and one strong and intelligent one.First of all, it must be said, in case people forgot, that this film is a satire, and in a satire people are made to look routinely ridiculous to hopefully enlighten those who can understand and gain some perspective through it, to refine, if applicable, their own behavior by weeding out certain similar types of stubborn and insidious behaviors. It's about exposing vanity and absurdity. And if the balance of satire falls more heavily on the women in this film, there are at least 5 other films made by Altman himself where the opposite is true. But even this film is far from one sided when looked at more closely. How exactly are the men that go hunting with Dr.T, not made to look like idiots? And so what if Dr. T himself is made to look only &#145;gallantly foolish' for being &#145;too nice' (therefore causing his wife Farrah Fawcett to go into &#145;Childhood regression' ) ? Isn't a character criticized for being &#145;too accommodating' and intemperate in the opposite direction from the one so overwhelmingly depicted in almost every other satire, highly original in itself? Where else have you ever seen a character like this? Dustin Hoffman in `The Graduate' maybe? But he was a confused kid with no money and Gere is a successful gynaecologist making bank! The almost Marcus-Welby-like, meticulously polite and accommodating Dr. T. gynaecologist character is as rare a subject for satire as any, and he is satirized for sure, but not in as obvious a way as his patients and family members, i.e., &#145;the women,' who bear the burden of his intemperate &#145;niceness' (and maybe take advantage of it in ways that they themselves don't realize). It's easy to mistake it for a &#145;faultless' depiction, because the fault happens to be an excess of something everyone considers a virtue when not in excess. But an excess of politeness and accommodation is definitely a fault and maybe even a vice and it will get you in a lot of unexpected trouble.  Dr. T's doesn't know why he's made a mess of his life but we do, and that's immensely fascinating (especially since chronic &#145;nice guy' syndrome is widespread in society and potentially much more harmful than people think if not checked by some stronger, harsher, more truthful, and ultimately healthier realities).And so what if most of the women in Richard Gere's office are shown to be annoying idiots that drive him up the wall day after day, and whom he has to accommodate because it's his job? So what if most of the women in his family are relative airheads? Isn't the Helen Hunt &#145;golf coach' character the opposite number from all these airheads? Isn't her character one of the strongest, most independent minded women depicted in a film for quite a while? Doesn't she come to Gere's office and sit in the midst of a whole roomful of bickering women with quiet, dignified detachment? Doesn't she sleep with Richard Gere on a first date because she feels like it, fully aware that he will not look at her as &#145;easy' or in any way adversely as a result, but on the contrary, as a strong woman who takes what she wants guiltlessly and confidently, because she has related to him on an equal footing from the start? Doesn't she later give him advice in his office, and then reject his offer to marry her and &#145;take care of her' because she has her own life (like any self-respecting feminist would)? And so what if she's seeing Robert Hays (Gere's hunting buddy) on the side? Doesn't that further prove that she's independent enough to keep her options open and reject a conceited &#145;gynecologist' she likes very much but not enough to give up her career or principles for (if it comes down to a marriage offer that she's not ready to accept, as it surely did in the end)?  Doesn't that show foresight and mature independence rather than some &#145;two-timing' &#145;cheating woman' nonsense proving her &#145;typical female treachery,' and &#145;shallowness' when she wasn't romantically committed to Gere yet anyway? I very much think so, and all Altman is doing is 'keeping it real,' and away from audience expectations and cliche, which, naturally makes a lot of people quite annoyed and mad, since their programmed tastes weren't satisfied.

I am a Robert Altman lover myself, but have not been afraid to criticize his films in the past. I'm probably the only one who will say that I hated The Player. I felt it was a rather childish lash out at Hollywood. I also criticized greatly Short Cuts and Brewster McCloud (although I ultimately gave them the thumbs up). But he has made at least one of the best films ever made, Nashville, a masterpiece through and through, and several other very good films, including MASH, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and his previous film, Cookie's Fortune, which I would deem wonderful. Doctor T struck me as also very excellent, and I'm giving it an 8/10, which, in four-star criticism, equals a 3.5/4 stars.First, before I discuss why I liked the film, I must point out its most glaring fault, the one which, I think, must sour the film for most of its viewers. This is the whole Hestia Complex deal to which Dr T's wife, played by Farrah Fawcett, becomes subjected. Obviously a made-up complex, it seemingly insults our intelligence. According to her psychiatrist, it is a complex which crops up when a woman is loved too much. When she has everything she could possibly want. It happens because the mystery of existence no longer exists. Thus, a woman with this complex reverts to a childlike state. This whole complex thing pops up within the film's first act, and, since we don't believe it, we just say, Oh, that's so stupid. That could never happen. And then we just block it out of our minds for the rest of the film. Whenever it crops up again, we just try to ignore it. Fawcett's acting skills make the whole thing seem even more stupid. This is not the right attitude to take. It is not stupid, per se, but what is truthful to say about it is that it is contrived. Contrivances are not a no-no when it comes to art. If you think they are, then you obviously don't remember Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette, among others. You have to just accept the contrivances as much as you can, suspend your disbelief a little. This whole Hestia Complex thing is utterly important for your understanding of Dr. T.Now, onto the rest of the film. Another reason why, it seems to me, people would complain is the lack of a plot, or a conventionaly plot, anyway. These people would have to fully admit that they are completely unfamiliar with Robert Altman. Even if they are not, they still have a semi-legitimate complaint. The film's meaning takes a long, long time to reveal itself. One could easily get lost in the meantime, especially if that person has chosen to disregard the Hestia Complex portion of the film. I still don't see how it's all that different from films like Nashville and Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. Nashville is a very difficult film, and, as Pauline Kael asks in her famous review of it, What does it mean? Actually, I think I myself have figured that out (and I'd be willing to share my views on it upon request). But for several of his other films, I have not. To tell you the truth, that is why I have always been so ambivalent towards Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. I may have liked a lot of both of them, but, when it all comes down to it, I never really saw the point. However, I still enjoyed them. With Dr. T, I believe I did get the point. It's just that it isn't revealed until the film's climax, the wedding scene. By then, I'm sure a lot of viewers have already thrown up their hands. Yes, it is a long time to wait, but you just have to be patient sometimes. Altman is not interested in spoon-feeding us any answers.Okay, so here's my interpretation, so maybe you should skip this paragraph and the next if you want to figure it out for yourself or if you are just so angry that you don't give a care what some other idiot thinks it means it's all about stability, to put it simply, the possession of it and its lack. To be stable may seem like a wonderful thing, but it can also get mighty boring. Dr. T appears to be a near-perfect human being. While it would have been simple to make a stupid comedy about a sexy male gynecologist (see the Saturday Night Live sketch, Mel Gibson World's Sexiest Gynecologist, to see how it could have turned out), this is just not done here. Women crowd to get into his office not because he is sexy, but because he is just so good to them all. He's warm, and he obviously cares for everyone around him, strangers included. The rich-and-unsatisfied wife is a stock character in drama. We don't ever see Dr. T's wife in that characterization, but she was obviously in that position. Dr. T's daughters, Connie and Dee Dee, appear at first to be pretty stable. They're a doctor's daughters and dress very beautifully. Dee Dee is a cheerleader, kind of a dream profession, but she's not very good. She's also about to get married, but she will regrettably have to abandon a more rewarding relationship to do so. To get married is, of course, the American symbol of stability and normalcy. Connie is in bundles, although she constantly asserts to her father, Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Hardly. She is constantly in knots over her sister's foolhearty decision and she obsesses about JFK's assassination (the film takes place in Dallas). To boot, Dr. T's sister, Peggy, has arrived at his home, divorce pending, with her three daughters. Peggy is completely unstable; she can hardly deal with her young daughters and she drinks like a fish. Dr. T also has an assistant, Carolyn, who constantly interrupts personal conversations and rest time with the pretext of anxious patients; the truth is that she is lonely and secretly in love with her boss. Dr. T is being crowded by these and many other women in his life, and, like any doctor, relaxes on the golf course. There, he meets Bree, a woman pro golfer who has decided to relax a little herself. With all of his burdens, Dr. T immediately becomes involved with this source of stability, someone who is confident in her current decisions. All of this may seem like a mess to many, but it shouldn't be if you know a film like Nashville.As Altman likes to do, the climax takes place at a marvelous setpiece, Dee Dee's wedding. It is outside, and it's threatening to storm. A bundle of problems are arising, and, as it begins to pour, chaos ensues. Dr. T's experiences an epiphany stability is overrated. Not everything can be perfect, so it is pointless to exhaust oneself trying to make it so. A similar theme runs through Cast Away of the same year. Dr. T embraces the chaos and jumps into a covertible. As he puts the top up, the wind rips it apart. He laughs and drives off in the rain towards Bree's apartment. He has chosen to convince her to run away with him. She wants no part in it. She is happy where she is, is stable. She knows that she cannot control her life perfectly, but she knows that she must exert some control. Hurt but not destroyed, Dr. T drives away. We don't know where he's going, and I doubt he does either. As he drives, a tornado descends upon him and sucks him away. This part probably angers a lot of viewers also because it is so random and untelegraphed. But I think it works. Fantastically, Dr. T survives the tornado, but has ended up in an isolated area of Mexico. The village nearby is isolated and in need of a doctor to deliver a baby. He does so. He is there to begin a new life. Again, he exists in a state of possible stability as the town doctor, but also there exists the possibility for random events, i.e., the mystery.

Reading the reviews of most of his fellow Americans, I see they have rejected him once again, but Altman, one of the best American living filmmakers, has done it very good one more time. Altman has made spoofs of films genres, institutions, the American way of life; he has made remarkable psychology studies, fantasies, ensemble films, and even movies about the relation between art and society (he must had felt an affinity with Van Gogh).Dr. T & the Women resembles his ensemble films that make jokes of American way of life (as A Wedding and Nashville). But I think it is more related to his recent movies that make fun of professionists and careerists, The Player, Ready To Wear and The Gingerbread Man. First it was filmmakers, after that fashion designers, then lawyers and not it's the gynaecologists' turn.Dr. T & the Women is a trip to the intimacy of a Dallas gynaecologist, surrounded by the chaos that he has made for himself. All the women around him are exterior manifestations of the way he has distorted his profession's mission. The women like him more for his good looks than for his expertise as a gynecologist, though he is a good one. He knows that his fees are way too high, and that they let him have the life he leads, a life that has alienated him from society at large. Altman never shows inner Dallas, but remains at the top, with Dr. T, his family and clients, as an indication that the gynecologist has lost contact with social reality and his profession's objective. This strategy is the opposite to the one in The Gingerbread Man, in which the rich lawyer gets in trouble when he falls for a low-class girl.In his personal life, Dr. T has accepted some traditional values, without asking if there is anything wrong about them. He believes in a maintained wife (who goes nuts tired of being part of his décor), in the continuation of this tradition by his daughters, in practising clean sports (although hunting turkeys for fun is rather criminal), and in trying to trap an assertive and independent woman, proposing her to escape with him, an offer that she logically rejects. Altman tries all these characters with affection and care, in the best Buñuelian tradition.But the turmoil in Dr. T's life grows and lead us to the chaotic no-wedding, when one of his daughters goes left, but above all to an unexpected twister, which made me laugh with excitement. When I first saw it in the background of the frame, I said to myself Is it possible that Altman is going to do that? Is he going to do THAT??!! And HE DID IT! Everything blows away, as in the end of Antonioni's Zabriskie Point. I do not know if scriptwriter Anne Rapp was conscious of her nod to Antonioni, but Altman is no newcomer to this kind of resolution or to fantasy. He is a true post-modern and he has mixed genres, themes and sources, and he has played with fantasy before, as in Brewster McCloud (was Sally Kellerman an angel?), in the science fiction morality tale Quintet and quite obviously in Popeye.After this cathartic moment for Dr. T, the final sequence is at the same time funny and beautiful. Dr. T finds the sense of his profession once again, giving life in the middle of a desert. This is, in my opinion, a wonderful conclusion. One last detail that is material for an essay Altman and water. Water is a symbol of life, of universal consciousness, of purification. It plays a central role in 3 Women, it is constant in The Gingerbread Man, as a permanent threat, and one may add Quintet, which takes place in a land covered with snow. It is also present here, and as in a Hitchcockian film, it fulfills its promise of disaster and redemption, as if being the continuation of Gingerbread. See Dr. T & the Women with the certainty that you are in front of the work of a major American filmmaker.

I hope not because it was extremely slow-paced and of little interest.  This film is no better.  The movie is set in Dallas with Richard Gere as a gynecologist.  He has a wealth of patients due to his looks and appealing bedside manner.  Altman makes great use of the fact that he is a lone man in a woman's world.  Naturally he has a wife and 2 daughters, and a divorced sister-in-law who herself has 3 daughters (no males at all).  He is literally surrounded by women.  However, every woman in this film (with the possible exception of Farrah Fawcett) is extremely annoying.  They keep jabbering away about nothing, fighting provoked by petty jealousies, worrying about minute details related to their clothing, and talking incessantly on their cell phones.  It is extremely aggravating and awfully stereotypical.  Perhaps that was Altman's point?At any rate, nothing happens in the film.  It slows to a crawl in the middle.  Even the presence of a large number of famous blond actresses cannot save this film (Tara Reid, Kate Hudson, Farrah Fawcett, Helen Hunt, Shelley Long, and Laura Dern).

One difference from the template is that often Altman makes all of his characters 100% unlikeable, whereas in this film most people are actually quite nice (at least in isolation); but if anything, a touch more venom would have been welcome in a film about people too rich to have anything real to care about. Yet in spite of this, there's also a faint whiff of misogyny emanating from the film's concept.

T AND THE WOMEN (2000) ** Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett, Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Tara Reid, Kate Hudson, Liv Tyler, Robert Hays, Matt Malloy, Andy Richter, Lee Grant, Janine Turner. (Dir Robert Altman) Robert Altman has had a distinguished career as a filmmaker largely due to his trademark ability to mix many characters into several plot lines with interchangablilty and overlapping conversations to give a reality to the surreality they often encounter (i.e. `M*A*S*H' and `The Player' to name two of his masterpieces).  In his latest attempt at the tradition he comes short but still makes it interesting nevertheless. Gere stars as Dallas gynecologist Dr. Sully Travis, aka Dr. T, whose thriving practice of demanding upper class clientele only supercedes his loving, yet eccentric family, that he has skillfully juggled.  Until now. Seems his daughter Dee Dee (Hudson) and her upcoming  wedding has begun a swirl of events that culminate into ahodgepodge pastiche of a large scale. Not only is the bride's lifestyle in question - it seems her maid of honor Marilyn (Tyler) has been very intimate with her in a past lesbian affair that threatens the stability of the upcoming nuptials - but her jealous sister Connie (Reid) - a tour guide to a conspiracy theory tour of sorts about JFK's assassination - clearly sees the threat as well as the green with envy way of handling things.  On top of that their mother and Dr. T's wife, Kate (Fawcett), has suddenly contacted a pathological breakdown of sorts regressing her into a state of childlike behavior which is explained by her doctor, Dr. Harper (Grant), as being a response to her affluent and much loved surroundings, which apparently she cannot accept.While all this is occurring, Dr. T is also dealing with his tipsy sister Peggy (Dern) and her brood setting up camp in his house and his practice suffering for its abundency of shrilly, self-conscious women.  As a cleanse to his mental pallette enter Bree (Hunt) as a golf pro who has just whisked into town to work at his country club golf course and into his heart all too willingly.   It's no wonder Dr. T hasn't had a complete mental breakdown himself with all the clucking hens in his waiting room, the tug of war with his emotions from his loved ones and the coming to grips that his wife will no longer be the love of his life while a new one has inexplicably altered his being.Gere is the anchor to this annoying and stereotypical comedy that recalls Tennessee Williams' Southern Gothic, but without the charm.  His ability to remain low-key, helpful, trustworthy, likable and level-headed is a miracle in this film that is the absolute antitheses. He deserves a medal for the psychological warfare attacked on his character by the raging harpies and slatternly behavior.   For example, his long-suffering and loyal head assistant nurse and chief of staff Carolyn (Long looking haggard) who secretly wants to be the second Mrs. T feels like a third rate sitcom plot and her unsublte seduction unbeknownst to him is trying in so many ways.The ensemble female cast should also receive kudos for their attempt to breathe freshness to their cardboard roles and in some small misogynistic way avoid the pitfalls lain for them to overcome. Hunt has chemistry to spare with Gere, Fawcett makes her sad role empathetic and Hudson's freshness adds new dimension to her journey to stardom. The screenplay by Anne Rapp manages to shoot itslef in the foot in her treatment of the women as egotistical, nasty and manipulative sirens belies her previous collaboration with Altman in his last film, `Cookie's Fortune', the bucolic comedy of errors that was confectionate sweet and convoluted to boot. It's hard to laugh at the pitable but that appears to be the unacknowledge doings by the filmmakers which is a sad, sad thing.

Lots of sexy fun and a few laughs, right?  Wrong! The characters in this film except Gere's T and Hunt's Bree are cartoon caricatures.  All of the gags stretch our suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  Farrah got to be the new Farrah as we've seen her on late-night talk shows and collect a hefty paycheck for it (I hope).  Her breakdown is a weird scene and not funny.  The hospital or sanitarium where T sticks her is so bizarre, and the head doctor's diagnosis is so ludicrous, that I wondered for a fleeting instant if Gere's character wasn't actually talking to one of the patients who had delusions of being a psychiatrist.  And that was the highpoint of believability.  Laura Dern plays a bossy drunk, and that's basically all her character is--a bossy drunk running everywhere at once trying to organize the planned wedding. Hunt and Gere give typical performances and this is just past Hunt's peak of popularity so the chemistry should work well and it does--for awhile. However, T's willingness to cheat on his wife and throw away his family out of what? boredom? and Bree's general outlook make them unsavory as a couple. Everything spirals out of control.  All the women that the good Dr. works on (and we see more of them than necessary) are crazy about him, even his head nurse/receptionist, played by Shelley Long.  One daughter is in the closet and going through with a sham marriage to an out-of-his-depth nerd who we only see quavering at the altar.  The other has some fantasy about being a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and the situations she gets herself into are utterly ridiculous.  By the end, nothing is recognizable anymore. Some poor, rejected patient with lots of cash and a very fragile ego makes a huge fuss when the doctor refuses to see her and this starts a chain reaction that disrupts T's practice.  His faithful nurse/assistant misinterprets his musings about Bree and begins to work up the courage to begin an affair with him, only to discover that she's mistaken.  His wife is so warped by her treatment that she introduces him to her therapy group as her brother. The final indignity is the long-promised wedding in which all of these threads are jumbled together to form the unruliest knot of plots seen in probably a decade.  The bride-to-be comes out of the closet and runs off with her maid of honor.  The assistant quits to--what?  Open a bakery? Mrs. T serves her husband with divorce papers.  And a tornado brews from nowhere to strike the outdoor wedding and reception to scatter all the guests.  In response, Dr. T gets into his beautiful convertible with the top down and drives through the storm on the newly christened Jayne Mansfield highway (which he earlier helped name) and drives straight into the tornado. Instead of killing him, the tornado sucks up his car in central Texas and plops it down hundreds of miles away in a native American village across the Mexican border--(somewhere near New Mexico if he'd landed in the US).

Shelley Long is his assistant who has a little crush on him. His daughters are Connie (Tara Reid) and Dee Dee (Kate Hudson). Dee Dee is about to marry a guy although she is a lesbian and her girlfriend Marilyn (Liv Tyler) will be her maid of honor. Connie is the only other person who knows the truth. Farrah Fawcett is Dr. T's wife Kate but she has gone insane and thinks she is a child again. Her sister is called Peggy (Laura Dern) and has recently moved in with Dr. T together with her three young kids. She is beginning to be an alcoholic. While his wife is in the asylum he falls in love with Bree (Helen Hunt).Basically this is Robert Altman's 'Dr. T & the Women', a movie with nice characters but a story that I did not like at all. There are some funny touches, especially with Kate Hudson and Shelley Long. The Fawcett moments when she is sick can be considered funny although I didn't think they were.Since this is an Altman movie you can expect a lot of different characters with a lot of different story lines. They all come together with Dr. T and Richard Gere finds the perfect touch for this character. I think I liked the movie because of the characters in it. Dr. T, who really cares for the women on his table, and the women around him all have something that gives us a reason to like them.Every character is well cast. Not only Gere but Hunt, Fawcett, Dern, Reid, Hudson and Tyler give fine performances. I liked Tara Reid the most here, may be because her role is more an adult one than in other movies she did ('American Pie', 'Van Wilder'). In the end I liked the characters enough to like the movie. The ending is not the best part, but I can understand why it is there. There is a chance you will not like this movie at all. On the same time there is a very good chance you will adore the movie or at least one of its characters.

Gere is no where near of a father of two daughters, nor is he very convincing as a gynaecologist. I guess, he had no idea at all what he was doing in this movie. I watched the Extras chapter on DVD and it's interesting what our Buddhistic friend reveals. According to Gere, Dr. T is a typical Republican - he visits country clubs, plays golf, and, is an extremely straight person. Funny, because Gere's part is in fact quite different. In spite of the female hectic in his daily life he remains a patient and friendly man that keeps the necessary distance to all this in attempt not to get knocked over by it (yes, quite a remote and peace loving attitude that reminds one of Buddhism, I'd say). He doesn't judge, just observes and tries to deal with a crazy world without a specific need to change it. To me, he comes closer to the gentleness of a soft and liberal Democrate. Fawcett, supposedly suffering from the Hestia-complex, looks completely ridiculous. Hunt's part is not properly finished; she never tells us or Gere what is on her mind and what her mysterious trip (well, it is at the least suggested that there was something mysterious about it) to New Orleans was about. The worst of it all is that the old master steals the - almost surreal - end of Magnolia, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who, I believe, is a great admirer of Altman! Shame on you, Mr. Altman. Altman simply replaces the frogs by a tornado. Gere is vortexed into the desert where he is finally confronted with a male a newborn Mexican baby. How should we understand this move? I have no idea. Anything goes. Altman shows the key but forgets the lock. I could go on mentioning other flaws, but I don't. For those who haven't seen other work of Altman forget about this one and try another.

The merit of the film is to show how a wealthy family may be really unhappy, and this is the case of the gynecologist, whose family and himself did not have any money problem but were all unsatisfied. The doctor came to know that one of his daughters is lesbian, and took the news with the necessary realism. Good message!. One unclear aspect of the film was the reasons for the doctor's wife (F.

All of which, on an individual basis, illustrates what the great philosopher once referred to as the Human Comedy, and which `Dr. T and the Women,' directed by Robert Altman, demonstrates cinematically with more than a touch of irony and some insight into human nature.  And, as often happens with a film of this type, it was mistakenly promoted as a comedy, which ultimately may have had a negative impact on the way it was initially received by the public at large.  It is amusing to be sure, and downright funny at times, but only in the way that life is in general, even in the wake of tragedy; hence the saying, `That's life.'	The story centers on Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere), a gynecologist with a wife, two daughters and a successful practice, who is well liked and admired by his patients.  And he should be; he's good looking and charismatic, but most importantly, he's a good doctor.  But his personal life is quickly becoming something of a shambles.  His eldest daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), is about to be married, his youngest, Connie (Tara Reid), is a conspiracy theory activist and his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), to whom he is devoted, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  He makes a valiant attempt at holding it all together and trying to please everyone, but as always happens in a situation like this, eventually something has to give.  And when it does, it leaves the good doctor at loose ends and forces him to take stock of his life and what it all means, if anything.	The first fifteen minutes or so of this movie is so hectic it is nerve-shattering and guaranteed to increase adrenaline levels, and your first reaction may be to scream `Enough already!' as the agitation and anxiety that fills the waiting room of Dr. T's office threatens to explode off the chart.  But discomfiting as it may be at the moment, it really puts you in the story, and in the final analysis it's a good piece of filmmaking by Altman, because it's the turmoil of the waiting room that becomes the manifestation of Dr. T's inner state of confusion and enables you to relate to him, which in turn gives a vital and necessary perspective to the film.	The performances are solid, though only a couple stand out as especially noteworthy.  Gere is believable as the doctor (quite unlike Tom Cruise in `Eyes Wide Shut,' who came across as an actor playing a doctor), and maintains the reality of the character by avoiding any superfluous dramatics; he plays him as a man who is what he is and nothing more.  Helen Hunt is good, as always, playing somewhat against type as Bree Davis, a fairly self-absorbed golf pro with rather ambiguous morals, who is willing to give only if what she receives in turn is satisfying to her (Bree is a character of whom Ayn Rand would be proud).  And Farrah Fawcett does a nice job as Kate, but lacks the screen time necessary to really develop her character; the perspective you get of her is established mainly through Dr. T and some of the other characters as they speak of her.	Hudson, Reid and Liv Tyler (Marilyn) are all credible in their respective characters, but there is certainly nothing endearing about any of them.  Not that they are unlikable, but because of the way that Altman presents his characters, these are people about whom it is easy to adopt an ambivalent attitude.  The same can be said of Laura Dern, in a somewhat forgettable supporting role as Peggy.  And one can only suspect that this was done intentionally, as it allows Altman to keep the focus of the film on Dr. T.																															As Carolyn, the woman who runs Dr. T's office, Shelley Long gives one the most memorable performance of the film.  As something of an integral, yet peripheral part of Dr. T's life, she is charming and funny-- not to mention agreeably attractive-- and adds some real spunk to the film.  And Janine Turner, as Dorothy, is also impressive as one of Dr. T's patients.  These are the two characters, in fact, who really bring this film to life. 	Of all of the actors in the film, the usually dependable Lee Grant is the only one who gives a somewhat disappointing performance.  In a brief appearance as Dr. Harper, her delivery is too stagy and overblown; in a scene in which she is having a conversation with Dr. T, for example, rather than coming across as a real person having a real discussion with another, she looks like an actor playing a part.  It's a performance that may have worked in live theater, but for the intimacy of film it was too much (Olympia Dukakis had the same problem in `Steel Magnolias).	Rounding out the supporting cast are Robert Hays (Harlan), Matt Malloy (Bill) and Andy Richter (Eli).  Altman has a rather stoic, almost aloof way of telling a story, which makes `Dr. T and the Women' difficult to embrace emotionally, but it is a good story, and the subtlety of the presentation may invite a reflective moment or two.  If you want comedy, look elsewhere; but for an interesting-- though somewhat quirky-- drama, this may fit the bill.  I rate this one 6/10.       	  	 	   "},{"Title":"What is a Man? Dr. T.--broken and sorry...","Date":"16 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Sometimes i think i could have passed on this movie. I thought it  would be another of the long line of movies Robert Altman has made that satirizes the heck out of a place, period or mode of culture that finally led to nowhere. I should give credit to Altman because he fooled me. This movie is not a pointless satire, although it does wander occasionally, but only briefly and with good reason. Altman could have packaged this movie to great success by underlining its similarities to such movies as Fight Club and American Beauty which follow basically the same theme a beleagured man fighting for his own survival in a hostile world. DR.T, of course,does not have the same charge and immediacy of an American Beauty or the violent indignation of Fight club, but in its own light hearted, amusing treatment of Dallas high society it offers a very serious look into the travails of lovable Doctor Travis.Such as the scene toward the end of the movie when Gere comes into Bree's home, with a boyish glee on his face, and a crazy notion in his head run away with me! He has just discovered that his wife Kate, played by Farrah Fawcett, has regressed into a childish state of mind and that he has forgotten how to be a good father to both of her daughters. So he once again assumes a prince charming pose and proposes to the Hunt character in all earnestness. It was a great pain to me when her response came cold and clear. Why would i do that? After all, she has a perfectly secure career and flings every now and then. Why would he think that she would risk it all for him? Here is a woman who shows a degree of cruelty that were only reserved to men in a previous era. This led me thinking if love was dead. If all is lost in our decadent era if two people cannot love each other, but only use and be used in return. Altman makes a movie of great poise and brilliance.

I mean, look at the list of established stars!  Dr T (Richard Gere)is surrounded by women, his patients, his daughters, his crazy wife (Farah Fawcett), his new golf pro (Helen Hunt). He truly loves all women, respects them, is one of the finest persons you could meet.  In the end, after being lifted by a tornado and deposited in a Mexican desert, and delivering a baby, a boy, he finally breaks out of this woman's world and gets on the road to self-realization.Of course, without watching the DVD extras and commentary I probably would not have easily come to this realization, because the film was not put together very well.  It didn't connect.  The storyline was a bit vague. The histrionics of the various women became a bit tiring. The lesbian affair between his daughter (Kate Hudson) and old friend (Liv Tyler) which ended up canceling the wedding.  The fling with the new golf pro who turns out to be comfortable with several meaningless relationships at the same time. The constant cell-phone conversations between the two daughters and the aunt (Laura Dern).  The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader rehearsals. The daughter giving Dallas tours and commenting on the Kennedy shooting.The actual live birth which occurs in the last scene is a bit ground-breaking, but didn't seem to fit with the surreal tornado scene, and the over-the-top script through most of the film.  A good idea, half-ass executed, yields a mess of a film, both my wife and I said mostly a waste of our time.  Too bad -- we really like all the actors.

Richard Gere gives a compassionate performance with what he can work with at least, redeeming himself from some of his lessor work (i.e. Runaway Bride, other films). Certain scenes are rather remarkable- particularly not just the 'breakdown' from Farrah Fawcett in the mall but her whole performance and appeal in the film- while others just aren't. It's like a cluttered bad of tricks and femininity that may appeal more to others, or not at all. Laughs come in small doses from observations from the gynecologists world, but overall, it's a tad bleak, and overall not as successful as Altman's better times in his 'one long movie' of his long career. "}{"Title":"21st Century Altman.","Date":"13 October 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"     It's hard to believe that twenty-five years ago Robert Altman's classi NASHVILLE was released, and it's even harder to believe that thirty years ago, M*A*S*H* Altman's most popular film was released.  Now as we enter into the 21st Century, Director Robert Altman returns this time in DR. T & THE WOMEN. Instead of this film being set in Korea, Nashville, Hollywood, San Fernando Valley, and even Sweethaven; DR. T is set in the wealthy class life of Dallas, Texas.     Richard Gere plays Dr. Sullivan Travis, a popular Dallas gynecologist who is either wanted or desired.  His daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) is about to get married, while his other daughter Connie (Tara Reid) is paranoid and skeptic on her sister's upcoming marriage.  While Dr. T's wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett) is a mentally ill wife who is sent to a asylum after running around naked in a water fountain at a shopping mall. Kate's sister, Peggy (Laura Dern) a alcoholic is going through a divorce and moves in with her sister's family, and brings along her three little girls.  While some of the people at Dr. T's office want him sexually. They include one of his regular patients Dorothy (Jenine Turner) who keeps visiting the doctor, although there is nothing wrong with her, and seduces him after the examination.  And there's also Dr. T's secretary Carolyn (Shelly Long) who keeps flirting with Dr. T, if she isn't taming the crowded waiting room full of patients.  The life of Dr. T is miserable and depressing, but it's a pro golfer named Bree (Helen Hunt) who helps Dr. T rediscovers the fruits of life.  That life doesn't consist of money, wealth, and sex.  But that life is fun, and that a good loving relationship has communication just as much as sex.      Like all of Altman's other films, DR. T isn't much on plot, it concentrates more on character's personality more than anything else.  And DR. T, is another Altman film that is rich in character's and not much on plot.  But also like Altman's other films, Dr. T, does have symbolism throughout the film that most film viewers wouldn't understand.     However, I am a Altman fan, and I did enjoy DR. T, but it isn't a classic like M*A*S*H*, NASHVILLE, and SHORT CUTS.  DR. T does have great acting, great characters, great dialogue, and great camera and editing scenes (including the opening scene at the waiting room, Altman pulls off another THE PLAYER opening continuous shot).  But unlike NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS which are both around three hours, DR. T's pacing is a bit slower, and it's a hour shorter than those films.    The acting in this film is obviously good (Altman is a actor's director, he favors ad libbing).  Richard Gere is at one of his better roles as the stressed out doctor who finds sanctuary at the golf course with Bree.  Helen Hunt is also enjoyable as the different and more humane Bree, the only woman in the film who isn't selfish, stuck-up, and doesn't have a Texan accent.  Both Tara Reid and Kate Hudson are good as the spoiled daughters who have two different personalities.  Reid seeing almost everything a conspiracy, and Hudson a girl who is seeking true happiness.  Laura Dern is funny as the ditzy sister-in-law who drinks as much as she can whenever she can.  Dern's character reminded me of the Jane Curtin character in Altman's other film O.C. STIGGS.  And Shelly Long also provides laughs as the love stricken secretary of Dr. T, who is too afraid to admit her true feelings towards him.      But like I said, this is another Altman film, it's a character film.  If you want to see a film rich in plot, then see THE CONTENDER and ALMOST FAMOUS.  But a film with rich characters and personalities, then Dr. T, is the film.  I did enjoy the artistic and visionary style of Altman in this film.  I was however disappointed in it's pacing.  And this is a film that has quite a bit of nudity.  At times I was surprised that this film got a 'R' rating.  And similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 classic BOOGIE NIGHTS, the final scene in DR. T, is quite shocking to see.  But the nudity is quite strong in this film, that author Craig Hosoda who writes the popular book The Bare Facts will be busy putting more entries in because of this film.  I did enjoy DR. T, and if you're a Robert Altman fan, you will too.  As for those expecting another PRETTY WOMAN or RUNAWAY BRIDE; or if you're a non-Altman fan, you're better off watching something else.  **** (out of five) "},{"Title":"Almost as bad as mass murder","Date":"1 August 2010","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" If you showed this movie to the survivors of the Rwandan genocide and asked them which was worse, seeing their families hacked to death with machetes or watching Dr. T and the Women&#x85;only some of them would choose the machetes.Dr. T (Richard Gere) is a gynecologist in Dallas, Texas. He has a wife (Farrah Fawcett) who's gone crazy, a daughter (Kate Hudson) who's getting married, another daughter (Tara Reid) who is half plot-device and half lame joke about the Kennedy assassination, a sister-in-law (Laura Dern)who is a lush and a horde of yapping women who jam his waiting room like it's an overstuffed hothouse of demanding Southern Belles. Though he's drowning in a stormy sea of estrogen, Dr. T is an insanely, sickeningly perfect man who is totally understanding of all of the crazy feminine behavior that buffets him every day. His only respite from it all are hunting trips with his buddies and an affair with the new golf pro at his country club, Bree (Helen Hunt).Like many Robert Altman films, the plot of this movie just sort of slowly spreads out in all directions like vomit on a bare floor. There's also enough trademarked Altman-babble in this thing to choke even his most devoted fans. Dr. T and the Woman is morally confused, emotionally phony, head-slappingly contrived and has an ending so stupid and bizarre that it would take an entire team of mental health professionals to figure out what the hell Altman was thinking. If there was ever a film that could be introduced at a competency hearing as evidence of senile dementia, it's this one.In fairness, most of the acting here is very mannered but relatively okay. The best performance actually comes from Shelley Long as Dr. T's long-suffering head nurse. She's funny and lively and the most enjoyable person on screen, until her character is brutally sacrificed on the altar of Altman's barnacle encrusted sense of humor. Helen Hunt might have been just as good as the independent Bree, but after creating the character it's really damn clear Altman didn't have the slightest idea what to do with her.If you're still not clear on how awesomely bad Dr. T and the Women is, Helen Hunt gets briefly but clearly naked in it and it's still unwatchable. That's right. It makes naked Helen Hunt unappealing. That's a magical feat on the order of turning lead into gold, which would make Robert Altman the master alchemist of cinematic suck.Now, if some Altman fans happen to stumble upon this review, I can already hear their excuses about how his films aren't meant to be conventionally entertaining and you have to appreciate his creative vision and I just don't get it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The fact that several decades ago he injected some juice into American movies should not give Altman a get-out-of-jail-free card for the rest of his career. The fact that he keeps recycling the same old bag of tricks is not creative vision. It's a guy who doesn't have anything new to say as a storyteller.This movie is terrible. Even if you've liked some of Altman's other work, do not watch it.

Dr. T and the Women is by far Altmans worst. I never thought he could get any worse than he did twenty years ago with Popeye, but of course he did. The plot sort of works as bad satire up until the final act in which point we run into a tornado and everything goes badly wrong for the plot and farther into implausibility than Altman or pretty much anybody has gone before. The performances arn't bad, particularly Laura Dern is good as the annoying depressed alcoholic sister in law, Richard Gere is also decent in the lead as are Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler as Geres daughter and her secret lesbian lover.
