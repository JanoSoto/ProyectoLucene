[{"Title":"Nothing short of miraculous.","Date":"10 May 2005","Score":"53 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Smoke Signals is a somewhat misunderstood film. The setting on an Indian reservation leads viewers to believe that Smoke Signals is about Indian issues or Indian philosophy. To be sure, the presence of Indian values and culture make this movie decidedly more enjoyable, but the movie is more transcendent, more universal than a purely Indian film. And, while this was heralded as the first movie to be written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans, there is something here for everyone, regardless of ethnicity.More than anything else, this movie appealed to me as a writer. Taken from Sherman Alexie's brilliant collection The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven. it is beautifully written and expertly crafted from beginning to end. The first scene, narrated lyrically by Evan Adams as Thomas Builds-the-fire, sets the tone for a story handed down, as with Native American culture, in true oral tradition.The French title, Le secret des cendres (The secret of the ashes) more accurately describes the book and the movie, both of which must be experienced to fully appreciate Alexie's genius. With multiple allusions to fire and ash, each having different meanings, as well as a well integrated use of Native American lore, Smoke Signals requires more than a little thought for the average American viewer.The story revolves around two young Coeur d' Alene Indian men dealing with loss and the end of childhood innocence. The two men cope with loss in very different ways; Thomas though mysticism and legend, Victor through stoicism and denial. When Victor Joseph, brilliantly played by Adam Beach, learns that his estranged father has died, he and Thomas embark on a journey to claim the ashes, another allusion of the french title, and on the way get in touch with their identities as adults apart from their parents.Evan Adams is stupendous as Thomas Builds-the-fire. His storytelling scenes are pure magic. By imbuing simple memories with mystical reverence, he elevates them, and thus both himself and his listeners, to a new spiritual level. His exaltation of the ordinary is the core of this delightful work of genius. It culminates with a reading, slightly modified, of Dick Lourie's poem Forgiving Our Fathers. Lourie, who is a self-described unreconstructed beatnik poet, brings a fragile and elegant beauty to the film's emotional climax. The final scenes, driven by Adams' narration and haunting Native American chant and music, are nothing short of miraculous.Adam Beach, strapping and stalwart as Victor Joseph, managed to parlay his appearance in Smoke Signals into a respectable film career. Evan Adams, diminutive and shy as Thomas Builds-the-fire, was not so lucky despite his masterful performance. Perhaps Admas' aspirations ran along different lines, as these days, even after starring in what is basically a sequel (The Business of Fancydancing, also by Alexie) Adams can now be called Dr. Adams, as he has become a respected and accomplished physician in British Columbia. The supporting cast was equally magnificent, and each lends credibility and energy to the movie. An interesting sidenote is that Irene Bedard, who appears as Suzy Song, was the physical model for Pocahontas in the Disney animated feature. I have seen this movie many times, and will undoubtedly watch it many more. Each time I am left in silent awe as I reflect on my own life, family, and philosophies.

The ones that shoot their arrows, wear feathers on their heads, and yell as they chase the heroes down. Finally, after 100 years of movies, we get a film that honestly portrays the Native American culture.Â  And man, it sure is refreshing.The story opens on the Fourth of July, 1976 in a small Idaho Indian reservation. A small infant named Thomas Builds-the-Fire is thrown out of the window of a burning house and is caught by Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), a neighbor with a drinking problem, who is later kicked out of the house by his wife, leaving behind his son, Victor (Adam Beach). Arnold eventually settles down in Phoenix and his family never hears from him again.20 years later, a phone call comes. It's from a woman in Phoenix, she says that Arnold is dead. Victor, who had developed a resentment towards his father over the years, decides that he should travel to Phoenix to pick up his ashes. Unfortunately, he has no money to get there... but Thomas does and offers to pay if he can come along with Victor. This is a tough decision for Victor since he never really liked Thomas, but he finally agrees and the two set off on their journey.It's during their journey that we learn about the characters, Victor and Thomas' conversations reveal their attitudes towards Americans their views of Native Americans. In one scene, Victor accuses Thomas of learning everything about being an Indian from watching Dances With Wolves. In another funny sequence, the two begin talking about cowboys and end up singing a tune about John Wayne's teeth! Victor's resentment for his father is also revealed to us through flashbacks depicting the early years and the memories (some good, some bad) that the two shared.They do eventually arrive in Phoenix and find the woman that called with the news of Arnold's death. Victor talks with her during the night and finds out how much his dad cared for him and how he never wanted to leave the reservation in the first place. The events that follow drastically alter Victor's perceptions of his father forever.Smoke Signals is a great film and one that can teach you a lot about a culture so often misrepresented on the screen. There is a feeling of ease and casualness in the conversations between Victor and Thomas... slowly they reveal more and more of themselves to us, in a way that is so nonchalant that we understand their feelings it without even noticing it. Smoke Signals is well worth your time and offers a refreshing alternative to the big budget, special effects driven crap this summer.

Instead they look to the lighter side of  history with references to Columbus and Gen. Custer.      The story is simple.  Two young men, Victor and Thomas, embark on a trip  to Phoenix to retrieve the ashes of Victor's father.  Victor is angry at  his father for leaving his family and angry with himself for the grudge  that he carries.  Through the help of Thomas and his father's final friend  Suzy, Victor is able to find resolution and peace.

I don't want to ruin a movie that I enjoyed so thoroughly by loving the book more.  In any case, I think that this film is largely misunderstood.  Non-Indian people tend to look at this film as a coming of age story about finding Victor finding not only his father, but himself as well.  Yes, that's there, but there is so much more. For example the very real and very sad quality of life on the rez.  The ones who are fortunate enough to have a car don't care if it drives in reverse only.  The kids watch their parents drinking, and often grow up to drink with them.  Alcoholism is a very real disease that affects everyone associated with an alcoholic...and it runs rampant throughout many reservations.  Imagine knowing that once you had so much, and now are only allotted a certain patch of a certain number of acres; imagine knowing that more than half of your history was oral tradition and people made you stop speaking your native language.  Imagine the elders watching the children grow up to try to be white and fail, and imagine them watching their history slip away with every word or nuance forgotten.  Imagine the desperation of a people as a whole and individually to have so much and really have nothing at all.  That, I believe, is the underlying theme in Smoke Signals.  The title alone is a cryptic message from Alexie smoke signals were used to communicate across open plains, plains now destroyed and whithered as though a fire raged across them, which it did in the form of the white man. Victor's father died in a fire, perhaps sending his spirit up in the form of a smoke signal to his gods.  And Thomas' narration at the beginning is about children born of fire and ash.  Watch this movie again and again, and see how so many suffer...

We can learn about customs of various groups through them, as well as learn a lot about ourselves, as human beings.

It's setting is the Coeur d' Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho where the K.R.E.Z. disc jockey(Broadcasting live from his trailer) proclaims the morning 'a great day to be indigenous'. The film's focal character, Victor(Adam Beach) is a closed-off youth with indiscernible ambition. He languishes around the expansive grounds dwelling over the absence of his father and a perceived lack of opportunity. Smoke Signals details the strange dynamics of Victor's friendship with childhood pal Thomas Builds-a-Fire(Evan Adams) who frequently regales the locals with his practiced storytelling skills. Victor is stoic and athletic, with an affected warrior look. Thomas is unnervingly talkative with a smiling naivete and a decidedly bookish appearance.(Thomas also serves as the film's narrator) Novelist Sherman Alexie wrote the script. It is based on stories from his book The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. He uses a casually irreverent humor to help tell his tale of personal and national identity. In a brief scene with his mother, Victor kids- 'What do you want a contract? You know how Indians feel about signing paper'. And later Thomas recounts how Victor's dad almost spent time for protesting the vietnam war only to have the charge plea-bargained to 'being an Indian in the twentieth century.' The movie's interesting cultural details(Fry bread, the significance of long hair, etc.) and salient dialogue accentuate it's themes of truth, self-acceptance, and the capacity to forgive. The cinematic structure is equally impressive. Director Chris Eyre employs several unsuspecting flashbacks to reveal the film's central secret. Victor and Thomas's present journey for answers alternates seamlessly with the lyrical recollections of the past. (Possible spoiler) In the end, the determined Thomas helps his friend come to terms with his father, his ancestry, and his exclusive place in life. The understanding Victor gains enables him to liberate the persistent bitterness and disappointment from his world. Smoke Signals deserves a look for those who missed it's theatrical run. It presents viewers with a caring and poignant glimpse into life on a reservation and the unique perspective of today's Native Americans.

What predominately spoke to me was how Thomas seemed to incorporate Christianity into his storytelling.  I'm happy that Eyre and Alexie were not afraid to portray a character in this film as Christian.  With all the current information, it seems there are no Christian Native Americans.Perhaps the format of this film is overdone, the buddy road-trip, but this film is a beginning toward understanding between two cultures that share a common land.

Too often, filmmakers rely on half truths, fabrications and demeaning stereotypes to portray the Native American on screen. In the golden age of Hollywood, actors such as Clint Eastwood and John Wayne were made into prolific, American figures, while Native Americans were made out to be savage and bloodthirsty enemies. This is a trend that has carried over from the past and into the present and is truly disappointing. Thankfully, Chris Eyre and Sherman Alexie's Smoke Signals reverses this trend and creates a heartwarming and engaging tale about two modern Native Americans and their unique struggle with personal demons, conformity and the constant, overbearing, white culture that dominates them. The film is amongst the most notable Native American productions and of the most successful. The productions is also amongst the few films to be fully written, directed and produced exclusively by Native Americans.The Film, based on a collection of loosely related short stories written by Alexie entitled The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven, centers around Thomas Builds-the-fire and Victor Joseph. Both characters are members of the Coer D'Alene tribe and reside on the tribe's reservation in central Idaho, though the characters are marginally different. These differences both inhibit and enhance the journey they must share. When Victor, the more aggressive, athletic and conflicted of the pair, must travel to Arizona to retrieve the ashes of his estranged and deceased father, he must rely on Thomas for both unwanted support and extra money to supply funds for the trip. While on their journey, Thomas acts as narrator, both adding to scenes and fabricating stories about both his and Victor's pasts.The film relies heavily on a specific type of humor to drive the plot. The humor is almost exclusively Native American in its dry and sarcastic tone. The humor is offset by the shocking reality of the situation faced by the two main characters. Located in Idaho, the reservation is isolated from the rest of the world. This is illustrated in the opening scene as the reservation's radio station, K-REZ, reports on local happenings and non-existent traffic conditions. As it is seen, both characters rarely leave the reservation and it is apparent that contemporary, predominantly white American culture is almost completely foreign to them. What average American citizens see as day to day society is both strange and new.The film, although humorous, tackles many issues faced by modern Native Americans. The issue of identity is of the most prominent. Victor is in constant conflict with who he actually is and where he has come from. He is aware that he holds a certain amount of aggression toward his father, but he does not understand this aggression until the very end, and it is at the point where he understands why his father ran away that he can accept his father's mistakes and celebrate his spirit. This is also the point where the idea of running from problems is also resolved. Running from problems is a constant in the plot. Arnold Joseph, Victor's father, is in constant guilt after being responsible for the fire that kills Thomas's parents. Although he saves Thomas from the fire he must live with the guilt until it becomes too much for him to handle. At the movie's climax, rather than running away, Victor literally runs toward the issue at hand and ends up saving the victim of a drunk driving crash. Additionally, alcoholism, a problem which faces both Native and Non Native Americans, is constantly examined. It is the reason why Arnold Joseph burns down the Builds-the-fire home and the reason why he leaves his own home. At first Victor is unwilling to accept his father's change after death. However, after coming to his father's home and seeing that his father still did care, even after leaving, he is able to come to terms with his father's struggle as both an Alcoholic and a Native person in American society. Victor leaves Arizona with a new understanding of his identity, a new found appreciation for his friend, Thomas, and the ability to face problems head on without inner struggle or violence.The identity of the Native American is studied deeply in Smoke Signals. Alexie's unique style creates a story that is one of a kind and completely different from the average American conception of Native life. Although it is entertaining and down right hysterical in some parts, the story evokes an important messages about inner struggle, understanding the family dynamic, addiction and acquiring the ability to cope in a less than acceptable setting.

You absolutely must dare to see this movie, even if you normally avoid dramas. I have written IMDb reviews for about 100 films now and don't believe I've said that yet. It's highly original, and emotionally moving without becoming melodramatic.It is a film about the Native American Indian culture in modern times. It was fast-paced enough to engage me, despite being a drama, and there is plenty of comedy, which is a refreshing change for a guy like me who's always wanted to see past the one-dimensional Indian stereotype of suffering and learn more of their culture.But there's plenty of pain and suffering in the film, too, and I got to learn something about the plight of the Indians without sensing a hot-headed we-good-you-bad attitude.

When I started watching this film, and from what I had read from the back of the movie box, it seemed like it was going to mostly be a film about the unlikely friendship between two people, about how two very different individuals can share many things in common.  As I continued watching the film, more themes creeped in, such as the nature of oral tradition and exaggeration/lying within it, what it means to be a Native American in the middle of the nation that oppressed your people, and the nature of fatherhood and forgiveness.The film ends up addressing or at least giving us something interesting to think about for all of these issues, but it just seemed like too many themes to address in 90 minutes.  It seems as though the last issue I mentioned (fatherhood/forgiveness) ends up being the most prevalent one, but it seemed like it was touched on so mildly that I didn't quite understand its resolution beyond a very basic, generic level.By far the most valuable thing about the film, for me, was its depiction and perspective of modern Native American life and culture.  It adds a great deal of insight, humor, and uniqueness to the film, particularly considering the fact that this was the first major film entirely written, directed, co-produced and starring Native Americans.  In fact, I really think the film would've been a lot more interesting if it were just about the two characters going out into America to perform some inconsequential errand, and building a friendship along the way, learning from one another's perspectives on Native American life and culture.  As it is, the whole fatherhood element really adds a lot of extra baggage to the film that didn't seem to fit well into its 90 minutes of storytelling.Much of my dissatisfaction for the film, however, could be attributed to the fact that I had very different expectations for the film when I started watching it.  Because the movie deals with so many themes, I think it's worth at least a second viewing so that one can take it all in.  Regardless of its perceived flaws, although it's not an entirely coherent film to me, it still offered a very insightful perspective to Native American life and culture, and it was very enjoyable to watch.

The loudest laugh is a silence shared across a table after a knock.Obviously I'm dangerously bonkers from a narcotic obsession with this film's encapsulation of the Way of all paths.

His response is nobody. They think he is kidding; they hope he would at least say his father is his favorite Indian. After asking him a couple more times he yells NOBODY! When he grows up he feels that no one can be trusted and carries the hopelessness and bitterness of a displaced people. This film ultimately becomes a journey film where two Native Americans try to overcome generations of displacement by placing their hope in a better tomorrow.Themes and Images Fire and Ash. The film opens and closes with fire and ash. Thomas, Victor's nerdy friend, says they were both born from fire and ash. I feel the need to re-watch this film with more understanding of the four elements because I do not think that I have fully grasped the symbolism of fire and ash in this film. The fire and the ash imagery represents their heritage but in a very real sense it also represents Victor's Father, Arnold. It is Arnold who burned the house down to ash. He hit Victor at times but one time he saved Thomas from a fire which gave them different ideas about Arnold and subsequently their heritage. They are also headed on this journey to retrieve Joseph's ashes.The Road. The how long will it take till we get there scene encapsulated the Native American plight. Thomas appeared to be rambling but he actually gave us a spark notes version of Native American history and ended it with Arnold. Great scene! Director Chris Eyre uses the road movie genre magnificently. The Road movie only requires one goal and permits poetic scenes like this to symbolize a generation at a crossroads.Phoenix. Their journey ends at Phoenix, Arizona. Due to the fire and ash imagery, I cannot help but think that this film also alludes to the mythical Phoenix bird as they come to retrieve Joseph's ashes. The myth originates from Egypt and tells about how an eagle like bird burns into ash and is reborn every 500 years or so&#x85; The Phoenix crest shows a bird surrounded by fire but unharmed. The Phoenix woman matches this image when she sets Joseph's place on fire; she's surrounded by flames but unharmed. This cross cuts with Victor on the bridge; out of Joseph's ashes Victor is reborn.Forgiveness When Victor throws the ashes off the bridge and into the river, he not only lets out a primal scream but he also lets out all the bitterness and hopelessness he carried with him since he was a child. The last line of the movie is Thomas asking if we forgive our fathers, what is left? Like the road scene, Thomas poetically asks a general question about forgiving the atrocities perpetrated on the Native Americans by past generations. If you put the questions together they sound even more poetic if we forgive our fathers, what is left&#x85; how long&#x85; till we get there? http//parablestoday.blogspot.com/2010/01/smoke-signals.html "},{"Title":"Smoke Signals Film Review","Date":"8 February 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" For years, thousands of the movies that produced by Western filmmakers presented Native Americans in a stereotypical way. They showed them a as warriors who are in a constant conflict with white people. These movies depicted Native Americans as savages, murderous defectors, and robbers. In general, these stereotypical movies showed the Native Americans in bad images, and the whites are always heroes. Yet, in 1998, a movie called Smoke Signals changed the style of Native Americans movies. It showed Native Americans in a more realistic way. The secret behind this movie is its cast. In fact, Smoke Signals written, directed, acted, and co-produced by Native Americans. The writer of this movie is Sherman Alexie who grew up on an Indian reservation in Washington. Unlike the writer a white family in Oregon adopted the director of this movie who is Chris Eyre. The actors of Smoke Signals include Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Gary Farmer, Tantoo Cardinal, and others. Comedy and Drama are the main genres of this movie.The story of Smoke Signals is about two young Indians men grew up together on an Indian reservation in Idaho which is Coeur d'Alene. Although they grew up together, they have totally different personalities. Victor (Adam Beach) who is a son of an alcohol addicted father (Gary Farmer). His father vanished from the reservation to live in a trailer near Phoenix while he was a little boy. Actually, Victor has a tough personality. However, Thomas (Evan Adams) is the other Indian young man who lost his parents in a fire that caught their home on the 4th of July 1976 while he was a baby. In Fact, Victor's father saved Thomas from the fire. Thomas has a very kind personality, and he always annoys Victor by telling stories about the live on reservation and about Victor's father. After about ten years from the day that victor's father vanished, Victor heard that his father died in his trailer in Arizona. He wanted to travel to Phoenix to bring his father's ashes back, but he did not have enough money for this trip. His friend Thomas decided to help him with the money, but in return he wanted to join the trip to Phoenix. After Victor accepted Thomas' offer, they started their trip to Phoenix that was full of surprising events.There is no doubt that Chris Eyre was very successful in directing this movie. He was able to present the story by adding the sense of humor. The movie contains many funny scenes that convey messages. For instance, the scene that showed the two ladies who were in the car, that moves backward, asking Victor and Thomas if they got their passports to enter the states. Actually, this scene makes the viewer laugh. At the same time, it conveys how Native Americans feel about their reservations as an isolated part form the country. In addition, Evan Adams was amazing in his performance. The character of Thomas adds an important value to the movie, and helped in placing the sense of humor. Thomas' appearance and cloths were very funny especially his over-sized glasses. Beside his appearance, his accent played important role in attracting viewers' attention. Especially, the way he used to call Victor, Hey Victor. However, this movie has a lot of flashbacks. In fact, all of them were well used. The character of Thomas as storytellers made the use of flashbacks vital in this movie. One of the interesting flashbacks is when Thomas was telling a story about how Victor's mother was able to feed one hundred Indians by fifty fry bread. Beside Thomas' stories, the flashbacks were very useful in showing the life of Victor's father in Phoenix, and how he felt about his son Victor.In general, Smoke Signals is a unique movie that produced by Native Americans. It shows the modern life of Native Americans on reservation, their values and beliefs. It also stresses on some issues that related to the history of Native Americans. Actually, Smoke Signals is a very enjoyable movie that must to see at least one. It is well written, acted, directed, and edited. On scale of five stars this movie deserves four stars.

The film, first presented in 1998, represents the current life of the Native Americans. The actors of this drama effectively embodied the different characters. For instance, Evan Adams as Thomas has inimitable ambiance and a great sense of humor which lids him to play a key role in the film. On the other hand, Adam Beach as Victor is one of the film stars who play the opposing character of Thomas, a serious and formal man. Smoke Signals is the first Native American film production, including actors, writer, and director. In addition, the film received several awards between 1998 and 1999 from different organizations. The film mainly focuses on Thomas and Victor, who are the key characters of the movie, and their life in a Native American reservation in Idaho. Victor is a basketball player and Thomas is a storyteller. Both of them are linked with Gary Farmer as Arnold who is Victor's father. In the beginning of the film, Arnold rescues Thomas when he was a baby from a house fire that killed his parents. After that, Thomas start treating Arnold as a father or a role model, but Victor and his mother were suffering from Arnold since he was alcoholic and he treated them violently. As a result, Arnold leaves his house and the reservation to go to Phoenix and complete the rest of his life there. A couple of years later, Arnold dies and leaves his properties in Phoenix. Therefore, Victor headed Phoenix in order to get his father's possessions and Thomas asked him to be his travel meet. At this trip Victor and Thomas faced many adventure events which make them closer than their childhood. Victor started to convince Thomas in order to change his appearance to be more as Native American and Thomas accepted. When they arrived to Phoenix, Thomas and Victor met Suzie who was Arnold's friend. Suzie tried to change Arnold image in Victor's mind by telling him the truth about the fire that Arnold made when he was drunk which caused the death of Thomas's parents. The film Smoke Signals is highly qualified production in all aspects. One of those great aspects is the film main story. The film was written by Sherman Alexei who writes the story in a logical way that makes it greatly reliable and simple. The well linked events of the story serve to a greater understanding of the Native American issues. A good example of these issues is the trouble relationship between father and son. Although this movie was filmed in the late nineties, the effects are quite surprising. Another interesting aspect of the movie is the cast. The cast were not Hollywood stars, but they preformed their parts well. Instead of hiring regular actors, the director chose to hire Native Americans to play the role or to simply to be themselves. Smoke Signals is a great film since it has carries a message, something which current movies lack. I believe that Native Americans are living in sort of limitation since they are living on a reservation that is under developed comparing it with other American civilization. The movie reflects a different kind of life style with a mix of values which shows us that people with different values can still live together and perhaps the differences are makes us more united. Considering the date of production and that it is the first movie made by Native Americans, I believe they did an overall good work that is why I would rate it with 4 stars.

Even though it seems a simple drama film, this film is special. I do not mean that this film shows us huge spectacle visual image or is acted by super-star. It describe Native Americans' point of view well, by Native Americans themselves. Original novel of this film was written by Native American author Sherman Alexie, and the film was also directed by Chris Eyre, Native American. It made the film describe their real story on their view. Not only them, but also including two protagonists Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas (Evan Adams), all actors who acted as Native Americans is real one of them. Describing their real life, the film shows us two guys' journey to recognize father's love.Arnold Joseph (Gray Farmer) had family and little son &#x96; Victor. He had lived with his brother's family on in reservation. One day, a big fire broke out their house. Arnold could save his family, but his brother's family got stuck in the fire. Arnold's brother threw his baby &#x96; Thomas to save him, and Arnold barely caught him. After that, the two boys had grown up completely different home environment. Arnold had alcoholism, and sometimes used to be violence, so Victor became to feel resentment against him. On the other hand, Thomas has grown up by his grandmother, so he became resemble with her. He became to wear big glasses, braid his hair and even talk tiresome story always. One day, Arnold got big conflict with her wife and son and he impulsively left his family. After some years, the two boys grow up to two guys. Victor's resentment against his father made him critical manly guy, and Thomas always talking stories Victor does not like. They were having a monotonous daily life, but Victor's mother suddenly got a call about Arnold from Arizona. It was Suzie Song (Irene Bedard) and she told that Arnold died so someone should get back his stuff. Thomas was embraced about it. He did not want to meat even remind. Also he did not have enough money to go Arizona. When he got a inner conflict about it, Thomas came to him with little bit money.One of the most remarkable points of the film is well-mixed memories and present scenes. For example, before Victor and Thomas leave reservation, Thomas came to Victor and asked to go Arizona with him in a store. After that, Victor went out the store. Then, a camera's viewing point is changed to outside of the store and there was boy Victor. This change of time makes memories naturally connected with present scene and prevents audience to feel bored from memories. Also they tell us connections between the present and the past. For example, when Suzie tells Victor about Arnold, the film shows us his soliloquy. Then, he threw a basketball and Victor caught the ball in the present. This scene makes not only good visual but also implication. The ball thrown by Arnold is symbol of truth and his real mind for the son. Victor caught the ball so it means he will accept his father. These kinds of framework make the film not only interesting but also worth as art.Other remarkable point is each role of two protagonists. Victor and Thomas have totally different personality. This point makes the film well-organized. Their journey is for Victor to get truth about father and understand about him. This kind of plot can be boring but Thomas prevents it. His role is assist for Victor to accept his father. He encouraged Victor to start the journey and makes him remind his father and even mother. Victor is always serious and critical so make element of drama, whereas Thomas is optimistic and makes the mood funny. If there were protagonists who have different personality in the film, it would not be great like this. Even though these kinds of characters are used to be in so many literature and movies, truth is that the film successfully adapted a composition of the characters.This film is simple drama but not usually. It described Native American's real life from their point of view. It gave us totally different impression and can be motivation to understand and think about them. However it does not mean that 'difference' is all good point of the film. Impression about this film is universal. Even though the film made by them, it can make us feel sympathy. Remarkable frameworks and well-organized character composition also contribute making attraction of this film. After considering all element, I want to give 8.5 score to it. If you want to understand Native American, feel impression about father's love and enjoy light humor, Smoke Signal might be pretty good choice.

From the earliest tale of Thomasflying through the air during the harrowing and heartbreaking aftermath of July 4th celebrations, straight through to the stunning denouement with the powerful poem of Forgiving our Fathers accompanied by the haunting music of Ulila and the drummers and chanters which lifts us up to the Heavens, this film is a small masterpiece. It is very much a depiction of contemporary Native American culture--but it is told with such a keen understanding of universal human emotion, that everyone can relate to it. Love, regret, pain, forgiveness--all of these great enduring issues abound in the film. At what point do our lives turn out a certain way do to society, luck or misfortune, inner strength or lack of it--that final poem sums up the film brilliantly. The characters are so richly drawn--even those who appear ever so briefly in the film--that a rich tapestry is created as their lives and stories are woven together. Ultimately director Chris Eyre's and author Sherman Alexei's film celebrates forgiveness, understanding, acceptance, human compassion and perseverance. This is not to say that the film is somber or purely philosophical. My Heavens, no! There are a wealth of intriguing events, characters--moments of surprising humor, moments of very real sadness, the past woven seamlessly with the present, the reality woven seamlessly with Thomas' tales of dreams and imagination. The photography is glorious, the American West a place of great beauty--sometimes a desolate beauty, but beauty never-the-less. The music score is powerful and riveting. And most importantly we care about the characters--we want them to be happy, their lives to be fulfilled...we laugh with them, knowingly nod our heads in understanding with them, and in many instances, our hearts break right along with theirs. For anyone who has lost their parents--this movie can be unbelievably sad, but it can also be unbelievably cathartic and comforting. This is one for the ages!

Should we die or have breakfast?","Date":"25 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The more you try to describe a movie like Smoke Signals the likelier it is that you'll kill it. The story basically is about a son who eventually reaches some understanding concerning his father, who left the family years ago. The discovery and acceptance by the resentful Victor Joseph of his father's own unhappiness plays out in a road trip Victor and his friend, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, take from the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho where they live to Phoenix to pick up the father's ashes. This sort of story has been so often turgidly overplayed by film-makers searching for truth that it's a surprise to find just how touching and humorous Smoke Signals turns out to be. The story may be about a search of discovery, but it's played out against the friction of reservation life in a white world. The humor carries a lot of irony but the dialog and situations are so gentle and natural that the inherent messages don't slam us about. There's no victim card being played here, just some truths told with the kind of underplayed honesty that makes ethnic humor, delivered by those same ethnic people, work not just for them but for those in a white world who are overhearing. Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is a big, good looking young man who barely gets along, plays basketball and carries a chip on his shoulder. Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) is a scrawny, glasses-wearing young man who tells stories and talks about almost everything. Thomas has been raised by his grandmother. A fire killed his parents and it was Victor's father, Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), who caught Thomas, just a baby, when Thomas was tossed from a second floor window. Arnold Joseph was a big man, quick to laugh and quick to hit, maybe not a drunk but close to it. He denied being a hero. One day, when Victor was about 12, Arnold Joseph picked up and left. Victor never forgave him. When word of Arnold's death reaches Victor's mother. Victor decides he must get the ashes, but he doesn't have enough money. Hey Victor! Thomas says, I'm sorry 'bout your dad. How'd you hear about it? Victor asks. I heard it on the wind, Thomas says, I heard it from the birds. I felt it in the sunlight. And your mom was just in here cryin'. Thomas has some money in a jar and offers it if he can come along. Off they go, hitchhiking, taking a bus, walking. Along the way, while Victor wrestles with his feelings about the father who left him, screenwriter Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre give us the kind of edgy smiles that are rare nowadays. You gotta look mean or people won't respect you, says Victor to Thomas on the bus to Phoenix. White people will run all over you if you don't look mean. You gotta look like a warrior! You gotta look like you just came back from killing a buffalo! But our tribe never hunted buffalo -- we were fishermen, says Thomas. What! says Victor, you want to look like you just came back from catching a fish? This ain't 'Dances With Salmon' you know! Yes, they return to the reservations with the ashes. Victor winds up learning a lot about himself as well as about his father. He learns a good deal about what Thomas reaches for with all the stories Thomas tells. We learn a lot about the value of a quiet movie with a fine screenplay and skillful direction. We learn about fry bread. And as Thomas says, when the going gets tough, Sometimes it's a good day to die, and sometimes it's a good day to have breakfast. All the actors do commendable jobs, but Evan Adams is a standout. When he closes his eyes and starts to spin one of Thomas' stories, you don't really want him to stop. Adams has the challenging job of bringing us to the movie's close, emotionally and thoughtfully. Do we forgive our fathers in our age or in theirs, or in their deaths, saying it to them, or not saying it? If we forgive our fathers...what is left? Smoke Signals is based on Sherman Alexie's book of stories, The Lone Ranger And Tonto Fistfight In Heaven.

Then, there was the Little Big Man and Dances with Wolves mold going a little overboard on portraying them as virtuous, even if they showed what the white people did to them. With Smoke Signals, Native Americans finally got to speak for themselves on the silver screen. The movie portrays young Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) traveling to Phoenix to retrieve the ashes of his deadbeat father (Gary Farmer). He has to travel with Thomas-Builds-The-Fire (Evan Adams), with whom he has never been particularly friendly, but they realize their friendship along the way.Overall, this movie is like a kick in the groin to the John Wayne mold (the Duke even becomes the butt of jokes in one scene). Around the time that I saw this movie, I read Sherman Alexie's novel Indian Killer; it had the same sort of humor that this movie has. Strange that even after the indigenous people see their land stolen and most of their people exterminated, they can still laugh, but they can.More than anything, it's just great that the Indians are finally getting their say in movies.

This is a truly good and moving film about the life and culture of the Native American indians rarely seen from the perception of the other superior races. I was one of the first to see this movie and loved it with my heart; my prediction of it winning the prestigious audience award at Sundance '98 was impeccable. Close-minded critics like Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly should get a life. Smoke Signals is an enjoyable and uplifting movie with spicy humor and poignant story concept about the fatherless Indian son who left the Idaho reservation with the goofy sidekick to travel to Arizona to retreive his father's ashes. Ode to Smoke Signals' screenwriter Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre, not to mention the acting emsemble of Adam Beach, Even Adams, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Tantoo Cardinal and Tom Skeritt.

One can describe Smoke Signals as the story of two young Native American men, Victor and Thomas, setting out on a road trip from Idaho to Arizona to bring the ashes of Victor's father home. However, it is much more than that. Smoke Signals is a film with an enthralling and complicated story. It has a good sense of humor and a flair for the dramatic. The personalities of the two main characters, Victor and Thomas, are mirrored in the ever-changing tone of Smoke Signals. Victor (Adam Beach) is often sullen, bitter, and quiet; while Thomas (Evan Adams) is usually happy-go-lucky, kindhearted, and loquacious. This movie touches on almost the whole range of human emotion. Every time I see this film I am engrossed by it. In fact, I find something new to love about it with every viewing. Smoke Signals always leaves me happy, hungry for fry bread, and singing about John Waynes teeth.

I thought it was going to be a plot less road movie, but it turned out instead to be about family and had a very specific story and plot line that avoided clichÃ©s. In that way it reminded me of the New Zealand Once Were Warriors - with about 1% of that violence about aborigine families struggling to have dignity within the confines of a white-restricted world. Like that movie you virtually don't see whites at all. I very much liked how the flash backs were handled (in the context of the past is never dead, it's never even past type evocation). The title is used for several layers of meanings about smoke and fire.Dar Williams's road song was used in an ironic road way, but I think it was added on afterwards. The passenger is bopping along to the song on the radio saying over and over that it's her favorite song, which would be odd for an obscure song. But the joke is also that the car can only go in reverse.John Trudell (he's the DJ at KREZ) and Elaine Miles (Marilyn from Northern Exposure) have teeny parts. The music is appealing --though none by Trudell and very little traditional. The closing credits have a Walala (the trio with Rita Coolidge and sister) tune that I thought it would be cool if it got nominated for an Oscar, if it's not previously recorded, as I thought it would be something different at the Academy Awards. The other music mostly also comes ostensibly from KREZ and is by Native Americans but in the singer-songwriter mode (no Bill Miller used). Other than Ulali (I thought was Walela, but I was corrected) and Dar when I tried to read the credits as they quickly went by I didn't recognize any of the names.I almost immediately caught Powwow Highway on cable and was surprised to see how much it must have influenced Smoke Signals as a Native American road movie.(originally written 7/2/1998) "},{"Title":"Pushes all the quirky indie film buttons but is charming and enjoyable nonetheless","Date":"25 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" As babies, Victor and Thomas survive a housefire that kill many others; their bond appears to be born of fire but years later they have drifted apart. They both still live on the reservation but Victor has become more of a jock and Thomas is the bespectacled geek that he has been since childhood. When Victor's absentee father dies, he plays to travel to the funeral but has not the resources to do so. Thomas offers to help pay for the trip on the proviso that he is allowed to come along with his friend. Victor accepts but prepares himself to be annoyed for the whole journey. However for every moment where their nonexistent friendship is stretched, they grow closer.Although it is an independent film and produced entirely by an ethnic minority, the plot for this film is fairly straightforward and not anything that is worth hunting out just for that. However it is the delivery, writing and charm of the film that makes it worth seeing and makes it as enjoyable and engaging as it is. Never taking itself too seriously and even poking fun at the ethnic stereotypes we would expect to have found the film's charm relies heavily on its characters to bring it off. The natural writing helps and produces dialogue that flows convincingly even when the story isn't all you could have hoped for. The direction is equally as assured and aids the film by giving the whole thing an accessible and down to earth story.The cast are a strange mix of people I've never seen and Indian actors who are in everything. Beach is impressive and natural and he makes his character more than just a jock sort of role. Likewise Adams is enjoyable even if he is a little annoying and he is more than just a geek. Bedard is as charming as the film itself and is gorgeous with it &#150; she carries a lot of the emotional weight of the film and she does it well. Farmer is a presence as usual and does well in flashback while support from people like Skerritt adds something if not a lot.Overall this is not a flawless film but it covers any problems by being charming and enjoyable. The cast take to the writing and deliver natural and likable characters who become the focal point of the film and carry the audience along. Sure it pushes all the quirky independent film buttons but it is no less enjoyable for it.

I didn't love the movie, but I was very taken into the story and each of the characters lives. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie and being able to experience all that occurs on today's Indian Reservations.The acting was by far the weakest point of this movie, but frankly there is some excuse for that considering the entire cast was made up of Native Americans. Not that Native Americans can't act very well, which they can, there just aren't too many who are interested in making a movie. The two lead roles are perfect examples of this. Victor Joseph is the first lead of the movie, played by Adam Beach, and is a very stoic person who has lived a hard life with his father leaving while he was a child. Thomas Builds-the-Fire is the second lead, played by Evan Adams, who is a very nerdy young man who desperately wants to be Victor's friend. Adam Beach does a very poor job in his role with every line being dry, which some could say matched his character, but not once did I believe that it wasn't an actor I was watching. Evan Adams, on the other hand, did an excellent job in his part, playing the nerd of Thomas almost perfectly. There is one particular point in the film, that I especially like, where he has lost his dorky braids, clean suit, and big glasses and is walking very coolly towards the camera; his hair blowing in the wind while he is walking in slow motion, and you begin to think that this is a really cool character. Then slowly he puts on a smile and immediately the nerd is back within an instant. Aside from Evan Adams' though, the acting in the entire film is really lousy, but in a way it sort of fits with the film, giving a taste of that rich culture even more.Chris Eyre directed this movie, and actually did a surprisingly good job for his first full-length film. Even though the film was very short, and the story even left open at times, each scene transition was very smooth. I was especially fond of all the different cultural aspects he included, from the bored radio announcer and radio meteorologist, and the long car trips in reverse because normal drive doesn't work, to the wide love of fry bread. This was just a great learning experience to what's going on right in our, or more accurately their, backyard that we know so little about. Acclaimed writer Sherman Alexie wrote the screenplay based off of a short story of his. Frankly, I thought this is where there was some of the greatest fault. The dialogue was alright, but mainly it was just the story and even some plot holes that brought down the movie a little. Nevertheless, it was a great film.If you decide to watch Smoke Signals, don't watch it for the movie. Watch it for the good story and great cultural experience that lies behind it. Then go out to one of the many Indian Reservations nearby and experience that culture firsthand, since it is the real root of the great country we live in.

It is easy to point out some amateurish flaws in the production -- the obvious wigs, some spotty acting -- but the problems run deeper than these superficial imperfections. At times the movie is compelling, and it points to some profound issues. But too often, it pulls its punches, opting for a feel-good approach reminiscent of made-for TV movies. It covers the brutality, pain, and loss in its subject matter with a gauze of sentimentality and empty humanism. The inevitable redemption that resolves the troubled, troubling story feels too easy, merely the result of the genre's formula. It doesn't feel true to life. Notably, the director chooses to try to pull the viewer's heart strings at moments when the script seems instead to be calling attention to hard realities. Thomas's boring tales are treated as though they are genuinely entertaining, when in fact they seem to reflect the oppressive tedium of reservation life, the need to escape its futility, and to shroud the past in fantasy. Similarly, the characters' fondness for flatbread is portrayed as touching, when it seems more a comment on their grinding poverty -- baked bread is so cheap that to forgo it for homemade bespeaks a perilous level of want. On the other hand, the characters' sense of dispossession and victimhood is overplayed. The script seems to point to a somewhat more problematic sense of Indian identity, matching the overwhelming sense of having been wronged with a concomitant guilty doubt -- something like, Did my ancestors blow it like some of my other relatives? Why weren't they strong enough to fight the white man off? Why couldn't they provide us a better life than this? This would seem to tie in with the central theme of the movie, the difficulty of grappling with the absurd, of grappling with the inexplicable, senseless past; the way in which history weighs like a nightmare on the minds of the living; the way history is a nightmare from which we're trying to wake up. But the movie's impulsive softness pushes this hard element to the periphery. Of course it must be possible to forgive one's father for years of abuse and neglect, and it must be possible to make peace with a culture and people that once tried to eliminate yours, and that still treats you with indifference and casual cruelty. But surely it needs more than flashback accompanied by adult-contemporary guitar for this to happen. The unfortunate thing about this is that there is an untold story here that screams to be told, that the world needs to know. It deserves a more mature telling than this.

It was one of the first films to cast actual Native Americans to play the Native American roles. The story will make you smile, laugh and possibly cry, but overall it is a heartwarming story of two young men trying to find their way as Native American's in modern America. The setting is the Coeur d'Alene Reservation and it's the 4th of July. Arnold Joseph saves two infant boys from a fire that breaks out. Unfortunately, the parents of Thomas Builds-the- Fire, whom he saved, do not survive. Arnold is never the same after that tragic day. Victor Joseph becomes strong and stoic when his father leaves him and his mother when he is a child. When he gets the news that his father has past away he continues to be angry with him. It's not until he and Thomas go on the journey to recover the remains does Victor realize his father leaving him wasn't because of him, but because of the drunken disaster he had become and the mess he had created. Throughout the film many historical and traditional Native American facts are brought to life. On the reservation, people do not use much money, but often barter or trade for goods with stories and favors. Also, cars do not always get fixed and because laws on the Reservation differ from state laws, one could even drive their vehicle backwards around town if the transmission went out. As for the stories, Thomas does an over the top rendition of someone using the oral tradition of story telling by telling them whenever he gets the chance and going on and on and on. At the end of the film when he and Victor have returned from their journey, Grandma Builds-the-Fire asks Thomas to tell her how it's going to end. He then goes into my favorite and the most touching part of the movie. The quote is as follows. How do we forgive our fathers? Maybe in a dream.

Unlike most movies in the past, in Smoke Signals Native Americans are not seen as savage or as one with nature. In the Disney movie Pocahontas we see Pocahontas with the birds and otters Pocahontas is singing and dancing along with her animal friends. This creates a stereotype of what many people believe Native Americans relationship with nature is. The movie, Smoke Signals, shows Natives Americans relationship with nature as well as each other. It also eliminates most stereotypes normally connected to Native Americans. The movie, Smoke Signals, deals with issues such as alcoholism, loss and love. The story is centered on a young man named Victor who is trying to find himself while saying good-bye to his father. He also wants to regain the relationship he once had with his mother. In Thomas and Victors relationship Alexie shows important bonds and friendships that can mean everything even when you think everything is lost. In Victor's desperate time of need his only true friend, Thomas, comes to his rescue and helps force Victor to see the reality of what he is losing as well as what he has already lost.

Sherman Alexie and Chris Eyre really pull the viewers into the minds of Victor, Thomas, Suzy, and Allen. Smoke Signals tells the story of Victor and Thomas's journey to Phoenex, Arizona, using flashbacks from their childhoods to tell the story and weave everything together so that it makes sense in the viewers minds. The film is unique in that it shows modern day Indians, their hardships, and the simplicity of their life rather than portraying the typical hostile Indians in the Old West. It really breaks away from those stereotypes creating what I believe to be a realistic portrayal of Indian life today, one that mainstream America is not very familiar with and needs to see. This is why I highly recommend watching Smoke Signals.

Do you want to watch a movie that is more down-to-earth and realistically portraits Native Americans' lives today? If so, Smoke Signals is exactly what you are looking for.This film portraits two very different young Native American boys living on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in present day. One, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, is a rather nerdy boy who uses story telling as a way to entertain and also teach others lessons. The other, Victor Joseph, is a strong, rather popular boy who takes life too seriously. When Victor is young, his alcoholic father leaves both him and his mother and goes to Phoenix, Arizona. This experience changes Victor. He becomes very cold and angry because he greatly resents his father for leaving.Years later when Victor's father Arnold dies, Victor and Thomas make the journey to Phoenix together to pick up his remains. On this trip, both Victor and Thomas realize that they need each other and they get to learn a lot about themselves on the way.What makes this movie so different from other movies with Native Americans? First of all, this film, unlike a lot of others made in the past, is written, directed, and acted out by all Native Americans. This means that they can better portrait their lives because they live them everyday. Although this film is entertaining, it also is very realistic and gives its viewers a better insight into life on a reservation.Well, if you answered yes to the questions at the beginning, consider watching Smoke Signals. It's definitely unlike any western you have seen in the past.

It gives hope to people who feel like there is nothing worth living for. Victor is not a victor in the movie, but is a victim. He is the product of the events around him rather than making the events around him a product of his actions. Even though his life is not necessarily a happy one, he finds what true happiness is all about. The movie is not just about the Native American culture and how it is different from the stereotypical Dances With Wolves Indians. It is about how, with the help of a true friend, a young adult goes from being a boy to becoming a man.

Most of the film-makers are Native American, including screenwriter, director and characters. It dramatically increases the credibility of it.The film-makers made the use of simple methods to convey the different cultures, beliefs and values between Native American (Indian) and mainstream American (White) by telling a story happened in a tribe. But it conveyed a very strong message by using smoke at the beginning and water at the end of the film to show how a permanent and painful fault happened like a smoke and how to forgive the one who made mistake by water respectively. It is a story full of love, family relationship, friendship, and forgiveness and culture differences.The fault made by Victor's father caused the death of Thomas's parents. In my point of view, it's like the mistake made by the White people to Native Indian in the past. It was a permanent and painful wound to all Indian American. However, the film used water as a symbol of forgiveness to represent that Victor forgave the fault of Victor's father. Does it mean that we should forgive the fault made by White people to Indian American in the past? Smoke Signals is a great film to watch and to think of&#133;&#133;&#133;..

Sometimes, these kinds of fears prevent us from trying to know something new. However, when we overcome these fears and face them, we can get a more valuable view to understand different things. I realized it after I watched this film, for this film gave me an opportunity to think about Native America culture in their point of view which was very new and different for me.In this film, I can experience Native American culture and lives through their eyes, ears, and voices. These special features of the film make huge differences comparing it with other films. For example, it breaks my misconception of Native Americans, shows me what real Native Americans look like, and makes me sympathize with their culture. Native Americans in the film are very humorous, emotional, and content with what they have. They are not aggressive at all. When I saw the scene which was that Victor tried to teach Thomas what Indian should look like, it was not scary. It was very funny and made me laugh. From the scene, I realized that I had misunderstood who Native Americans were and what I had seen was a very small part of their lives. Also, I really enjoyed listening to Thomas' stories in the film. His stories show that they are optimism, enjoy laughing as much as they can, and try to keep who they are. I think they know the importance of laughing and living through their tragic history, so they keep laughing although they do not have many things they need.It was the first time to watch original Native American film. It was really interesting and made me consider other possibilities to see one thing. I hope I can enjoy experiencing new and different things.

Thomas and Victor have known each other since they were babies and as a result have a very complicated relationship. Thomas lost both of his parents in a fire when he was a baby and Arnold Joseph, Victor's father, saved him. As a result, the two families were forever linked and bonded to each other. However, they have a strained relationship because they both have different beliefs on what a real Native American is. Victor believes it is stoicism but Thomas is always telling stories and making jokes. When Victor learns that his father has died, the two set off to Arizona and this is when the real journey begins. This is a classic tale about two young men discovering themselves on a road trip. However, it also involves several misconceptions about Native American life. For example, the Native Americans in the film used humor in almost every situation. They are always quoting today is a good day to die, whether it be today is a good day for pancakes or today is a good day for basketball.Adam Beach, who plays Victor Joseph, does an amazing job portraying the stereotypical Native American. He remains stoic throughout the majority of the film. Victor has a difficult time coping with the fact that his father left and as a result he is serious and in denial for the greater part of the film. Evan Adams, who plays Thomas Builds-a-fire, has a very shy character with a remarkable ability to tell stories. Thomas tries to connect with his ancestors and tells stories in a very mystical way. Thomas uses jokes and his stories to try and connect to Victor, who is always pushing him away. Adam Beach and Evan Adams are not the only good actors in this film. The whole cast is talented and bring different special elements to the film. The fact that the entire cast is Native American adds to the authenticity of the film.Director Chris Eyre and screenwriter Sherman Alexie did an incredible job representing Native American life in a new light. They shattered several stereotypes about Native Americans and opened the door to real reservation life. The Native Americans in this film portray humor which is rarely seen elsewhere in the cinematographic world. Sherman Alexie wrote a compelling storyline that keeps the audience absorbed in the world of a Coeur d'Alene reservation for the whole duration of the film.Overall, this film was well written and acted. It changed Native American films forever by breaking stereotypes and opening the audiences' eyes to how Native Americans really are. At the same time it was a classic road trip story about two young men discovering who they really were and what was important to them. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was glad that I took the time to see it. It was enjoyable and surprising from beginning to end. "},{"Title":"Hooray!

I knew that Indians have not received their fair shake, but I did not know how bad it really was. We cannot change the past evils that were done to these people; but the future is not written yet. By having intelligent movies that depict Indian people as they really are instead of offering us stereotypes is the first step in honoring and acknowledging Native Americans. Chris Eyre and Sherman Alexie have changed the future with this movie. This is the first film made by Indians that stars real Indians. Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Farmer, and the rest of the cast were excellent.The whole tone of this movie is enlightening. It educates without offending and humors us within the drama that unfolds.

Almost of all movies appearing Indians is about fighting against white people. Indian faces are painted by ink. We feel they are violent and not intelligent. However, Smoke Signal talks about modern Indian life which is separated from modern white people life. It is acted by many real Indians. Indians live in a reservation in countryside. Their life is not rich because they don't have high technology and enough money to use high technology. Indians have an own culture which continues from generation to generation. For example, Indians have an oral tradition. They don't write down how to make fry breads and sign up on a piece of paper. There is a reason they use oral tradition. In ancient time, Indians couldn't write English letters. They could tell other people only to use their word. When white people established a reservation in United States, they demanded Indians to sign up on the piece of paper. Indians signed up it without understanding a meaning of that piece of paper. Indians don't trust to sign up on the piece of paper. In conclusion, Smoke signal is different from other movies appearing Indians. We can know modern Indians life and what they think about white people and a reservation. It is good for us to change our P.O.V. about Indians.

The leaving of his dad improves this kind of feeling much, he becomes to hate his dad, and hate hearing anything about his dad. But there is contradictions in his mind, the love is more than the feeling of hate, and also hate results from love. Sometimes when someone loves others so much, but can not get return, he/she will be confused, and change from love into hate. At his dad's leaving, his explosion and throwing beer bottles directly results in his dad's leaving, but when his dad want to leave, he just chases up and cries, Donot leave. At the other side, his dad loves him, too. He is always mean to his dad. Including the guilty to set fire years before, even that was an accident.To Thomas, his parents died in the fire which happened years before, and later he know who is the person set the fire, but actually it is the same person whom also saved his life in that fire. When he realizes this, it is not meant to him that person is his enemy, but his saver. He regards him, loves him, and also is one of the most sad person when that person passes away. Maybe his a person who always does not care so much and remember enmity for ever, maybe there is much stronger idea in his mind Alive always more mean than the person who passes away.

I'm always weary about watching movies that I have a good memory of from my childhood because I don't want to ruin the good memory by realizing, with my now critical eye, that the movie really is not as good as I remember it being.When I watched Smoke Signals for the first time after 7 or so years I was pleasantly surprised. It is touching but not over the top and maintains a great amount of humor that is interspersed throughout. Victor and Thomas embark on a journey, traveling from Idaho to Arizona, to collect the ashes of Victor's father. This is not just a physical journey to Arizona but also something that Victor must go through emotionally in order to come to terms with the past and the broken relationship he had with his father. This film is very powerful and sends a strong message of forgiveness. Watching this movie I was reminded of how holding on to past grudges can stunt an individual's emotional growth and ability to connect with others.Thomas provides great comic relief with his melodramatic storytelling (that is not always based on absolute truth), quirky mannerisms, uninhibited friendliness and desire for Victor's friendship. He is the exact opposite of Victor who is the sullen, too cool type. Victor starts out viewing Thomas as ridiculous but by the end of the movie he comes to understand him a bit better and opens up a bit, allowing himself to learn that kindness and vulnerability are not always weaknesses.

It is beautifully filmed around the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Idaho and the Arizona desert, with a bit of Pacific Northwest thrown in. It is often funny both from obvious stuff that everyone can understand and much more subtle stuff that sneaks up on you. The characters are multi-dimensional and the acting is excellent. I often recommend this movie to friends but find it really difficult to respond to the inevitable, So what's it about question. It's about a lot of different things that are all intimately connected into one thing that everyone recognizes. (Try explaining that to some of my friends!)On the surface, it's a coming of age movie and, although the characters deal with issues common to most coming of age movies, they do it within the framework of a modern Indian Reservation culture where tradition and pride are strong, and, for many, all they have left. It is not an Indian movie but it has a strong and pleasing Indian flavor. It's a movie version of lunch at the Tuba City Truck Stop. I am especially impressed with the Thomas-Builds-A-Fire character played by Evan Adams. Thomas' unfailing good humor and magnificent smile light up the whole movie. His determination to carry on the Native American oral tradition allows him to maintain a constant stream of observations, parables and stories about everything - many of which are funny, most of which are strangely deep and poignant, and all of which are unfailingly honest. Although these unending observations drive his would-be buddy Victor nuts, they constitute nothing less than true wisdom. Keep an eye on Gary Farmer, too. He does an excellent job in the difficult role of Victor's alcoholic and overwhelmed father. If you like movies that are about a lot of real things, I recommend Smoke Signals. Like lunch at the Tuba City Truck Stop, it isn't fancy but it is great fun, very real, and you will leave feeling not only warm and satisfied but that you've learned something that you probably need to know. Enjoy.

The situation is novel and the characters are novel, IMDb informs us that it is the first movie in which American Indians' role is so prominent. This movie is a good story well told.The action of the film surrounds two young men of the Coeur d'Alene tribe and their trip from Idaho to Arizona following the death of one of the guys' fathers who lived there. This guy was very stoic, but his companion was talkative. Part of the reason the first guy was stoic was that he felt rejected by his father, who had left when the son was about 12. Initially he regarded the trip to settle his father's affairs as a mere chore. On the trip, the stoic guy came to grips with his relationship with his father. Once in Arizona the two meet the young women who had been the father's companion at the end of his life. She told how the father talked and bragged about the son, even though the son had never felt his father's approval. A key reason was that the father had once caused a fire that the son and his talkative friend were caught in. Unbeknownst to the son, his father went back in the burning building in an attempt to rescue the son, but he learned this from the companion. On the return trip the son is involved in an accident, and performs a valiant but unsuccessful rescue attempt. At this point, the father's attempt really sinks in, and he makes peace, with his father's memory in lieu of the father himself.The film exemplifies the imperfect way in which we love our children, and the imperfect way in which our parents loved us. The father had his flaws and ultimately failed to live up to his responsibility to his family, but loved them nonetheless. The talkative companion reinforced the father's brusque but loving ways, as he was a storyteller in the best of the oral tradition common in American Indian culture, as he had stories of his own encounters with the father. His tales and the woman's recollection flesh out the portrait of the father, and helps the son discover who his father really was, and who he really is.

This is a unique movie in its giving us the story of present-day Native Americans without stereotypes or bitterness.Victor has spent a decade trying to resolve feelings about being abandoned by his father when he was a young boy. By the time they return from their trip, both Thomas and Victor have learned a lot about themselves and Victor has come a long way toward resolving the issues with his father. The two protagonists are immensely appealing and they play off of each other very effectively. Thomas is a talkative nerd who annoys the more self-contained and physically strong Victor, but Thomas is not cowed by Victor and he has important things to say to him.One of the most appealing qualities of the movie is its gentle humor. See some of the entries in the memorable quotes link for examples. And just when you think things are going to lapse into clichÃ©, the movie does a fake and runs right around you.The story gently builds to a powerful culminating scene that is a piece of pure poetry. While the camera scans scenes of a river from a meander to full flow to gentle rapids to fury below a bridge where Victor is scattering the ashes of his father, Thomas reads Dick Lourie's poem How Do We Forgive Our Fathers while an Indian chant is played. This scene is uniquely cinematic (no other art form could do this) and it is a knock-out. Not to be missed.

In it, Victor has to recover his father's ashes and return them to the rez. However, he doesn't have much money, so he goes to Thomas, who he normally won't have anything to do with, because Thomas is always telling stories. But Thomas is the only one who can afford a bus ride to Phoenix. There's a catch, however Victor has to take Thomas with him.There are many references you have to be Indian to get, like the passport joke, but even if you're not Indian, I recommend this movie.

Fathers and sons, mothers and sons, and an odd-sort of male-bonding all take place during the course of this film. I was already a fan of Alexie's writing -- and had met him and talked with him for quite a while at a book-signing party in Berkeley, a year or two before the film (only loosely based on the book, as other people have commented). People are quick to categorize films, especially as to the ethnic group or religious group featured, what country it was filmed in, etc -- what about simply judging on the characters, how engaging they are? This film should be seen by all people, not just Native Americans. It was very funny, but also had its bitter, angry, and sad moments, as well as a little poetry -- and lots of visual beauty. My only problem, a big one, with this film is the poster used to promote it. Irene Bedard does wonderful work in the film (she's most famous, at this moment in time, for being the figure-model for Disney's Pocahontas -- and also doing the voice of Pocahontas in the film). But on the movie poster, Bedard looks like a ten-year old girl. So it's my guess that most Americans looked at the poster -- immediately registered the phrase kid's movie in their heads and weren't interested in seeing it. Since so many movie-goers are teenagers or people in their early twenties -- the poster must have done a lot to destroy what could have been a huge box-office for this film. It could have been, and deserves to be a monster hit. When you see Bedard's character in the film, it's immediately clear she's a woman; she carries herself with the grace and maturity of a woman in her mid-twenties to mid-thirties. She's clearly more mature, if not in actual age, then in her self-possession and wisdom than the two young men who've come to visit her. She'll probably look 15 or 20 years old when she's 70; here's hoping she does! But what a disaster to give the impression on the movie posters, and video box art, which makes her look like the much younger sister to the main characters. It's not a love story, so it wouldn't be appropriate to have her posed in some sort of romantic embrace with one of the figures. But maybe she could have been shown in some photograph with the father, kissing or embracing him -- some way which would convey that she's a lovely lady, worthy of great romantic interest and intellectual respect. This is a movie for teenagers and adults. Yes, kids will enjoy the film too -- and the child stand-ins for the adult characters during flashback scenes do very professional work. But a film breaking new ground like this needs all the help it can get to be well-received; most reviewers I looked at in newspapers and elsewhere loved the film and couldn't say enough nice things about it. But I saw the poster before going into the theater (and I'd also seen it in newspaper ads), I already knew what to expect from having met and read Alexie's work, so seeing Bedard's face on the poster just made me curious who the kid sister might be. Then when Bedard's character shows up 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the way through, I did a double-take -- a little like Tim Meadows' Ladies Man of SNL -- Whoa, it's a lady!  Not a girl at all. (She may be about 5 feet tall, if that, but all the more a lady.) Alexie's next novel or movie project should be about who falls in love with her, now that the father's gone. Bring back Irene Bedard to play the role, write another first-rate script, and do a proper poster -- and you've got a hit!

John Wayne's song touched my heart.When I saw this movie, I focused on the lives and the thoughts of the Native Indians. Victor asked Thomas, You watched 'Dances With Wolves' more than a hundred times. He meant that the movie didn't portray an Indian's life exactly. The auteurs said, Dances With Wolves is not an Indian movie (Reel Spirituality, 198). Movies are powerful because they show how people unknown live and think. Movies are sometimes dangerous because they produce stereotypes. The Native Americans are sometimes victims of stereotypes made by Hollywood movies.M*A*S*H was meant to teach its contemporary viewers about the irrationality and inhumanity of the Vietnam War (Reel Spirituality, 32), but Korea and the Korean people became victims of stereotypes the TV drama created.I liked Smoke Signals because this movie changed my prejudice against Indians. I thought they were stoic and like warriors, but I found that they were like everybody else. And I felt for the Native Americans because they were put onto reservations.

But maybe Indian films don't have to be radical, or maybe this film simply stands as a good start for Indians to be able to tell their stories with their own voices to main-stream America.

And the movie does it so well that it coaxes your response from your mythic self.All that, and (of course) it's funny, quirky, warm, complex-yet-direct, unaffected.I saw (in some other comments) the gratuitous characterization of Smoke Signals as low-budget.  It's is a perfect example of a movie that just might have the power to induce everyday movie-watchers to completely abandon any mental linkages formed between financial/technical resources and esthetic effectiveness.

Well, he only took one story from his book and turned it into a film that translates Indin' Rez culture as well as he does in his book, I do have problems with the fact that it is slight, but the movie's poetic fluidity that Alexie uses overshadows this massively. There's several things that weren't understood here Indin's making fun of everything is an alternative to drinking in a way,and the fact that there are many elements that couldn't be worked upon in this movie would convey the confusion and unabatedness of the Rez. My problem with this movie was that Sherman Alexie set this movie around one story in his book in this movie, which makes the reality of the Rez less biting to the viewer. Let's just say the Indin's are still good-humoured even though this movie didn't convey the listlessness the characters in the book and what they really endured. Oh well,  he's getting a sequel under way from what I understand... I had to give it a 9, it's too good to be true! P.S.

First off, minus a few gags like 'Frybread Power' and the car that only drives backwards, the film certainly is not the sidesplitter that reviews boast it to be.  However more importantly, with a running time of less than 90 minutes, relatively short by feature film standards, the leanness in length is glaringly apparent.  The last act feels rushed and wraps up quickly, without a feeling of completion to the story, as if there were originally scenes that told more about the story, but were edited out for some reason. The interesting dynamic and contrast between Victor and Thomas seems to resolve itself just in time for the end of the film and Thomas' fascination and appreciation for Victor's father, as the father he never had, is hardly explored or discussed by either character.  I think that something of that magnitude would be a defining part of their relationship and how they view one another.  Conversely, the relationship between Suzy and Victor's father feels completely unbelievable and seems to work only as a means for Victor to better know his father, although I am never convinced that happens.The most solid section is probably the first few minutes, which present vivid images of reservation life to viewers who might be puzzled about how Native American culture and community operates within the modern world.  The answer to their questions is poorly.  The ramshackle houses and repeatedly failing car engines tell of how low income these developments are. Audiences get a distinct impression that these people are truly cut off from the rest of the world, both in the films setting of a barren, empty land and the humorous use of the lonely traffic reporter with no traffic to report. The town is run through by seemingly endless stretches of road leading out of town, and hardly anyone coming in.  These are both good illustrations of an awkward living situation and effective cinematic tools.  However, the screenwriting promptly lapses into poor form when Victor and Thomas start to explain away every conflict that involves their heritage. It is an unfortunate undermining of the audiences observational ability because they are shown and then told, rather than just shown - accenting this with strong visuals to enforce what is being said.  The opening act sets the stage for a compelling road movie, with a heavy emphasis on exploration of identity and heritage.  But because of consistent plot holes, or rather underdevelopments, the audience must take great leaps of faith throughout the entire film, hardly any of which pay off.

Therefore, you can see the true Native American culture and values in the film.Another reason is that this movie is impressive and touching. You will be moved by friendship between Victor, the main character, and Tomas, an old friend of Victor. Victor finds Tomas as a real friend through the long trip to find his dad who has died recently. Also, family love is a very important concept in this film. Although Victor could not have noticed his father's love for him until he died, he finally finds it when he meets his father in ashes. It took long time for Victor to notice it but that makes the father's feeling deep. To sum up, you can learn the real Native American culture and be impressed by friendship and family love by this movie.
