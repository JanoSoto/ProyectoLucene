Like everyone was saying that all of the white characters are bad and all of the black characters are good, when that is apparently not the case.  Why does Remy become a skinhead?  Because the black guys in his dorm rejected, humiliated, and belittled him.  In a way they drove him to it.  Who's to blame here? In no way does Singleton let the black characters off the hook here. Many of them are portrayed as violent and irrational.  Omar Epps's character is good example of where Singleton points out another dangerous attitude that has nothing to do with white people.  The character thought the world owed him a break because he was black and underprivileged and the teacher is the one to call him on it.  Or as someone in a another post pointed out, sorry to quote you, Black self-pity, which the film does not excuse, but rather addresses with the same skepticism as it does the more generic issues everyone else seems to be concentrating on (racism, neo-naziism, date rape, lesbian cults.) So ask yourself, did this film genuinely leave you with the impression that it glorifies the behvoir of certain characters based on their race?  Or is it maybe just that since the director is black you have a preconceived notion that he will be partial to the black characters?So where a lot of people seem to think the message is black=good white=evil, I see it as It doesn't matter who's wrong and who's right because we need to put our differences aside and get along (almost equally clichee, I know, but still a different message entirely) Signed, white dude "},{"Title":"Must have seen a different movie","Date":"6 May 2002","Score":"53 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I must have been watching a different movie to most of the people adding comments. I didn't see it as a film portraying African Americans as good and whites as bad but as a film in which all the factions were shown to have good and bad sides. Even the guy who becomes the Nazi skinhead was portrayed sympathetically in as much as he is clearly out of his depth in a social situation and becomes a recruit because only the skinheads will accept him when no-one else will. Overall, the African Americans come out as the most sympathetic but not by much.I agree there are some fairly silly stereotypes, especially Fishburne's character, but they work in the context of the movie. Most refreshing was the fact that an American college is portrayed as a place with real issues like racism and date rape and drunken behaviour. It's refreshing because colleges are usually shown as places where nice middle-class kids never have any problem bigger than being dumped by their boyfriends before everything is resolved in the last reel.An overly maligned movie. Not perfect but better than a million other college movies. Loved the ending too.

Into this place of higher learning comes a mix of students to join the already multicultural pot.  Malik is a black track star who feels he is disadvantaged as he has to run and study, while others only have to run.  Remy is a white teenager who is forced out of his dorm by his black roommate and finds friendship in an extreme group.  Kristen is a young female who struggles to make friends and is assaulted by a man before falling in with a women's group.  Their experiences intertwine in the small campus.If anyone wonders why director John Singleton (he of Boyz n' the Hood) is now making things like 2Fast2Furious, this is as good a place to start looking as anywhere.  After an assured start with Boyz, the director made a couple of films that had potential but just came out muddled or lacking something to make them work.  Poetic Justice was one of them and this was another.  Higher Learning had potential and you can see that it's heart is in the right place but it doesn't come off at all.  The plot tries to be a mix of experiences but, because there are three or so characters up front, there is no time to develop them so their experiences are broad cultural brush strokes - the white kid sucked into extremism, the raped girl taken into lesbianism, the black man who has to work harder for everything.As a result the plot never really engages and it all just goes where you expect it to go - and is less impacting as a result of it's plodding nature. This spills over into the characters too - they are all pretty much stereotypes that fit into their scenario rather than real characters. Singleton shows is bias in his direction and character selection.  My wife said something about me watching a lot of `black' films in the past week and I said Higher Learning was not dominated by any one race - but I think I was wrong.  Singleton clearly likes the characters played by Busta Rhymes, Ice Cube and Epps - they are cool and put upon where other characters (races) have fewer kind touches placed on them.  Personally I thought every character had huge chips on their shoulders about their identity - but the African American characters are the only ones that are held up for praise in relation to their chips!Having said that I did think Epps did OK - he made a lifeless character a little more interesting.  Banks however is as one dimensional as I have grown to expect from her.  Rapaport looks very young indeed but he does well.  His character is lazily drawn and developed, but he manages to make him a little human - which took work looking at the film as a finished product.  Swanson is too dippy and light - but then all the lesbian characters seem to be painted in a weird sort of light.  Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes give extended cameos which require them to deliver their rap personas of thugz - they are laughably clich√©d!  Fishburne adds gravitas as he always does, but he has little to do and is given not only a poor accent, but also some `deep' dialogue that just sounds pretentious or like a fortune cookie.Overall I saw what this film was trying to do but it didn't manage it.  It was ambitious, but the wide spread meant that none of the plots or characters were allowed to develop and instead were left as hollow, broad stereotypes and scenarios.  The film tries to go all deep and the final shot of the word `unlearn' against an American flag just feels like Singleton must have thought that he had been making incredibly profound points the whole time - instead it felt that his original idea had had a deeper point, but it was totally lost in delivery.

I get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. In addition, there are a bunch of might-makes-right messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up. I mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks? However, he way Singleton portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. There is another bad guy (in reality a drunken frat boy) who rapes one of the movie's protagonists. In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one. In any event, he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country.Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it? When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch. The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, et al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks; however the (apparently in Singleton's mind) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. Again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.

We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. Befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. It did not attempt to show how either was right, although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you'll find Higher Learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10 "},{"Title":"It should have been billed as a comedy. . .","Date":"28 April 2006","Score":"24 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy.

The Jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men.

The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud.

The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of.

People are even racist in college. That's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it's in college too.This film deals with this problem of racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads Dead Men Don't Rape. See what I mean?) I don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. The big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. I'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens.Another problem I have with this movie is that it's supposed to be gritty and hard-hitting, but they make Nazis the bad guys. I agree Nazis are evil, but that's my point. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's. The film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.

I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if Singleton didn't make his characters such broad caricatures.On the surface he tries to portray Ice Cube's character as a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduates at the end in the movie's redeeming epilogue? It seems Singleton points at white as either unable to empathize (I didn't say sympathize!) with his fellow black student OR only able to take the path of a racist skinhead.

From the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. Its almost as its an insult to both black and white people. I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters. One a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film. They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education.

First of all, I don't know if Singleton ever went to college (I'm assuming he did) but the campus atmosphere in this movie was completely ridiculous.  Yes, certain groups of students tend to congregate together and isolate themselves from other groups, but the division of these groups into warring factions in the film was way over the top.  I mean, come on, a Nazi fraternity?  Also, I almost laughed out loud when the innocent, vulnerable freshman girl gets raped and automatically becomes a bisexual feminist campus organizer.On the other hand, the film does give sheltered white people a better view of the more subtle forms of racism minorities are bombarded with in all parts of America, even college campuses.  I loved how Michael Rappaport's (white) character got away with violent crime while Omar Epps's (black) character was detained by the police for the same incidents, not once, but twice!  This happens everyday, and it's about time we see it in film.Lawrence Fishburne plays a sort of mentor/professor to Epps in the film, but his character is not nearly developed enough, and also, doesn't seem to know what he's talking about in his lectures.  He said America was founded in order to create democracy?  Even the most cursory study of history supports the view that America's founders were the same wealthy white men who felt their social inferiors needed to be exploited and controlled to support the ruling class.  I'm a little off topic now, but the point is that Singleton has failed in his efforts here to illuminate the roots of hatred and racial conflict.  Compared to his more successful efforts Boyz n the Hood and Baby Boy, this movie is a failure.Note  I've heard this film is required viewing in many college courses!  Give me a break -- either those professors are so out of touch with actual campus life that they think this is somehow realistic, or they are closet conservatives who think this failed effort at liberal ideology will turn students off to efforts at social change.  I wish they would give students more credit and show them a film that actually does a decent job of showing racial and class conflict in contemporary America, like the Weather Underground.

One is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. Though they are students at what looks like a private university, they cannot utter a single line of proper English. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.It appears that drunken Kristen(Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunken Billy was taking her to his house. She even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy. Later Kristen was assured by Taryn(Jennifer Connely) that she holds no accountability in that matter, and despite willfully jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator. Then a week or so later she met, and slept with, an ultra-sensitive do-gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom. The director stressed contraception thoroughly.This movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail. Cole Hauser's acting, and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I can think of to watch it. The writer/director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want, but keep in mind that neurons don't grow back. Just follow the advice at the end and UNLEARN.

Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it.Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by Nazis. They took him in. Nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly.Omar Epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. She then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically.This film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play.I read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (Nazis). So what? Remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. He even says right before he kills himself, I didn't mean it, I wanted to be an engineer.Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No.People say it shows white=-bad black=good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided.Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well.Good movie, well done.

This work is designed to fool shallow viewers into believing that it's a complex drama about race and love, while in reality it's nothing more than a bad cut/paste job. I tried hard to swallow the beaten-to-death-then-revived-and-beaten-again clich√©s, but the foolishness of characters and their random irrational developments left me with a strange taste as if someone has farted in my mouth.The characters * A student who at the beginning was so keen on studying, then after a minor scuff with a black student he drops out, becomes an insane skinhead with an out of the blue history of using firearms and we find that he had a state of the art pistol stashed in his ruck sack all along. Yeah, right.* A black gang leader who is supposed to be an intellect and has a massive library stacked with books, but then he acts as a common thug harassing the white boy who just wants to study. Which one was he? If that was supposed to be the black student struggling against prejudice and racism, then we shouldn't have seen him bulling the white students for no reason at the beginning. Makes sense? * A girl who we are supposed to believe was raped, but I'm not sure how you can call that a rape? She went home with the guy, let him engage in intercourse with her, then as he approached climax she asked him to stop, and when he did not, she becomes a rape victim! It's unlikely that people who love such a film have ever had sex, so to them I say that a Saint would not be able to stop at the time she asked him to. Physically and mentally impossible and no judge would even consider looking at it. But we still have to accept that she is a rape victim.* Another girl who runs anti-sexism meetings is as contradicting and random as the rest of them. She was all about helping the rape victim, then we see her having a lesbian relation with her and we are left to guess whether it was in reality, a dream, a fantasy or a mental image of her new boyfriend. Fortunately this character was played by Jennifer Connelly which is the only high point of this rubbish film. Her acting is world class and she is -as always- a joy to look at. Too bad she wasted her time playing that badly written character.* The leader of the NAZI group is a guy who somehow comes out as if he hates what's they're doing. Yet no one explains why he does and what forces him to stay on it. We see him in one scene blaming a fellow skinhead for dropping out of school and tells him that he must have a bright successful future, then shortly afterwards he provocatively dares him to commit mass murder and hands him the rifle!!! It also beats me how no one had investigated their attacks on black/white students, and how after the shooting police did not even speak to the group even though one of them gave a clear and loud order to fire while a policeman was 3 feet behind trying to catch him.* Then comes what is supposed to be the main character. A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates slaves who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!! Which one is it? You know what, I'll stop here because I suddenly feel that it is not worth my time. Worthless rubbish.

The characters are stereotypes, the college campus is nothing like reality, and the whole affair screams 'Do the Right Thing' but without any real understanding about what that really entails. Spike Lee's film had a lot of valid points and understood the nature of racism and portrayed it brilliantly. This film just takes pleasure in reducing everybody to stereotypes, tossing in an education spiel that would make Bill Cosby roll his eyes, and basically just waste the audience's time and money.But it does have value. The movie attempts to portray America as a land seething with anxiety and bitterness over social norms breaking and bursting. But it's a childish movie in that it wants to be revolutionary without really knowing what it's trying to do. Why does rape equal becoming a lesbian? How does being dismissed by a bunch of black men immediately follow into racism? Huh? What is going on in this movie? And we'll never know. Higher Learning is a product of the '90s. If anything, it shows how we cannot judge history while we are living it. It's a bad clone of Do The Right Thing and is ultimately pointless and meaningless.

So I had no idea what to expect when I started watching it.The film follows the story of three incoming freshman at the fictional Columbus University, both plagued by tragedies. Kristen (Kristy Swanson) is nearly raped, loses her useless friends, and questions her sexuality, or so it is implied. Malik (Omar Epps) faces racial tension, tuition woes, and the realization he isn't sure what he wants in life. Remy (Michael Rappaport) deals with loneliness, and his eventual decline into white supremacism. So it's an upbeat film.Director John Singleton had a unique opportunity to show the reality of racial tensions and the struggles of college life. In some ways, he succeeds. In other ways, the film is extremely dishonest. You won't find a single redeemable white male character. Based on the movie, you would have to conclude most white males are either skinheads, frat rapists, or moronic racist campus police. The only truly positive white female character happens to be a lesbian (Jennifer Connelly), whose place in the film is mystifying for me until I read a lot of her relationship with Kristen is cut out (Could it be sexuality is more scary than race? I don't know why they cut it out, just a possibility). I don't count Kristen as a positive character because she is portrayed as being so weak. The film also dumbs itself down at times, as in the scene where Malik rants about Christopher Columbus for example (Malik doesn't know anything about Frederick Douglass, but he's suddenly an expert on colonial history?). And Remy's descent into white supremacy is laughable (He's becoming racist because his black roommates wouldn't turn down their stereo?). The white supremacists are so poorly acted (aside from Cole Hauser) and so much caricatures, it's hard to see why they should be feared (Real skinheads are much more frightening).And yet, there are some superb scenes. The conclusion of Remy's story was powerful. It would have been interesting to hear Malik's thoughts on Remy after that moment. Does he pity Remy? Does he forgive him? Maybe that's just me though, as I've experienced the anger that comes with having a friend murdered.The moments where we see Professor Phipps (Laurence Fishburne) struggling to reach Malik are also gripping. And any scene with Michael Rappaport is powerful. Despite the ridiculous lack of justification for his transformation, he makes it work well.In the end, the performances are what redeems the movie, starting with Rappaport. Fishburne is excellent, and every scene he is in keeps your eyes glued to the screen, despite an accent that disappears at times. Ice Cube is great as a perpetual senior, who is also the smartest character in the movie. It makes you wonder why he isn't getting more serious roles. Regina King, Cole Hauser, Adam Goldberg, Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks round out the honorable mentions. Although part of me felt Goldberg's role was a stereotype. Kristy Swanson does a respectable job, but her storyline is a mess. At the beginning she is shown being nervous around Malik because he's black. Yet she has no issue with Regina King's character? And she's the one the filmmakers chose to organize a unity rally? I suppose it's the scene were King has Ice Cube and his friends rough up the frat boy that tried to rape her that's supposed to represent her transformation, but I think that should have been explored more. They never really showed her coming to terms with the attempted rape. And the lesbian angle remains unresolved. Her story just didn't make much sense.In the end, this film is worth seeing, if only for the excellent cast. It doesn't treat politics, race, or sex with any real honesty. Films like Do the Right Thing and Remember the Titans are much better at presenting racial issues. If you are homosexual, you are likely to feel slighted. And most races could find something to be offended by. If you went to college, this won't at all resemble your experience. But there are single moments of truth.

The movie follows three characters, Malik Willaims (Omar Epps), Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson), and Remy (Michael Rapaport). Each of which assimilate into groups bound by race and gender. tension between the groups lead to an ending which could of been better.One of the biggest problems I had with the movie was the fact some parts of the film were just tacky.This is especially seen when the security guards constantly beat up Malik, now a pro-black activist, are super nice to Remy, now a Neo-Nazi. Some of the plots and characters just seem to fade away. The lesbian relationship between Kristen, and Taryn (Jennifer Connelly) took off but never became clear. I found Remy's transformation from a farmer boy nerd into a Neo-Nazi quite unrealistic, mainly because the Neo-Nazi group is not shown as a Neo-Nazi group, they are instead shown as a bunch of angry white guys. The only sign of a Neo- Nazi group is from Scott (Cole Hauser), the leader of the group; however his character is much too under-used.The pro-black group was more realistic then the Neo-Nazi group; however it had their fair share of problems too. For one Malik, just seems to whine all the time about how he as to endure being an athlete and a scholar at the same time. Ice cube actually isn't too bad as Fudge, but displays too many stereo-types as a black to be taken seriously (smoking weed). Busta Rhymes character as dreads, was just that dreadful. Perhaps the only realistic character was the professor, Laurence Fishburne. Although his lack of a cultural stance proved to be the opposite problem of all of the rest of the characters in the movie.

I realize that Mr. Singleton was attempting to deal with multiple issues in a limited timespan, which accounts for the film having very little by way of realism, but that doesn't excuse many of the situations being as over the top as they were, nor does it warrant such heavy usage of stereotypes.And the near lack of non-black and non-white (I don't count Jewish people as not being white) characters only served to lessen my respect for this piece of work.

(Singleton, it should be mentioned, was convicted of spousal assault.) A bad movie overall, but if you really want to see the worst of Singleton, I would suggest Rosewood.

Of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges.I went to colleges in Southern California where the races pretty much hang around with their own. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. and I can honestly say, that it's there. But the thing is when class lets out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is that bad? Not really. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended once wrote about that, we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them. Otherwise you're creating your own segregation.Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended. One time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.I can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen.So is Higher Learning overly dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe. Is it way off mark? It depends on where you went to or go to school. The race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own DOES happen. Minus the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.

At first, you wonder where the story's going, but the more it progresses, you begin to see there's something special going on here, where Singleton had made something more than a movie here. What we have are a collection of characters, collegiate students, with their own drama's, and cuttingly real life problems, which of course might seem very clich√©'d, but it's how the characters react off each other, especially when again, it's racial conflict, in a movie which again pits black against whites, some of it done discreetly. The two standout performances are that of sick loner student, Rappaport, studying engineering, who has some really bad wiring, and when a Nazi militant group befriend him, they send him down a real killer path. The other great performance is that of Fishburne, as a kind of smug, African literature teacher, who tells it like it is. His character was bl..dy interesting, not stereotypical. Of course, there are predictabilite's in the film, like one outcome, you'll see miles off, but the intent of the film is there, with a few beneficial messages, where you as the viewer, will do some learning yourselves. Not many films are like this, and Singleton has made a film, which has sadly, been heavily and unjustly criticized, yet though, it stands apart from his others. It's a shame, more viewers can't see the real beauty and special self to this powerful drama, with some powerful performances, no more than that of the scary Rappaport.

The battle between Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport does drive the story in an interesting way. But again, Singleton takes it into the most sensationalized way. This is not a subtle movie. The characters are mostly 2-dimensional. Tyra Banks makes an impassioned plea, but even that seems 2-dimensional. I guess if there are enough 2-d, Singleton hopes it adds up to 3-d. "}{"Title":"White Trashed","Date":"3 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is a review of Rosewood and Higher Learning, two films by John Singleton. The weaker of the two, Rosewood takes place during the 1923 race riots of Rosewood, Florida. Structured as a western, the film watches as an archetypal Man With No Name (Ving Rhames, literally playing a character called Mann) enters Rosewood, only to find the town's predominantly African American population living on edge with a white minority who rule with guns, badges and a bucket full of resentment.A single incident sets the town alight a young woman blames a black stranger for the vicious beating she received from her white husband. He was so big! she screams. He was so black! The news spreads. Local white folk begin assembling. Pretty soon a carnival atmosphere develops, whites arming themselves, getting liquored up and commencing the slaughtering of blacks. Charred corpses hang from trees, houses burn and bullets fly.Though it pretends to be serious and historical, Rosewood is mostly a silly cartoon. Singleton creates an African American Eden, one which would have flourished had it not been for the white man. Whites are themselves portrayed as lecherous, stupid and one dimensional. One character, played by Jon Voight, is our token nuanced white. He's a rich landowner, sleazy, but eventually learns to do the right thing. Elsewhere Singleton consciously reverses common African American stereotypes all the white families are oversexed, violent, carnal or single parents. The black families, in contrast, are torn straight out of Norman Rockwell paintings, celebrating birthdays, always surrounded by a warm glow or sitting at big, family meals. Later, Mann becomes a Biblical figure, a Moses who leads surviving black folk on an exodus out of Rosewood and across a river.Like most films about racism, Rosewood has nothing to do with racism. The saviours of our victims are two landowners, the ruling class is invisible and it is specifically working class whites who are demonized. Racism, in other words, is caused by the stupid, poor, irrational lower class. But racism always has economic roots. In the US, racial policy became a means of combating worker unity by fostering conflicts and divisions between groups along racial, national, sexual or religious lines. The revitalisation of the KKK in the 1920s was itself a direct response to economic factors. Such things go back as far as the 18th century (quasi-military alliances between large corporations and governments repressed efforts to form labour unions and conduct strikes), when the ruling class pitted blacks, Indians and whites against one another to stave off insurrection. Indians, for example, were often hired as slave catchers, whilst strikebreakers - workers used to replace white strikers &#x96; always came from outside the area and/or lower ethnic groups. This, of course, exacerbated racial tensions and disrupted communities. Where Rosewood is set, almost two generations after the abolition of slavery and the end of the American Civil War, many French Canadians, East Europeans and Africans were first introduced as strike breakers. The deliberate creation of racial and ethnic conflict was not a matter of individual employer prejudice but of capitalist class strategy. Ulimately, Rosewood's message is typical of all of Singleton's films evil whites preyed on black, set them back, but now's the time for African Americans to help themselves, pull themselves up by the bootstraps, be good and earn a buck. Blacks, in other words, must now be good whites. Play the game that causes the problem and shunt the problem onto someone else.Singleton's Higher Learning tells the same story, but is set in a fictional Columbus University. It contains a number of intertwined subplots and characters, the most interesting of which involves Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black athlete who resents being forced to represent his school on the track field. The film's philosophy is articulated by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a West Indian Professor. African Americans, Fisburne essentially says, should suck it up, work hard, stop blaming people and put up with the problem. Other subplots involve shy and naive girls turning lesbian after being raped by men and a lonely confused man (Michael Rapaport, deliberately parroting DeNiro's Travis Bickle) joining a neo Nazi group. The film ends in a big, climactic orgy of blood, as most of these films do. As with Singleton's best film, Boyz n the Hood, actor Ice Cube (and rapper Busta Rhymes) stands out. He out classes everyone. The rest of the cast overact.While the film is right to show how racism as a system has been institutionalised within the very fabric of American social, economical, educational, and governmental institutions, and has always sought to dehumanise, devalue, and even destroy minorities and women, its ending, in which the word unlearn is boldly written on-screen, is completely unearned. The idea is that a higher education beyond education is the solution, that one should unlearn what they've been programmed to accept, but little in the film supports this theme and the statement largely comes out of left-field.7/10 - Worth one viewing.

So instead I'm reviewing this one, Higher Learning, having just watched on Netflix Streaming. Taking place at Columbus University, it centers on three freshmen Malik Williams (Omar Epps) who has a half scholarship on track, Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) a naive girl from a town near Disneyland, and Remy (Michael Rapaport) who finds himself alienated from the beginning. They all attend the class of one Professor Phipps (Lawrence Fishbourne) who believes in not doing anyone special favors. Malik is especially resentful of this since he thinks the teacher should help a brother out. Eventually, they all have some kind of mentor outside of class Malik with Fudge (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks), Kristen with Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), and Remy with Scott Moss (Cole Hauser). Compelling characterizations all with many pertinent topics and situations worth exploring though I feel I have to discuss one really interesting one after Kristen gets raped, roommate Monet (Regina King) gets a call from the one who did it trying to reach her but gets rebuffed. He doesn't take it well and calls Monet a black bitch which then switches the focus from Kristen's misery to Monet's appalled demeanor with the result of her bringing her like-skinned friends to go to his place to...well, you've probably figured what they would attempt to do. This was the most compelling part that explored how one doesn't watch what one says in the heat of the moment with consequences to pay the only option. In summary, Higher Learning is perhaps not a great film but it's very good in pushing one's buttons. So on that note, it's well worth seeing.

One thing I love and truly admire is that this movie is unconventional. It isn't afraid to show the ugly truth and with absolutely no discrimination towards skin colour. It does not try to please peoples political correctness and stupidity, rather it tries to expose it for what it is. The movie shows off several mentalities that are flawed in their reasoning amongst both blacks and whites.The movie shows how black people can be just as racist and judgmental towards white people, as white Nazis are to blacks. And that is something truly special and admirable to me because it is not often that people dare to criticize a stupid mentality with someone who is a minority. There is such a thing as reverse racism and it is often overlooked because some people just don't think it's  just as bad when blacks are racists towards whites. They are so afraid of being labeled racist for criticizing that mindset that they just go Oh well, black people have a right to do that because of everything they have been through.But it doesn't make anything better for anyone. It just creates more hate and more racism, which this movie makes sure to point out. It sets out to display how racism and the way that it affects people is bad no matter what form it takes.It does this while also showing that there are reasonable people in any race. It doesn't just depict blacks and whites as two separate extreme racist groups, it also shows off the reasonable individuals that are anywhere in between. And I just love that. I love how realistic it is in it's diversity and how it does absolutely not discriminate. It is completely objective in proving how people are idiots.But this movie isn't just about racism. It depicts problems that young people face growing up altogether. And honestly, this would be perfect to show young people in schools.

That's not to say that I thought this was an awful movie,but it hardly fits into the best of categories for any of the principals involved. The acting is sincere and even painfully moving enough,but the storyline and intertwining of characters and events is so artificial and forced that it threatens to make the film's polemic Society-as-represented-through-a-college-campus theme almost laughable. I am not certain what John Singleton's experiences on a college campus or university setting is,but I can tell you that through my experiences in that type of setting(and I seem to recall reading some reviews from other college publications at the time it came out almost eight years ago saying the same things as I am)it was NOWHERE NEAR as polarizing and tribal as this movie would have the uninitiated believe. Mr.Singleton's filmmaking style is pretty lyrical,so there is a sort of rhythm and flow to this show that makes it watchable. But it so simplifies the social settings of a University that it reminds one more of a large high school or a junior college than it does a major(or even minor)college. Also,this film seems to be more of a chance to voice various philosophical stripes through character archetypes(i.e. the disaffected slacker black student,the angry black athlete with a chip on his shoulder,the loser-ish white kid from rural America who is vulnerable to racist brainwashing,the man-hating lesbian,etc.)through the film's creator rather than pose a truly believable and engrossing story of college freshmen learning (or unlearning,if you will) the norms and hard knocks of American society.

I really think that those who wrote those reviews missed the point.1)  There ARE stereotypes in this movie.  It's intentional.  Not every white character in this movie is portrayed as a skinhead, as some reviewers may have lead you to believe.  Not every black character in this movie is portrayed as a victim either.  In order for people to overcome racial stereotypes, we have to at least take a good look at what other races see when they look at us, and this movie does a good job of that.  There are also characters (both black and white) who try to persuade Omar Epps' character to not use his race as an excuse to play the victim, so I really don't see this movie as one sided.2)  The rape scene, where some reviewers complain that Kristy Swanson's character gave consent, wasn't supposed to be a clear cut, awful drunk bad-guy rape.  In order for people to understand the causes and effects of date rape, we need to take a closer look at where the line is between right and wrong, and this movie does a good job of asking the viewer where that line is.There are other situations where characters choose violence and revenge rather than thinking of a better solution.  But - some of these situations seem justified, and others do not.  Once again, you as the viewer have to decide if what you're seeing is right or wrong.I must admit that I was troubled by the portrayal of the campus security as being overly suspicious of blacks, and overly sympathetic towards whites.  But this movie is meant to ask questions; not suggest that ALL white security guards are this way.  The fact that I am troubled by this portrayal means that I was forced to think about what suspicions are justified, and which are not.  This movie is full of things that make you take a stand one way or another.  It's not meant to make you feel comfortable, or to decide for you...If you like movies that overtly tell you what you're supposed to think, you may misinterpret this movie.  But if you want to see thought-provoking film that will make you ask yourself a lot of questions on where you stand, I recommend seeing this film.  Great performances by Epps, Swanson, and Michael Rappaport.  I was even pleasantly surprised by Tyra Banks performance.  8 out of 10 stars.

They're getting into groups that allegedly have the solutions and are being influenced and are being completely programmed by their peers and what they read.  And, even worse, because they're in college, they think they already have the wisdom to know what everything they're learning even MEANS!Larry Fishburne plays one of the two people who seem to know this.  He has the knowledge but also the wisdom.  That's why when Malik (played by Omar Epps) is talking to him with his new-found knowledge and why he called Larry's character a sell-out for giving him a bad grade, Larry pipes back what does it have to do with Malik's being able to spell a word properly, etc.  He also says that instead of complaining about being a second-class citizen, he should do something about it by improving himself ... by running faster.  The other one who doesn't get programmed is the guy who's into Kristy Swanson.  She says that the rally for a non-sexist society is for women only and he points out the hypocrisy in such a thing (Non-Sexist and it's for Women Only?).  He doesn't get roped into anything and just floats along.Although this movie gives highly extreme examples and hypothetical situations of just how far the programming can go when one is in college (and has the ego like they know the secrets of the universe BECAUSE they're in college), it is IMPOSSIBLE to say that it's an unrealistic movie; to this day, I have never met a college student who didn't mistake being in-the-process-of-being educated for being educated.

The white skinheads are as stereotype as they can be with Hitler yells and Nazi crosses while the black people are being presented as harmless individuals who are constantly under threat by the local police (who offcourse are racists). It's not the people in the movie who are black and white, it's the movie itself. Skip this one and if you want a better movie in this genre, check out American History X instead.

Higher Learning, while not as good or focused as his earlier Boyz N the Hood, certainly deserves a screening and is even more worthy of a subsequent debate, whether internal or not, as to how realistic and meaningful the story related is.Synopsis (at least at first glance) Several students of varying background come to large, diverse university but find themselves more segmented than ever.Outcome Singleton does a good job of making the viewer understand the backstories of the characters he focuses on, especially Omar Epps and Michael Rapaport. Indeed, Epps' story is certainly the best and most worthwhile. However, Rapaport is convincing as an outsider in search of an identity--a role that many college students find themselves in, at least at the beginning of school. Fishburne is terrific (especially in light of his Matrix character, which is quite a departure--but not totally--from the stately professor he plays here.)Since anything else I am going to say is going to be derivative of Roger Ebert's review, which really hit the mark, I can summarize quickly. This is a good movie, but it is in no way realistic. It exaggerates and highlights and twists some realities of the college experience. The movie asks you to unlearn at its finale; I ask you to decide why it comes to this conclusion.

It's either genius or crap. I found it somewhere in between, and I have to say I enjoyed it, owing mostly to Omar Epps. I believe he's one of the best actors in America right now, and his performance in this movie really made it watchable as far as I'm concerned. Many of the characters were not developed well, and were two-dimensional at best. Rappaport's character, and in fact all the white supremacists, were mere cut-outs and actually painful to watch. I didn't get the good guy/bad guy (name your race -- I think it depends on who's reviewing) theme at all. I think Epps was the protagonist and naturally he was shown in a better light than most of the other characters, black or white. There was some intelligent dialog and some inane dialog. However, it was overall an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. Not perfect by any means, and with its share of clich√©s, but a good film nonetheless.

It starts by portraying the rich OC white girls as stuck up and only wanting to get drunk and hang out with stereotypical date raping frat boys. First I am in a fraternity and we are a bunch of guys like anyone one else, we are as much capable of rape or not raping someone as anyone else. Then there's the black guys who of course have the utmost respect for the black beautiful woman and could never be as piggish as white frat boys. The black group has its idealogical leader who instead of leaving the system he fights against stays in it for 6 years. You have the preachy teacher who is like some kind of God leading the people of college through their roough times. Not once have i met a professor like this, filled with so many ideas that it would make your head spin. Then there is the loner white guy who actually has chances to hang out, people are nice to him, the frat guys accept him, his roommates except him, no one is mean to him throughout the entire film and then one weirdo asks him to be a neo nazi and he is in. He quickly shaves his head, starts carrying a gun, pulls the gun on a black man, then has the balls to show up on campus the next day. And the black women are a force too, one doesn't even know where Orange County is so she says is that near Compton, like that is the only city in CA that she knows of... And the feminist of course. Starts as a confused freshman with money problems, which don't add a thing, she talks about her dad being laid off and told she has to get a job, but she never resolves those money problems or gets a job. Eventually she gets raped and getting hammered and going home with a frat boy. It was a weird rape in the sense that she wants to have sex but just wants him to wear a condom and when he doesn't she leaves and calls it a rape. I agree its rape, but its a little harder to sympothize with. Eventually there are some culminating points, a fight between skin heads and blacks which looks like a WWE match in slow motion. And eventually a school shooting by a skin head, even though they could have made the movie interesting by having one of the black students do it, but that wouldn't make any sense now, black people don't commit school shootings, not psychotic enough. Eventually we learn that black and white can coexist, but we did not learn why, it took a school shooting for people to realize that racism is wrong...? Makes no sense and the slogan unlearn at the end in front of the American flag is even worse. To top this movie off they don't reveal ice cubes face for a while like its a big deal he stars in the movie. And Busta Rhymes adds some annoyance as well. All in all its good cause its just entertaining to watch a bunch of stereotypes run around and hate life.

Political correctness means teaching students that America is racist homophobic country and that minorities, especially African Americans indeed deserve special treatment, otherwise all hell is going to break loose. Professor Phipps, marvelously played by Lawrence Fishburne, who expresses his philosophies in a prominent British style, represents the common sense and social conservatism of higher education, something that I would have wanted to hear in all the liberal colleges I have attended. He believes that conservatism is what all students regardless of their backgrounds need to hear in order to succeed in this world. Thus he is saying, that no one will treat you special because you are Black, or White, or Hispanic, or Indian, or because you are a woman. No wonder, he is not prone to accepting leftist views from Fudge (Ice Cube)and is working very hard to dissuade Malik (Omar Epps) from being influenced by Fudge and his crew. Unfortunately, as the story winds up, Remy played by Michael Rapaport, who is actually Jewish (ironic!!) goes on a killing spree, with an intention to annihilate anybody who isn't White Christian, resulting in the death of beautiful Deja (Tyra Banks). In the aftermath, Phipps totally stunned, is seen as a person whose ideal he truly believed in, was just completely smashed into his face. The message of the movie becomes clear--if professors on campuses stop teaching from left-wing perspective, such as that Blacks should be treated special just because they are Black, and become more conservative, there are going to be tragic consequences, like the revival of KKK or Neo-Nazi staging a race war. Meaning, that right-wing conservatism is an inspiration for White supremacy.It is needless to say that the movie was made shortly after the famous Berkeley case, which struck down affirmative action there. It looks like Singleton was trying also to defend affirmative action by writing and directing Higher Learning, so he could show why it was needed in a very crude and bombastic way.

I'm not saying Higher Learning is a brainless and blunt film, but you can most certainly feel the almost simple, bludgeoning way that Singleton uses to try and get his film through to your brain. Aside from this, the film is definitely carried and made dramatically effective by a totally outstanding performance from Michael Rapaport as the confused Remmy, with his closing scenes being some of the most powerful I've seen on film in a long time. Other stand out performances include Laurence Fishburnes at times Yoda-like professor, Ice Cubes ghetto-philosopher and the neo-Nazi character of Scott. Overall, a great film that pokes you in the right places, both intellectually and emotionally, and has a very strong cast, but one that would have benefited from a more surgically precise delivery.

Long story/short, his bullied treatment from Ice Cube and his Ghetto friends manipulate him to become a Nazi skinhead.Kristen Conner is the helpless , confused ,ignorant , sympathetic , white girl.If these character descriptions seem one-dimensional and flat, then I gave them too much depth.Every negative/Angelo stereo type is depicted in this film.  You have your date-raping, beer drinking frat boys, your Rodney King type ,night-stick clubbing ,campus security guards, your ignorant bystanders and lets not forget those obligatory Neo-Nazi Skinheads, who's sentences can't be finished without uttering White Power!The members of the protagonist race, are educated, cultured, and heroicly good, without the slightest bit of ill will. One example is when the date-raping frat-boy calls Kristens' roommate a black bitch and he's gently convined to apologize by Ice Cube and his flock.If that isn't enough ,Singleton tips the scales even deeper by executing a fight scene where 105 lb rapper Busta Rymes ,single handedly fights off two skin-heads while 6'4, 350lbs skin-head , played by former body-builder Andrew Bryniarski is beat to a pulp by a guy half his size.Just when you think the odds can't get any more leveraged, the Skinheads strike back ,murdering the only passive individual to the end, and when Malick rushes to revenge this death, he is ambushed by (you guessed it) campus security in traditional Rodney King style.The only solice that Singleton gives to the villainous race in this film is dream sequence ,love scene between Swanson and Jennifer Connelly, which Singleton more then likely put in to salivate at.This film is as biased  and one-sided as a game of see-saw between Marlin Brando and Calista Flockheart.The closing of this film was a final conversation between the noble hero, Malik and some generic and ignorant member of the antagonistic race (who miraculously seemed to avoid those persuasive recruitments by the Nazi Skinheads) saying there's no hope for the races to get along I guess. It almost seems as if Singleton wants every Angelo who sees this film to drop down to their knees, crying God, why did you make me White?, Why?I recall seeing Lawrence Fishbure bring a refreshing presence to this film. Peppermint?  His first line is Welcome to the Real World I was then reminded of his great presence in The Matrix, and then it was all clear.  Matrix is reality and Higher Learning is a far as you can get from reality as possible, because all issues in this film that relate to college life make you actually believe in things like jumping 100 ft between buildings and dodging bullets from agent Smith.The very final moment of the film is the word UNLEARN.  Singleton finally said the right thing, because unlearning the last 2 hours of your life is exactly what one should do after seeing Higher LearningI think I'll side with Delro Lindo, from Get Shorty in sayingI've seen better film on teeth.Singleton can make no excuses for this ungodly concoction of smite, because he's proven that he can make a film that is true to life, heart-felt, moving, informative, well acted, inspiring and humanly meaningful (Boyz in the Hood).Higher Learning should have it's own section in the video store Sociological Science Fiction.Before anyone considers renting this, overrated, over-hyped, overly racist propaganda (with Jim Camerons' True Lies running a close 2nd) let me suggest a much more significant alternative.The underrated, under seen American History XI'll say it three times so you wont forget American History X American History X American History X "},{"Title":"This flick makes you wonder if the film makers ever went to college.","Date":"27 March 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Higher Learning is a predictable and contrived handful of college campus stereotypes all involved in worst case scenarios on the same campus at the same time with little purpose.

They remind me of characters from a film like Not Another Teen Movie. Someone like me can watch this with a certain kind of eye and find the entertainment value in it, but to a young person or an impressionable teenager, Higher Learning is borderline dangerous propaganda and nothing more.The viewer is offered an entirely one-sided depiction of the racism that black people endure on a college campus, all the way up to the end. Not one campus security guard is black, they are all white and they are all racist. They even obstruct our hero in the end instead of going after the killer.

There is no prayer what with the racist cops (they were subtly racist in the first film, i.e the beginning of the movie, but become criminally racist by the second movie, i.e. the end) beating, arresting and harassing them (while lovingly coddling the skinhead who just shot two people) at every turn.In short -- don't bother seeing this flick, seriously.Oh yeah, & the main-character's over-wrought acting at the end of the movie where he's lies bloody lamenting the loss of his girlfriend (who's been shot by a skinhead, which happens routinely at USC, right?&#133;) in the arms of Laurence Fishburne is downright embarrassing.

You watch this film, and think, oh, college was never like this when I was in it. True, however, John Singlton likes to make films that many other directors can not make, thus because their imagination of things needs to focus on the basics in life. What excaly does that mean? Well, the story is based on one very hard and evil thingracism. It's in the world, and some people go around there lives, the word racist doesn't even cross their mind. Singlton just makes films that are gut wrenching, and he so does not fail with Higher Learning. There are three main characters Malik, Remy, and Kristen. Malik, is played by Omar Epps, (love and basketball), he's on the school's running team, and if he doesn't start paying, he can say bye, bye, bye, to the team. Remy, is a shy person, he tries to make good grades, like a normal person. About halfway through the film, he falls in with a bunch of skin-heads, and they decide to get even with the school. Kristen, is played by Kristy Swanson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and she ends up raped about 20-30 minutes into the film. Her roomate, whom is black, finds out, and they turn to her friends, including Ice Cube, and they of course, find the guy, and try to beat the living crap out of him, only to be stopped by police on the campus. The whole film is not based on black verses white, it takes a look into people, their fears, hopes, and dreams. Kristen goes to a support group, run by a girl named Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), whom finds herself, uh, attracted to Kristen. The story finally ends in a bang litterally above all great film great story great ending nine out of ten stars one of Singltons best do not miss the terrific film  "}{"Title":"Ummm...

Higher Learning makes a serious effort to take no sides in its portrayal of racism in America and it is an effort that pays off in spades.

Charges of oversimplification are inevitable, and many people are going to hate it no matter what the message.I'm a white guy, but I know from friends and acquaintances that it often seems that whites just do not get what it is like to be non-white in our society. I also think that the discussion may be more open and honest in the US at present than nearly anywhere else. So if this movie seems biased against whites, at least it expresses how many African Americans really feel, especially if you realize that for some, they are much more of a minority when they arrive at college than they ever were at home.I would like to note that the movie actually did take a couple of pretty heavy swipes against the Black Panther crowd. First was the scene where Fudge orders one of the girls to go shopping. The other was when Deja and Malik are watching the boys rehearse their battle with the skinheads. Deja's open-mouthed shock underlines how primitive and violent their behavior has become.

Obviously Higher Learning doesn't stand up against Boyz in the Hood but as a standalone film it is worthy enough. I personally enjoyed it, although it had too many characters in it who weren't developed enough, it certainly had its poignant moments and Omar Epps and Cole Hauser did extremely well in there roles.The film did seem one sided in the racial issues it raised, although having seen all of Singletons films it's not surprising. This is again a reason that this film is under appreciated as if it were widely acknowledged as a good film then it may be concluded that the critics/publications agree with these views, which might upset certain people.Overall though i believe it is under-rated and should not be 6.3/10.

Ice Cube plays his friend Fudge, who does'nt like the racism surrounding the university and will take offense very easily the minute he hears the N-word or any other racist comment.

A film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.There are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story Malik Williams, an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American male. Kristin Conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and Remy, a unsophisticated unconnected white male. All three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared (Malik), by being naive (Kristin), and by being unwanted (Remy).One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large. The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. It is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students. It would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.But it didn't and that's where the films falls apart. Singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at Southern California. Through this film he lets it all hang out. There is no need to beat around the bush here. Singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.The black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student.Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her? The ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence? The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube ,Busta Rhymes, and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film.John Singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life with this film. And he did so quite badly. It was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this. Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. Seeing the film ,then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to.

And this is one of his better films. Not quite as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to it (and with much of the same stellar cast). This film was very well written, very well put together, and very well shot. There's very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff? No mention of a rich background... And why doesn't Professor Phibbs have an office? A professor of his stature *should* have one... And while we're at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, Remy's a pretty dumb character - I'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon).But that aside, the film was very sharp. A good array of characters and points of view; and Singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of interspersing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides.Much of the cinematography was excellent; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne each scene spliced together really well. Also the Malik/Deja scenes were really well shot as well.The dialogue was a bit much at times; this film had a tendency to get *really* preachy at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness (we really didn't need the US flag with 'UNLEARN' typed onto it, give some credit, we're not morons...). And to top it off, although *most* of the time Singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets *way* too cheezy (like Deja's death, which is fine until she screams out 'WHY!!!' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene).But the acting, in general, was top of the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act??), Michael Rapaport (surprised the hell out of me...after True Romance and Beautiful Girls I though he was a one-role actor), and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are *always* outstanding.Downside? Jennifer Connelly was flat; though it's not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrid. She whined and whined and whined. Yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably (though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule).Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) which fits the film like a glove. Each scene has a twin song (although the Tori Amos songs started to *really* annoy me by the end...not her best work).

It reminds me of alot of what's going on in schools still in this year.    I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great movie.

I think Singleton was using a college campus as a microcosm of America. Hence Columbus (discovering America) University and the full screen of the American flag at the end. When seen in that context, I believe the film makes more sense. While what was depicted might not happen at a single university, it certainly had happened in America's history and the stereotypes he portrayed can certainly be modeled from real people. And in the past 5 years how many school shootings have there been???? Unrealistic, I don't think so.

It's full of emotion and the direction is done well.  The storyline progresses very quickly, but I guess that's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie.  This is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy. "}{"Title":"Magnificent, Beautiful, Accurate 21st C. College Experience","Date":"16 March 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I have seen movies of all shapes and forms, and this one is the BEST of its breed.The theme song, Tori Amos' Butterfly, is the piano piece that sticks in everyone's minds after watching this magnificently created, beautifully written, factually accurate college experience.  This movie meshes everything a college student is expected and not to learn.  Everything that he/she is not told of the CHANGE THEY WILL GO THROUGH after experiencing love, hate, racism, fear, anger, happiness, challenges, successes, achievements, confusion, escapism, teamwork, academic excellence.  I can go on and on about it.The cast is amazing, their skills are unsurpassed.  NOWHERE!  And being a college student who has interacted with all sorts throughout the years by traveling across the USA multiple times, nothing can bring me more to tears than the harsh REALITY this movie provides. Off to college?  Children in college?  Friends in college and want to know what they REALLY go through, and how they became a better man/woman?Go rent it... it speaks for itself.Tears... tears... tears...

John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece.  Brilliant performances by the whole cast, but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.However, as a college student myself, many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme.  In a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe.  In some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur.  However, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think.  One of the things from this picture I will remember forever, was a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character, Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power.  Brilliant, just brilliant.

Racial conflicts aren't usually this entire, but it's a good dramatization of how they could be. Because it depicts racial relationships in such a manner, it better shows what can, and often does happen. No one is right, that's certain, and we're more than the color of our skin. Still, most of us let that divide us..... We have many lessons to learn.

To these days, the events displayed on Higher Learning still happen in college campus everywhere. Not only in America I must say. The movie's film makers tried to do a clever, dramatic movie about discrimination on America and did a very good job showing that Neo-Nazis with nothing better to lose still have primitive ideas, or that gay couples are not secure in a homophobic society. The situations are very well done and many people can relate to them as discrimination is a sickness in modern society. The acting is pretty good. Omar Epps delivers a strong, believable performance as the lead. But Kristy Swanson demonstrates that she is a good actress and gives a perfect performance. The rest of the cast is great. Special mention deserves Jennifer Connelly for two things 1) delivering a good performance. This woman knows how to demonstrate feelings just by looking at her eyes. 2) For being that HOT in all of her scenes. She is a pleasure to watch. Watch this movie as a supporting material on how discrimination was in the 90's. It's an entertaining movie that will make you think about how lucky you are if you haven't been a victim of discrimination in all of it's categories.

It has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in University can be.  There are 3 main story lines, the skinheads, the African-Americans, and the homosexuals.  I was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about Kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl.  The end was great.  After seeing the movie 25 times plus, I still cry.  I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to settlefor 10/10.

Its not everyday that a film director has the guts to face an issue which is so rife and fresh in the minds of people today "},{"Title":"Higher Learning Explores Social Problems on Campus ***","Date":"15 March 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" Interesting film revolving around racism, resulting prejudice and life at a college.We have some interesting performances here by Omar Epps, as a student, with hang-ups and Laurence Fishburne, as a tough political science professor who chides his own people for being lazy.4 years before she won the Oscar, Jennifer Connolly again plays a college student.Interestingly, Michael Rapaport, who I believe is Jewish in real life, plays someone weak in mind who is drawn into a neo-Nazi movement with tragedy resulting.The film is good especially when it tries to show that the college crowd try to get together for toleration of each other, but unfortunately violence ensues.The police are made to come off badly in this film. No matter what, black students are routinely harassed and beaten.The picture succeeds since it points out the need for human understanding and tolerance.

This stroy is about the problems between white people and black people. The story is quit dramatic and you get to feel for the different persons.The ending is really rough and made me think for a long time. All in all a god movie,but not as good as John Singleton's Boys in the hood.

It dealt with issues of rascism and class. But, it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. This movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. The actors I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. At a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is, but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie.

It was definitely worth a rewind or two. Aside from that titillating moment the movie is really stupid. It made Neo-Nazis seem like weak, pick-on little boys (which they aren't), it made lesbians look hot (which most aren't) The only redeeming quality was that it showed how the whole brotherhood of man thing really didn't work out and that some people are just downright hateful and that this was years before Columbine. Lawrence Fishburne was weird and that rule about a comment having 10 lines or more is really gay because I wasn't planning on pontificating to any great degree I just wanted to let people know that the kissing scene is in there.
