[{"Title":"Animation is not just for kids and male teens.","Date":"8 October 2002","Score":"120 out of 130 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" I waited a bit before contributing a review for I wanted to read a few reviews to see if what I thought would be true...and it is. So let a lady step in and point out a few things for those who are interested in viewing this film.This film was actually started in 1978, and finally released in 1981 and I was there to see it. It is based on the adult fantasy sci-fi America version magazine Heavy Metal. The original origin of the magazine is French, very adult, very graphic, very sci-fi, lotsa nudity BUT excellent and compelling storytelling.The key phrase is Adult, Fantasy, Illustrated.Just because its a 'cartoon', does not mean its for kids.Looking at the Animation now in 2002, its dated. In the mid-80's Japanese Anime has set and kept raising the bar on this kind of adult anime genre. This early mainstream American attempt was good, for it had a good model, the magazine, Heavy Metal.If Heavy Metal had waited to be produced until now, with all the advancements on technology, animation, graphics, art we have at our disposal, I only wish that the popular artists and storytellers of the magazine Heavy Metal were involved. It would be a different film indeed, and it would get an NC-17 rating. The only pieces that were trademarks of the Heavy Metal magazine were Soft Landing/Grimaldi Den and Taarna.More specifically, Taarna WAS exactly what the American Heavy Metal Magazine was all about and uncredited was Jean Giraud who has done a hell of a lot of work in the magazines history....both American and French versions is the cause for that. You may know his work by his other more famous name, Moebius.If you ask me, the film could have gone one of two ways just like the magazine story by story without the silly connector of the green orb, or with just the one story of Taarna. Back in 1978-1981, I would assume the Studio Executives could not venture into that manner without getting squeamish about box office so what we have is a tip-toe cross blend between the two. On one level it works, on another it does not. Its a viewers decision.I like this 1981 version of the movie Heavy Metal, although a few stories didn't live up to the level of the magazine content..or were not presented as such. Neverwhereland should have NEVER been cut, I would have taken it over Captain Stern any day. Neverwhereland seemed to be along the lines of the magazines' content, too bad it wasn't included. Harry Canyon I could have taken or left, made no difference.Additionally, I JUST loved Den and B-17. I loved the soundtrack, for Metal is America. But just like the magazine, it was adult, it was fantasy, violent at points and contained nudity. It was early R Adult Animation American Style. (I know...Fritz the Cat was an X rated Animation that instead of using humans, used felines. Besides, Fritz was Ralph Bakshi's ticket outa Disney Animation and Robert Crumb is the 70's counter culture!)This film, Heavy Metal was also marketed as the male dream Metal Music, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Nudity.But wait...why was I...a woman interested?!?!?It was Taarna. This was the first animated woman in an American made mainstream animated adult feature film that the world needed, that the world depended upon, that was tough, that was independent, not a size four but voluptous, and was still very sexy. Nowadays, it may not mean much, but in 1981 when I was a teen and saw this, it meant a lot. Snow White, she wasn't and was she the Wicked Witch of the West either and that is how women were portrayed up till the release of Heavy Metal.When I read a few stories in the adult magazines Heavy Metal from the late 70's to the early 90's, both American and French versions, the women in the majority of the stories, although drawn by European men and set in uncertain futures, wear...and in many cases...don't wear at all... and involved in explicit sexual situations..the women WERE the heroes!!All in all, keep in mind Heavy Metal was made for an adult audience, just like the magazine. It's not just for the teenaged guys, its not just for the stoned and metal heads, its not just for the trekies or x-filers. It's a good effort for its time but if you're expectting work like in late 80s/90's Japanese Anime like Katsuhiro Ôtomo's Akira, etc., or 2001's Taro Rin's Metropolis remember its 1981, and American, and NOT quite like its name sake Magazines, but its still good.

Well, I just have to say that this comment is incorrect. I myself was not produced until after the film had been around for some years (*raises hand* 1986), and I highly enjoy this wonderful flick.I got the chance to sit down and watch the movie with my mother when I was 13, and I instantly fell in love with it. I love the way the green orb links the stories together, the humor, the music, and yes - even the animation.True, the animation is nothing compared to the stuff that's out there these days, but this film is a classic. If you don't understand the film's stories, then you clearly weren't paying attention. Heavy Metal magazine is fantastic, and this movie is nothing short of the magazine's beautiful creativity.Also? Comparing Heavy Metal to its sequel, Heavy Metal 2000, is simply wrong. Heavy Metal 2000 pales in comparison to the original. Sure, the soundtrack is amazing, but in my opinion, that's about it.

A true cult classic, and second in Midnight Movie viewing only to Rocky Horror.I think one reason that this movie was looked forward to for so long is that it was unavailable for so long.  I remember around 1984 when a release was planned, and a dispute with the multiple musicians caused it to be pulled.  But thankfully this was finally resolved, so we can own it again.I bought a pirate copy when i was in Japan in 1988 (On Beta no less), and almost played it to death.  And having been a fan of the comic when I could find it, I think it told the stories very well.  I admit that the green sphere link was silly and did not work, and that the original carousel concept would have been much better (watch the DVD release for details on this).  The simple fact that I have bought 3 copies of this time and still own all 3 of them says something about the movie.Harry Canyon, Den, and Taarna are the be the most remembered pieces of this movie.  Each in itself could even be fleshed out to hour long length, and still be enjoyable.  So Beautiful, So Dangerous is enjoyable, and Harold Ramis and John Candy steal the show with their voices (Hey man, you got any of that plutonium niborg left?).  And I admit, the film version of the story was MUCH more enjoyable then the original one from the comic.PS  Watch for the cameo of a destroyed USS Enterprise.  I love pointing that out to people that miss it.

Heavy Metal was and is an anthology of the best of American and European comic writers and artists.  It has carried the work of such masters as Moebius, Druillet, Liberatore, Bernie Wrightson, Howard Chaykin, Walt Simonson, Arthur Sydam, Enki Bilal, Richard Corben and Simon Bisley.  The movie adapts some of the great stories from the glory days of the magazine.The movie is much like the magazine a mixed bag of sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy, and erotica.  Some of it is good, some not.  My personal favorites are Harry Canyon, Den, Captain Sternn, B-17, and Tarna.  Harry Canyon is a sci-fi tale of thugs, femme fatales, and cynics ala Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, transported to the future.  It has been cited as an inspiration for The Fifth Element, by some; but it bears some resemblance to the works of French artist, Moebius, who created designs for The Fifth Element.  Moebius also factors into Tarna, as the entire look of this sequence is almost xeroxed from Moebius' Arzach stories.Captain Sternn is the anti-hero/criminal from Bernie Wrightson, co-creator of Swamp Thing and illustrator of a beautiful edition of Frankenstein. This is a fun sequence, full of comedy and chaos, much like the Sternn stories. Sternn has more than a slight resemblance to a certain Kryptonian.B-17 captures the flavor of the old EC horror comics, like Tales from the Crypt and the Vault of Horror.  The sequence features design work from Mike Ploog, a horror comics master and artist of Marvel's Man-Thing. It has a nice creepy, decayed atmosphere and lets the visuals tell the story.Den is adapted from Richard Corben's tales.  The melon-breasted women that Corben is known for are on fine display here.  We also get the humor that also permeates Corben's work.  John Candy was quite good here, giving Den the perfect adolescent voice.Tarna is the most lush sequence, with sweeping vistas and the use of rotoscoping for the character.  It is also quite violent.  Again, it owes a great deal to Moebius' Arzach.So Beautiful, So Dangerous is pretty forgettable, with juvenile humor and boring animation.  Soft Landing is fairly pointless, except to serve as a title sequence.  The whole linking device is unnecessary, as the segments bear little relation to one another and are stronger as separate entities. The soundtrack is great, with most pieces capturing the flavor of the animation.Ultimately, the uneven stories and lower budget animation holds this movie back.  The movie is best viewed as an anthology, rather than a complete story, and with a forgiving eye to the budget.  With that said, it's still entertaining and an important work of adult animation.

I notice quite a few comments from people who were in their teens when they saw this movie and identified with it and now who cannot fathom it.  To them I say, it's not for you now.  It was for you then.  This is one of those movies that is aimed at  people from the ages of 16 to 20 who are just starting to see what the world is about and what a difference they can make if they try.  It's about having dreams and pursuing them and it's about making sure that you don't get carried away in the process.  It gives you an idea of what awaits you in the wide world and yet it tells you that if you hold true to what you are and make things happen you will get what you want out of life in the end.  Now, the animation isn't as good as even the old Batman/Tarzan Saturday morning cartoons of the 70's, but it has style for days.  The soundtrack has become a top selling CD although released years afterwards.  The voice characterizations are as good as any animated film ever made. And last but not least, it has John Candy, who, in my book, just has to show up to make a movie.  Whether you stay to watch the rest of that particular movie is entirely up to you ... 9 out of 10.

However, for when it was made the animation was top notch. It does have a great voice cast and the music is great. I graduated highschool in 1991 with long hair down my back. I went to my senior prom wearing a Motley Crue t-shirt--so nothing more to be said. I think anyone like me must appreciate Heavy Metal at least on some level. I also appreciate it for the art work and the small details. Watching a beatiful warrior godess slowly don her ridiculously sexy red outfit before wielding a sword to gut a bunch of mutants--it couldn't get any better. The movie as a whole, a conglomerate of strangley unrelated yet joined stories, makes this movie a cult classic--as true as they come. Perhaps that is what is lacking in Heavy Metal 2000--truely a sad attempt as a sequel, with no potential of ever being a worthy classic to sit on a shelf next to the original. The FAKK sword is the coolest thing about the movie, besides the Simon Beasley cover art. At least I think that's Simon's work and not Royo's--perhaps someone could confirm that. Okay, but not to stray from the topic of Heavy Metal (1981)---take it for what it is--don't over analyze it. Sit back, have a few laughs, poke fun at it, and at the end I think it's worth the watch.

This is Heavy Metal!The concept of this 1981 animated experiment is two-fold show good and evil in a constant state of flux, and bring to life the richness and erotic energy of the popular animated magazine. Add to that some science fiction, a slight reverence for history (in the beautiful ghoul scene in the WWII B-17) and a juvenile insight into drugs and sex, and you have the definition of my '80s youth culture.I was one of those kids who'd sneak an issue of Heavy Metal, found on the magazine stands in the local drug store next to the grocery store where my father did his weekly shopping, inside another magazine and stare at the drawings, looking for some violence and humor ... and naked women with bi g breasts. I did the same thing whenever I got my hands on a National Lampoon and, if I was lucky, Hustler.It's pre-pubescence at its hormonal best! And seeing it again as an adult brings all that excitement back to me. Every story, every piece of music ... God, every shot for that matter -- they all bring me back to being 10 years old and wrestling with my older cousin as she tried to block my eyes when the chick Harry Canyon picks up off the street strips and slides into bed with him to the tune of Journey's Open Arms.This movie wasn't meant to be cinematic greatness. It was meant to be a boy's fantasy and his coming of age. Sometimes we take these things too seriously. A good movie is a good movie, and a good memory is a good memory.

This movie sure ain't politically correct -- and that's exactly why it's such a hugely enjoyable blast from the funky early 80's past.An evil glowing orb called the Loknar (the supremely sinister and velvet smooth voice of Percy Rodriguez) spreads its malign influence throughout the decades and galaxies. First tale, Harry Canyon - Cynical cabbie Harry (marvelously voiced to weary perfection by veteran character actor Richard Romanus of Mean Streets) gets involved with a sexy young lass in a bleak and rundown futuristic New York. Second yarn, Den - A nerdy teenager (affably voiced by the late, great John Candy) winds up on another planet where he's transformed into a bald and brawny behemoth. Third romp, Captain Sternn - Sleazy scoundrel Captain Sternn stands on trail for his many heinous indiscretions. John Vernon scores strongly as the angry voice of the prosecuting attorney. Fourth opus, B-17 - A very creepy and gruesome World War II zombie outing. Fifth vignette, So Beautiful and So Dangerous - A couple of wacky aliens and their goofy robot buddy abduct a sassy hot Jewish chick. Harold Ramis and Eugene Levy are hilarious as the Cheech and Chong-style stoner pilots of a giant smiley face spaceship. Candy once again is a delight as the voice of the charming and amorous robot. Sixth outing, Taarna - A lethal and lovely mute warrior woman mixes it up with a vicious horde of nasty marauders.Boy, does this picture rate highly as the ideal guy flick we've got a fantastic roaring rock soundtrack (Cheap Trick, Black Sabbath, Devo, Grand Funk Railroad, Nazareth, Blue Oyster Cult, Journey, Stevie Nicks and much more), plenty of sidesplitting sophomoric humor, stunningly voluptuous and often naked women, a handy helping of gore, a nice smattering of soft-core sex, a blithely breezy'n'carefree tone, and no pretense whatsoever to get in the way of the infectiously trashy fun.

There's a whole lot of demons to slay, a rocking soundtrack, and yes, boobs. There's a lot of animated boobs in this flick. With all this overloading imagery on display, its difficult to concentrate on the story aspects of the production. That may be as well, because the stories themselves are rather hit and miss. Harry Canyon and B-17 are really cool and entertaining science fiction tales, one which accurately capture the feel of a good comic book (not surprising, because Heavy Metal was originally a comic book publication). The rest of the stories aren't nearly as good, but even than the visuals are enjoyable enough.Another criticism of the film is the soundtrack, for two reasons. The first being more minor in that many of the artists included aren't heavy metal. Stevie Nicks, Journey, Cheap Trick, and Devo (as much as I love the latter two bands) don't even qualify as pop-metal. Even more disappointing is the fact the soundtrack seems muted throughout the film. The dialog isn't remotely important, so the soundtrack should have been a whole lot louder.

After killing the astronaut guy, the glowing green ball of doom starts harassing/torturing/tormenting the poor girl with stories of its evil antics across the universe - stories that yo-yo wildly back and forth between absurdist humor to dark fantasy to horror, most if not all with an element of science fiction in it, and almost all of them very heavy on the eroticism.1) Harry Canyon the story of a crass, cynical New York cab driver in the post Apocalyptic future. One day he gets caught up in a conspiracy that involves the Loc-Nah.2) Den A nerdy teenager nerd boy picks up the Loc-Nah after it crash lands in his backyard. When he tries to experiment on it, he gets flung into an alternate dimension planet called Neverwhere Land, where he is transformed in a giant bald beef-cake with superhuman strength, pursued by beautiful, busty women (one of them a Native of Earth who was also transformed from a frail, unhealthy girl into a beautiful, more womanly individual). He too is caught up in a plot involving the Loc-Nah, which is also in this world, and is the pinpoint in a big huge sacrifice.3) Captain Stern A ruggedly handsome but irredeemably evil scoundrel is on trial for his various misdeeds, but he bribes a weakling named Hanover Fist to speak on his behalf at the trial, but Hanover gets a hold of the Loc-Nah, and it may or may not influence his Hulk like rampage at the trial. But will the righteously brutish version of Hanover win out over the evil Captain Lincoln F. Stern? 4) Zombies on a plane a sequence involving zombies tearing up an old WW II fighter plane and its ill-fated passengers.5) Stoner Aliens & the randy robot A beautiful, buxom red head secretary is abducted by two stoner aliens and their over-sexed robot, who then take us on a space odyssey like no other.6) The last story concerns the last Tarakian Taarna, a beautiful yet silent warrior woman with white hair who rides a flying pterodactyl is given the task of thwarting a race of green skilled mutants, who owe their very existence to the Loc-Nah after the thing crashed into a volcano. Though the beautiful Taarna is captured, stripped naked, tortured (possibly raped) and left for dead, she ultimately prevails in thwarting the mutants and destroying the Loc-Nah. The last story comes back to the present where the Loc-Nah is destroyed once again, revealing that the girl is in fact the next Tarakian.Uneven but atmospheric, very hit and miss, as tends to be the case with a lot of these adult animated epics. The Den sequence is probably the most entertaining, thanks in no small part to the voice performance of the late John Candy as the nerd & his brawny alter ego. Also worth a look for the Elmer Bernstein score as well as the look at old school animation.

Not a criticism, just an observation.  When you add graphic violence, elements of sci-fi and fantasy, and relatively crude animation to the busty nymphos, you have a slapdash, strangely affecting film that is both irritating and fascinating.As has been mentioned in several comments, the quality of the stories vary from dull to captivating.  The taxi driver tale and the story about the young geek who becomes a muscular hulk are weird and fun to watch; others, like the final story about an avenging beauty clad in a skimpy system of straps, are tedious and revel too much in their unique brand of kinkiness.  However, the story about the fighter plane which becomes infested with the living dead is an underappreciated gem.The writing is average and the animation is pedestrian when compared with some of today's animated classics (The Iron Giant, Tarzan), but Heavy Metal is an amusing enough exercise in rock and roll cartooning.  (The selection of music is hit-and-miss as well, and the exclusion of Ted Nugent is inexcusable.)  If you rent this not expecting much, you might be pleasantly surprised.

And just a couple of words about the animation. Most American animations I've seen fell into two categories  Ugly and Disneyish. I like Disney's movies - the ones that Disney actually directed, but the movies made by the studio years later are annoying.

The humor in this movie is superb because it is very subtle. The animation (especially for the time period) is exquisite if not, enchanting. You can't be doing something else while watching this movie however, because you could get very easily lost that way. It is a series of short stories and often times it is not defined where one ends and a new one begins. But if you watch it intently, it comes together very nicely, and somewhat unexpectedly at the end and makes the whole movie worthwhile.  I am NOT looking forward to Heavy Metal 2000 for I heard it was quite a bit of hogwash (to put it nicely). And how could we expect any different after all these years?  After all, Heavy Metal was really the first mainstream adult cartoon.  Now, adult cartoons are like an old hat.

My favorite episodes are Den, a light-hearted romp which could also be viewed as a satyrization of the film's target audience, Taarna, the film's redemptive conclusion, and   B-17, my personal favorite.

When the world awoke form it's boring funk, disco, brown-yellow-orange-colored slumber after Star Wars shook it awake and revived sci-fi, heavy metal appeared during the aftershocks and created albeit for a small public a visual feast. Heavy metal is usually described as a void fest for stoners and granted with the proper intoxication the movie's charm is increased greatly. What makes heavy metal so appealing is what many people call it's principal flaws, the pubescent jokes, violence, plethora of nudity, the crude animation and often its bright explosive colors. But these are not flaws, in fact to anyone with a fun-loving nature and imagination these are virtues. The script is wonderful, with lot's of crude jokes, that make excellent one-liners during parties. Death, death to all who oppose us has to be a classic introduction-line for a villain (who is menacingly one dimensional. And has anybody wondered where his helmet comes from?)At moment the script even becomes epic, like during the sequence where the council of elders summon Taarna.Although the animation maybe dated and even downright ugly, it gives the movie it's charm, the same as Ralph Bakshi's animation gives it, it's cult-charm and those with imagination see what the animators tried to accomplish. The backgrounds are simply stunning. From epic landscapes with cycloptic animal skeleton's cradling entire cities to impressive space-vessels and space-stations(Mark the brick-motief of the space-station during the Sternn sequence,hahaha) The color schemes of these backgrounds are daring and vibrant.And there are boobs, lot's of voluptuous big-breasted women! I think this needs no further clarification.The music is excellent. The soundtrack features a lot of decent hard rock tracks(I'm not writing heavy metal, because of inane debates by metal-purists (mostly with ugly goatees) that these are not metal-songs. Thank god, No!)And there's the majestic score by the late Elmer Bernstein. That simply blows you away with it's beauty (Listen to the Den sequence when the queen flies on the dragonflies, how the trumpets and the lower brass are sequestered by two themes, one rising, on descending.)So in a dull world where tedious monochromatic fantasy trilogies pass for a good time, Heavy Metal is the lost jewel, that fortunately is discovered every generation. So gather your friends, get some beers and pizza-bagels and watch this movie, you'll love it.

It combines different genres (adventure, crime, drama, sci-fi, comedy and horror) with R-Rated elements (sex, nudity, gore, extreme violence and profanity) all done in cel animation. I personally think this film is a huge mess but certain parts are very well done. The film opens in space with Elmer Bernsteins haunting score playing. As the credits role we watch a model animated astronaught return to Earth on a space-vehicle. This credits sequence is awesome, combining the stop-animated and sometimes hand painted animated astronaut. Then we meet a green globe which represents pure evil. It tells storys of how it has been around for ever all around the galaxy and what it has done to it. The first story is, OK. It's predicible and ends kind of lamely but it's OK. The second story is pretty much a big mess. It's called Den about a nerd who gets transported to a place where he is the hero and sleeps with every woman who wants him and saves the world and the alien civilization. It's really nothing more that a 12 year old perverts fantasy and it's a waste of time. The third story is better than the firts few called Captain Stern and it reminds me of the old Nelvana animated cartoon shows except for the language that is. The fourth story is a masterpiece. It's called B-17. It opens up as WWII fighters and planes are battling each other. The only surviving plane, being of course a B-17, flys off after all of the others have also gone or have been destroyed. The only surrviving people on the plane are the pilots and one of them goes back to see what's going on. He sees that everyone else has died of bullet wounds. Then a circular green meteor-like object lands on the plane for a short moment and then leaves. When the meteor leaves, the dead bodies of the men come back alive, as skeletons who's organs are falling out. Now the 2 pilots must face ultimate evil while trying to escape the B-17. This story reminds me of old EC comic books such as Tales from the Crypt and Vault of Horror. This was extremely well done, accompanied by an awesome and haunting score by Elmer Bernstein, the animation was done so that it looks like you're watching a living horror comic book on your TV. The 5th story is another excuse to show sex and pathetic antics. This time with a sex-crazed robot and 2 drug addicted aliens. The last story is so boring, I don't even feel like talking about it; it's so poorly written and looong, it's the longest segment in the film and not even Bernstein's score can save it and it was worse to find out that the end that the whole bookended storyline (with the meteor and the girl) ties in with the last one. I'd say that this movie has one excellent segment which should be scene by horror comic book fans, but the rest is terrible.

Heavy Metal was an animation landmark pioneering adult fantasy with modernized standards of gore, nudity, language, etc. As a cult-fan I find watching it infinitely enjoyable. As a critic, I want to briefly review this film's technical achievements and pros1. The animation was unparalleled for its time by making uses of early 3D rendering, cell shading over live-action photography, panoramic landscapes, multiple moving sprites, and amazing detailed cross- hatching.2. The stories are nostalgic the way they reiterate, in an adult sense, fantastic themes from literature we read as kids. Respectfully, I think the beautifully expressed motifs are derived out of ultimate male fantasy which are boys share once in the lives.3. Though sometimes lacking a coherent moral, the writing stays fresh and balanced enough to keep you entertained.4. The voice cast includes legends like John Candy, Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty, and John Vernon who all give memorable performances.5. The Soundtrack (both the rock music and classical score) is perfectly conceived to accommodate the strangeness of this film.In conclusion, I feel this is one of those movies where its shortcomings do not hamper the artistry.

Unlike most animated films at the time, Heavy Metal combined heavy metal music, blood-n-guts and nudity in an animated feature. The result was a somewhat daring film. While adult animation had been done before (Ralph Bakshi films like Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic), Heavy Metal took things to a whole new level.Based on the magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal is an anthology film. It has six different segments, all strung together with a plot. A green orb that is all evil in the universe called the Loc-Nar tells these six stories to a young girl.The first of these stories, Harry Canyon, is an original story that is not adapted from the magazine. However, it does draw inspiration from some other stories from the magazine. The Harry Canyon segment is well-told and has a touch of film noir in it. The portrayal of New York in 2031 was rather grim. A lot of music is used in different scenes.Den, based on Richard Corben's character, is the story of a 14-year-old who becomes a muscular man in a place called Neverwhere, due to an experiment he conducted one night. This segment was pure fantasy, with fight scenes and fantastic artwork throughout. In this story, the Loc-Nar is worshiped. Captain Sternn is a more comedic segment in the film. Captain Sternn's pleads not guilty during his trial. His angle, Hanover Fiste, is there to praise him, as he will be paid to do this. However, with the Loc-Nar in his hands, he begins to reveal the truth about Sternn and becomes a giant and chases Sternn throughout the space station.B-17 is probably my favorite segment in the film, based on the story by Dan O'Bannon. During WWII, the Loc-Nar hunts down a severely damaged B-17 bomber and turns the dead crew into zombies. This segment was truly creepy, and unlike most of today's horror films, it gets to the point and ends in a freaky Twilight Zone-style ending.So Beautiful, So Dangerous is not a strong segment story-wise, but it's one of the funniest segments in the film. Some of the best songs on the soundtrack are on this scene as well, and the animation is very colorful and detailed here. The two stoner aliens are the best. The film concludes with the epic Taarna segment, an original story that is somewhat lengthy in its structure. With its epic fight scenes, amazing backgrounds and its grand scope, Taarna is a great finale.The soundtrack is the best thing about the film. There's nearly twenty different songs from many different artists, ranging from Black Sabbath to Sammy Hagar to even bands like Grand Funk Railroad and Journey. It's a very diverse mix and the songs on here are all very good. Black Sabbath's The Mob Rules goes great with the barbarians' invasion of the peaceful village in Taarna, and Don Felder's Heavy Metal (Takin' A Ride) makes the beginning of the B-17 segment pure excitement.The animation is one thing I get a bit cynical with. Despite some great effects (particularly on the Taarna segment), some of the character animation seemed a bit poor. There was a lot of rotoscoping used in the film, but some of the character animation wasn't very subtle.Aside from a few flaws in the animation and the story, Heavy Metal is still an enjoyable film. Even though some critics look back on it and called it dated and juvenile, it doesn't seem to effect the quality of the film. Some say it hasn't aged well, but to me, it's still fine. It is a bit juvenile, yes, but the film is still great. What this film did show was what the animation medium was capable of doing. Setting animation to heavy metal is quite an achievement, with compelling storytelling and epic moments to boot. This film proves that animation can do anything.A 9.6 out of 10.

It was all I needed to see to know this wasn't an issue of Spider-Man. I didn't understand the reasons as to why any artist or writer would even create such a thing, but I understand now. The worship of the phallic symbol, the slaying of a male dominated society, perhaps? The movie takes on the surrealistic touch on the same thing, everything from a crummy sci-fi future taxi cab to a fantasy setting with lots of breasts and violence. It includes several short stories, including a wrap-around story. If you don't like one story, you are going to love at least one other. I personally liked Harry Canyon & Taarna, but I enjoyed the others as well.While it may seem obvious that the amount of nudity and violence will attract teens and older geeks, animation has continued to make strides in a variety of genres. Heavy Metal had so much to offer aside from this. It could have been a stepping stone to much larger projects where a live action camera can not compete with. But, alas, here in America we have hit a wall in creativity for the animated adult market, and it just about ended with Heavy Metal. Movies like A Scanner Darkly, or even South Park come around rarely, and I find myself dipping into the only thing I can, and that's Japanese anime. It has evolved to the point where deep character study, stunning visuals, & great story lines is the norm.As of this writing, May 2009, rumors exist that a new Heavy Metal is to be made.

All transitions between visual styles and effects were pretty much seamless, and as a result, the images portrayed in the movie really had me drawn in to the many worlds shown in the Heavy Metal universe.Of course it would be important to mention sound for this movie, which like the visual effects was done in a very stylized way, considering it won awards for its audio aspects, I can safely say the sound effects as well as the soundtrack are amazing, everything fits together.All in all, this movie has done it all, it's got fantastic humor, it's got plenty of action, and it it's suspenseful at all the right moments. I give it a 9 out of 10 on the basis that I couldn't fully justify a 10 out of 10 without writing an essay (even though this is probably already quite long).

Major plot Spoilers Ahead!First thing's first do not watch this movie for any coherent plot or narrative; you won't find it. The story about the Loc Nar is an afterthought, poorly tacked on to tie in the six vignettes; for two of them, Captain Stern and So Beautiful Yet So Dangerous, the connection is not clear at all. With that out of the way...This cartoon is deservedly considered a path-breaker in adult animation. It is a lovely piece of schlock that features sex, nudity, and mutilations to the nines, all to the sounds of a hard rock soundtrack (it does so better than the coordination between music and action in Goodfellas). I am not a fan of rotoscoping or Xeroxing; the use of real-life models in some scenes makes this film look rather cheap. It is certainly no ground-breaker in animation quality, but overall the style is not too terrible. This film, depending on the vignette, oscillates wildly between genres and animation styles, from semi-serious drama styles, with realistic humans, in the Harry Canyon short, to horror movie realism in B-17, to cartoony and comical aliens and humans in Captain Stern and So Dangerous, and serious and epic styles for the sword-and-sorcery Taarna story. This extreme in animation styles may seem like it would make for a terrible film, but it works here. There are lovely background designs for many of the settings, such as futuristic cityscapes, the interiors of spaceships, and eerie and alien desert landscapes. I presume these were inspired by the other-worldly stories and art from Heavy Metal Magazine. This film is a quintessential camp popcorn flick for the grown-ups; or, in other words, it is sweet and satisfying brain candy. It earned cult status as a midnight movie, much like Rocky Horror, and I must say this film is in the same league as mindless fun. The guys will love it for the exaggeratedly bosomy---and often naked---beauties that populate the stories. Those who watch the DVD must also view the documentary that explains the creation of this movie. The creators explicitly admit that their inclusion of naked women and blood-and-guts was pure teenage wish fulfillment. They also state that the Loc-Nar storyline was an afterthought to the individual stories themselves. Scenes to watch for the goof-ball aliens who snort mile-long lines of coke from the floor of their spaceship, while their robot captain (voiced by John Candy, and who looks like some 1950s toy you'd find in an antique shop)beds a lovely secretary; Taarna's long dressing scene in the temple, done to an epic-sounding tune; the barbarians sacking a town to a loud thumping heavy metal tune; bomber pilots getting shot to pieces to a hard rock tune; and Journey's Open Arms in the Harry Canyon sequence.

Its Tarentino narrative style and dropped-in-the-middle exposition can't help but upset if you're not expecting it.

Granted if you compare it to today's animation and CGI graphics standards, HEAVY METAL might be a pile of worthless crap. But bear in mind WHEN was this movie released. It's like trashing something like The Day The Earth Stood Still just because it doesn't look and sound like ATTACK OF THE CLONES! Anyway, I was 13 years old when I first saw the TV ad for HEAVY METAL. That ad literally changed my life. I purchased the album 3 years before watching the movie (I finally watched it on a Betamax in 1984!). I must confess that it was the ALBUM rather than the FILM that had the biggest impact I went on to become a metalhead, and I still am to this day! Although, the album is not JUST heavy metal music. It has stuff by Stevie Nicks, Don Felder, Donald Fagen and some really mellow stuff. But, it has some really hard stuff (at least, by early 80's standards) by CHEAP TRICK, SAMMY HAGAR, BLACK SABBATH, NAZARETH, TRUST, RIGGS and other bands. When I finally saw the movie I thought the story was a bit contrived; the movie tries to be just like the adult magazine it was based upon, and include many stories all linked together by the story of a malignant glowing orb. The animation varies from story to story. There's some graphic violence and some over the edge sex scenes and nudes. Had this been done with real actors, it would have been X rated or at least an NC-17! The final story of TAARNA is the real deal here, although the other stories are fun and sometimes even frightening (like the B-17 story). The TAARNA story uses some rotoscoping (a technique where a real actor is shot on film and the animation is done on top, making it look very realistic), something that Ralph Bakshi used a lot in his movies. It's the longest story and the most interesting. The TAARNA character (who is a hot looking blonde)is the last breed of a race of defending warriors, sworn to protect another neighbor race. When this neighbor race is attacked, TAARNA is summoned. The story is also the most violent AND the most sexy, as we get to see full frontal (albeit, animated!) nudity.I would recommend this movie to just about anyone who enjoys sci-fi, fantasy with a dash of sexiness and violence. You won't find any Nu Metal music herein, nor state of the art CGI effects (which, by the way, are getting boring REAL FAST!). This is a handmade movie if you will. It's not the greatest animated feature, but it sure was fun to watch and brings out cool memories!

Some of the stories are fun in their own goofy teenage-boy kind of way, while others are almost entirely worthless.  I recently watched the film and tried to figure out why I liked some of the segments so much better than others, and suddenly it hit me--the good ones are the ones that actually use Elmer Bernstein's score instead of relying on the dated eighties rock music.Bernstein's score actually supports the on-screen action, but the rock music only interferes.  Look at the Captain Sternn sequence, my personal least favorite of the stories--the song they use to accompany the long chase through the spaceship is completely inappropriate for what's going on.  Likewise, So Beautiful & So Dangerous, another clunker, barely uses Bernstein at all.  The only stories that successfully use the rock music are B-51 (with the soldiers dying in slow motion) and Taarna (when the barbarians attack the peaceful city).  Otherwise, it's Bernstein who carries the film--listen to his work as Harry Canyon and the girl meet the mobster at night, as Den risks his life to save Catherine, as Taarna flies over a rocky valley in the film's most memorable special effects shot.  It's one of the best scores I've ever heard, and the sad thing is that it's never been released on CD--but infuriatingly, the rock music soundtrack is readily available at any corner music store.  Would somebody please explain that one to me?Also, on never video editions and Columbia's excellent DVD special edition, there is a deleted segment known as Neverwhere Land.  Don't ask me why they selected it to be removed from the film instead of Captain Sternn--it seriously would have been the movie's shining point.  It's creepy and haunting and beautiful, sort of a silent-movie anthology of the history of evil set to the most chilling classical music I've ever heard (it's much better than even Bernstein's work).  If you like this movie or experimental animation in general, you have to check it out.

Due to its collaborative roots, the styles and tone between segments vary widely.  Much like the film Tron from the same period, some of the elaborate cinematography shows its age, particularly the use of filmed models.  For example, the long follow shot in Taana was innovative in 1981, but compared to the dizzying visuals in contemporary Disneys like Tarzan, not to mention Japanese animation, it's prehistoric.The best segment is the first, a near future detective story set in New York.  The Fifth Element clearly borrows (steals?) liberally from this idea.  The later segments grow progressively weaker until the last, a well told Western framed as a fantasy with a female warrior.  This last segment is reminisicent of Eastwood's speghetti westerns, right down to the squint.Heavy Metal is entertaining if taken at face value.

It's a skill that requires a lot of patience and pain staking precision while animating every frame of the picture. It is no easy task. I like to categorize it in the same area as stop motion animation because that requires the same if not more amount of time and effort. What interests me even more in this kind of filmmaking is when an animated movie obtains a rating higher than a G or PG. I mean, how often does a viewer get to see a cartoon bleed or run its mouth without a censor. The world isn't always gumdrops and smiles.So when I came across this movie, I was thrown back for that exact reason. It was totally new to me. I never had a chance to experience such an opportunity. Because of that, I went into watching this movie with optimistic hopes. They weren't high but I didn't expect garbage either. Instead, I came out feeling frustrated and rather annoyed. By no means is this movie bad. The visuals (which I will get to), are fantastic but the plot is just so irrelevant.The story is about a girl who is harassed by a deadly godlike green orb that tells her random stories. The stories range from how others have seen it and used it. But honestly, who cares? If I were that girl listening to this orb's stories, I would begin to get tired of it continuing on and on and on and on and on! Enough! Just tell me what you want or if you're going to kill me, get it over with! It's like having a serial killer jump into your house and hold you hostage just so he can blab about his life story. That's torture enough.That's really it because I didn't care for any of the stories at all except for the last one because it actually dealt with what I thought was going to be the main character. The rest was a mishmash of random stories. I also found it sexist too. Every woman in this movie ends up sleeping with some guy they don't know, either because they were saved by them or because they were wood into it. For any person who watches this, please remember that most women are not like this.Back to what I did think worked though was the animation. For 1981, the animation is crisp and highly detailed. I was honestly expecting a budget in the range of He-Man cartoon animation. But it was very good. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters themselves had great colors and shadings. The voice cast behind it was also fun to listen too as well. I even enjoyed Elmer Bernstein's score. It had some really beautiful tunes within some scenes. As for the rock music, I can understand because of the era it was made and how popular it was at the time. And in some scenes, the rock music does work which surprised me. Overall it is a piece more for the nostalgia of the time and nothing else.The animation is great for its time and its score actually has some beautiful tunes, even when it contains rock music. But don't count on it for a decent story. There is no plot and it doesn't have a main protagonist to root for.

This book was called Heavy Metal and it's still going strong today. Most of the stories are science fiction and delve into some pretty strange ideas. The movie was made to in a way showcase the talent that came from the most popular artists and writers of that magazine. There was some up and coming Canadian talent doing the voice work like John Candy and Eugene Levy. While the idea sounds cool enough I think the execution leaves a little bit to be desired. This movie feels like it was a rush job considering some inconsistent production values and even some of the story content. Since it is an anthology of multiple stories I will go down the line so you can get an idea where the quality lies and where it falls short.Soft Landing - This is the opening sequence that comes with the opening credits and it's the only story that connects itself to another story in the movie. The animation is a rough rotoscope technique that has only a wash of paint over real footage. I like how they did it. Very artistic. I have to admit it is a perfect representation of the magazine with its off the wall content and nice design. The hard rock soundtrack feel appropriate in this segment too. It's short, but it sure does make quite a good impression.Heavy Metal did accomplish what it set out to do in that it showcased the magazine in a time when it was at its highest in popularity. For the non-Heavy Metal Magazine fan it's not as good. Keep in mind the content has lots of blatant animated nudity, sexual situations and graphic violence, Definitely not for the kids. The stories are interesting enough, but that might not be enough for some who expect quality production values all the way through. If you're a fan of the comic book then you probably already seen it and love it. If you are the type of person who jams to classic rock and have that biker rebel streak in you then you might find Heavy Metal refreshing. The rest of you will have to just make a judgment call.

Heavy Metal must be on the few exceptions that I've ever seen, and its one pretty damn weird movie. When I call it as adult, that's not a reference to emotional maturity- this is the most blatant male-fantasy I've seen since Conan the Barbarian. It reminds me somewhat of Wizards, a sort of counterculture Lord of the Rings, which was made a few years before this. Luckily, I found Heavy Metal than I remember Wizards as being, though it's still very uneven. Strangely enough, I remember seeing bits and pieces of this at Starlog, the downtown geek store that was closed years ago to make way for nail salons and restaurants. The quality of the animation isn't great, which is understandable, considering the movie's age and the fact that, as I mentioned before, this wasn't exactly made for the Disney audience. The movie's main flaw is that the individual stories tend to be underwritten. They also vary greatly in quality, not to mention style- even though Heavy Metal had a single script, its segments were all done separately. The device used to (very tenuously) link the stories together is weak an evil green orb telling stories to a young girl to demonstrate its boundless evil, or something. At least one of the stories drops the orb altogether, and the orb's function is never very clear anyway. The first segment, Harry Canyon, is one of the best. Though the animation isn't as sophisticated as in later stories, the visuals, of a decaying, futuristic New York City, are the most interesting in the movie. It's actually quite reminiscent of Blade Runner, both in terms of the setting and the film noir-like tone. The story, of a cab driver who helps out a woman on the run from gangsters (they want to know where the green orb is) begins well, but it runs too short to really go anywhere. On the plus side, Harry Canyon is the most interesting and complex character in the movie (which is, admittedly, not saying much). The second segment, Den, is the most gleefully sophomoric, sexist section in a movie that was pretty much based on being sophomoric and sexist. But it also has the best sense of humor, and could be taken as at least as much a parody of ridiculous male-fantasies as a representative of them. The story has a nerdy adolescent, voiced by John Candy, being turned by the green orb into a muscular, Conan-like warrior and transported to a barbarian planet, where naked beautiful women throw themselves at him, that is when grotesque monsters aren't attacking him, that is. It's fun to listen to John Candy's voice coming out of two bodies that are both equally unlike him. The third segment is probably the weakest. It has the handsome Captain Sternn on trial for just about every crime that you could think of at a space station. He looks doomed (his lawyer tells him that the best they can hope for is an unmarked grave!) but then Sternn uses a surprise witness to escape. This story is fairly pointless, with no real protagonist and not many particularly interesting visuals. It was fun hearing John Vernon do the voice of the prosecutor, however. The fourth segment, B-17, is perhaps the best, despite being the shortest. In this one, the orb resurrects the dead crew of a bomber, who then attack the pilots. The animation has an effectively creepy look to it. The fifth segment, So Beautiful and So Dangerous, has an alien ship abducting a woman from earth. She has sex with the ship robot and they decide to get married, while the ship's pilots get stoned. The story has its moments (ever seen animated characters do drugs before?) but it's as out of place as Captain Sternn, and doesn't really come to any sort of end; it just stops. On the plus side, it does have some fairly complex animation of the ship's journey through space, but in the end the whole story is just an elaborate setup for some lame jokes. The sixth segment, the longest and most elaborate, is essentially the movie's showcase. In this one, the orb inspires a race of barbarians to wipe out a peaceful civilization. Before they're killed, the civilization's elders summon a woman warrior to avenge them. The visual style in this segment is excellent, but as with the other stories, its impact is limited somewhat by the script, which seems underdeveloped. Here, the main problem is that the female avenger doesn't end up doing very much. The bad guys capture her, and then she fights in single combat with their leader.

Yes, there was some good material in the early issues but there was a lot of crap, too. Too bad the crappy elements of HM are all that seemed to make it into this movie... a series of short sci-fi/fantasy cartoons linked by the lame device of some evil, sentient green jewel that sets out to kill the one person that can destroy it... but first, it's going to tell its victim several irrelevant stories. Most of the stories are based on some of the best cartoons from the early years of HM... but the transition to animation doesn't do them any justice. The best cartoon of the bunch, Captain Stern is but a pale, pale echo of Bernie Wrightson's original 7 page strip. Every other sequence is just an endless parade of juvenile sex/drug jokes and senseless bloody violence. I guess you could argue that that's all the magazine ever was anyway... but at least there was an artistic vision behind it all. There is no art in this movie whatsoever... just clumsy animation, bad writing, crummy voice work and lousy inappropriate heavy metal music (hey, the movie is called Heavy Metal... better cram some heavy metal music in it!)

That said... it's nothing compared to his comic books, the visuals are mostly rough and stuff is flickering a lot. The animation is roto-like, meaning lifeless, no contrasts, the motion of everything is even and slow-ish. But hey, it's animated in 1981. The story... I don't know, it's probably interesting if you're high. Very, very high. This film was probably made by people who understand comics, not film, and it's not a good adaptation of comics to motion pictures. I think the film does have merit though, for being a feature that looks like a comic book, not like the usual 2D animation stuff the line is more complicated, lots more details in the drawings. Some of the backgrounds are quite interesting, and they use line art, so the whole picture is colored line art.. as opposed to the usual animation look which has painted backgrounds and colored line art for animated elements (and it doesn't look cohesive). Anyway, overall... this film is more or less a creative mess. It has some remarkable bits of eroticism, not normally found in animation. Personally I would love to see more comic-book-like feature animation. But made today, with modern tools and animation and film knowledge, and with better character design and better overall visual style.

Maybe it was the fact that so many talented people were involved. Perhaps it was just unusual to have a major release of an animated film with this kind of content. Or maybe it just has something to do with the fact that for the first time an animated film brought about the elements of a bawdy comic book and played it out for the mentality of 13 year-old boys.Whatever the reasons for the success of 'Heavy Metal', I'm afraid I just don't get it. I see the images, I see some original writing in spots, I see the potential for a cult classic. But, for me, 'Heavy Metal' looks dated, silly, disjointed and out of all eight stories I find myself defending only two.I found 'The Legend of Tarrna' (the last one) to be a true original. Sure, it seems sexist and Tarrna is a complete male fantasy but I found it to be strikingly original in its visual imagination. She comes out of the sky riding a giant condor and carrying a sword. She walks into the bar, is hit on by three slobbering goons and you can fill in the rest. This well animated scene owes more than a little to the Clint Eastwood westerns (Did I say a little? She even squints her eyes). I caught myself smiling at this scene, that's why I liked it.I have to admit that 'So Beautiful, So Dangerous' is curiously funny. An alien spacecraft breaks into the Pentagon and kidnaps a secretary. She is kidnapped by a trio of robots, one of whom has an over-inflated libido in it's programming. I wasn't all that keen on this segment as a whole but I have to admit a certain admiration for any scene that opens with a robot and a naked woman in bed after sex and ends with the line 'Okay, but I want a Jewish wedding'.The rest is pretty routine. I liked where 'Harry Canyan' was going but it seemed to be over before it began. 'Den', a story about a geek who gets turned into a giant blue hulk is little more than a prepubescent fantasy. 'Captain Sternn' had some fun dialogue before disintegrating into predictability. 'B-17' the disturbing story of a plane being taken over by the living dead is a matter of taste (but not mine). The framing material about a sickly green orb that tells these stories to a frightened girl is just plain baffling.'Heavy Metal' is based on a popular behind-the-counter comic book that would make Bob Guiccione blush. The movie isn't anywhere near the graphic level of that book but to fans of this movie that hardly matters. I haven't a clue what makes this film so popular. I find chunk-style movies like this lacking almost by definition. It has it's moments, it fills it's quotient of T&A and graphic violence, but I wasn't all that impressed.Ratings (out of four) 'Soft Landing'- *½; 'Grimandi' - **; 'Harry Canyan' - **½; 'Den' - **; 'Captain Sternn' - **½; 'B-17' - *; 'So Beautiful, So Dangerous' - ***; 'The Legend of Tarrna' - ***.

I personally found it a decent, if not great, one. It does have a number of problems. A lot of the segments have stories and morals that for me lacked coherency, So Beautiful and So Dangerous was the one that was the most problematic in this area. And as beautiful as it looked, I didn't really see the point of the Soft Landing sequence either. Some of the character designs looked rather flat which may make the film rather dated by today's standards, again the weakest were in So Beautiful and So Dangerous. Most of the characters work very well actually, especially Den, Captain Stermn and Harry Canyon- Loknar is also intriguing but not developed enough- but others like the female from So Beautiful and So Dangerous get on your nerves. The humour gave me a mixed reception, Harry Canyon, Captain Stermn and Den did work very well in this respect however apart from some moments So Beautiful and So Dangerous comes across as juvenile, in fact the only thing that stood out to me in that segment was the voice acting. On the plus side, the animation on the most part was very good, not the best I've seen but acceptable enough for when it was made, Taarna was by far the best-looking sequence, so sweeping and lush. The soundtrack is superb, the songs are the epitome of killer and the musical score itself is powerful. The graphic violence is unrelenting and quite disturbing, most evocative was B-17, my personal favourite segment of the entire film because of how creepy and atmospheric it turned out to be. Harry Canyon is thoroughly enjoyable, only let down by a rather underwhelming ending, you do have a feeling you know how Captain Stermn is going to end but the memorable titular character and wonderful humour really carry it wonderfully while Taarna is the most visually beautiful of the segments. Den is highly effective also. The voice acting from Richard Romanus, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and especially John Candy is spot on.

I think it is a very brave film, violent, filled with heavy metal music, it has sex, action and raw, serious animation. A suitable historic compatibility wanted for this film to be made exactly eight decades after Georges Melies filmed his own space opera and other fun and most important things when it comes to the SF genre. Heavy metal closes one big media and genre circle, when it comes to the maturing of the genre. The title of the film comes from the British adult magazine, and it's adapted from French magazine Metal Hurlant. The movie is made out of several short stories, that were based upon such authors as Richard Corben, Angus McKie, Bernie Rightson and others... The item that combines all stories is Loch-Narr, a lighting ball that presents the alien evil. The director Gerald Potterton shows us a bizarre world of anti-utopia and space opera, and somewhat cosmic parabola. We can see aliens, robots, monsters, mutants, the whole gallery of SF archetypes that looks pretty original and fresh. It would that seem that audience back than, and even today, didn't accept this film pretty much, not even the SF fans... but I think that this film holds a special place in history of SF genre.

Which is probably why it's pretty awesome. Based on a series of stories from a magazine of the same name, Heavy Metal takes a number of different animated styles and creates some science-fiction tales that are loosely connected thanks to a big glowing green thing called the Loc Mar. The tales range in absurdity and quality, but most have time to strip a woman naked for very simplistic reasons, such as thanking a man or tricking a man. SOme stories are very Twilight Zone-esque, such as the tale of Zombies in a bomber. But others are just weird, such as the woman taken into space, where she has coitus with a robot and the pilots of the ship are doing drugs. It really did feel like a long bizarre music video, with a bunch of stories that never really concluded properly. Some fantastic designs, good soundtrack, and things you are bound to not see anywhere else, means this is a strange curiosity you should definitely see at least once in your life.

It's got plenty of storyline flaws, characters who behave in an extremely implausible manner, gratuitous nudity and animation that makes the old Looney Tunes cartoons look like The Lion King. By all accounts it should have turned out horrible but instead the grittiness and wild storytelling is actually part of its charm. Heavy Metal is an anthology of stories that range from gritty noir (Harry Canyon) to wacky comedy (So Beautiful, So Dangerous) to straight out gore (B-17). They are all tied together rather loosely by the presence of an evil green orb called the Loc Nar. It narrates these random stories to a hapless teenage girl it considers its arch-nemesis.The film opens with an astronaut returning to earth in a flying convertible. He makes it home to present the previously mentioned green orb as a gift to his daughter only to have it threaten his daughter after melting him into goo. My main problem with the opening segment is that the Loc Nar chooses to tell the girl about all the evil it has perpetrated rather than melting her as it did her father. Of course, if it did that, we wouldn't have a movie. Also some of the faces she makes come off too goofy to take seriously.The film switches to the first story, Harry Canyon, a 50's film noir transplanted to a futuristic New York in decline with a gruff cabbie in place of a gumshoe. He is thrust into the action when a girl gets into his cab to escape from gangsters who just murdered her father, the current owner of the Loc Nar. While it's my favorite of all the stories, the problems come from the girl's behavior. She decides to have sex with Harry Canyon within minutes of meeting him and watching her father die; a reaction usually reserved for porn movies. Then she turns against him after she gives the Loc Nar to the gangsters despite there being no foreshadowing that she would do something like this. Perhaps most disappointing is that this is the way the story ends. Harry kills the woman in self defense and drives off to adventures that we will never know.On to story #2, Den. This one is more of a fantasy where an 18-year old nerd finds the Loc Nar in his backyard and is teleported to an alternate universe where he is transformed to a muscle bound hero who gets tasked to defeat an evil warlord and, of course, rescue a superhot naked girl. I really enjoyed this story and John Candy's voice-over lends some much needed laughs after the downer resolution of Harry Canyon. This one also seems to have a more satisfying ending. The only thing I can't understand is why the Loc Nar would include this story as it clearly made Den's life BETTER.The third story is Captain Sternn, the story of a lowlife criminal who bribes a meek man to give false testimony at his trial. However, the Loc Nar has other plans and causes Hannover Fiste to hulk out and chase after the titular scumbag. Despite the premise, this is the most light-hearted episode up to this point. It also seems to end before it really gets going. Surprisingly there are no naked women to be found either.The next story is B-17, a claustrophobic horror tale about a WWII pilot trying to survive a plane full of zombie comrades reanimated by the Loc Nar naturally. This story is highly effective in its gore and scares and has, by far, the best ending. Once again there are no naked women and there is also little spoken dialogue but it does just fine without them. This is the strongest segment, storywise anyway.After the brief segue to full on horror, So Beautiful, So Dangerous, seeks to lighten the mood. We have a sexy secretary who is accidentally beamed aboard an alien spaceship piloted by two stoner aliens. She also finds love with a robot of all things. I'd consider this one to be the weakest. The woman is annoying, the thought of robot sex requires too much suspension of disbelief and I was actually disappointed that the story abandons the far more interesting plot thread about mutations once the spaceship shows up. Also the Loc Nar doesn't do anything evil here and appears as a bauble on the secretary's blouse. How did she get it? Why didn't it kill her? Finally, we conclude with Taarna, a stoic fantasy involving a mute, but impossibly gorgeous warrior woman and a city of violent thugs mutated by the Loc Nar. All in all, it's a good story with a good ending except for the beginning where Taarna takes an eternity to get dressed while the city that summoned her gets completely slaughtered.After the stories are concluded, the wraparound plot concludes in case you forgot about it. The Loc Nar explodes, taking the house with it. However, the girl escapes where Taarna's bird shows up to whisk her away and her hair whitens indicating she is Taarna's ancestor or reincarnation or... who knows? The ending makes little sense but it's not the main attraction here anyway.Heavy Metal is a fun escapist fantasy that knows what it is and makes no apologies for it. Even though it's not the most expensive or the best looking movie, it more than makes up for it with its passion and unencumbered approach to storytelling. If you're looking to have a good time, definitely check it out.

The project was the brainchild of publisher Len Mogel, who ended up bringing it to producer Ivan Reitman, who agreed to join the project on the condition that he have total control and bring in his own writers, Dan Goldberg and Len Blum, with whom he'd worked on Stripes. The result is an anthology of lush, vivid, sexy, violent, adult stories linked by the ongoing journey of an evil glowing green sphere dubbed the Loc-Nar, which brings chaos to all those with whom it comes in contact. Some of the episodes are taken from the magazine - Soft Landing, Den, Captain Stern, and So Beautiful & So Dangerous, some are originals - Harry Canyon, B-17, and Taarna, and they're united by the common thread Grimaldi. The movie is an amazing collaboration between artists such as Richard Corben, Berni Wrightson, Mike Ploog, Howard Chaykin, Chris Achilleos, and Juan Gimenez; the total crew of animators and support personnel numbered around a thousand and was based around the world - NYC, LA, London, Ottawa, and Montreal; also among the credited writers is Dan O'Bannon of Alien fame. The assemblage of voice talent is solid - John Candy, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty, Harold Ramis, Richard Romanus, Percy Rodrigues, Al Waxman, Jackie Burroughs, Don Francks, etc. Harry Canyon, a noir style story of a cabbie of the future, Den, a tale of an adolescent's fantasy of derring-do as a muscular hero, and the adventure saga Taarna are definite standouts. Even though it's true that animation has come even further in the past 30 plus years, and a film of this sort would look even better now, there is still much to admire with the look of this film. Some of the stories are actually worthy of feature length in their own right, and they're all equally engaging and often humorous, with Levy and Ramis priceless as a pair of chatty aliens and Candy endearing as a sex starved robot. (In fact, some of the SCTV guys provide voices for a few characters.) The awesome soundtrack includes contributions from such artists as Blue Oyster Cult, Sammy Hagar, Cheap Trick, Riggs, Stevie Nicks, and Journey, so the movie is just as appealing that way as it is visually.

This sphere spreads evil wherever it goes, and it's loosely behind the various dark stories collected here. In all honesty, it's a very vague connection at best; the vignettes here essentially are all stand-alone. The universe of Heavy Metal is one of science-fiction, fantasy, occasional horror and an abundant procession of large breasted women. Its erotic content is perhaps its chief selling point, and certainly what gives it its memorable imagery. Even though I know I should know better, I still have to confess to really enjoying the voluptuous vixens that populate this film; I'm such a sucker for the pneumatic female form that even these cartoon ladies worked for me. Call me an idiot if you like, I can take it.The stories themselves are as variable as you might expect but fairly imaginative. The mixture of the erotica into the sci-fi/fantasy narratives always keeps even the most uninspired segments at least enjoyable. On top of this the soundtrack is a selection of music from arena rock bands of the early 80's, which I guess is only appropriate in a film called Heavy Metal.I suppose you could classify this as an example of a cult cartoon, an animated feature that could just as easily be considered a midnight movie. It's most definitely a little strange on the whole. And it is quite clearly aimed at males, although women would find the whole thing a little amusing I suspect. They would most probably come away from this celebration of enormous breasts and sci-fi/fantasy thinking that the male of the species is in essence a knuckle-dragging low-brow idiot.

We start off with an introduction kind of story where the orb begins terrorizing this girl while telling her of the various evil he has done throughout time. Then we shift to a very cool cartoon, the best of the bunch about some cab driver from the future. Unfortnately, we then go to a comedy in some new dimension and I think there is nudity in this one, but I have never saw this movie on anything but standard television. It shifts again, I have a hard time remembering the exact order, I do know there is a rather good one featuring some sort of pirate on trial, a cool one about some bad happenings on a plane during what looks like world war II, and then one with aliens that is not all that good and we wrap it up with the weakest of the bunch about some woman on some bird. Do not ask me why I dislike that one the most, I can not even give you an answer, I just thought it played out very weakly. The voice work is interesting having John Candy as one of the main voices used and the music is pretty good too. The animation is not top notch anymore, but for its day it was okay. The stories themselves range from too short to to long. The ones you want to run long end to abruptly, the ones you want to end seem to go on and on. Still it was a pretty cool movie when looked at as a whole.

Laden with dark humour and a liberal sprinkling of sexual undertones that wouldn't look out of place in a Tinto Brass movie.The story begins with the sphere arriving at the house of a young girl who is terrified at first, but then is regaled with stories by the sphere.

The film is a collection of stories that seem right out of the comic.  The stories in the film are well written and animated, coming from a variety of settings.  What I liked the best was the extreme far-out fiction. The stories have no `explanation' of why things are; they just throw you into the story and let it flow out.  Also the film makes sure the audience knows it's for mature audiences by throwing in graphic violence and nudity, which adds to the story but seems a bit much at times (although that holds true to the comic also).  I would recommend this to anybody looking for a mature animated film with a serious sense that's not anime.  Of course, also to fans of Heavy Metal the comic magazine.

(okay)Heavy Metal is based on some early issue 'underground' comics of the same name, and is simply a compilation of five stories, strung together by the same evil greenish (for some reason) 'force' in the shape of a globe or sphere. It's called the 'loc nar', prob. for reasons I could care less about. And the beastie is after a heroine, which we discover she is only later in the film, and who alone can save the world; shades of Buffy and her vampires.What's striking in the film - apart from some of the aires, and even lyrics, from Riggs (never heard of them outside of this film), Blue Oyster Cult, Sabbath, Sammy Hagar, and of course Don Felder - is the enthusiasm and energy of everyone involved. Many of the episodes involve the adolescent fixation on gratuitous sex, so the cartoon women are busty and loose. And much else strikes the same remarkably juvenile pose. It's truly a disco era, '70s feminist'/frat-boy sort of film (contrasted with the 90s prudish feminism of the X-Files and the nasty inseminating bees, with the ooze, the black pupils, the virus parasite creatures, and so on). But despite that childish tone throughout the various stories, or maybe because of something childish in it all, the stories are interesting, and remain so upon repeated viewing. The late voice acting John Candy (among a regular cast of voice over Canadian (or is it 2nd City?) comics, I believe), who himself seems to be one or more voices in almost each episode, actually sounds remarkably old and mature, considering, and in light of the overall tone of the film itself. And one can look past the dominatrix-clad heroine of the final episode, and the somewhat crude and distracting experiment in '3D' animation at one brief point, even the slightly cheesy attempt to capture a bit of Frazetta, and see instead the selfless bravery that was intended, even if the evil is uncomplicated and exaggerated. One can understand that some would decry the animation itself as cheap and based solely or too unimaginatively on live action cells. But, for what it's worth, the animation comes through, and doesn't really get in the way (just my opinion) - save for the slo-mo fight in the final episode, which is a little visually confusing (and thankfully, they left that pretentious Neverwhere Land sequence _out_).It really was an amibitious film, if you think about it, and would surely be considered for an Oscar if released among the nonsense films of today. It holds up well, except perhaps to assorted anime fans, who would prob. be more satisfied with hardcorn porn rentals, anyway (again, just my opinion). Any buzz about a sequel, with today's 'talent', and today's overly precious PC thinking, and not to defend adolescent indulgence either, strikes me as a project doomed to fail, and something which would never approach the sort of spirit, good and bad, found in the now decades old film (but one can always be surprized).

I realize that this is an animated film which, in the main, is entertainment for entertainment's sake, and that I am deriving more from the movie than was intended.

And I mean that in the most sincere way. Let me get this out I don't like this film's stories and themes. I like the scope of imagination, and maybe the Den story.Most of this film, to me, represents the filth of the drug-rock counter- culture that pervaded much of the 70s in America, and could often be threatening if not downright lethal as one often heard news stories of the results of drug abuse. Yet, even so, even with the law created to abate the problem, there were those those who engaged in it casually or indulgently, and did so without apology.To me, this film represents that in spades. And yet I acknowledge the positives of the movie; that being a group of people took a chance on creating an imagined spectacle based on an Americanized version of a European comic book.Regrettably the French got royally screwed in the deal, and instead of American audiences getting exposed to the finest of Continental Sci-Fi, we're given some bastardized version of the same comic (Metal Hurlant). Anyone familiar with the publication will know the stark difference between the over- sexed, over-drugged, and just down right insulting and pornographic version of the American magazine verse the rather refined (but no less violent in terms of themes presented) publication of the original European publication.Don't believe me? Go to the two different websites, or buy issues of both American and European publication, and you'll be stunned at how insulting the American publication is.Still, the film has heart, and delivers a type of escapism that I think a lot of sci-fi fans will guardedly and tacitly nod in mild approval. After all, it wasn't meant to be a head-trip film (as it often was mistaken as such), but an earnest attempt to bring some of the grown up adventure fantasy to the big screen, and done in an animated venue to not only keep in style of the comic, but also to show a stylized and artistic rendering of alternate worlds.And that's what I like about the film. Worlds and other places that during the cultural depression of the 1970s and early 80s were presented to people who normally didn't get to see such places. Hence the reason I have the DVD in my collection.As a young man I was deeply insulted by a lot of the baser themes coursing through this film, but I did appreciate the redemption at the end of the film, and for me that seemed to partially exonerate the authors of this anthology.Then, after seeing the film on HBO, it vanished. And it wouldn't be until many years later that I finally saw it again a few times on the midnight circuit. The print was battered, but the scope of the film was still there.This film should have been a lesson for the major studios, just like Star Wars, but the ever cautious and sociopathic middle-men who horde wealth in the entertainment industry for the sake of it, and have no concept on how to expand and create better products to garnish more wealth, the lesson was lost.Meanwhile, across the Pacific in Japan, animation is running strong, and was the forerunner to the Heavy Metal film with adult themes depicted in animated media. But the squabble and fear of upsetting North American audiences with a cartoon not meant for kids, is too daunting, too challenging, and just plain baffling and incomprehensible.I guess what I'm saying here is that there could have been more and better Heavy Metal like films without all the extreme cultural- pollution depicted in this film. Sad, but true. And only now, when CGI is finally coming into its own, are we getting some mild exposure to what we should have gotten many years back.Well, allegedly there are a few other Heavy Metal films in the works, and after seeing Heavy Metal 2000 all I can do is shrug and hope the DVD hits the bargain bin, or there's a free stream of it somewhere because of what I expect to be more of the same.So, to sum up, the original Heavy Metal film should have been a turning point for American animation cinema. But it wasn't. Why? Because it not only pushed the envelope, but, like any experimental aircraft that flies beyond it's performance envelope, is crashed and burned.Like a lot of other products in the 70s and 80s, the Japanese came to our rescue. In the meantime Heavy Metal remains a cinematic curiosity. Me, I can't watch it more than once a year, if that. Watch at your own risk.

Fans of the movie seem to be poo-pooing anyone who comments on how bad the animation is, but come on, the animation is done at a REALLY low frame rate, causing movement to look really stiff and jerky.That said, the artwork is rather good, in a comic-book sort of way. The style was very unique, and was clearly influenced by the cartoons of Ralph Bakshi. Even though the movie was a series of episodes, there was a uniform look and tone, which I enjoyed.The writing, again, pretty much on a par with some comic books of the era. If you are a fan of any of the anthology comics from the seventies, like House of Mystery or House of Secrets you will see many parallels (including the fact that Bernie Wrightson, well-known as a horror comic artist primarily in the 70s and 80s, contributed work to the movie).The voice acting was laughable -- but in a good way. It seems as if most of the actors accepted this gig as a goof. No one really seems to be taking the material all that seriously, which is good, because it is NOT Shakespeare.I am not familiar with the magazine, Heavy Metal, so I can't draw any comparisons to that; but for me, the movie reminded me most of the comic book inserts that they used to include in National Lampoon.

It's awesome because of its spirit of adventure and experimentation. I'd rather see ten weird, experimental, and personal movies like Heavy Metal than one boring pander-fest like 500 Days of Summer which, like a smooth politician, is guaranteed a wide audience because it's engineered to appeal to as many people as possible. What it loses in the process is a human touch, the sense that I'm getting to know a real person's dreams and aspirations, not being manipulated into thinking that it's hip for young women to have borderline personality disorder (as in most popular RomComs like Juno), or that grand special effects are more exciting than a good story (as in the Avengers or the Phantom Menace). This is just a guess, but I think these animated stories are very close to the hearts of the people who wrote and designed them, and this movie was made out of love for the stories instead of expecting to get rich off of it. I love it for that alone because even if it's a bad story, someone believed in it enough to not let it get (too) watered down by someone who didn't think it had enough mass appeal. So for better or for worse, it's a window into another person's heart, which makes me feel connected to humanity. You can't buy that with all the special effects and cinematography in the world.So I love this movie for the spirit behind it. But the movie itself - eh. It's a mess. Stunningly detailed background plates vie with very hit-and-miss animation. In fact it's shockingly bad in many places, the battle scene in Den is almost as choppy and wooden as in GI Joe. And it's juvenile -- there's not much going on underneath the boobs, violence, and cool drawings. I want some kind of cohesive message to justify all this eye candy, like making the green orb only destroy people who are evil anyway (the B-52 pilot wasn't necessarily evil). And why is it some busty chick, of all people, who defeats evil? Since this plot device is just plopped in there, it makes me think that the answer to this question is that the filmmakers thought chicks with swords and big boobs just look cool, that's why. I want more reason why it's HER who defeats evil, because I don't think hot Amazonian chicks who dress like pole-dancers defeat evil in real life; they'd create it by frustrating men with their hot and exposed bodies. A more plain- looking woman in a monk's robe would be more believable, but (I know) a lot less cool-looking. That's not to say there aren't some gems here and there that shine on their own. There's a scene towards the beginning of the Taarna part where townspeople are turned evil by being immersed in green slime. That part on its own has a strange, resonant power like a story from the Bible, and is worth the entire movie. I think it resonates because of its chilling similarity to Marxist and feminist brainwashing, but that's just my opinion. PA must-see if you're into the art of animation or just have a taste for strange movies, its heart is in the right place but watching it is like looking through a talented fourteen-year-old boy's sketchpad.

You have drama, comedy, horror, and swords and sorcery, and going from a story with humor (Captain Stern) to horror (B-17) back to humor again (So beautiful and so dangerous) just doesn't work.A bigger problem is the animation itself. It's mostly of poor quality, and to be fair, by 1981, even Disney had lost it's touch in this artform.A couple of the stories do work. The B-17 story is quite good, as is the final one.

It turns out that they were, in fact, as well as depicting drug use amongst aliens. But this is an adult animation. Sure there's goofy aliens in some scenes and dumb-as-bricks warriors in others, but the overall story is about this green Orb who has caused some downright horrific in its past. It chooses to settle down and talk with a chosen girl about its exploits and how she is a part of its story. If you haven't seen the film, picture it like a long episode of He-Man back in the days of Dungeons & Dragons marathons and way too many pot-fueled stories of alternate universes. There's an over-abundance in breasts throughout the film, much like most of the D&D fantasy artwork of the time, and there was pressure, I'm sure, to play it up as something they could do in this adult animation. Some of the animation was overdone but it looked better than some of Bakshi's animations. The rotoscoping effects look great as well, and the skies in some of the sequences were very dreamlike. I personally was not attached to the various pop artists they got for the film, and to see that the VHS release was delayed on account of them makes me cringe. I hardly noticed the music at all. I found that it was called Heavy Metal because the idea for the film came from the Heavy Metal magazine where a handful of these stories came from, but I don't understand the tie-in of the title to anything in the movie itself. Overall, I recommend this film to animation fans and fantasy/sci-fi fans. It doesn't really have anything to do with heavy metal music so for you music fans, you might feel ripped off (although Sammy Hagar singing about heavy metal is included).

Each of the shorts have their own pros and cons but none of them seem to be able to strike a balance between story and animation.Those that have really interesting and entertaining stories tend to have really sub-par animation(even by 80s standards. Goodness, even TV series episodes of Scooby Doo look like they were animated better than some Heavy Metal short films). On the flip side, those with richly detailed art and high standard of animation are coupled with overly simple and superficial stories.The dialogue and acting is also a mixed bag. The music, especially the heavy metal music(haha, heavy metal music in a movie entitled heavy metal, who would have expected that), is used in all the wrong places and never really seem to mesh with the footage on screen. Sometimes it looks like they just threw in any random screaming loud rock song to the wrong footage; like some newbie music video producer who would just sync in random shots with no connection whatsoever to the music playing.It might appeal to only the most hardcore science fiction fans or hot blooded teenagers who are looking for more adult style of cartoons. But those looking for a wholesome animated movie experience, a good balance of animation quality and engaging story, would do well to avoid this mess.

What I received was a succession of fantastic sci-fi and fantasy stories wound together by a common plot line and delineated vividly by art and animation that is light years beyond anything ever released in Japan. Mind you, Heavy Metal was released in 1981, several years before the first true Anime films came overseas and had some mainstream success. (Akira - heavily inspired by the cyberpunk style of Heavy Metal - springs to mind) Putting aside all of the historical context, however, any layman with a mild to moderate love of life can enjoy this on its sheer over-the-top fantastical qualities, alone. To borrow an old adage, they simply do not make them like this anymore. It is fun, raucous, and unrepentant fare - much like the music of the same name - and very few people will not be at least mildly entertained by the novelty of many of the concepts presented therein. From a dreary sci-fi world where we find a world-weary taxi-cab driver triumphing over forces larger than him, to a boy who becomes a barbarian, defeats a sorceress, and gets the girl, this film has a quality which the vast majority of cartoons and live-action films of the modern era find strange and foreign original ideas.Unfortunately, much of the originality and vibrance is overshadowed by Heavy Metal's own unapologetically violent and latently sexual overtones. This is, quite simply, a stupid reason to discount this film's merits, as its strength stems from the imaginative nature of its own bombastic brand of sci-fi, and not the varying degrees of T & A that each story has to offer. One only has to look at some of the most successful science fiction films of the last thirty years to see the influence of this seminal animated film.

This is getting a 3/10. It's that bad.HEAVY METAL is one of those films that fans love because of what it represents, rather than what it actually accomplishes on its own. Although the source material may have been groundbreaking, the vignettes here are either boring or incoherent. The magazine was a collection of serialized adult comics and the film attempts to show a range of those stories each realized with different animation teams based on artwork from the publication, but the film never pulls together as a whole and is actually weaker than its individual parts.Two of the sequences rise above their genres. Den is a sarcastic take of barbarian/fantasy genre with its musclebound hero literally having the mind of an 18yo nerd, an evil queen who interrupts a battle to have sex with the hero, and a sneering gay-ish villain who seems ready for the whole thing to be over. But the sequence never gets the chance to LOL as a genre-challenging satire. The animation is appalling (Thundar the Barbarian TV-show looks better!) and contrasts badly with the final sequence Taarna which takes its Fantasy pretensions seriously.In the Sci-fi story So Beautiful, So Dangerous a scientist reporting to the Pentagon on the impossibility of extra-terrestrial life turns out to be a robot planted by aliens. When he malfunctions and is retrieved via vacuum tube to a giant spaceship that looks like a kawaii-style smiley face, a sexy Jewish New Yawker secretary (reporter?) is accidentally sucked aboard as well. Beautiful/Dangerous is the best-looking and least dated of the entire film - and the gratuitous sex is the least irksome, although there's still plenty to cringe at.The lone Horror-genre piece B-17 written by Dan O'Bannon (ALIEN) stands out as the most memorable sequence, told almost entirely through action and in real time. The story would feel at home in EERIE or similar pulp comic from the '50s, and really is an oddity in this film. It completely ignores the Loc-Nar story and is the better for it. I've read it was not an actual story from the magazine.Another odd-ball is Captain Sternn where the life of a rogue is examined in a court trial that gets interrupted by mayhem. The character animation here is refreshingly stylized rather than rotoscoped, and the plot also dismisses the Loc-Nar arc.The opening credit sequence Soft Landing shows an astronaut sitting in a vintage Corvette. The animation is processed with hand-painted Xerox frames but would have felt dated even by 1981 in the age where MTV was exhausting alternative animation methods. Like most of the film, Soft Landing is a one-punch joke that you are stuck with for too long.Harry Canyan is a clichéd effort at a noir double-cross set in future New York City where cab drivers are the baddest dudes you will ever meet. There's a girl with an artifact. There's a gangster. There's a deathray in the back of the cab for unruly passengers. It's low-grade writing, although it's amusing to contrast this sequence with THE FIFTH ELEMENT where similar cab driver/hero clichés are done with a wink and nod.The peak sequence Taarna is handsomely animated but slow and pretentious. The plot is so ridiculously unimaginative - belonging to the Fantasy sub-genre Naked woman in a Temple with a Sword - that I could devote an entire review pulling it apart. Meanwhile the filmmakers are convinced that what they are showing is SO amazing that they cannot cut away or edit for narrative pacing. Long rotoscoped sequences and long speeches, the title character putting on her skimpy leather straps for a really long time, people you couldn't possibly have any investment in are slaughtered (probably because it takes Taarna so long to get dressed) - all with monumental self-importance.The only worse sequence is the recurring story arc that is meant to hold the film together Grimaldi where the green orb Loc-Nar must convince a little girl how EVIL it is, apparently by talking her to death.If you see this, be sure to also see ROCK&RULE and WIZARDS. They got it right.

Kenny and Stan's dad get high and enter the very sexually charged world of HEAVY METAL.I give this movie 3 stars for one reason alone--the music was exceptional, though why they included Journey's Open Arms along with all the harder rock, I'll never know. The tunes, if you love late 70s-early 80s hard rock, are really good. As for the rest of this film, it plays like a teenager's wet dream as animated and directed by a group of not particularly talented teens.The first thing that many viewers will notice will be that the animation makes the worst Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the 1970s look pretty good in some ways. That's because the frame-rate of HEAVY METAL is very, very low--resulting in an even jerkier and less animated style of animation. People who have given the film scores of 10 must either be blind or just could care less about super-cheap animation. Now that doesn't mean the animation is all bad--some of the backgrounds and a few of the scenes are definitely better than Hanna-Barbera--but even the best this film has to offer is light-years worse than anime, such as AKIRA. Although I saw reviews that compared the two, AKIRA is simply a much better product animation-wise or traditional full-length cartoons. Apparently the different segments were the work of different animation teams, though none were particularly good.Another thing you may soon notice is that although this film managed to get an R-rating, it is incredibly explicit--yet somehow this got the R and FRITZ THE CAT got an X. While the language wasn't that of FRITZ, there were tons of naked people featuring not just breasts but crotch shots and sex--lots of sex. Now I could see how a teen might like this, but for anyone wanting porn, they could also do a lot better! Seeing exceptionally explicit cartoons just seems sleazy and kinda gross.So what you have is a long series of short smutty stories that are horribly animated that are set to great tunes. My suggestion is that you watch the Cheesing episode of SOUTH PARK and see their dead-on parody of HEAVY METAL instead--it's actually funny and worth seeing--unlike this rather stupid film. I can't believe I actually watched this dumb movie.

Instead of coming up with one interesting, well-written story, let's come up with five or six vignettes that aren't terribly creative (the cab driver one was OKAY), let's throw in some bare breasts (which was really the only time my interest was sparked) and profanity and maybe no one will notice the stories aren't that well-written.

It is basically for the D and D playing set that would today be into Xena or Laura Croft or whatever. Red Sonja too for that matter. Very adolescant, sexist, sexy, violent, etc.I liked hearing Eugene Levy and John Candy in it. I enjoyed the 'STERRNNNNNNNNNEEEEEE!!!' segment, along with 'Den'(...Can't go running around with my Dork hanging out'), the bit with the stoned aliens  and whatever. It def. has it's moments.But this thing does veer from good to garbage and back again, depending on the music(Hagar, Felder and co are fine), Harry Canyon or whatever kinda slapdash at best. The linking segs with the talking green ball is very dated.If you liked anything like this, say Conan or the magazine itself, you will like this flick. It helps to be in either a Beavis age group or Butthead mindset however. Like-he said 'dork'! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH!**1/2 outta ****, dated stuff.

That's what I meant when I said women will love it, disposing of the top competition, but men, at least heterosexual men, will be completely turned off by the whole piece of crap.It's supposed to be based on the art of the magazine, which is just as chick flick racist as the movie. A complete neo Nazi propaganda movie, totally seventies formula in 1981.

It's just a series of junkily animated shorts (adapted from good comic books) held together by a nonsense frame story.  Each short is either poorly animated, completely boring, or both.  By the end, you won't understand the plot and you probably won't care to.If you're really desperate, you could probably squeeze a little entertainment out of this movie, but you're likely to have more fun taking a nap.

The middle stories are pathetic and/or boring, but fortunately, this film is book-ended by two solid tales at the beginning and a particularly entertaining segment at the end. None of the parts are suitable for children, as the film is littered with cursing and (sometimes gory) violence.  One might also object to the tendency of the animators to only draw rather voluptuous female characters. But it's the strong storytelling that often makes this film worthwhile for the rest of us, and I would heartily recommend watching about half of this movie to those who like good stories.  Just skip the middle so that you're wide awake for the great ending.

Ironically, it could have been an interesting movie. I liked Sci-fi more as a kid but still think it has its place, and the premise of linked tales in the future is not a bad one. Even the mix of the exotic and mundane in the future had some potential. However, this movie took the easy way out and went for stories that almost all hit below the belt. Even the animation was a disappointment because it was so sub-par--more like a bad version of those forgettable Saturday morning Transformers cartoons that started running in the 80s--Warner Bros. and Disney did it much better decades ago. Shame on anyone involved in this piece of trash. Since when does the future have to be overrun almost exclusively by trashy people? The creators tried unsuccessfully to mask poorly written stories and cheaply drawn animation with hard core violence, meaningless adolescent fantasy sex, and illicit drug use. Wow. What creativity. If their aim was to appeal to socially misfit adolescent males brimming with violent urges and unfulfilled lust, then they hit their mark.. Not recommended for anyone with a modicum of taste or decency but perfect for wannabe serial killers and misfit males mentally stuck in their teens. . 2/10 "},{"Title":"Disaster","Date":"15 December 2002","Score":"6 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Very disappointing, it might have been good in 1981, and it might have inspired 5th Element, but that doesn't make up for the (disastrous) rest. The first part with the taxi driver is almost ok! The rest is very meaningless. I rented this because it was refereed to as one of the first adult-orientated cartoons. Í cannot speak for the others, but for myself I believe that adult is more than (boring) sex and (boring) violence and gore. The worst thing about this movie is the total lack of story. Good against evil has never been portrayed so.. shallow and uninteresting.Normally I love cartoons, both anime and western, and therefore gave this one a long line before it broke...PDD  "},{"Title":"Why did this movie become a cult movie???","Date":"14 March 2007","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" A series of silly stories about fantastic creatures, the outer space, or the future are the pretext to show a little bit of violence and blood, and big breasted naked women.Why did they called it Heavy Metal? Well, I guess it was just marketing. Heavy metal was the most popular music in those days, so they filled the soundtrack with bands such as Nazareth, Blue Oyster Cult or Black Sabbath (let it be said in passing that those weren't 100% heavy metal bands, they were more like hard rock bands). Maybe they thought that way thousands of long-haired rockers would fill the theatres to overflowing.*My rate 3/10 "},{"Title":"Load of c**p","Date":"22 January 2000","Score":"5 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  I picked this movie up in a hurry, mistaking it for an anime, and I was astounded by it.

I really like anime, and thought I was gonna have real fun with this one. It seemed to be a myth to many people. The first story is quite great, with that cynic taxi driver, and the voluptuous girl. Also good animation, different to anything I've seen before, and really refreshing. But that's all, only 10 minutes of joy. The 2 I give to this film is due to this first story, without it, it would be a 0.The next chapters are just a collection of naked girls and nonsense action. Action is not even spectacular, just nonsense and boredom. The animation becomes ordinary, just medium quality, similar to Heeman series and things like that. There's even some chapter without naked girls at all, what just turns them into below 0 crap xD.There's only another story that's not so bad as the rest of the film. It's that one of the zombies in the plane. Great animation and a quite disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, at that time I was so bored that I couldn't enjoy it properly. There's one chapter particularly stupid, 7 or 8 minutes just to make a joke about cocaine. And besides, the joke is not funny, just silly. It seems it pretends to be politically incorrect or corrosive, it's just childish and stupid.The ending, that fight between the girls, is so predictable and typical like a telefilm. And the real ending, with the green sphere, wants to be mysterious and even transcendental. I thought it was pathetic. Like if somebody was going to spend a second thinking about this movie. So if you have to choose between this and any other animation movie, choose any other animation movie, you'll have chosen right. And if you wanna see a really good anime, with loads of action, just take Blood The Last Vampire.Marcuse.

Admittadly, I saw this movie AFTER I saw Heavy Metal 2000, so I might be biased in my thoughts/opinions. While there are some O.K. Parts to this movie, 95% of it is worthless drible. The Animation is AWFUL by today's standards. Even in 1980 (4 years before I was born) it probably looked like garbage. It looks like a bad Sci Fi Beavis and Butthead. The story makes little sense. Of course, you don't watch these types of movies for plot, but they could have at least tried (like HVM 2000 -the plot wasn't much but at least it was there). The music is a bunch of 80's style Hard Rock. While middle-aged viewers might enjoy this 'music', I cant see anyone else enjoying it.The violence and nudity are all that anyone could possibly like about this movie. And if you really want that, then you could watch HVM 2000.Overall, 1/10. Only older people and geeks should watch this movie.James Black Wolf Johnston blackwolf14016@hotmail.com "}]
