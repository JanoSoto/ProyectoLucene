But I don't think they could've done a much better job at spoofing high school flicks like Dangerous Minds, Lean on Me, The Blackboard Jungle and To Sir, With Love.  There are lots of witty moments that hit the bullseye.The jokes are not over-the-top, nor are they filthy and vomit-inducing like many recent spoofs.  It's from the writers of The Naked Gun and the talent really shows.  Jon Lovitz is funny, like usual.  Tia Carrerre has never looked hotter, and serves as great eye candy.  Louise Fletcher is appropriately creepy as the principal, who is sort of like a female version of Joe Clark--she also roams the hallways with a baseball bat.  The young stars like Guillermo Diaz, Mekhi Pfieffer, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Brian Hooks are very good and their timing is just right.I would probably praise this movie a lot more if I submitted this comment after my first viewing, but trust me--it's very funny!  But, like many broad comedies of this kind, it's not as enjoyable on repeat viewings.  After having seen the latest spoof, Not Another Teen Movie, I'm able to appreciate this film a lot more.  This is a spoof with wit and structure, and even has a few subtle in-jokes  the school is titled Marion Barry High.  You get it?

While Mike Myers, Adam Sandler and others have gone on to bigger things, Lovitz has primarily been background fodder for the other ex-cast members. And he's good at this, but he's also good on his own - as this movie proves. High School High was the best school movie parody of its time (before Not Another Teen Movie), taking Dangerous Minds and making a plot we should actually care about and enjoy. And we also have Tia Carrera (not to be confused with Asia Carrera).Lovitz plays a history teacher who wants to turn a school full of unwanted students into a fleet of tomorrow's best and brightest. With help from his street smarts and an intense chicken race scene, he might just accomplish his goals. But, oh no, what happens when a rival gang steals the tests or the class valedictorian turns to dealing drugs? You're just going to have to watch and see.

The simple story finds Clark working to raise the GPA's of his students in order to win a citywide school contest while pursuing romance with an attractive co-worker (Tia Carerre).This film takes pot-shots at films like The Blackboard Jungle and Dangerous Minds, but does it in an outrageous way, but that is to be expected from a film like this. As a matter of fact, David Zuker, one of the geniuses behind Airplane! was one of the contributors to the screenplay here.As expected, the gags come fast and furious and Lovitz plays his role with just enough of a straight face that makes most of the silliness going on around him funnier than it should be (though Lovitz is no Robert Hays). There are some fun supporting turns from Louise Fletcher as the hard-nosed school principal, Mekhi Pfifer as a troubled student, and Guillermo Diaz as a gang leader, but it is the lightning-swift tempo of the comic gags that keeps this one relatively entertaining for most of its ride.

Actually, this film also contains references to many other (mostly teen) movies.Don't expect Bergman or Scorcese. The humor is low brow and the sight gags are predictable. But the film is playful.

Scenarists David Zucker of Airplane, Robert LoCash of BASEketball, and Pat Proft of Brain Donors aren't as successful with this half-baked entry. The comedy in High School High seems virtually colorless. Although it boasts more jokes per screen minute than Airplane and Top Secret or the Naked Gun trilogy, this production manages at least to amuse, even though it cannot intoxicate.Weasel-faced comedian Jon Lovitz of City Slickers 2) plays Richard Clark, a sympathetic but naÃ¯ve educator who quits teaching history at a 'rich kids' academy to work in a poverty stricken ghetto school. Clark gets more than he bargained for at the inner city Marion Barry High School. No sooner has he climbed out of his car than the same vehicle mysteriously vanishes. Initially, Clark is blind to the rampant crime, gang, and drug problems afflicting the school. He is horrified to see Principal Evelyn Doyle (Louise Fletcher of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) hitting students with a baseball bat. While Clark fumbles with his own foes, Griff McReynolds (Mekhi Phifer of Clockers) is coming back to finish school after a year in juvenile detention. McReynolds wants to go straight, but a gang of drug runners refuses to let him off the hook. Before these bad boys can convert McReynolds to their cause, they have to discredit Clark. Word-plays and sight gags constitute the best of what little comedy punctuates High School High. The funniest scenes include a send-up of the Russian roulette duel in The Deer Hunter, an attempted rape in the school library, and Clark's rain-splattered expulsion. Actor-turned-director Hart Bochner concerns himself more with the plot turns than the humor. Bochner doesn't develop his mise-en-scene as imaginatively as Zucker did in his Naked Gun movies. Zucker exploited every inch of a scene, with gags on the periphery.When Bochner tries to imitate Zucker, he fails miserably at the task. Bochner shoots the background out of focus where the action occurs so audiences have a hard time spotting students failing down stairs because they wear their pants too low. Blaming Bochner entirely for these shortcomings in this marginal comedy would be to overlook the writers' slack contribution. Indeed, High School High features a couple of truly inventive gags, but the movie suffers because there is not enough funny stuff.The writers stretch jokes and ides far beyond their limits, and High School High looks like a labored sit-com. The cast performs with deadpan brilliance, but their characters are rarely inspired or loony. Zucker, LoCash, and Proft should be ashamed that it took three of them to pen what little drivel High School High has.

In the case of this movie, High School High, I expected it to be as stupid and as sucky as was Spy Hard, which is in a similar vein. I guess the difference here is that this movie is made by the same people who created Hot Shots and Flying High.Highschool High is a send up of movies about rough highschools where a dedicated teacher comes along and changes all of the students around. Such movies I have seen in vague memories, and one that comes to mind is The Principle. Basically the major character is the son of the principle of a prep-school, but the students hate him. He decides that he wants to go out on his own and takes a job at Berry High (the joke becomes apparent at the end of the movie) which is the roughest school in the States.I guess the theme of this movie is you can do anything if you put your mind to it, and just because society says that you are something, does not mean that you have to fall into that mould.The humour is simply taking the believability to the point of stupidity. I will not say absurdity, as that is a particular type of humour where one laughs at the pointlessness of life. It is a far more intelligent humour, and for an example of absurd humour, I would direct you to a French Movie called News from the Good Lord. In this movie, the humour is far less intelligent, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator. I am not saying that the humour is bad, just that it is not intelligent.This is an okay movie, and I would simply say that it is only worth watching to shut ones' mind off.

On one hand, it wants to be a traditional Zucker-Abrams-Zucker movie, with surreal, non-sensical gags coming at every moment. These movies, like Airplane and Scary Movie are more like cartoons, because they never for a moment resemble real life. You don't end up caring what happens to the characters. On the other hand, it wants to be serious at times, like many romantic comedies, where you get emotionally invested with the people and the story. These two styles don't cohere.I guess the problem is that the movie does too good of a job getting you to like the characters and wanting them to succeed. Jon Lovitz as a dedicated teacher who turns his community around was halfway believable. As I stated earlier, however, parts of the movie seem to clash with each other. They are just too different in tone. The formulaic ending doesn't help much either. I enjoyed High School High, and there are PLENTY of genuinely funny moments.

Unlike the crap that passes for parody(like anything by Seltzer and Friedberg) HSH hits all of its targets and actually has a story tied to the spoof. Compare that with spoofs that are just about picking on pop culture and meaningless gags. Jon Lovitz was hysterical and as a comedic actor, he never got enough credit. Tia Carrere was gorgeous as well as funny and Louise Fletcher was funny too as the irascible school principal. Mekhi Phifer as well as the supporting cast add to the laughs too.

But it goes overboard. It doesn't only spoof the film, it tries to be a film in its own right. And it's not.Jon Lovitz plays Richard Clark, the Michelle Pfeiffer character. He is a high school teacher, who chooses to go teach in a baaad school full of baaad people, a real Gangsta's Paradise. Does this sound familiar? After winning the students' respect by flying away with the detached hood of a convertible (really!) he proceeds to inspire them for about two minutes as a teacher, and then he goes back to being a jerk.Because Richard Clark goes beyond bumbling and into the realms of being completely and stupidly oblivious. It's supposed to be a farce, but even in the farcical frame it's unbelievable. No mean feat, really.The love interest between Richard Clark and Victoria Chapell(Tia Carrere) was obviously written by the unsuccesful partnership between an 8-year-old girl and a wife-beating pervert. It doesn't really go anywhere, anyway, except for a toe-curling, cringable groan-a-thon of a sex scene.The movie rolls along steadily until about half an hour is left of the film. That's when the writers seem to have run out of ways to make you groan within the framework of the film and decided to throw in a drug dealing ending that comes completely out of left field. It's supposed to be surprising and plot-twisting, but at this time no-one really cares about any of the characters anyway.One more thing. When Richard Clark arrives at the high school the first time, the writers (reject writers from Mad Magazine, by the look and feel of it) spend a disproportionate amount of time convincing us that this school is baaad. But, as Richard Clark has taught there for some time, the school starts smartening up. Suddenly, there is less grafitti and plants in the halls. More and more, until at the end it's a beautiful, completely restored high school. How does this happen? Where did the moeny come from, and who OKed it? Not miss Doyle, that's for dahm sure. This could, arguably, be an expressionistic metaphor for the growth and development of Richard Clark. I don't believe this, though, for two reasons a) What growth? b) This movie is nowhere near intelligent enough for that.

It's a parody of movies about teachers who get jobs at corrupt schools and try to make a difference. I was only ten years old when this came out, and it's a PG-13 rated film. When I first came across a copy of it in the video store over a decade later, I saw that the lead role was played by Jon Lovitz, a comedian I was familiar with. The film was also written by David Zucker, Robert LoCash, and Pat Proft, and I had previously seen comedies which they were involved in. Before seeing High School High, I knew it wasn't a very popular spoof movie, but there was still a chance I could find laughs in it, especially with Lovitz in the starring role, and I did. However, unsurprisingly, most of these laughs were small ones, and in the end, I was not left very pleased by the movie.Richard Clark is a teacher who leaves Wellington Academy with another teaching job waiting for him at Marion Barry High School. Unfortunately, he quickly learns that working here will not be a pleasant experience, as this is a very dangerous school full of crime, where the students in general are deeply troubled and constantly get poor marks, and it doesn't look like they have a bright future ahead of them. After arriving at the school on his first day, Clark soon meets the hotheaded principal, Evelyn Doyle, and his first conversation with her turns out to be an embarrassing one, but he then meets an administrative assistant named Victoria Chapell, and falls in love with her. Despite how much trouble Clark's class puts him through, he remains determined to somehow guide them in a different direction, and has his new girlfriend to help him, but obviously, he's going to face more than one problem along the way!Around the time I started watching this high school movie spoof, I certainly wasn't always keeping a straight face, but it didn't exactly look that promising. The first part that made me laugh fully might have been the protagonist, on his first day teaching at Marion Barry High, getting rivals to shake hands in the hall, and unfortunately, not too many gags made me laugh that hard after that. There are some fairly unimpressive sight gags and I didn't really like most of the characters. There certainly were a number of scenes that made me at least smile or laugh just a little, which may not have been the case without a talented comedian like Jon Lovitz in the starring role, and eventually found at least one touching moment. For this, I feel I COULD be giving High School High a 6/10 instead of a 5, but definitely no higher than that. I won't advise people to avoid this movie at all costs, but can understand why it doesn't even come close to having the same kind of reputation as Airplane! and The Naked Gun.

It shows an easy yet well-made story. Some perfect slapstick, lines, puns, and simple parody comedy. And the result didn't contain things like being forced, bad taste, toilet humor, or all what I watch in the comedies of today! The cast did a fine job, especially the minor parts. It's only Louise Fletcher who didn't amuse me, giving a one-note sullen face all along. The thing about Jon Lovitz is that he's Jon Lovitz in every movie or TV show. That's not a bad thing at all, but maybe it affected his career in a bad way. Although I love the guy, I even watched the movie more than once to savor him better, but sometimes his confused moves do bug.The twist of the Principal being the bad guy, who forged her students' results, was wild. Yet I can accept it as a far try to present a satire agrees with this movie's farcical time and general innocence. So accordingly when a school reaches being that bad, and stays as that, then the Principal must be a real *criminal* ! It's one small movie (it's even less than 90 minutes). But there are plenty of good dialogs (I love Where The Hell is Our Dinner ?!! the most), and detailed scenes (look at how the school was shown at the start). I can't forget the final encounter of the new students with their Principal in which they got to beat her by their hard study and right answers; see, this movie is constructively motivational on a deep level yet in its own way ! Even at one point the movie delivers a sad scene in a very special way; and I mean the moment of Richard Clark leaving the school, feeling the failure, with a rain over his head only, namely departing under a cloud literally. I love the genius blues melody in the background, the serious &#x96; rarely seen &#x96; performance of Lovitz, and the smart lines during it.Some criticized it as a predictable, formulaic...Well, so most of the comedies, rather most of Hollywood movies. However the question would be did the amount of entertainment manage to rule or not? And this time it did. So it's predictable, formulaic, yet clever and seductive to watch. I miss this kind of comedies. Now I can't find anything but teens trash, stupid family movies, and disastrous parodies like (Disaster Movie) !

Tired of his old school, teacher Jon Lovitz accepts a position at an inner city school where his car is stolen but his steering wheel lock remains. His classroom consists of loose floorboards and walls that cave to staples. None of this is very interesting although director Hart Bochner has timing on his side. Despite his efforts Lovitz is unable to elevate his role above conventions. His role is cardboard and by the numbers as he struggles to find a technique to reach these students. Tia Carrere is wasted as another teacher. She is basically there to provide a possible love interest. Louise Fletcher plays the principal as a homage to her role in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest but to a lesser degree. Mekhi Pfifer plays a student seeking opportunity but the role is never funny. Malinda Williams plays his cardboard girlfriend. This pushes a potential message of hard work and study that all but drains any remaining humour possibilities. It makes fun of the education system but for a superior high school comedy check out Fast Times at Ridgemont High and tossed this failed comedy in the detention room.

But in a comedy? It doesn't exactly work. But, I did enjoy the movie. Jon Lovitz is a funny guy, but he is miscast as the teacher. But in spite of that, he makes the movie fun to watch. He would probably be unbelievable as the teacher if this were a drama. And I don't mean 'unbelievable' in a good way. The movie has it's predicable moments, of course. But there's one moment where I didn't expect to see the principal.

High School High is a story of a teacher named Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz) who left a well-know school to a school where most of the students weren't working so well on their grades. Now Richard is trying to help these students out in getting even more good grades. Mekhi Phifer played a bright kid who wasn't doing well until Jon Lovitz' character helped him out. This movie was not only funny but it had some serious issues. But it was still funny. This is probably one of my favorite movies of 1996!BOTTOM LINE A GREAT JON LOVITZ COMEDY!  "},{"Title":"Thin Line Between Spoof And High School High Life","Date":"14 January 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Jon Lovitz stars as a sweetly idiotic idealistic teacher, who thinks he can make a difference at a troubled inner city high school with its own cemetery, no less. Tia Carrere is on hand to provide eye candy in the form of an impossible-to-believe love interest. Mekhi Phifer and Malinda Williams are the high school kids that Lovitz could lose to the gangs. They are both fine and provide more interest to watch then what else goes on at times. The problem with some spoofs, as with this one, are that the gags are sometimes too close to reality. In some cases, so much so that the gags lose their bite. A bumper sticker that says, proud parent of a D average student is one such case. It's very funny until you realize how true it has become in today's world. My favorite bit was the protective chicken wire fence between Lovitz and the students, but again it's uncomfortably close to reality in certain schools. The weapons bit too is another example. The first half of the movie was pretty funny and consistently enjoyable, but then the second half deteriorates into a mishmash of scenes that are out of sync with the times (like the drag race), or plot turns that are out of sync with the tone of the film (like the drug plot). I thought the drag race sequence was entirely dated and served no purpose. Then again, David Zucker-affiliated material is so broad at times that you almost expect these kind of disappointments. It's hard to tell what the movie is trying to do or where it's going, as written. It makes the mistake of trying to come out with a happy ending, as if it were a genuine movie made about high school life. John Neville adds credibility as Lovitz' high brow father and Louise Fletcher does a wild turn as the bitch of high school principals. ** of 4 stars.

Ok, there was room for a school satire, but there were already gaps showing in the comedic fabric and the movie ran for less than 90 minutes. I am quite a fan of Jon Lovitz and he does his part reasonably well. The lovely Tia Carrere also performs well (although that ain't saying much with her intensely stupid role), but their individual talents can't save this flick from inanity. Don't fork out any money to see this film. My vote 6/10 and it was lucky to  get it.

Not only was  the humor great, the jokes in the film proved  to be funny without the overabundance of potty jokes and bodily excrement. There are so many  great moments to high light in this film, and it hits  its marks pretty most of the time. Tia Carrere  was also good in this film, being out of place yet  ravishing in her role. One of those films you need  to watch with friends or when drunk, or both.

If you ask me, Paco (Guillermo DÃ­az) and Miss Doyle (Louise Fletcher) were pure bullies! Mr. Clark (Jon Lovitz) and Miss Chapell (Tia Carrere), on the other hand, were very good, attractive, strict, and business-like teachers. I really loved their styles. When Mr. Clark got that shock when he first entered the classroom, I laughed really hard. Oh, man, that was funny! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, Be cool. Go all the way in high school! Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Jon Lovitz, and, you haven't seen this excellent, gut-busting, in-your-face high school comedy, I highly recommend it! You're in for lots of gut-busting laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. "}]
