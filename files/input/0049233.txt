Some might describe it as rather sickly sentimental at times, but William Wyler's touch is always assured  and coaxes performances of great charm from all the principals. I saw the film for the first time in1957 and was immediately captivated by it. It has remained one of my favourite movies -and takes its place with such classics as It's a wonderful Life and Casablanca It was also the first time that I really noticed the music of Dimitri Tiomkin, who is now firmly established as my favourite film composer. He is the composer 'par excellence' in setting mood, and there is something haunting in his themes and melodies. Take away Tiomkin's soundtrack and you would destroy the film. Fortunately you can buy the CD of the soundtrack. Tiomkin also wrote the music to It's a Wonderful Life, and Gunfight at the OK Corral, which I find also strangely moving. Another feature of the film which adds to the overall charm is the inclusion of humorous touches such as Gary Cooper staring through two curtain hoops at  the music booth at the county fair which gives him the appearance of wearing glasses. The strong storyline involves the viewer directly in that one realises the crucial choice involved in taking up arms to defend one's home or refusing to oppose the aggressor because the New Testament asks us to turn the other cheek. So, what makes this film so memorable? I have spoken to people who think that this movie is O.K -nothing special, and other such comments that suggest mediocrity. But to me , there is  an atmosphere that is unforgettable- and thanks must go to the genius of Wyler, Tiomkin, Cooper and a host of talented craftsmen and women.

Still had the Monogram/Bowery Boys look to it. But the biggest and best film that little studio ever put out was this wonderful film by William Wyler.Gary Cooper by now had a whole lot of career roles, but this one as Jess Birdwell, Quaker farmer in Southern Indiana during the Civil War was probably his last really great performance. But for Dorothy McGuire this was her career role. She and Cooper work so well together that you think you are prying in on the family of Eliza and Jess Birdwell.The film is based on a novel by Jessamyn West and it's about the effects of the Civil War on the Birdwell family, the parents and the children, Anthony Perkins, Phyllis Love, and Richard Eyer. The tenets of pacifism are not easy to follow, especially during time of war. And we're not talking about war overseas. But war just the other side of the Ohio River where Confederates do cross occasionally for raiding.Each of the Birdwells feel differently about the war, including hired hand Joel Fluellen who's a runaway slave. He's got real reason to fear raiding Confederates. Phyllis Love is in love with Peter Mark Richman who's a non-Quaker friend of the family and he's gone off to war. And Anthony Perkins feels it his duty to defend what they've earned and sweat for.Perkins got an Oscar nomination for his role. It's a telling portrayal of the angst of youth brought up in a pacifist house. Perkins is a truly torn individual.Years ago I met Anthony Perkins at a science fiction convention in NYC. The poor man looked nervous and ill at ease in those surroundings. He was there because of the Psycho films and the role of Norman Bates with which he had become so identified with. I have to say he looked grateful that someone asked him about Friendly Persuasion. He said he admired both Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire as thorough going professionals and it was a pleasure to be working with them and William Wyler and associated with Friendly Persuasion.In some of the lighter moments of Friendly Persuasion before the war hits home, Cooper and Perkins go on a trip to sell some of their farm produce. They stop at widow Marjorie Main's house with her three eligible daughters who haven't seen a male face in ages. In a more liberal age it would have been quite explicit what daughter Edna Skinner does to Perkins. Cooper knows though, you can see it in his face as to what's coming.Friendly Persuasion's popularity was helped a great deal by Pat Boone's record of the title song which was a Gold record for him. But a really great version was done by Bing Crosby for the Longines Symphony in the Sixties. It was nominated for Best Song, but lost to Doris Day's Que Sera Sera.One of Gary Cooper's best screen moments ever is the death scene with his friend Robert Middleton. Middleton who is also Peter Mark Richman's father is Cooper's best friend and friendly rival every Sunday before church for him and Quaker Meeting for Gary. They have a friendly horse race on the way. Cooper finds Middleton shot and dying from a Confederate soldier. Middleton and Cooper both are superb and I guarantee not a dry eye was in any movie house when this was first released. It's followed by a scene where Cooper disarms the Confederate who killed Middleton and let him go. His Quaker faith kicked right in.Dorothy McGuire in the meantime forcibly hosts a rebel patrol who confiscate the Bidwell stores. They're about to confiscate the pet goose Samantha for dinner when she whacks the offender with a broom. The goose gets a pardon. She stood up and fought for what she loved even if it was a family pet. It's one of her best screen moments.William Wyler took some southern California landscape and did a marvelous job in recreating Indiana of 1862. He brought home a winner in every way for Allied Artists.And Friendly Persuasion will pleasure thee in a hundred ways.

Several older men in the congregation quickly turn coats, urging Cooper to join them in fighting the Rebels who plunder and burn Northern villages and kill women and children. When put to the true test, it is Cooper who proves to be the true Christian.A love story between the teenage girl and her soldier suiter is a beautiful bonus.

Though the story ultimately focuses on just a couple of the characters' concerns, along the way it provides an effective overview of their lives as a whole.Gary Cooper is surprisingly believable in a somewhat atypical role as a Quaker father. Dorothy McGuire is well-cast as the sometimes fretful mother, and Anthony Perkins works very well as the son torn between his family and what he perceives as his duty. Walter Catlett is a bit over-the-top as the organ salesman, but he is entertaining, and his character is used well. In fact, the subplot with the organ is an interesting contrast with the main plot about the war, mirroring a couple of the same themes in a much less consequential context.The setting in the American Civil War is well-conceived, and the family's dilemmas are portrayed sympathetically and convincingly. It is such a nice contrast with the type of movie that has to make its points through heavy-handed, contrived events, and it offers some worthwhile thoughts without pretending to offer easy, superficial answers.Besides all that, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie because of the many lighter, amusing moments. Director William Wyler and the cast work them in nicely with the more serious material, and the film maintains a harmonious balance throughout. It all makes for a very worthy and memorable picture.

The movie received many Academy Award nominations except for Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire as best actor and best actress.  My favorite character is the Widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main).  Widow Hudspeth is similar to Ma Kettle.  It must have been hard for Gary Cooper to keep a straight face when working with Marjorie Main.  They were both funny and delightful together.

The Wide Screen presentation on the DVD is a joy to see. There is something else that is NEW with this issue -- a screenplay credit for Michael Wilson. The film was originally released without a screenplay credit -- the title read simpily From the book by Jessamyn West. Wilson had done a script some years before when director Frank Capra had optioned the film. Many years later Wyler acquired the rights, including Wilson's treatment of the script. Wyler went after the author of the short stories that made up THE FRIENDLY PERSUASION, Jessamyn West. Reluctantly, she agreed to help devolop the screenplay. She kept a diary of her involvement with the film, which was published as TO SEE THE DREAM (highly recommended reading IF you can find a copy). West and Wyler's older brother worked for a very long time to shape the movie into the form it finally took. Wilson demanded screen credit and took his case to the Writer's Guild. They sided with him, stating that he was to receive sole screen credit. William Wyler, who had worked with Wilson on previous films, declared that at most, Wilson had written 10% of the dialogue and that Jessamyn West and Robert Wyler were the ones responsible for the majority of the used screenplay. So the film was released without a screenplay credit. For awhile, Wilson had fallen in disfavor for his communist leanings, after his appearance before the House UnAmerican Committee. In order to make-up for injustices that Wilson suffered, the now quite liberal Hollywood community has cheated West and Wyler out of their screenplay rights. Anyone reading West's TO SEE THE DREAM will have a difficult time accepting Wilson as the sole screenplay author. It probably should read Screenplay by Jessamyn West and Robert Wyler with addition material by Michael Wilson. One of the nice EXTRAS on the DVD (and I think on the VHS also) is a Behind-The-Scenes Segment from the 1955 NBC-TV Series WIDE WIDE WORLD. West, in TO SEE THE DREAM, makes mention of this event. It was the first time that LIVE TV visited a movie set on location. We get to see Gary Cooper rehearse a little song that was not used in the film. And the Theatrical Trailer is for the European release of the film. It is interesting to see how scenes have been re-edited to make it appear that Cooper is involved directly in a lot more action then he actually is in the film. One thing is for sure -- FRIENDLY PERSUASION is one of the true gems of the cinema -- a warm and loving film that truly lives up to the promises of the ads It Will Pleasure You In A 100 Ways!.

Walter Catlett, who plays a bumbling organ salesman, nearly steals a large part of the movie trying to convince the Birdwells that an organ purchase would enrichen their lives- knowing fullwell that music in the home is against the Quaker religion. Dorothy Mcguire gives a brilliant performance as mother Eliza Birdwell, the spiritual glue who holds the family together through any crisis.

Without going into much detail I eventually left the environmental movement due to disillusionment and I have little good words to say about Quakers / pacifists and their dubious moral stance . When I learned about the plot of FRIENDLY PERSUSION which centres around a Quaker family who find themselves caught up in the American Civil War and having to find themselves choose between practical necessity and principal I just knew I'd have to see it . Here is a movie that personifies what great drama is all about where the protagonists have to make deep decisions and hopefully illustrates the hypocrisy of pacifism , but after seeing the movie I was aghast at its lack of drama and complexity. Worse still it lacks moral courage The opening scene is straight out of a Walt Disney production . Filmed in glorious and beautiful technicolor we see a young child little Jess Birdwell being attacked by a goose with entirely human mannerisms . The character interaction between goose and child is amusing and becomes something of a running theme in the movie . The story continues as the Birdwell family and their Quacker friends discuss the war and how they're going to stick to their self righteous principles and not take part in it and you just know that they'll have to discard their principles and take part by the end . Alas as the film continues I started to notice more and more wasted potential as to the drama What is the film trying to say ? Is it saying that war is wrong or is it saying pacifism is wrong ? . We see large portions of the running time dedicated to the pacifist characters self righteously saying they'll not take part in the conflict then the most self righteous critic Purdy takes up arms when is farm is burnt down by the Rebs . Is Purdy condemned as a hypocrite ? Possibly but it's understandable he wants revenge , what's not so understandable is why the elder Birdwell son Josh joins the Union home guard , especially since he's watched his parents condemn Purdy's actions . When Jess Birdwell Snr realises his son might be dead he picks up arms in a character arc that's not entirely convincing and it's here that the movie starts to fall down .Jess narrowly survives being killed by a Reb who he overpowers but eventually sets free . Wouldn't it have been more dramatic if he'd killed his prisoner ? And while he's away his homestead is visited by Confederate forces ! Oh no his wife and daughter will get gang raped before they're murdered with young Jess ! Actually they won't because these soldiers are very polite and appreciate Mrs Birdwell looking them dinner , they're so appreciative they even apologise for thinking of the family goose as lunch . And the movie ends with with the Birdwell family intact except for Josh who has his arm in a sling The problem with all this is that there's little involving the fundamental core of drama - Internal conflict . People easily pick up guns but their motives for doing so are not always convincing . When they come back from the war nothing as really changed from a dramatic viewpoint , they're still alive and everything they hold dear is still there . It might involve making changes to the original book but wouldn't it have been far more poignant if a couple of the Birdwell's had died thereby illustrating the cruelty of war along with the need to fight ? Director William Wyler and many of the contemporary audience of FRIENDLY PERSUSION had seen the first hand horrors of war , whilst here the movie points out that the enemy are not brutal and everyone goes home to their family after a conflict . What a dangerous and hypocritical message to send out "},{"Title":"Religion Meets War","Date":"29 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, War, Western","Review":" The pacifist attitude of a Quaker family is tested as a result of the American Civil War.The worst thing about this movie the strange rear-projection during buggy scenes, although I will let it slide as a strange relic of the time. Best thing about the movie Dorothy McGuire was cast as Cooper's wife after Wyler's choice, Katharine Hepburn, declined. Not only was McGuire very good, but it kept that useless hack Hepburn out of a good film.What I appreciate most is the story of the film's production. Writer Michael Wilson told HUAC in 1951, I feel that this committee might take the credit, or part of it at least, for the fact that 'The Friendly Persuasion' was not produced, in view of the fact that it dealt warmly, in my opinion, with a peace-loving people. Although it took a couple years, a slight name change, and Wilson's name removed, the film did still come out.There were some other changes What happened to Wilson's pacifist script after Capra dropped it, notes film historian Joseph McBride, reflected the political climate of the Cold War. When William Wyler directed the film for Allied Artists in 1956 as Friendly Persuasion, he had the story changed to make the Quaker youth (played by Anthony Perkins) become a killer. The Quakers in Wyler's version, as Pauline Kael observed, 'are there only to violate their convictions.' But some of the strength of Wilson's conception remains, as in a scene of a crippled Union Army officer respectfully challenging the steadfast Quakers about pacifism in their meeting house. I would like to have seen the stronger argument for pacifism...The film also received mild criticism for certain inaccurate portrayals of Quaker views, such as a misunderstanding that although Quakers disliked programmed music they did value individual original expressions of it; and in meetings, Bible passages are not read verbatim but speakers recite scripture from memory and express its meaning in their own words. Here is another thing I would have liked to see, a stronger and more accurate portrayal of Quakers. But the point was to pick a religious group that was anti-war, not necessarily be strict in the representation. So we must not be too harsh.

Year 1862. In American Civil War. Jess and Eliza Birdwell his wife live in a community that has not yet been reached by the conflict that seeks the abolition of slavery. They themselves are a slave, Enoch who treated with the utmost dignity and respect. His life seems very harmonious and spiritual, Jess dedicated work of the earth, while Eliza is Quaker church minister. His children are very special the little Jess Jr., lives in conflict with the goose Samantha. Joshua is a quiet young man who does not deny his doubts about his religion. And Mattie live love with a Union soldier, Gard Jordan, son of Sam, the laughing and joking friend of Jess Birdwell , both competing in the race for the church.Everything seems to be in harmony and in close communication with God ... but we will soon realize that they fail to follow the dictates of their consciences. The church has taken away the joy, music, dancing, wine ... and even their language is different from the rest of the community, and has become solemn and bombastic.The Bridwell family wants to follow the rules of the Quakers, and thus assume the rules with greater commitment ... but something deep inside of them crying for their freedom, and then begin to live with hypocrisy you buy a piano and hide it in the attic to avoid gossip. They go to a show and dancing springs from their feet, but only Mattie dares to break the norm. She kisses Gard and feel immoral when others discover...And soon the biggest test. Can infamy attack and abuse the batterer without sin mean? ... These and other questions will arise in the hearts and minds of the Birdwell family, and many others of the Quaker community.William Wyler film achieves strong and powerful reflections that we sharpen awareness and alert us about many things that can happen. The question is the way open for answers and this story makes us so hopeless, that we do a few.A sly and rogue Gary Cooper, a serene and lovely Dorothy McGuire, and a hilarious Robert Middleton, lead a brilliant cast that gives us a picture of family and community nuances unforgettable and charming anecdotes.This work customs, rural, reflects on the conflict between maintaining a belief and reality. Think about the limits of ideology and human imperfection, between attempted control behaviours, and natural impulses of instinct.This reflection comes amid a beautifully shot, excellent actors and the sweet music of Dimitri Tiomkin caressing.Naturalistic film, serene, shows dramatic containment not always exhibited the excellent director William Wyler.

The film provides not only a lesson in the lifestyle of a Quaker family in Indiana, it reveals the personal impact and heartbreak of the American Civil War. It was hard for a young man to adhere to his family's pacifist beliefs when he knew his friends were going off to war to defend the very place he called home. Civil War buffs unwittingly romanticize this national trauma which took the lives of over 600,000 young men. This movie brings it down to a personal level. Although filmed closer to Hollywood, the story takes place in Jennings County, Indiana. Although the soil of the Hoosier State was very lightly touched by battle, the fear of invasion was real. The little town of Vernon, mentioned in the movie, is still much the same as it was in the 1860s.

When Dorothy McGuire is engulfed by Confederate army she offers them food, she cooks, perhaps a bit unrealistic but by the time the soldiers reached Southern Indian they were ragged and fatigued.

Every one of the Quaker characters at some point acts violently or endorses violence, either on impulse or principle. It nowhere suggests that pacifism is about finding alternatives to violence or confrontation - the little comedy about the organ is a case in point. (He brings it home, she won't have it in the house and sleeps in the barn, he joins her there; they never actually discuss the issues involved.)The one thing about Friends the makers of this film are sure of is that they say thee - they say it very clearly, and they say it much more than you or I ever say you. It grates. I guessed that the plain speech would be already obsolescent by the time of the civil war, but I stand corrected. Its purpose, after all, was to emphasise that all people were equal in the days when you in the singular was only used to one's betters. When everyone addresses everyone as you, it becomes an affectation, something Quakers deplore.

With Gary Cooper in the cast, even portraying a Quaker, I thought there would be more in the way of conflict for the main character to face and persevere against. I know, the conflict turned out to be more of an inner one, with conscience winning out against hate and revenge, but within the context and setting of the Civil War, the outcomes of the various characters didn't ring true to me. Now should Jess (Cooper) have slain the Rebel soldier who killed his friend Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton)? It was a self defense situation and Jess would certainly have been justified, war or not. If the intent of the story was to see Jess through to standing by principle, then I guess it worked. But Jess could have wound up dead just as well.The more principled stand was probably taken by son Josh (Anthony Perkins), who was determined to protect his family's land and property. When the Rebs overran the farm and then wound up basically as house guests of Eliza (Dorothy McGuire), that's where I thought credibility went completely out the window. These weren't even uniformed soldiers for the most part, and initially acted more like marauders when they arrived at the Birdwell farm. Their behavior turning on a dime wasn't realistic in the least; not even one of them was portrayed as a cutthroat soldier. Even the guy who went after the goose seemed to see the error in his ways rather quickly once it was explained to him.I guess what I was expecting was something more along the lines of John Wayne's 1947 film Angel and the Badman, and more recently, a modern take on the pacifist theme in the 2002 TV movie The Outsider with Tim Daly. However in both of those films, the principal male character was not a Quaker and brought conflict into the story by virtue of their gunslinging reputations. Which reminds me, in both of those films, Wayne and Daly left their holstered weapons outside, honoring a Quaker tradition of not allowing weapons to cross the home's threshold. In this picture, Jess and son Josh both have rifles that are stored in the farm house. I don't know if that's an important point or not, but it's something I wondered about having seen the other pictures mentioned.

Rarely, though, are there ones that bridge that perilous divide with such elegance, insight, and charm. This is due in part to the casting, with an impeccable Gary Cooper, and an equally accomplished co-star in Anthony Perkins. But every great film requires a great man at the helm and who could compare with Billy Wilder, a true American treasure. This movie also stands as a emotional look at the war between the states, what we call the Civil War. Many families and communities were torn apart by that war, and although we hear about those travails in books, capturing it on film is an entirely different story. This film does it so well. In today's films, featuring bloodshed and violence on a scale unheard of when this film was produced, watching it again as a 65-year old man still brought tears to my eyes. It was truly a gentler, sweeter time then, which this movie captures so well. Although there is a modicum of violence in this film, it only serves the plot... of the utter senselessness of war.

Released in 1956, this William Wyler film holds up today because some of the debate and dilemmas touched on remain unresolved 57 years (and numerous wars) later. The film takes place in 1860's Indiana as the Civil War rages. The story is told from the perspective of a pacifist Quaker family and is based on the 1945 book by Jessamyn West.The patriarch of this Quaker family is played by Gary Cooper, who was four years past his Oscar winning performance in High Noon, and five years from his death due to cancer. His wife, the Minister Eliza, is played well by Dorothy McGuire, who the following year would play the mother in Old Yeller. The film's best performance comes from young Anthony Perkins (his second film) who of course made cinematic history as Norman Bates in the 1960 classic Psycho. Both of these Perkins characters share mommy issues and complicated decisions of conscience.The opposition to war and violence is the main theme here, and there have been many interpretations over the years. Is it religious belief or fear that prevents the men from joining the cause? At least Perkins' character is honest enough to wonder. Cooper kind of plays against type here since he was so often a man of movie action, but in reality his strength of character and belief allows him to maintain his image.Comedy relief is at hand given the youngest son's ongoing battle with Samantha the Goose, a family pet with devious attack modes. And daughter Mattie, played by Phyllis Love, falls madly in love with a soldier played by Peter Mark Richman. See, every character has their own personal battles and decisions regarding conscience and violence.The great Margaret Main has a sequence as a single mother of three daughters (every one a gem!). The daughters introduce Cooper and Perkins to the joys of music ... forbidden by the Quaker church. One of the daughters is played by Marjorie Durant, whose father was a writer and assistant to Charlie Chaplin. Her grandmother married EF Hutton, so Ms. Durant could have spent a great deal of time researching her only family stories.While it's difficult to understand these days, screenwriter Michael Wilson was not originally credited for his work. He was on the Hollywood Blacklist, and his screen credit was not reinstated until 1996. William Wyler was one of the most successful directors in Hollywood history and his resume includes Jezebel, Mrs Miniver, The Best Years of Our Lives, and of course, Ben-Hur. Though this movie was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, it didn't win any and lost out to Best Picture winner Around the World in 80 Days. A final note of interest, this was Ronald Reagan's favorite movie and he presented a copy to Mikhail Gorbachev in hopes the message would prove the downside to war.

Apart from having confused children, these are people who are living a rural, agricultural and U.S. version of monastic life about as honestly and well as it can be lived. That is the theme of this film--living by one's ethics, even when these are being tested--especially then. The time chosen to test those ethics, by some very good writers, is the early period of the Civil War in the North. The Quakers depicted in Jessamyn West's charming and well-plotted short stories, Jess Birdwell and his wife, played by Gary Cooper and Dorothy Mcguire, are trying to live by a set of rules that works miserably in the secular world and extremely well for them on their remote farm and in their food-selling business. There are three children, admirably played by Tony Perkis and Phyllis Love, who is in love with a neighbor's sonplayed by Mark Richman (whose father great actor Robert Middleton is Jess's buggy-racing rival and best friend) and their young son, Richard Eyer. The film is episodic but has the flow of a peaceful river; only the late raid by Confederates which causes Perkins to abandon pacifism and Cooper to be sorely tempted to kill momentarily deflect the course of the family's honesty. The family farm receives unwelcome guests-- raiders, among whom Mcguire risks her life to save their obnoxious pet goose; other incidents various family members survive include church meetings, a visit to the widow Hudspeth and her daughters (a lady portrayed by stalwart Marjorie Main), a County Fair, the temptation of an organ, and others. There are fine performances in smaller roles by Edna Skinner, Richard Hale, John Smith and Walter Catlett among others. The music is by Dimitri Tiomkin, costumes by the legendary Dorothy Jeakins. Cinematography by Ellsworth Fredericks and the art direction by Ted Haworth are outstanding, as is every other aspect of the sprawling but unified gem. The script develops West's stories exactly; she supervised the film; but the lion's share of the credit goes to William Wyler, who produced and directed this masterwork. One-of-a-kind and certainly a more eloquent argument for separation of secular and church institutions--including the production of children--than anything agnostics or civil libertarians could ever argue. Lovely from start to finish, moving and unforgettable.

However, the husband (Gary Cooper) seems to have more trouble than usual trying to keep this separation, as lots of temptations seem to get the best of him (such as music and his desire to best his Methodist neighbor). As for the wife (Dorothy McGuire), she seems like a giant wet blanket--a veritable black hole that sucks all the fun out of everything! If it's fun, she's against it! As for their three kids, all of them also struggle with temptation and external influences that challenge their commitments to the simple Quaker lifestyle. Ultimately, when Southern raiders attack, each member of the family is faced with the decision to sit by passively, fight for their country or run.This is a lovely film to watch for many reasons. It's obvious that the director, the great William Wyler, took his time allowing the story to unfold. Along the way, there were lots of nice vignettes that served to give this film a lot of heart and a nice gentle sense of humor. In addition, the actors did a very nice job and the end result is very enjoyable--at least up until the end. The end just annoyed me because several of the characters seemed so untrue to who they were throughout the rest of the film. In addition, any respect you had for their religious commitment was negated by some of their actions. The wife, for instance, actually AIDS the Confederate soldiers--and I thought although the Quakers would be against violence, they would NOT condone treason. And, as for the father, after Confederates just killed his friend and one of them tries to kill him, he hits the guy and tells him to just go away. Huh?! It was as if the writers just didn't know how to wrap all this up and I felt dissatisfied--especially after investing well over two hours on the movie.My opinion is that the film is a lovely narrative but the writing at the end just left me cold.

They could be the means with which to tell a simple story or present a message with contemporary relevance. Friendly Persuasion is an unpretentious costume drama (not technically a Western although it looks a bit like one) which speaks about pacifism and the difficulties of reconciling religious discipline with human self-expression.Unusually for a picture from this era, Friendly Persuasion only had one screenwriter, the blacklisted Michael Wilson. Although Wilson had done some great stuff in collaboration, the fact that he was on his own here shows. The overall idea and structure of the story is very strong. The first part is full of light humour and touching vignettes of family life, the idea of this presumably to give more impact to the darker and more dramatic final act. However this build-up and meditation on Quaker life is all a bit too neat and simplistic, as temptations such as dancing, fighting and gambling are lined up and dealt with one after the other. Even the weightier finale I feel pulls too many punches, with a very pat ending that seems almost disrespectful to the issues involved.Behind the camera is director William Wyler, one of the very best. Unfortunately Wyler, who around this time had a self-confessed urge to move away from small-scale dramas towards the fun of the big picture, seems to have neglected some of his dramatic sensibilities. It is great that he brings the most out of the landscape's beauty, and uses this as a backdrop for the tenderness of the story. It's also brilliant that he tends to use long takes with multiple characters in the shot, allowing scenes to play out naturally before us. However, he doesn't close things down often enough to bring in intimacy or personal space. He doesn't isolate characters so our whole focus is on them, at least not until the final act. In the broad expanse of the first part of the picture, we miss out on any real emotional connection with individuals via the camera. Not that I would want him to overuse the more intimate techniques, and in fact the beauty of his earlier pictures was that he didn't overuse them, but when he did put them in he got them just right. Thank goodness for the cast, upon whose shoulders it mainly falls to convey the sympathy and humanity of this picture. Although he apparently didn't like the role, Gary Cooper is just what you need here &#x96; relaxed, steady and universally likable. Conversely though, he and co-star Dorothy McGuire did not get along &#x96; although you'd never know it, since she comes across believably as his perfect companion. Some wonderful supporting players provide the picture with its only effective comedy. Walter Catlett, here sounding more than ever like Honest John from Pinocchio, manages to give a hilarious turn from a part that isn't really funny on paper, but is under his delivery. Marjorie Main is terrific, in a section of the story that is somewhat silly and unnecessary, but made bearable by her understatement. And then of course Russell Simpson, a familiar face from many John Ford pictures, who does little more here than give disapproving looks, but adding a wonderful comic touch by doing so. The standout performance is undoubtedly that of Anthony Perkins, perhaps a little unfairly so because his role is the only one that really calls for such a level of passion and intensity, but he does magnificently. At the Oscars he lost out to Anthony Quinn in Lust for Life. Fair enough, Perkins is a little too overwrought at times, whereas Quinn is always full and rounded. Friendly Persuasion is a picture that ought to be excellent, and in many little ways it is. But I feel there may have been a bit too much confidence on the part of the makers &#x96; Michael Wilson's confidence in his abilities as a lone screenwriter, William Wyler's confidence in the beauty of the image to translate to that of the story, and in the cast to carry the movie through their performances. It is perhaps an unfortunate product of independent production &#x96; made with good intention, stuffed with great ideas, competently made at least in part, but not pulled off with the level of teamwork and practical dedication to make its message work.

After all, it's hard holding onto non-violence when everything dear is threatened with destruction. But remember, this is Hollywood where rough edges tend to get finessed in crowd-pleasing fashion. And that's what happens here, though the compromises are rendered so smoothly, it's hard to notice.Hard to think of anyone more suited to the role of upright father than Gary Cooper. Every pore of his stature oozes rectitude. Thus we're sure that whatever he does will be morally correct. Same for the sweetly insistent Dorothy Mc Guire as mother Birdwell. However, Tony Perkins is Tony Perkins, twitches and all. Still, he's well suited to a conflicted young man, torn between what other young men are doing and the family's strict precepts. It was also astute to cast the rather plain Phyllis Love as the daughter instead of someone more glamorous. She and the wonderfully impish little Eyer make persuasive siblings. All in all, the movie is Hollywood entertainment at its shrewdest, such that it's hard to notice the moral and religious complexities that have been so cleverly finessed.

The most ridiculous claim was from the right wingers flapping their wings. Speaking of that, it should be mentioned that Samantha the goose was one helluva scene stealer. Four honks.I thought the movie was a beaut. I live in an area that was an early Quaker settlement, and there are still two active Friends churches. Needless to say the 'thou' and 'thee' are out of fashion, but the warmth remains.My only puzzlement is that the family, whose house still stands and is a tourist attraction were, like all Quakers, anti-slavery, but the family did own four slaves.Back to the movie. Cooper, the fightin' hero of Sgt. York, does a complete turnaround as a pacifist poppa, and he does so wonderfully, telling his story not only by his words, but by his facial expressions.Perkins was perk-fect as the son of Cooper and McGuire. I wonder what Coop and Perk talked about between takes - hopefully not sexual preferences.Friendly Persuasion told its story quite well, and is particularly enjoyable if you just watch and enjoy, instead of watching for things gone wrong. That is very un-friendly.

Gary Cooper breaks out of his usual roles as the father, Jess Birdwell, who isn't adverse to a bit of fun despite his strict Quaker beliefs, and Dorothy McGuire is perfectly cast as his somewhat fretful but tender minister wife. Phyllis Love is captivating as their romantic teenage daughter, and Anthony Perkins, later unfortunately typecast in some rather oddball roles, puts in a splendid performance as their son Joshua, who is morally torn between his pacifist beliefs and his feeling of duty to protect his family from the invading southern army.While the backdrop of the story is the rural north and the horrible conflict of the Civil War and how the Birdwell family deals with it, there are so many warm and charming snapshots of family life and the love they have for one another. Plus the score by Dimitri Tiomkin is haunting and sweet and perfectly underscores the feeling of the movie.I missed this one as a child and I'm so glad that I got to see it at last! P.S. Marjorie Main is cast as a widow woman who is the mother of three rather aggressive daughters who haven't seen a man in far too long! She has great chemistry with Cooper, who seems about to crack up during their screen time together. This is one of the cute little sidebars to this film.

The farm in the picture is run with 3 adult males and it is as manicured as a high-end country club. Also, Indiana never looked more like Southern California (the picture was shot less than 50 miles from Hollywood). But there is some attempt to treat serious matters interspersed with the heart-warming vignettes, and since I even like movies like State Fair, I enjoyed this. (Except for the scenes with Marjorie Main -- those belong in a Ma&Pa Kettle movie.)The performances are all solid and the cinematography is beautiful.

William Wyler was the greatest director of his era Jezebel, The Little Foxes, Wuthering Heights, The Letter, Mrs. Miniver, The Best Years Of Our Lives, The Heiress, Ben Hur, Funny Girl, and this movie Friendly Persuasion. Bette Davis deemed Wyler the Great Love Of Her Life and Her Greatest Director The Little Foxes, Jezebel and The LetterFriendly Persuasion is a beautiful film with a great co starring role for Dorothy McGuire.One of my favorite movies of all time. Thou Swell! Friendly Persuasion was a movie distributed by Allied Artists, a small studio, now defunct, and I am wondering if this film is on DVD? It is one of Gary Cooper's finest efforts as well as a signature film of William Wyler's. Mr. Wyler was a great Director known for many re takes of a scene, frustrating many of the great stars who worked for Wyler Bette Davis, Olivia DeHavilland, Frederic March, Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Jennifer Jones, Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine. When De Havilland, a great actress, challenged Wyler on the amount of retakes, asked of Wyler, what do you want, Wyler replied  I Want it Better I wonder how Gary Cooper so great an Actor he made his work seem effortless took to the many takes Wyler demanded in his pictures?

Tony Perkins claimed that Gary resented him getting the part due to his age and inexperience. He ignored him through the entire filming!If Bing had made the film, I wonder if he would have sung the title song instead of Pat Boone? While his role in Man on Fire was not a singing one, he sang the title song during the opening credits. Stagecoach was his only theatrical film where he did not sing.

Will the Birdwell men fight for their freedom or hide behind the sanctity of the church? Gary Cooper plays the family patriarch with a rascally touch; he coasts through the role--never letting us forget he's acting the good sport--though his boyish charm sparks the proceedings and attains the good will of the audience. The children bristle under the strict guidance of their by-the-Good-Book mother (a retread performance from Dorothy McGuire), with eldest son Anthony Perkins questioning the family's refusal to become involved in potentially violent matters. There's also a bad-tempered goose, and a freckle-faced child who opens the movie with a voice-over narration (which is then, thankfully, abandoned). Certainly the most prestigious picture up to this time to be released from second-string Allied Artists, though the plastic coating over the project mitigates against enthusiasm. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Masterpiece","Date":"3 January 2009","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War, Western","Review":" From the first frame of a tapestry landscape, the first note of the song, Thee I love, sung by Pat Boone, to the magnificent photography and superlative acting by absolutely everyone, even the most tertiary of actors, Friendly Persuasion persuades you to watch in awe. It is an out and out masterpiece. The screenplay could not be improved (pity its author could not have not his name on the credits thanks to Senator McCarthy) and the dialog does not come any livelier or more balanced. Love is conveyed throughout in gentle touches or then in a truly volcanic display by Mattie, the daughter of the Quaker couple (Cooper and Maguire). There are comic touches throughout, with the goose, Sam, and the horses Rover and Lady in top form... but it is the ever nearer and increasingly inevitable Civil War that gives the film its perceptive, sincere and humane core. Cooper acts, as ever, with considerable restraint, Maguire likewise. They are one of the best and most convincing married couples I have ever seen on the screen, certainly more than a match for Tracy and Hepburn. A young Perkins also provides a highly creditable performance but if I were to elect one aspect as perfection itself, then that aspect would be William Wyler's direction. I urge you to see this film I have derived ever greater pleasure from it every time I have watched it. "},{"Title":"War! What Is It Good For?","Date":"10 July 2004","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War, Western","Review":"  A long time getting to the point hurts Friendly Persuasion. The film is about a family of Quakers in 1862 Indiana who oppose war and violence just as the Civil War is hitting its hottest point. The eldest child (Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins) of parents Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire gets torn between his faith, his duty, his home, his wants and his freedoms. While this occurs a local soldier (Robert Middleton) courts Perkins' younger sister (Phyllis Love) and also makes Perkins think about what he really should do for the war effort (if anything). Cooper and Perkins are dominant figures here as they steady very shaky direction by Oscar nominee William Wyler. The pacing is a mess as it literally takes about 100 minutes before anything intriguing takes place. An extensive background of the Quaker way of life seems to be the primary focus through most of the picture. Finally a decision is needed as to what the family is going to do when the Confederacy starts to invade their lives. Overall a good film from the period. It remains one of the more curious and interesting pictures of the American cinema. 4 stars out of 5.

Even most avowed pacifists eventually find some kind of armed action to support -- or at least refuse to condemn. And the fiercest hawks frequently become fervent doves when the gruesome reality of war rips apart their lives. Movies, on the other hand, tend to look at war in black and white. Flag-waving films make combat seem like the ultimate glory. Anti-war films make human conflict appear so absurd, you wonder why it happens so often.Friendly Persuasion is that rare movie that captures the moral ambiguity of war. It's about a family of Quakers living in a border area during the Civil War. As devout opponents of slavery, they care even more than their neighbors about the Union cause. But their faith tells them that the best cause is not worth fighting for. Their stand alienates them from their community, raising suspicion that they are cowards, slackers or even traitors. And that's only the half of it. Eventually, the war comes to them, and forces them to question their beliefs and their view of themselves and each other. Some of their warlike neighbors go through similar moral upheavals.There's no need to point out how well acted this movie is. The material is the thing. It's a movie that makes you care while making you think. Bravo!

There are good performances by all, including Perkins as the son who is conflicted about joining the cause, Middleton as Cooper's competitive friend prone to gales of laughter, and Samantha the Goose as the mischievous family pet.
