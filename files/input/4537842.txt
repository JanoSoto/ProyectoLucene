It quickly degrades into one song after another with essentially no plot. It is the only movie (show) that I can remember turning off before it was over (I got about 3/4 of the way through). The only enjoyable thing (for me) was the opening song where Bill Murray sings. I was surprised that his voice was that good. After that, it down-slid from a story with songs into just songs (and the Bill Murray songs were nowhere as good as the opening).It has also been described (on other sites) as a tribute/re-do of old time variety shows. It is not even close. I'm old and have seen them all (from the 1950's and on). This isn't even close.I am a Bill Murray admirer (short of a fan). I can't recommend this to anyone unless you want to hear Bill Murray sing (which is why I gave it a 3 of 10.

This film is simply a bewildering waste of your time. It's not funny, and it lacks any sort of narrative. It boasts several cameos from actors in the comedy field, but the film is essentially just Bill Murray dreaming of singing carols with them.Murray stands in what I initially believed to be his apartment, and sings a song for two minutes, is greeted by Amy Poehler, who wants him to film a Christmas special, which he begrudgingly does, and sings another song with Chris Rock. He then loses power, no longer has to do the show, and is snowed in. He subsequently sings 15 more carols, passes out drunk, meets George Clooney and Miley Cyrus, and for 15 minutes, I sh*t you not, sings Christmas carols uninterrupted. He then wakes up in his apartment, sings "We Wish You A Merry Christmas", and left me in shock as the credits rolled. My middle finger slowly extended.By the time I was finished, I was just left confused. Confused as to who wanted this, and why. I swear, it borders on being an opera.

This one, not so much. It was really disappointing as a fan. I agree with several other reviewers that Bill Murray's talent was underutilized. I expected it to have a bit more of a plot and a bit more of his usual quick wit humor. It's not so much a movie with a plot as it is a celebrity karaoke night with Bill Murray as a host and also a bit of a therapist to some of the characters in the bar. I feel like they phoned a few celebrity friends, got together for a slumber party in a warehouse, sang songs and filmed it, used the first takes on all of the scenes and hurriedly put it together to get it on Netflix in time. Some songs were decent enough, but others were a disaster. Possibly on purpose, but didn't cut it humor wise. If you are someone who enjoys celebrity cameos, perhaps you'll enjoy this. It just wasn't funny for us to watch a bunch of celebrities we know are not singers fail (miserably) at singing and a bunch of celebrities we already know are decent singers be decent or mediocre at singing.If you're going to watch this, be prepared with something else in front of you to do while it's on, like wrapping Christmas presents, so you don't have to feel like it was a total waste of your time.

Perhaps to indulge in a little nostalgia, or perhaps to pause and be grateful for food in the belly, a warm place to stay, and whatever friends or companions one actually has in this complex and difficult world.Before the merchants and the religious fanatics seized upon it, the Winter Soltice was the pagan season of Yule, a time of song, feasting, alcohol and socializing. (Look it up if you don't believe me!) This is a show of song, and of actors pretending to eat, drink and performing lightly comedic dialogue so as to simulate socializing. Additionally, this show takes pains to acknowledge the fact that real life is nothing like the saccharine shopping-mall mega-church fantasies which propel most Xmas season programming.The banter and music are mostly amusing, sometimes even quite good, and there is even a hint of genuine sentiment at one point, but thankfully not overdone.Sometimes you want a TV show that is not heavy or demanding, a kind of electronic fireplace to keep you (and hopefully a companion) company for the better part of an hour, and sometimes you need a little help getting through the holiday season. Some people find the videotronic images of Bill Murray and Paul Shaffer to be an amiable presence. If you are such a person and have a nominal appreciation for irony, this is a good show to watch.

It is in New York and there is a bad snowstorm that virtually closed down NYC as Murray (playing himself) is about to host a Christmas Special. He has a number of guests all playing themselves. Maybe it is a spoof of the old variety shows that actors and singers like Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole used to have.

The purpose of the event was to raise money for Ferrell's friend's charity that helped give terminally ill kids an opportunity at college education, but instead of making a meaningful contribution that would go unnoticed like many would, Ferrell had to embellish it and make it all about him. This, in turn, led to a purposeless publicity stunt and a film that screamed nothing but vanity and ego for Ferrell himself.With that, just in time for the holidays, Bill Murray, enough universally loved and respected actor, has decided to hop aboard the train of mindless projects that assume we, the audience, is just going to bust a gut throughout because the titular actor is the lead in the film. Sofia Coppola's A Very Murray Christmas is pointless Christmas special, never quite making the stride towards self-referential humor but never acting like a straight-forward comedy either. As a result, we get fifty-six minutes of Christmas carols from recognizable faces punctuated by a sulking and brooding Murray and banter between him and other celebrities.The film revolves around a lonely Bill Murray, who has lost his holiday spirit after a vicious blizzard in New York City prevents guests like Pope Francis and Brad Pitt from showing up to his one-man-show "A Very Murray Christmas," where he was set to perform various Christmas songs. The venue he was scheduled to play at, New York's famous Carlyle Hotel, is nothing but an empty auditorium, and Murray's crushed sentiments can't even be curbed by the encouragement of a perky Amy Poehler. In the midst of this mess, Murray runs into Chris Rock, who agrees to perform a song with him in the meantime, and over the course of the day, Murray helps liven up a couple's (Jason Schwartzman and Rashida Jones) postponed wedding and finds the gall to sing alongside George Clooney and Miley Cyrus.The end result shouldn't be as cheerless as it is. To begin with, the Christmas songs move at a snail's pace and are never played for the absurdity of circumstance. It also doesn't help that writers Coppola, Murray, and Mitch Glazer can't find a consistent tone for the project and don't really know how to handle the sardonic and often bleak humor of Bill Murray's character. Secondly, the scenes interjected in between the musical numbers aren't very funny or interesting either. They're more along the lines of nudging the audience at how allegedly funny it is that Clooney, Cyrus, and Murray, at one point, all share the same on-screen space. Most of these scenes are clear that Coppola and company just assumed that the presence of many actors at once would hopefully take over and, in turn, produce comedic results, but time again shows that this notion is just an excuse for lazy/minimal screen writing.Finally, what's the takeaway from this project? By the end of it, the characters don't seem to learn anything they didn't already know, the glacially paced musical numbers have mostly faded from the mind, there's not a single quotable line in the film, and Murray's attitude has made the audience exhale comfortably knowing that this special doesn't even last an hour. A Very Murray Christmas is about as perplexing as it gets, if you try to discern its themes and content in a literal sense, but it's pretty easy to understand the soulless attempt to make the audience laugh solely based on actor recognition as a result of lazy screen writing and conceptual ideas.Starring: Bill Murray, George Clooney, Miley Cyrus, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Paul Shaffer, Jason Schwartzman, and Rashida Jones.

The rest consists of Murray in a bar singing with either his friends or the directors friends, with a little help from the band Phoenix. There are connotations in the film as to if they are all dead and in purgatory, with Murray finally being blessed with his perfect show in heaven, or whether it's just a weather polluted nightmare the day before the actual show.Either way, it's beyond smug, and I fell sorry for Murray, the man is a legend, but Coppola isn't. In my opinion she's only made one decent film, and that starred Murray,mother rest are like this. Pretentious and celebrated because people are scared that they might be classed as uneducated if they don't 'get' them.Fear not, the hipsters who will say that this is the best Christmas special/movie of all time, will run home after and watch Surviving Christmas.It's tepid stuff, but what grates the most is that if it kept up with the snappy humour of the first ten minutes, it could have been wonderful.It's not.

I feel like someone wrote this and said "Hey Bill come and do this for an hour" and he did instead of giving it real thought and care and concern. It just isn't the type of thing I would watch every year. There are so many celebrities and they are underused and too quickly passed over. Bill Murray has such avid fans that he could have made this memorable and it's just very rushed. Still being so short and simple and fun, you can't really "dislike it" either. He interacts with lots of different stars, sings some songs, has some fun and it's lovable because of that. I just think the idea behind it could have been a ten and instead its run of the mill and okay at best.You'll see a ton of SNL alum (mostly modern not from Murray's own time on there) and one of my bizarrely favourite numbers is involving Bill Murray and Miley Cyrus following a George Clooney gag. I also find it extremely odd that Sofia Coppola directed and co-wrote this and while Bill Murray also supposedly co-wrote this I think they either didn't have a lot of time to do it or a lot was cut (which I doubt because it seems Netflix gives a lot of creative green lights) The point is that it is fun.

I assume they shoot it in June or July, and they film 'natural' moments hanging out enjoying the festive spirit and perhaps sharing a song while sipping on fake film brandy. I am not a fan of such shows as they mostly cannot avoid the sense of being forced and awkward. So perhaps it is deliberate that this modern version of these shows has the same qualities.In this spin we join Bill Murray as he does a live Christmas Eve show which nobody turns up to due to a blizzard in New York. With the show cancelled quite quickly, Murray finds himself in the hotel bar, where he chats to those there and sings Christmas songs. I have read criticism that this is not funny enough, which is odd because these specials are rarely thigh-slapping affairs, and nor is this one. In a way I am fine with that, because the deliberately awkward chats are part of the construction rather than a failure of the guests to have chemistry, however yes I must concede that a lot of it doesn't really spark or be as entertaining as it could have been.The guests (playing themselves or others) are mostly reasonably well used and get into the spirit of it (although Clooney is wasted). Murray himself is not too bad, even if he is playing the caricature of himself that people seem to adore. There is a slight feeling of 'all famous mates getting together, slapping each other's backs, while the viewer pays", and the special doesn't do enough to avoid that feeling, even if mostly the cast do add a lot to the events. The songs are reasonably good throughout, and as festive background the scattering of musical numbers and chatting set-ups is well done. It looks good and is well polished, even if for me it was only an average viewing experience. I did like that it captured the spirit of the variety show, but in this way I guess it should not be a surprise that I didn't really love this since I am not a fan of the genre. It is a fun addition to the genre, which plays well with its modern spin, but this adherence to the structure and style did mean that it didn't work for me personally, and may be too wry and knowing for those audiences that actually do like this type of show.

The startled jogger turns around, and, to his surprise, sees Bill Murray to be the culprit. Murray shrugs, remarks "no one will ever believe you," and strolls off. It's a great story - uncorroborated, of course - and fits perfectly into the mystique of Hollywood's most beloved melancholy clown. And if the objective of Sophia Coppola, reuniting with her Lost in Translation star, was to encapsulate the feel of that anecdote in A Very Murray Christmas (a title that sounds like it was stolen off a t-shirt) - charming, but left in a bemused, fuzzy "did that just happen?" daze - it's a feat she accomplishes with (jingle) bells on. 'Pleasant' is the first adjective that comes to mind in describing the film, but it's swiftly followed by 'odd' and 'non-narrative'. For every enthusiastic fan prone to extolling hyperbole like "I would literally just watch Bill Murray's face for an hour," Coppola appears determined to take you at your word, with this cheerfully ramshackle vision of sugarplums loosely structured around Murray's Christmas variety show being unattended and cancelled due to a raging snowstorm. At least one part of the film is a dream sequence - I'm still skeptical that more isn't - but mostly an excuse for Murray to croon Christmas carols and banter with his celebrity guest stars who flit in and out - a cute, albeit somewhat dusty premise. As with much 'Hollywood does Hollywood' schtick, the disjuncture between celebrities playing themselves (Chris Rock, Miley Cyrus, and, yes, Clooney) and celebrities playing characters (Amy Poehler, Michael Cera, Rashida Jones and Jason Schwartzman) can be a bit rocky, but Coppola largely skirts the fourth wall with cheeky grace, landing a choice Monuments Men gag amongst others (which is already probably more laughs than the film itself yielded). What the film lacks is much of a payoff or sense of purpose, which can make Coppola's trademark dreamy, leisurely pacing really start to grate as the festive sparkle wears off. There's a woven in subplot involving Murray reuniting Jones and Schwartzman's feuding couple after their wedding is postponed, but the strength of the actors' performances (particularly Jones) makes the 'sing your love to one another' sit uneasily, even amidst the kitschy, meta variety show aesthetic presiding over the film as a whole. As our host, Murray, playing the Bill Murray of Zombieland, birthday party crashing lore, is charm and class personified, compensating for the lack of plot with sheer charisma, but even he looks desperate for more to do, making it hard to avoid the feel of a wasted opportunity. The celebrity cameos are fun (Clooney in particular, who looks like he was paid for the gig in champagne, appears to relish the rank weirdness of his bit), but it all wears thin so soon that it's akin to the hangover hitting before you've left the party. Coppola's Christmas Carol is as insubstantial as a Christmas cookie, but a largely cheerful evening for all who have ever wanted to spend their Christmas doing karaoke with Bill Murray (and let's face it - who wouldn't?). But, like all good Murray stories, it fades from consciousness almost immediately, unlikely to ever be revisited, but leaving a pleasantly confusing after glow. Is it likely to worm its way into the pantheon of annual holiday viewing? Nah. Give Scrooged another go instead.

With them putting out respectable TV shows on their platform like Daredevil or good comedy specials from people like Chris Tucker or Aziz Ansari, they are an entertainment platform here to stay. Even more so, it's impressive how they stuck a big named actor like Adam Sandler to sign a four film deal with them. Let's also not forgot the film A Very Murray Christmas Netflix made with Bill Murray that came out earlier in the month to celebrate Christmas. Due to a massive snowstorm during Christmas time in New York City, Bill Murray worries that nobody will shows up to his TV show. Even with everything going on outside, guests and celebrities still find time to join Bill Murray to celebrate Christmas and to find a real meaning to the holiday. With really no plot here and only running fifth-six minutes long, don't expect a lot and this drags a lot also. It's a holiday special that depends on how much you like Bill Murray. He is much the same in A Very Murray Christmas as he is throughout the year. He is loud, obnoxious, and of course drinking is a must. His cast includes people like Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, George Clooney and others. Expect a lot of fun singing even by Murray himself and the best singing comes from really a surprising guest. With the type of talent here and with the excellent director in Sofia Coppola, I would rather have wanted this to be a full-length film with actual real characters. In a way though, that is asking a lot. A Very Murray Christmas is at least a respectable holiday special even if it's a bit of a disappointment.

Fearing that no one will see the special,Murray's hopes start to shine when he spots Chris Rock stuck in the weather,and drags him in as a guest.View on the film:Taking place largely in a hotel,co-writer/(along with Mitch Glazer & Bill Murray)director Sofia Coppola gives the trim 56 minute running time a touch of Christmas glamour,by surrounding the hotel in snowy whites which create a strong feeling of being stuck in the hotel.For the screenplay the writers take a satirical view at the fake world of TV Christmas specials,as the hilariously stiff exchanges between Chris Rock & Bill Murray recall the infamous Bing Crosby and David Bowie X-Mas special,whilst a dive into Murray's dreams reveal the diva attitude for an X-Mas special to solely focus on the host.Whilst the special offers some satirical lights,the writers struggle to keep the lively atmosphere of an X-Mas special bubbling away,with the extremely abrupt ending strongly suggesting that the film makers were unable to come up with a grand final that Christmas specials are known for.Joined by a wise-cracking Paul Shaffer and a humble Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray gives a terrific performance as himself,with Murray showing himself to be bitter and completely lacking in enthusiasm for the holiday season,as Bill wishes everyone a Murray Christmas.

My main disappointment with this is that I was expecting a story, which there really wasn't, I thought it would be about Bill Murray hosting a Christmas show that will be a definite disaster, which is eventually saved by his celebrity friends, instead the concept of Murray's Christmas special is forgotten about fifteen minutes in and the rest is just them singing Christmas songs. In anything where celebrities are playing themselves, you expect a lot of jokes to be made about them throughout, such as in This is the End or Extras, but instead they are playing very normal versions of themselves, nothing particularly exaggerated or funny about their personalities in it, in fact this definitely could have brought in more laughs, the humour is slim and any bit that's there is dry. It has its moments, but A Very Murray Christmas is a big disappointment and I expected much more from Bill Murray and Netflix, it's free to watch if you're interested, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Or something that features just cute furry talking animals etc. This is what people expect, so why offer more? Well, enter Netflix. I like Netflix. I like their "Zoetrope"- like attitude and balls to tackle on projects like "Wet hot American summer- the series", and "A Very Murray Christmas". In "Very Murray Christmas" Bill Murray plays... Bill Murray who's snowbound in New York and whose Christmas special is about to go bust. He wanders around the studio building, bumping into celebrities and regular people (played by celebrities) in similar blue situations. And very often these situations turn to singing numbers. The overall feeling is deliberately a little off-putting. It's a thinking man's comedy. Sombre, subtle, and a little meta for good measure. There's no slapstick. No Christmas trees fall down and nobody gets kicked on the balls-and heck, even two of the best Christmas classics, "Die Hard" and "Home alone", went for those in the end! But not "A very Murray Christmas". That's why I really, really, really wanted to like it. I'm sure on paper this looked promising... but in the end the non-comedy just bites itself in the tail. Dropping 2-3 songs in favor of some honest broad comedy would have definitely put this on my yuletides favourites watchlist for years to come. But sadly: no cigar. Actually we're not even so close to one that I should mention 'a cigar'.Anyhow, hats off to Netflix for an attempt full of heart. The idea of it was so great that I really have high hopes Netflix gives this another shot next year. Just instead of Sofia Coppola pick Judd Apatow. Even the idea is ready: 'Bill Murray doesn't want to do another Christmas special because his special last year got so bad reviews'.

The writing, which I assume consisted of a quick huddle before cameras rolled on each scene, is desultory and leaves the cast of well-meaning but underpowered celebrity friends hanging in the wind. Not everyone can ad lib with the charm and brio of Bill Murray, and it's unfair to expect them to. Likewise, the demands on their voices was a setup for failure. The only common denominator I could find among the guests, is they must all be on Sofia's phone and readily available. What we would have loved to see: a collection of real characters and comedians getting drunk and holding their own against the greatest karaoke host in the business, Murray. A little rapport would have gone a long way, as summed up in Murray to Chris rock: "I know you...a little." While this may have been a joke, it's impossible to tell. The conceit of Murray and Paul Shaffer holding down a Christmas special in a snowstorm is a good one; even a couple of the scenarios worked. What didn't work was the hipper-than thou tone and tossed-off feel. Highlights: the band Phoenix, who I'd never heard, playing a Beach Boys Christmas song I'd never heard. A really great performance recorded live in carpeted ambiance; "Fairy Tale of New York", with lines broken out for a 3-way delivery; Paul's masterful piano arrangements of everything.
