I'd never even really heard of MacGraw nor O'Neal before (though they both looked vaguely familiar). The Love Story theme, I was definitely aware of though.I saw it for the first time in 2002, and bawled like hell. I saw it for the second time a few weeks ago (2005) and cried like a baby again. I instantly needed to get my DVD copy. My parents always say that they don't do movies (or music, for that matter) like they used to, and on this occasion, I had to agree.The movie's premise is simple the typical boy meets girl love story, with the clich√© rich boy, poor girl angle. But I think its simplicity is part of what's so great about it. I fell in love with Oliver and Jenny (and as corny as it may sound, I think their undying love for each other is ultimately what we're all searching for), and their tragedy became my devastation as well. It's generally your typical soppy chick flick (with the exception that the pair don't live happily ever after), but probably the best one of its kind. A story like this has become so banal today, 35 or so years later, but it was surely one of the first of its kind. It hits all the right emotional buttons, and although I'm not one to usually cry over films, this one certainly had me in tears.The two very attractive leads make a cute couple, and have good chemistry. O'Neal and MacGraw both turn in very solid performances, and I quite enjoyed the foul-mouthed MacGraw. Good writing, solid acting, great music (I could listen to the musical score all day), beautiful scenes. I love Love Story. Hee! 10 out of 10 from me.

There is nothing to spoil love, trust, confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times, until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant, the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease, and has a very short time to live...Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel, giving a heart-breaking performance as the ultra-rich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny, the dying heroine, the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe, the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...Ray Milland is the 60-year-old Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong, articulate, civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...John Harley is Phil, the father of Jenny... For him, Father's love is something to cherish and respect.There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection Love means never having to say you're sorry.- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation. And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So Love Story was followed by Oliver's Story.Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears... Love Story won 7 Academy Award nominations and Frances Lai - touching music - mixed by Bach, Mozart and Handel, won an Oscar, enriching the beauty of the film...An intense, tough-looking leading actor is seen Tommy Lee Jones in his film debut...

The secret to the film's ultimate effectiveness is in it's simplicity. Director Arthur Hiller wisely films Eric Segal's screenplay (an adaptation of his own best-selling novel) in a concise and straightforward manner, allowing audiences to become enamored with the characters and involved with their plight. The film even manages to make subtle commentary on class struggles, personal identity, and even the changing attitudes of religion, all of which while never appearing preachy or obvious under Hiller's unpretentious direction.Ali MacGraw brings an undeniable spunk to her characterization here which helps undercut the potential sentimentality of the picture, and lends the finale a greater emotional punch. The natural handsomeness and effortless charm of Ryan O'Neal is used to exceptional effect, and the supporting performances of Ray Milland and John Marley (as two very different types of fathers) are terrific. This is a film that never attempts to disguise it's own thematic manipulations, which may very be why it remains so effective. French composer Francis Lai's haunting original score further enhances the film, which is justifiably considered by many to be one of the all-time tearjerkers.

Two totally different boy and girl from different social levels fall in love with each other and of course not everyone in the environment (mainly the parents of course) are happy with this. Their love life has a couple of ups and downs in which they have to weight some choices for themselves against choices for their love together. Further more the movie also features an unavoidable dramatic twist in which one of the characters get seriously sick (Don't worry, this is not really a spoiler since this is mentioned right in the beginning of the movie already). In other words this movie has all of the formulaic sappy sounding ingredients to make this a sappy formulaic romantic movie. Yet Love Story is not. Why? It's hard to put your finger on why Love Story is so much more and so much better than your average love story but I guess that you can still answer this question, once you start analyzing the movie. Although the story and all of its elements are sappy and formulaic the movie itself doesn't try to be sappy or dramatic. The movie doesn't attempt to make you cry, by putting in over-the-top dramatic filmed moments with dramatic loud music and all that sort of stuff. Instead the movie chooses to take a realistic approach, no real surprise, considering that this is a '70's movie. The decade in which the most realistic (and best) movies were made. It has as a result that the movie never feels forced or overdone. It even makes the most formulaic and predictable elements of the movie work out, as strange and unbelievable as it might sound. You also have to keep in mind that at the time it was released, this movie was not formulaic at all. It was a fresh approach on the genre and inspired many later movies. In a way Love Story was bare raising and set the standards for many later romantic movies. The movie was nominated for 7 Oscar (of which it won 1 in the end) not just for no reason. The movie is obviously made on a low budget but it makes the end result look all the more creative. It's effectively directed by Arthur Hiller, who later went on directing lame comedies. A real waste of talent. The musical score by Francis Lai is a classic and the simple effective cinematography from Richard C. Kratina makes the movie feel all the more realistic. The movie made Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal big stars for the moment and they were both even nominated for an Oscar. To be frank I didn't even always liked their characters in the movie and I've never been to fond of Ryan O'Neal as an actor. In that regard I liked the supporting cast way better with John Marley, Ray Milland and Tommy Lee Jones in his very first (and very small) screen appearance. He looked so amazingly young, that he was hard to recognize.Although the movie takes some formulaic and obvious dramatic turns, the movie still always remain perfectly watchable, just not always emotionally involving enough. So I'm not to sure about it if this is a movie that can (still) make people cry. Nevertheless the movie still has its powerful moments, mostly due to the realism of it all. Everybody should be able to recognize the situations- and put themselves in the place of the characters of the movie. Everybody have been through similar events in their life at one point, in one way or another.Now days lots of people actually complain about the tag-line and famous quote from the movie; 'Love means never having to say you're sorry'. People find this a stupid and illogical line. To those people I would like to say; Wait until you've truly falling in love once. If you've REALLY been in love, you'll understand what is the meaning of that line. Love is about mutual respect and also accepting each others less pleasantries and still love each other for it. This also means never having to apologies to each other. Actually when I was in love once and the girl felt the same way about me (Yes amazing, I know. It seems like ages ago now), whenever one of us said 'sorry' for something the other always said; 'You never have to apologize for anything to me'. None of us had ever seen the movie or heard of its famous line before, so I think that really says something about the line and the truth that is in it.It in my opinion certainly is one the best and perhaps most influential romantic movie ever made. A must-see that deserves more objective respect and higher rating on here.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The modern tear-jerker.","Date":"16 May 2000","Score":"30 out of 46 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  The modern tear-jerker for today's audiences.

After hearing a friend's recommendation, I decided to give it a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a simple film in terms of everything execution, performances, background score, direction, dialogues...The writing is incredibly great as the dialogues are creatively and amusingly witty. The movie stays focused on Jennifer's and Oliver's relationship that is portrayed with the utmost simplicity. A movie like 'Love Story' could have easily gone wrong but kudos to director Hiller for his fine execution and for pulling all the ingredients together so effectively with the help of whimsical cinematography, impressive soundtrack and fine actors. The chemistry between O'Neal and McGraw sizzles on screen. Both actors complement each other brilliantly and convincingly portray the 'opposites that attract'. Hiller has done a commendable job by bringing these two actors together and a strong rapport with them to enhance their work. Of the supporting cast John Marley and Ray Milland stand out by their strong presence. Overall, I liked the film a lot for its subtlety, ambiguity and simplicity that makes it feel more genuine. Clearly it stood the test of time as there are hardly any more movies being made these days that could reach anywhere near the level of this classic.

After all, I want a movie to be recognizable (at least with a movie about a love story, I'm not talking about movies in general. You can't expect a movie like The Godfather to be recognizable) and the acting has to be real. With certain movies from a couple of decennia ago, I sometimes have the feeling the acting isn't real, you're all the time aware of the fact that they are acting, and I think a movie can't have that.The acting here was amazing. Ali MacGraw as well as Ryan O'Neal were both excellent in their roles as Jenny and Oliver. I thought both fathers were quite good as well, specially Jenny's father Phil, performed by John Marley, who surely deserved his Academy Award Nomination. The music was also terrific in this movie. I think it's, beside the acting, one of the most important points to make this movie timeless.Unfortunately, this movie became the only success of the leading actors. It could have been the beginning of a brilliant acting career, but Love Story became the highlight of their career.

And it was a tagline that became as famous as the movie itself.Love Story is a simple tale of young love defeated by death. It's not deep and the characters are not very appealing for a movie that depends on us loving them enough to hurt when they do. Ryan O'Neal's character is a spoiled, sniveling rich boy who falls in love with the opinionated, bitchy Ali MacGraw.I think the big problem with the film is that MacGraw's character is so abrasive it's difficult to muster up enough sympathy for the ladder part of the film when she lays dying in a hospital. Even as she lays dying she is still strong enough to spout her opinions and swear like a truck driver (well, like a truck driver in a 1970 PG rated movie).O'Neal comes off far better and we do have sympathy for him. It also helps that the beautiful musical score is played over every touching scene to help underscore our emotions.Watching Love Story today it is easy to see why it was a blockbuster back then.

Yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV, a privileged Harvard hockey player, who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri, an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background. His old-school father naturally disapproves of Jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie-era, extemporaneous ceremonies. He lands his dream job in New York, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. There is a veneer of then-contemporary film-making techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller, but none of that can hide the old-fashioned, clich√©-ridden story at its core. The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic fa√ßade. John Marley (two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in The Godfather) does better as Jenny's plainspoken baker father Phil, as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias. The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. The print quality on the DVD is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller. The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal (upon whose book this movie is based) conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew &#150; Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver's roommates.

To be honest, I can't come up with one other film starring Ali MacGraw.

Yes, it's mildly entertaining and might even bring a tear to your eye. When I first saw this movie shortly after its release, I was a young college student myself (sorry, I'm dating myself here) and absolutely adored it beyond words. But time passes...oh, to be young! I haven't seen it since, but suspect my current reaction would be quite dramatically different. I'm afraid I might snicker.To summarize, it's the tale of two college students who fall in love...a rich Harvard law student, Oliver Barrett IV (played by Ryan O'Neal) and a beautiful, rather sassy, dark haired Radcliff music major, Jenny Cavalleri (played by Ali McGraw), daughter of a working class Italian father. Naturally, as one would surely predict, the course of true love does not run smooth. Oliver's authoritarian father (Oliver Barrett III) disapproves of the romance and threatens to disinherit his son. No surprises there. Rich boy, poor girl...one would be shocked if the father DIDN'T threaten to disinherit.*** WARNING SPOILER AHEAD *** The pair bed (ooooh, how risqu√©) and eventually wed, though not in a church of course...heaven forbid such a traditional, religious ceremony. To the best of my recollection, though Jenny's Italian father is Catholic, these two don't believe in God. Oh dear me, no, having faith would never do. Alas, before too long there is trouble in paradise. Jenny is soon diagnosed with leukemia (I believe) or a fatal illness of some sort and quite dramatically dies, more or less in Oliver's arms and basically looking, I seem to recall, every bit as healthy and gorgeous as the day he met her. Mind you, the death scene was all very touching for me back in 1970. I wept for quite some years.That was THEN. As for NOW, I consider the tale pretty unoriginal at best and not particularly well done even, though both the novel (by Erich Segal) and movie as well as their sequel, Oliver's Story, were cult-like popular at the time. I succumbed like almost everyone else of my vintage.The famous line Love means never having to say you're sorry now seems, after I've enjoyed nearly a quarter century of happy marriage, downright idiotic. Please, I beg you, don't gather your marital advice from this film. A word to the wise, as another reviewer also noted ... Love means learning to say you're sorry quite frequently, and meaning it... that is, if you want a romantic relationship to endure. I'm afraid too many viewers may have taken Jenny's pearl of wisdom to heart and that's why our divorce courts are so full today. I've read some of the flattering reviews and am pleased for those of you who still like this movie; I don't begrudge you. But how many of you middle aged folk have actually watched it lately? Are you sure you're not just waxing nostalgic about your own youth and college years, recalling how much you loved it way back when? That was exactly what I was tempted to do myself; then I got to thinking... By all means, see Love Story and consider it sort of a period piece from the hippie era. There ARE worse ways to spend an hour and a half, but frankly, there are an awful lot of more moving romances out there, with more original plot lines and more engaging, sympathetic characters than this stereotypical pair. The only chemistry here is in the nearby university science buildings. Jenny seems downright rude and cocky to me now...sorry, fans, but I mightn't care much about her terminal illness any more; I don't even much like her; she's just not very nice... and Oliver (albeit he's quite handsome of course) is well, just a little dull.You must realize, I'm not spoofing this movie as much as I'm mocking my foolish, younger self. Sorry, Jenny and Oliver...I feel kind of guilty betraying you like this but I can't help it. I'm still a romantic, I'm not normally a cynic and still love a tearjerker, but I realize more now what true love is and what it isn't. I've grown up.

Swathes of cable channels pumped full of mediocre TV drama are their horrifying legacy, and sooner or later someone must snap their fingers so that this false reverie can come to an end. Anyone who can write a song as well as John Lennon also has the sense to know that 'love means having to say you're sorry every fifteen minutes'.

I saw it for the first time in winter of 1971and for the third time I saw it last night. I hardly ever wanted to watch any movie for the second time, but I watched it already two times this week.This 1970 hit film has not aged at all. I was surprised at Jenny (Ali McGraw)'s outwear and accessories, I noticed some her fashion has never gone out of fashion, I feel like I could put on even nowadays. The movie's story is simple the story is about very rich millionaire's son Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) who happens to fall in love with the poor girl Jenny till the day the doctor diagnosed her with cancer. Have you heard it all before? Perhaps, but even if I've heard melancholy stories many times I am quite charmed by the movie and it's one of my favorite movies. Although the story is very simple, it kept me glued to the screen without doing anything spectacular during two hours. In addition, the movie is well known for its theme song composed by Francis Lai, which won an Oscar for the best theme song. There are many songs of Bach, Mozart and Handel, which enrich the beauty of the movie.It seems wonderful to peep over the old buildings of the University of Harvard, with the Boston streets as the backdrop. And I just love the improvised scene of Oliver and Jenny playing in the snow on the empty football field. It is one of the all time great movie scenes. The music playing in the background and these two beautiful actors improvising a lovely scene of young lovers playing in the snow. I think the memories of such moments when we were young never leave us, and when we see the film again our original reactions come back with it. I recommend it to everyone who loves a great love story but don't forget to get some tissues and prepare to experience a story about life, a sad story, one that will stay with you forever.

This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is poor, and the direction is flat out lazy.The acting is terrible because the sarcasm used by Oliver and Jenny is tough to notice. Most people have some kind of joking tone, but Oliver and Jenny sound like two people in a heated debate. When Oliver makes Jenny angry and she runs out of the house, I don't feel the way Oliver is supposed to feel. His face is plain, but with an added gawk to add nervous tension to the scared husband that wants to apologize to his wife. Oliver's parents are the basic snotty rich people who have a son in love with a poor girl. Oliver, himself, isn't that interesting a character either. Jenny and her father are basic characters, the poor family with a small business that barely let them scrape by, and Jenny is the girl smart enough to get accepted to a good college.The story is generic as generic can be. It is simply a modern day Rome and Juliet story, but instead of Montagues and Capulets we have a rich Protestant and a poor Catholic. Dragging economic status and religious background shouldn't be a wedge between the characters because its not powerful enough, especially in this film. Romeo and Juliet is fine, we don't need to see its plot mindlessly abused by this film, among others. The only curse Shakespeare brought upon Romeo and Juliet was the simplicity of duplicating the story. What's even worse was that the novel was written by an English professor who was not satisfied with the romance genre of novels. A student then said that he should write one if he thought he could write a better story. The problem here This story is too basic. This film is basically the film student's guide to a quick buck, an easy plot, and how to go minimalist.On that Minimalist note, this film is incredibly lazy. This movie has a famous soundtrack, according to my Film Analysis professor. My complaint was that there is one song, and its used in the stupidest scenes. A scene where Jenny is riding her bike to her house that she owns with Oliver is accompanied by this abused song. When Jenny and Oliver are just playing in the snow the music plays. My point to my Film Analysis professor was how over used it was; my professor used an example like the Indiana Jones theme, my response was that when Indie is doing something heroic, we hear his signature theme. Love Story has a signature that is supposed to symbolize loneliness or being cast out, but it is played too often in unusual situations. Another lazy aspect of this film was the directing. In the scene where Oliver is running around town to apologize to Jenny, the camera hardly moves. It is right in front of Oliver, but when he goes into the laundromat the camera doesn't follow him inside. The camera doesn't had a sense of urgency. The rule with the camera was, Here's where I can see, so the actors walk within this one shot. Need more proof. The camera is lazy near the end after Jenny dies. Oliver is in the park and he's by himself, but the camera doesn't do much exploring, if you will.Avoid this film at all costs. You've probably seen this story before, its only Romeo and Juliet, which we've all read before.

This movie deeply tapped into the psyche of the early 70's on a number of levels, and the cinematography and music, while repetitive, caught the moment.  I defy any of you to name another sappy chick flick that accomplishes that. Sure, it would be easier to like this movie if it had an intelligent screenplay or more range of acting, but the moment is captured all the same, and in a perverse way it would probably only detract from the meme this movie evokes to be complicated by those things.

The two find that their love is strong enough to stand even the biggest tests of life.A massive hit and Oscar winner in the 70's it is easy to forget this film now, simply because it is so dated, flawed and unrelatable that I found it amusing but never emotional or moving.  The plot is a straightforward and goes just where you expect it to.  However that is not a major problem if the film had managed to be emotionally involving and powerful &#150; neither of which I found it to do.The biggest reason for this is the characters and the actors.  Oliver is a spoilt rich kid who has `issues' with his multimillion father only wanting the best for him.  It doesn't help that O'Neal can't act and delivers even the most touching scene like he was made of wood.  Meanwhile Jenny is rude and pretentious and quite an unpleasant person.

It runs constantly and got to the point where it grated on me.

The film follows the out, out, brief candle formula beautiful, beloved woman dies young. Unlike Moulin Rouge (the premature death genre's most recent product), Love Story presents its ideas simply -- and with great force. Boy meets girl. Boy dates girl. Boy marries girl. Girl dies. That's it. The other characters and (sub)plots augment, instead of distract from, the master plot. In addition, we know from the opening of the film the fate that awaits the boy and girl What can you say about a 25 year old girl who died? Alfred Hitchcock said that suspense (curiosity paired with dread) results when an audience knows that something terrible can or will happen. With that knowledge they begin to wonder how the events will lead to the inevitable -- and, most likely, through identification with the characters, start to hope that the outcome can somehow be avoided. Isn't this what happens? Isn't Jenny's death so devastating because we know it will happen? Love Story succeeds for other reasons, as well. First, the music. Again we find something simple -- a string of notes played over and over and over. These notes, however, are exceptionally plastic; they bend, bulge, surge, spiral -- move in whichever ways are needed -- to prepare the audience for Jenny's death, and then, once the awful event occurs, the notes sink it into our memories and hearts as deeply as Hiller's image of Ollie contemplating the Central Park snow. Second, the film's cinematography. Two examples come to mind the editing on Ollie's run through the Harvard campus; the widening field of white Ollie and Jenny cross as they head for the taxi. Third, the acting. Consider, for example, Ryan O'Neal's face as he watches Jenny perform on the harpsichord. Often actors will use the muscles around their eyes to convey emotion; or they will move the eyes themselves (Welles' in The Third Man, for instance). O'Neal simply allows his eyes to mist up -- just like a father watching his child at an elementary school awards ceremony -- and the effect is remarkable. And banal. But when the point of the film is to show how the death of a lover destroys someone, misty eyes may be one of the surest ways to establish, in cinematic shorthand, the soon-to-be-grieving's depth of emotion, attachment, and sincerity. Banal and remarkable, the two words don't belong together; but in Love Story, more often than not, they do. Is that so bad? Probably not. Quite often, the best art happens when the banal is raised to the level of the remarkable. Too often these days, I'm afraid, directors have it backwards, making the remarkable banal....Pearl Harbor, Enemies at the Gate, Moulin Rouge.....

I now understand that certain things should be left alone. I often have an affinity toward 70's movies , because they possess that rare charm that we almost never see in the post 2000 A.D. movies. I vaguely remember the popularity of this film as a child and that it launched two acting careers of the lead characters. As we all know, the story is told in redundant simplicity. Boy and girl meet in college. They spar, date, fall in love, marry, then she dies. All 100 minutes of this covers about 5 years of time and still seems to just drag. Ryan O'Neal as Oliver plays the Harvard rich kid of a wealthy magnate Oliver Barrett IV. He has no respect for his father and decides to rebel against his father's wishes of dating a girl who is beneath their social stature. Jenny played by Ali MacGraw is a glib music major at Radcliffe who falls in love with the boorish Oliver III. I didn't care one iota for either one of them and they had very little chemistry. The sentimental scenes were forced and had no spontaneity at all. The goofy 70's love montage of them playing in the snow and frolicking in the grass is about as corny as a tortilla chip. Oliver happens to drive an antique MG that looks so out of place, they both look dorky when driving through the traffic of the urban east coast. This is 1970!! Not 1932!!! A kid this rich should be given a cool muscle car like a Mustang, Corvette, Porsche or Ferrari. Not some flimsy, thin wheeled, open cockpit British jalopy. It just wasn't believable. Besides Ryan's acting in this is all wrong. His speech sounds affected like he was trying to use some upper class east coast accent. But it misfires and he just looks odd doing it. Ali MacGraw acts too poised and speaks too properly to pass as a tough Italian girl from humble upbringings. Their acting is not very good. The musical score however was very familiar to me, but it is overplayed a few times to much in this film. Twice would have been enough. Ray Milland gives a believable performance and he is the only real actor in this movie. Yes, he's snobbish, stuck-up and not the most likable guy. But at least he tried to make amends toward the end with young Oliver after Dad was completely rejected by him.

The main symptom is that the sufferer becomes ever more radiantly beautiful the closer she approaches death.The script of Love Story is, of course, a mass of traditional Hollywood clich√©s, but director Arthur Hiller was determined to give those clich√©s a modern gloss. The boy is Oliver Barrett IV, the rebellious son and heir of a wealthy Boston family so grand and patrician that they have taken to adding Roman numerals after their names as though they were royalty. The girl is Jenny Cavalleri, the daughter of an impoverished Italian-American pastry cook, who meets Oliver while they are both studying at university (he law at Harvard, she music at Radcliffe). The film is at pains to point out just how Modern and Nineteen-Seventies its two main characters are. They do things not normally done by the heroes and heroines of earlier Hollywood romances. They sleep together before their wedding; indeed, it is implied that Oliver has slept with plenty of other girls before meeting Jenny. They refuse to have a church wedding, disappointing Jenny's devoutly Catholic father, on the grounds that they do not believe in God (although Jenny is later seen acting as the local church choir mistress).What seems to have shocked seventies audiences most, however, was the fact that they use bad language. Profanity might have been OK in a crime thriller or war film, but the public obviously had difficulty in accepting it in the context of a romantic weepie. Jenny in particular has a weakness for referring to the excrement of male cattle. Oliver does not swear quite so often, but is fond of speculating that his father, whom he detests, may in fact be the offspring of a female dog.Although the two protagonists are clearly supposed to be appealing, I found them both rather unsympathetic. During the first half-hour or so Jenny is quite deliberately smart and cocky, playing games of verbal volleyball with Oliver. Everything he says is immediately met with a sarcastic put-down. The idea is to show that Jenny is using a cynical, flippant exterior to hide a sensitive, caring nature, but even later in the film, after the two have fallen in love, elements of her former persona kept coming through. Ali MacGraw never really made me believe in Jenny's sensitive side; I was left with the impression that she was using a cynical, flippant exterior to hide a cynical, flippant interior.The more unpleasant side of Oliver's character came out in his dealings with his father. Certainly, Oliver Barrett III is not an easy man to love. He is cold, authoritarian and snobbish, the sort of father who insists that his son call him sir. (That is not, perhaps, as absurd in an American context as it would be in a British one, but even so it does not suggest a relaxed or easy-going character). He reacts angrily to his son's marriage to Jenny, cutting off his allowance, but does at least later make efforts to heal the rift, all of which are rebuffed by Oliver.This difficult father-son relationship, in fact, tends to detract from the love story which the title suggests should be at the centre of the film. This was probably not the intention of the film-makers, but it did strike me that Oliver did not love Jenny as much as she loved him. Ryan O'Neal's rather angry performance did little to dispel the suggestion made by Oliver's father that his marriage to a girl from a poor, Catholic family had as much to do with a deliberate act of rebellion against his own privileged, Protestant background as it did with love. The sacrifice Oliver makes on Jenny's behalf never struck me as being too onerous. He might have lost his allowance from his father, but this did not mean he was reduced to poverty. Unless, of course, one's definition of poverty includes living off one's wife's income for a couple of years in a charming apartment in a historic district of Boston before taking up a position with a prestigious New York law firm.Thirty-five years on it is difficult to understand why this was such a cult movie when it first came out. Apart from the charms of its pretty heroine and even prettier hero, it has two things going for it. The first is the fine photography of Harvard University and New York; many of the scenes were shot in winter against a background of snow and misty grey skies, presumably in order to create an atmosphere of gently melancholy. The second is Francis Lai's famous musical score, reminiscent of a Mozart piano concerto, which well deserved its Best Music, Original Score Academy Award. All those other Oscar nominations, however, seem incomprehensible today. Thank goodness it didn't actually win any further awards. The Academy are often suckers for sentimentality (as they showed in 1984 with another manipulative tearjerker, Terms of Endearment, and with Million Dollar Baby this year), but a Best Picture award for Love Story would have been difficult to live down. 5/10 "},{"Title":"The greatest romance ever seen...","Date":"14 February 2000","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I think I used a rather challenging title for the comment, but I suppose I am justified in doing so, because  after watching the movie just like after reading the book(that of Erich Segal) I couldn't keep my tears rolling off my eyes...

Not to mention, that Ryan O'neil, you were kinda still mad at him, because I think he still got together with Ali for the fact that he wanted to rebel against his parents.It still was an effective movie over all and both Ali and Ryan did a great job of acting.

But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10.  For me, this movie rated a 4.  There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Oliver's father.  But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me.  I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal -- I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence.  The lone exception is What's Up, Doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure!  McGraw and O'Neal tend to mug their lines, rather than act them.This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career it was Tommy Lee Jones's first movie.

God is she bothersome or what?! She says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. There is not much of a story.  He's rich, she's wooden, they both have to Sacrifice A Lot for Love.  His father is Stonewall Jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the Difference in The Two of Them that They Overcame in the Name of Love. The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year.  John Marley is fine as Wooden's father, but a Supporting Nomination?  At least Ali didn't win.  I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in a lot more movies.  She's certainly a better actress than McGraw.  I didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad. It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good.

Brief moments, enhanced or surrounded by gorgeous images of snow, are so powerful that they are remembered bigger than they play out in the film. Much is made of the illness and how Ali McGraw becomes ever more beautiful toward the end but there's only one scene that shows her in hospital. Time rushes by, and when Jenny dies it doesn't prove any point but only adds to the volatility of the few valuable moments before.There are instances when the lovers make snow angels or say silly things like, Love means never having to say you're sorry. But we can believe that these characters are happy and carefree, and they wouldn't be as true if they'd engage in smart hipster talk. (That does not mean they're dense; when was the last time you saw a young couple lying together on a couch, each one reading a book?) For modern audiences, it may be disturbing that Jenny and Oliver place their love before all else. Oliver renounces the ties to (and the money of) his father (Ray Milland), and Jenny even passes on the opportunity to study in Paris, under an illustrious lecturer. To stay together, they take turns in working and studying, and dwell humbly. Their acts contradict our perceptions of emancipation and self-expression. But let's look at it from another perspective. Aren't we in some way mental slaves of the delusion of self-optimizing, self-fulfillment, self-anything? The title of this film is Love Story, after all, and not How I Made My Career and Found a Stable Mating Partner.Ryan O'Neal is the pampered jock, but he also invokes an unspoiled tenderness in his boyish behavior. Oliver will have much time to become a self-absorbed cynic like his father. Jenny, as played by Ali McGraw, will stay as that snappy-sugary girl that departed too soon.

However, watching it today is still an emotional experience. All relationships are different, and the quirky communication between the two main characters is often strange (albeit irrelevant, since you do see the love between them well enough). The side plot with the Barrett family adds to the character buy-in on Ryan O'Neal's performance, even if it's clear he can't act a lick. How did he get nominated for an Oscar here? McGraw isn't much better, in truth, but whatevs. The story is as timeless as Romeo & Juliet, in essence love torn apart way too soon. If you're not crying at the end, you're not human. As noted, the film could use more development to show the true love between the characters, especially in the beginning of the courtship. It is funny to see Jack Woltz in a different role here, and he's pretty good surprisingly. Overall, it's certainly worth seeing once just to say you've seen it, but after that, it can go back on the DVD shelf forever.

Jenny comes from a poor family but is full of personality and intelligence and is very blunt with people. This is Love Story, and it's a good one at that.The film doesn't hold back. It throws us into the focus of the film in the very first scene when Oliver is arguing with the school librarian, who happens to be none other than Jenny. They are an odd match since Jenny pressures him into buying her coffee with the attitude that she gives him (and he returns the attitude). They do begin to flirt though pretty quickly; Oliver asks her why she wanted him to ask her out to which she responds playfully I like your BODY.The conflict within the film stems from Oliver's father (Oliver III) being overly concerned with his son's life. He gives advice for what his son should do, but Oliver sees this as commanding him. Oliver Barrett III is basically the reason Oliver attends Harvard, he has connections (and when he brings this up Oliver feels insulted) and wants Oliver to maintain status in the upper class. With Oliver set to marry the daughter of a baker, this proves to be a great problem with his father.It's interesting to wonder which relationship drives this film the most the relationship Oliver has with Jenny, or the relationship he has with his father. The best scenes of the film prove to be when Oliver is conflicted with his father's presence in his life. These scenes prove to be well-acted by Ryan O'Neal. These scenes are heartbreaking, especially since one of them involves Jenny being on the phone with Oliver's father just a few feet away from where Oliver is sitting.The source of conflict proves to be very interesting for a romance story. However, it isn't difficult to notice how cheesy the film is at certain parts. The best line of the film is uttered twice in the movie, and while it is good it honestly also sounds like it comes from a Valentine's Day greeting card. In this sense, the acting in the film heavily outweighs the writing.This film may prove to be cheesy at times, but overall it is a very engaging love story which makes one question the importance of relationships and forgiveness. It is not the most entertaining of films, but it gets its themes across very well.3.0/4.0 "},{"Title":"Pretty Lame","Date":"26 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I remember when this movie came out when I was in high school in 1970. It was wildly popular. The theme from Love Story played on the radio 24/7. Author Eric Seagal appeared on all TV talk shows all the time, as did Ryan O'Neil and Ally McGraw. Every teenage girl in America copied Ally McGraw's hairdolong, straight, and parted in the middle. Some blonde girls even dyed their hair brown. Teenage boys carried around the Love Story paperback in school and got all the chicks because they thought he was sensitive. But the truth is, this was an awful movie. The acting was bad and so was the script. Scene after scene was so melodramatic...poor Oliver working in a Christmas tree lot...oh, the indignity! Big deal..like a strong 24 year old man can't carry a Christmas tree to a lady's car? And when the doctor broke the news to Oliver...so unintentionally funny...she has no symptoms at all and he announces she will die soon because they took three blood tests and found...what? Doctors don't announce a patient will die unless all extended treatment is exhausted. He didn't even begin treatment or tell Oliver what was killing her. Later on, they mentioned white blood cells and a lack of platelets, but even a veterinarian would treat your dog before giving up on it. Then, she seemed her usual bright eyed and bushy tailed self n her deathbed before she just croaked. Even if she had lived, I don't see how this marriage could have survived more than a few years.Oliver was passive, and Jenny was aggressive, rude, and teased him constantly while saying goddamn to punctuate everything.

Supposed to be romantic, but in reality, sounds absolutely ridiculous. Love Story is the first gushy, mushy rom-com with a terrible ending. What I can say, positively, is the chemistry between Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw. They play people that are hardly relatable, but their language of love is universal. Ali MacGraw is nearly the best thing about the picture. First of all, tell me she wasn't incredibly beautiful back in those days. The writing is also clever, in a Cameron Crowe kind of way.. despite allowing you to hate Ivy leaguers more than you already do. It suffers by being what it truly is. Along with one of the most annoying soundtracks of all time. Theme from Love Story is nails on a chalkboard bad.

Still, it presents an interesting view of social attitudes prevalent in a 1970's Ivy League setting. Love Story tries to make an egalitarian nod towards an unlikely romance between a WASP scion and a poor but gifted Italian-American woman. At the same time, the film constantly glamorizes and glorifies the northeastern top-out-of-sight Anglo-American culture associated with Harvard. The beautiful cinematography evident throughout the film pays homage to Harvard and to east coast chic.Spoiler AlertOliver Barrett IV (Ryan O'Neal) rebels against his anally retentive and classist father (Ray Milland) by marrying Jennie Cavalieri (Ali MacGraw), a working-class Italian-Catholic woman from Cranston, Rhode Island. Quel horreur! While Jennie pretends to disdain preppies, her obvious fascination with their social power is evident in her emulation of their clothing styles and her preference for WASPy men. She even claims (somewhat ironically) to love the number after Oliver's name. During her meeting with his nauseatingly pretentious parents the usually blunt Jennie is charmingly demure, and nearly as smooth as Sydney Poitier in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. This is a romance motivated not so much by true love, as by mutual fascination with the Other from a different side of the tracks.Jennie's class crossover from proletarian Cranston to Preppieland may have been a major source of the film's romantic appeal, especially since the myth of movin' on up is cherished to an extreme in America.By my lights, Jennie Cavalieri makes a horrible mistake when she gives up a fellowship to study music in Paris with the acclaimed Nadia Boulanger. Instead, she falls for the oldest myth in the book by marrying Oliver Barrett, the quintessential bland corporate type from the right background. In the real world, unions between working-class types and preppies rarely work due to the snobbish attitudes of the latter. It is wiser for talented people from more modest backgrounds to gain entry into the upper classes through intellectual and artistic abilities that will give them staying power, rather than through marriage alone. Had Jennie gone to Paris to fulfill her dream of becoming a concert pianist, she not only could have realized her creative potential, but she also could have eventually married a man from a more culturally sophisticated and less class obsessed background than Oliver Barrett IV. This better spouse for Jennie would also have been more appreciative of her musical gifts.The ridiculous line, love means you never have to say you're sorry is the dictum of a spoiled and entitled richie who uses others for pleasure and profit. When Oliver throws this line at Papa after Jennie's death, this relieves the eminent Mr. Barrett of any responsibility for his vile snobbery. Oliver is welcomed back into the fold only after Jennie no longer exists as a threat to the Barrett family's WASPocracy.Fortunately in the post millennial world, a rich WASP man would not be viewed as the ultimate prize for a woman like Jennie Cavlalieri, since the current bourgeois bohemian culture in America would encourage her to seek other choices. Who knows? Perhaps Jennie's immune system had an aversion to Oliver's preppy sperm -- and this caused her fatal illness.

This modern-day Romeo and Juliet story is so unbelievably trite, clich√©d and insipid that it's hard to imagine what a phenomenal box-office success that it originally was.

On the surface, it looks typical. At the very beginning,Jennifer's death is declared openly and the audience expect the thunderbolt from the very beginning and probably wonder what form it will take. But that is not what matters. The story itself is nothing too special. But what makes it special, or rather, what makes it different from a thousand other variations of this clich√©? The answer is humanity. Both Oliver and Jennifer are relatable as human beings who want to find their way in the world,specifically Oliver who wants to stand on his own two feet and move out of his father's shadow. You feel for them and want them to succeed. There are compromises and sacrifices but you do understand they would not have it any other way. Oliver is lucky in many ways in that he got himself a wife who sacrificed her career and put up with his tantrums. Not everyone get such an ideal wife. But that is what love is. The writers have showed the ideal of love in these two characters. Love means having to sacrifice or compromise without expecting anything in return. It's unconditional. Thus, in real love, you don't have to say sorry. One can always say the real world does not work that way and will be proved right. But that is also an aspect of human nature. But this ideal is what keeps one moving forward. It helps us face the harsher aspects of reality and should thus not easily be cast aside. In the end, the point of the movie is that Jennifer's life was short but it was not insignificant or empty. That is what truly matters.

She comes off bizarre and annoying (Hey preppy -- preppy preppy preppy). O'Neal's character, on the other hand, I found to be an all-around likable guy -- tough, but very nice at the same time, filthy rich yet undeniably humble and respectful.MacGraw's character kinda turned me off to the the flick the first time I saw it. Seeing it again recently, I enjoyed Love Story more because I was prepared to handle and embrace her strange personality.The father/son 'relationship' is interesting O'Neal calls Milland sir at all times. In reality there's NO relationship at all. Hence, what ultimately takes place in the story is both understandable and believable.There's a funny scene when O'Neal finally takes MacGraw to his family estate to meet his parents. She's understandably overwhelmed when she realizes just how rich O'Neal's family actually is. Her true-to-character reaction made me bust out laughing.I enjoyed the New England locations and seasonal changes. The setting and tone naturally reminded me of Dead Poets Society. I'm not saying Love Story is anywhere near as good because Dead Poets Society is in a class by itself. Yet, Love Story is a decent drama/romance; Just keep in mind that it's from 1970.

I'm sure if I had seen this in 1970 that it would have felt revolutionary, unique and heartbreaking. Having seen it now, the problem is that countless other films have copied it and paid homage to it. The film absolutely relies on the chemistry of its two stars and you absolutely can't deny that. Both characters are very well written with distinct and vivid personalities that just click so well together. The story behind Love Story is simplistic enough and I was actually surprised at how simple it was. Perhaps it was the years of build up and discussion about the film being a classic that left me a little underwhelmed. But I even found the major turning point in the film (I don't want to blatantly give it away in case someone actually doesn't know) but I found it completely anti-climatic. I knew what was going to happen going into it but I didn't find it nearly as heart wrenching as I thought. I've heard people say that Love Story is the greatest romance film ever, and always have a Kleenex but I simply wasn't that moved. Was it good? Yes it was good but I don't quite see the same level of quality everyone raves about.Ali MacGraw is beautiful, sassy, full of life and perfect in her role. Nowadays I think her role might be considered stereotypical and predictable. You know, she's the wild and vivacious woman that tames the playboy. However, for its time I'm sure she was a unique character and she simply nails it. Almost exactly the same could be said for Ryan O'Neal. He equally is terrific in his role as straight laced Harvard jock Oliver Barrett. They are two very different characters which is really the entire point of this passionate romance. Their chemistry is unmistakable but the beauty of the romance is that its real. It doesn't feel all based on lust or passion but a real romance unfolds between them throughout their life. John Marley and Ray Milland are decent in supporting roles as MacGraw's and O'Neal's fathers respectively. They don't have big parts but they are vital to the story and do well in their roles.The key to Love Story is the phrase I keep saying, in its time. I don't know if that means that the film didn't age well but I think it is was far more important for when it was released. It was the end of the sixties, O'Neal and MacGraw were playing young lovers looking to find their way in the world like so many baby boomers. The simplistic and yet vibrant setting of the Harvard campus and Massachusetts is the perfect spot for their budding romance. The film feels incredibly short for the time span that it covers. We are to feel like this is an epic all time romantic love and yet they meet, they banter back and forth, they kiss, they make love, they marry, they work, they go to school...and then the ending. It all happens very quickly. The dialogue between them is terrific and of course the film features that classic line love means never having to say you're sorry. It was great to see the movie, but I just didn't get the classic vibe that its known for. It is mildly entertaining and fun to watch but I think it lost its effectiveness over the decades. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Almost Perfect","Date":"24 December 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Love Story hit the theaters in 1970 and instantly became an international mega hit!

The closet that is of the people who find it fun to laugh at this movie. Yes, by 1970 standards, it was certainly dated, but audiences didn't seem to care. It was a smash hit and the Titanic of its time. It is the type of movie that MGM would have done in 1935 with Joan Crawford and Ray Milland (more about him in a bit!) as the lovers and Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore as the fathers. With Midnight Cowboy as the most recent Best Picture winner and big Hollywood musicals losing millions of dollars, how can an old fashioned love story so filled with clich√©s become so popular? Simply this-audiences needed something like this to bring them back down to earth from all of the social issues of the late 60's and early 70's and have a good old fashioned cry. While 1973's The Way We Were is probably the best love story of the '70's, Love Story (even with its generic title) isn't far behind, and influenced producers to look to simpler themes to bring in audiences. Without Love Story, there would have been no need for tearjerkers like Terms of Endearment, Beaches and Steel Magnolias, and that would have been a shame.Certainly, you cannot find more attractive and likable leads like Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw for this film; They are gorgeous, and were the hottest on-screen couple of the year. I think what makes the film work so well is that it reminds us all of our own mortality. John Marley, as MacGraw's earthy father, is magnificent, so totally likable that it is easy to understand why he would be friends with his daughter and that she would simply call him by his first name. As for Ray Milland as O'Neal's father, that is where the film's only real flaw comes in. His character seems to have no real motivation for being so controlling with his son. Milland, one of the best looking actors of the 30's and 40's, sadly gets some really bad close-ups here. Just take a look at his eyes. They looks like one of the monsters from the 1975 horror disaster The Devil's Rain. That's some Lost Weekend!.Love Story can be a trifle manipulative at times as the music swells to a powerful crescendo at melodramatic moments. But it is that music today that people remember, and it is beautiful. There are few totally perfect films, but Love Story takes predictability and makes it acceptable to be formula. It helps to rise above cynicism when watching films like this and just enjoy its tribute to innocent youth who must face mortality head on. "},{"Title":"Solid","Date":"7 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" When I was a boy, the film that dominated my earliest memories of pop culture was 1970's Love Story. From the music to the saying, 'Love means never having to say you're sorry,' to Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal being everywhere, it was the biggest movie of its day; sort of what Titanic was to folks a decade ago. And, yes, like Titanic, it's a schlocky film. It has a few saving graces which place it above the doomed ocean liner picture, though. One, there's no Leonardo DiCaprio in the film. Yes, Ali MacGraw was a terribly wooden actress. Her wooden performance here is mind-numbing. But, it's still not as earnestly bad as DiCaprio's. Second, despite the title being meant to refer to the film's two leads, Oliver and Jenny, played by O'Neal and MacGraw, the far more interesting love story is that played out between father and son. O'Neal plays Oliver Barrett IV, while Ray Milland plays his father, Oliver Barrett III. And, it is this relationship, between WASP scion and patriarch, that is so good that it carries the otherwise predictable soap opera of a film over the threshold to passability as a film. Is it a great film? No way, but Ray Milland does give a great performance as the emotionally impotent father.The film was directed by Arthur Hiller, a serviceable Hollywood journeyman, and adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name, by Erich Segal. I used to get Segal and the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard Bach, mixed up all the time, because of the Segal/Seagull and Erich/Bach 'ch' connections. Also, both films come from the dippy-doo era of American literature. Anyone who is in their mid-forties or older will know the tale, but for the young'uns, a brief recap. Young Oliver meets Jenny Cavellari on campus, at Harvard. She goes to Radcliffe. They have a series of very fast paced scenes that are ill-wrought dialogue-wise. Nonetheless, much happens in the first twenty to thirty minutes, and, in this way, Love Story was a precursor to the MTV-like editing style that has gripped film for the last twenty or so years. But, technically, the film is quite good. Its use of montage, superimposition, scoring (although, at two or three times the theme song intrudes too loudly), editing, and giving snippets of a scene and letting the viewer fill in the rest, works, and credit should go to Hiller for giving his cinematographer, Dick Kratina, room to experiment. In modern films, this utilitarian concision does not happen. A film is cut quickly, but the viewer has no way of filling in the action, so you get a sort of narrative strobing, whereas in this film, the cuts work because the setups so strongly reinforce what will happen, which is confirmed no less than a scene or two later.A final point, though. For a tearjerker, I was left dry. Love Story is schlock, pure and simple, but well made schlock. Cum-see, cum-sa. "},{"Title":"A simple and universal love story ... and an unfortunate hate story with movie lovers ...","Date":"30 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Why is love so underrated? Why one of the most sincere and simple romances epitomized the 'cool-to-hate' notion to an extent that only Titanic would reach? Love Story didn't even win any Oscars except for Francis Lai's iconic score. However, it did win 5 Golden Globes, including 'Best Drama' and like Titanic, it was the highest-grossing film of the year. The detractors say that Love Story is just about two persons meeting, falling in love, marrying and at the end, the girl dies. That's true and many loved the film for this straight-forwardness. It never lied about its premise, even opening with the famous What could you say about a 25-year old girl who just died? What were people expecting? Whenever I hear these cynical comments and how the film is used as a reverse alibi for a more sophisticated and Pauline-Kael-like taste, I can't discuss Love Story without sounding like the devil's advocate. But this is a film I would support and defend with all my heart, for all the aspects that cemented Love Story's greatness.And it starts with Arthur Hiller's directing, it's simple and it's elegantly discreet. Any cheap romance insists on close-ups or slow motion, Hiller's camera has just a unique ability to focus on the characters in a way that makes us able to understand their emotions, and feel the chemistry growing between them. The so simple but delightful snow scene that would make cringe all the cleverer movie lovers, illustrates the perfect use of a particular setting to a much more universal feeling. And I'm sure that even in the movie theaters of the hottest countries, viewers could relate to this juvenile insouciance, playing in the ice, kissing with the snow, and just being &#x85; in love. The talent of Hiller was to dilute himself, to use the settings, the places as foils for Oliver and Jenny's relationship, and make everything but them look secondary. For that, I guess Hiller had to really trust his cast and be confident that the film's quality wouldn't be undermined by the performances. On that level too, the casting is perfect. Ali McGraw might not be a beauty queen but what a personality! And Ryan O'Neal's eyes contain this mix of immature anger and sensitive idealism that immediately makes him fall in love with Jenny. Jennifer Cavalleri and Oliver Barrett IV have great personalities, and the chemistry is only believable because they do complete each other without being too different. He's a brilliant Harvard Law student, she's a gifted Music student, both have talent, ambition and dreams, and parents who're not just here to show 'where they stand for', but also highlighting their background and rebellious nature. Oliver Barrett can't stand being seen as the heir of a prestigious Harvard Dynasty, and Jennifer isn't as religious as her father. But here both Ray Milland as Oliver Barrett III and John Marley, Oscar-nominated as Phil Cavalleri, are so convincing that we feel empathy toward them, too.Indeed, I felt that Oliver was acting immature and having issues for wrong reasons, and I was glad to see that Jennifer admitted she also loved him for everything he was, including his name. The subplot with Oliver's father isn't overused, but it shows a certain intelligence. We believe in the characters not just because they're well played, but because they evolve and show that love is also about less ego and more responsibilities . The script works for its realism, the relationship between Jenny and Oliver starts like an intellectual volleyball and we're glad Oliver finally points it out. The death scene could have produced an overdose of tears, but it works with the perfect harmony between writing and acting, and Ryan O'Neal is extremely convincing when it comes to this.Maybe the tag-line is the only weakness of the film, the infamous Love means never having to say you're sorry, but this is a fallacious reason to condemn the whole script, especially if you consider it only meant that when you're in love, the one you love, knows you didn't mean to be hurtful. Quite a stretch, but I like to think of that, as a newlywed myself. No, if there ever were a flaw, it would be the way Jenny looked in her deathbed; I accept this because the one who came with the Ali McGraw syndrome, Roger Ebert, gave the movie four stars. But he also said that the film was about love, not death, death was already taking our friend Jenny, that it would take her beauty was not relevant whatsoever. So, Hiller had the story, the characters, the actors, all he needed was the music that would convey all these emotions. When he heard the proposition from Francis Lai, as I expected he would say in the 'Making- Of- interview ... he cried.The score transcended whatever the film defined, and became a universal hymn for love, even more because a foreign composer made it. Love Story would never have this success without Lai's haunting score, this extraordinary mix of melancholy, nostalgia and mourning of a lost love. Whether it's for the snow scene, the thrilling sequence where Oliver tries to find Jenny, the music emphasizes the emotional impact of every moment. Love Story is one of these films that are immediately identifiable with very simple notes, like Jaws or The Godfather, and I couldn't believe it didn't make the American Film Institute's Top 25. The music defines being in love; it's something that cuts straight to your heart, something that any viewer can respond to. If only the score, Love Story is a universal and timeless classic.With its remarkable simplicity, Love Story may not be a masterpiece, but I've seen masterpieces that affected me less than this classic romance, that portrays love in all its facet insouciance and happiness, but also maturity and responsibility. Love is more than just never having to say we're sorry ...

The trite theme of son rebels against millionaire father is not substantive.Recommended if you like flash backs to a time when films were less histrionic and shrill.

Jenny tries to reconcile the Barrett men, but to no avail. Oliver and Jenny continue to build their life together. Relying only on each other, they believe love can fix anything. But fate has other plans. Soon, what began as a brutally honest friendship becomes the love story of their lives. That DVD sleeve summary also notes that this film was nominated for seven Academy Awards; not sure how that happened, but it won the most deserved Oscar, for Francis Lai's excellent musical score. Writer Erich Segal does ratchet up the amount of naughty verbiage acceptable in mainstream movie of the time, which gives its young lovers a relatively more realistic appeal. In the right haircut at long last, Mr. O'Neal finally hits the big leagues, after Peyton Place; and, Ms. MacGraw builds on her Goodbye Columbus success. Director Arthur Hiller does especially well with the chilly Harvard locations.The opening lines give away the Love Story, and you simply wait for the big event to happen. Piano-playing Jenny and hockey-playing Ollie get less interesting as a couple. As their respective fathers, John Marley and Ray Milland have great roles; the relationship between Mr. Milland and O'Neal unexpectedly takes the emotional weight from the younger pair. You keep wondering what MacGraw's problem is - there is simply nothing to really fill out the characterization of the scripted conceited Radcliffe bitch.

With only a few minor differences, the premise and development of the film's story is the same as that of the best-selling novel it is based on Jennifer Cavalleri (Ali MacGraw) and Oliver Barret IV (Ryan O' Neal) are two Harvard students (just like the screenwriter and novel author Erich Segal) from entirely different backgrounds who fall in love she is a poor, brilliant but sometimes foul-mouthed Social-zero Radcliffe Bitch , he is a muscular, smart and polite Harvard Preppie Millionaire . But their love for each other crosses all sorts of barriers, whether be class, religious, political, economical, or social differences. Their love for each other even outweighs the cold war between Oliver and his authoritarian father (Ray Milland), economic hardships and then the unthinkable.Ali Macgraw and Ryan O'Neal shine together, their chemistry is spot-on perfect and they are 100% believable as you laugh at the jokes they make to each other and cry at their trials and tribulations. The movie, just like the novel, starts like a comedy with their chatter and ends with on a very sad note. John Marley and Ray Milland-- the former plays Jennifer's father-- do not disappoint either with their brief appearances. Francis Lai's repetitive but catchy music score sets the mood perfectly.

Many of the girls I dated at school and college loved this movie. Having watched it again for the first time in years it's still an enjoyable experience.The writer, Erich Segal, adapted a plot, involving star-crossed lovers, that has been around since the Middle-Ages. Ryan O'Neal (Oliver Barrett IV) and Ali McGraw(Jenny Cavilleri) play Ivy League over-achievers who fall in love. The likability and chemistry between O'Neal and McGraw is the main reason the film works. Jenny is beautiful and a smart-ass. Oliver is a brilliant Harvard jock who is unable to communicate with his father. Oliver's family are rich and aristocratic while Jenny's father owns a pastry shop. Their engagement results in a rift with Oliver Barrett III (Ray Milland) who tries to terminate their relationship. The objective of big studio movies is to entertain and Love Story succeeds. The relationship between Jenny and Ollie sucks you in and is strangely intoxicating. The film is helped by Francis Lai's memorable music. The characters are articulate, the dialog is crisp and McGraw delivers some funny one-liners. Arthur Hiller does a solid job, telling the story clearly without the pretension and the over-indulgence associated with many seventies directors.

I saw this movie in college, and I was a Music Major at a woman's college like Jenny, so you can well imagine the influence on a young woman's mind and the the power it had for me. However, obviously I did not die young! I still admire the look of Ali McGraw, the way they dressed her for the film is timeless.

Managing the seemingly impossible feat of being both generic and unique, it traces the romance of a wealthy Harvard law student (O'Neal) and a mouthy, middle-class Radcliffe girl (MacGraw.) They meet, spar, fall in love, make sacrifices and then are met with an insurmountable tragedy. Milland plays O'Neal's old school father and Marley is MacGraw's working class pop who tries to view things the newfangled way. What is a simple (and hardly new) story of love amongst class differences, tinged with heartbreak, is given a fresh coat of paint that includes four-letter words, frank (for the time) love scenes, charming montages of the couple's activities, a noted lack of syrup (though there is some) and a staggeringly beautiful musical score. The story is told in fairly brief vignettes and is filmed mostly in authentic Boston and New York locations, giving it a realistic and naturalistic flair. Only the trappings and some of the sociological viewpoints betray it's era. O'Neal is very good as the boy, continuously butting heads with is domineering father (whom he addresses as sir.) He isn't able to muster up any real tears during his scenes of turmoil, but he does stir the heart at other times, notably in one extended scene in which he searches (and searches) for MacGraw following an argument. MacGraw is given some off-putting attitudes at times, but eventually wins audience interest and sympathy. The role is mostly within her limits and she and O'Neal develop a charming chemistry. (And to her credit, at 32, she manages to seem much younger.) Milland is terrific as the crusty millionaire who can't bear to see his son avoid fulfilling the destiny he has mapped out for him. Marley (who is called Phil by MacGraw as an example of only one of the couple's many differences), does a nice job as a man rooted in tradition, but drawn to keeping up with the new ways. Most of the other characters are negligible, though one of O'Neal's fellow students is played by an already self-assured Jones. Director Hiller presents a kaleidoscope of vignettes, but doesn't skimp on the little, telling details such as O'Neal adjusting MacGraw's hair before she meets his folks and MacGraw nibbling snow off O'Neal's face, to name just a few. Forced to keep the film's budget in check, he demonstrates creativity in the staging and handling of the material. He links the scenes together well and works overtime to create the right emotional tone in his audience. The film was a massive success and the stars benefited from it, but, oddly, some of the cast either never worked again (such as Daniels, as O'Neal's roommate) or hardly at all (Balfour as O'Neal's mother.) The extraordinary music of the film acts as a thread for the somewhat fractured storyline and is nearly a character itself. The delicate and beautiful work retains its popularity today as demonstrated by its use in the famous Olympic gold medal-winning figure skating program of Sale and Pelletier.

But this 70's-made (actually end of 60's)film gives me more understanding on love and freedom. O'Neal can't act? McGraw is ugly? Hatchet job or echoing what other says?

Why not? Do tragic things happen to people all of the time without rhyme or reason? Absolutely! But that should not detract from the film, if anything, that should enhance its message.Losing anyone is profoundly difficult and one cannot produce a hierarchy of tragedy because no matter how long you have been with someone, or how many years your relationship has had the opportunity to grow, we seldom feel there is ever enough time. What is also difficult is that we so often feel we haven't begun to realize the possibilities within one another. Jenny's death, while certainly tragic and profoundly haunting and sad, does make sense if you remember that all things are fleeting. By addressing this issue this film is not a jaunt into sentimentality but a realization that the bonds of love exist on multiple levels of consciousness. We can only infer, as we watch Oliver struggle to assess his loss at the conclusion of the movie, that her presence and what she meant to him will persist in his mind for years to come. And perhaps that is what is the most powerful feature of this movie, his life must go on and she tells him, I don't want you to be sick. She knows he needs to move on, to find happiness, to not allow the sadness of his loss to obliterate the beauty of what they had together and that in life, beauty exists and can be found once more, regardless of whether or not we have fallen.This is an unusual depiction of a love story because one does not get the sense that the value of one's life can be assessed  solely by the involvement with another person. Oliver's life must go on and it will. He must get back out there and relearn how to live and he probably will. Does this mean that his life with Jenny is cheapened? No, because his life was enhanced by his time with her. This movie provides a mature examination of love and relationships, it does not tell us that once two young beautiful people find love that life is perfect and within their own relationship it is clear that life is not perfect, they do argue, they do have disagreements, they do have difficulties. However, they do have each other and they seem to be able to provide comfort and happiness within one another and perhaps this fosters a strength in Oliver so that he may continue?The music is deceptive. On the one hand the music tinges each moment of happiness with a touch of sadness, but on the other hand, the music itself should not let one believe that the movie is suggesting that without one another all of life is lost. And the line Love means never having to say your sorry does not belong here. It is a mistake because it is a gimic, a line designed to be memorable and to render the film, like a catchy song, stuck in one's mind. But the movie does not need this line to do so, the bond between these two characters, the quality of their love and the questions that they face is enough to make this film persistent and memorable. Sometimes Hollywood just has to sink its teeth into projects that would do find to stand alone.

What do young, sensitive people want?  Not really to be happy, since they are too cynical to believe in that.  No, they want their sensitivity to be writ LARGE, to be displayed and appreciated.Ollie, the poor little rich boy, is the ideal symbol of these aspirations. He starts out being merely sexy, glib, and buff.  True love transforms him, opens him up, and lets him glimpse his buried emotions for his father. Man, that would be great!  Love Story is the fun side of depression, a cocktail of noble despair, and easier than reading Rimbaud.  Who does not hear the famous da dee da dee da riff of Francis Lai, without imagining himself trudging along the commons on a wintry day, eyes misty and haunted with the dawning knowledge that your true love is dead, and you will have 60-some years to grieve?Public martyrdom it's how young people without the balance to skateboard express themselves.As proof, I point to the ad copy of Segal's novel.  IIRC, my well-worn paperback copy included some comment about how whole dormfuls of sensitive youngsters stayed up all night reading Love Story to one another, crying.When you have stopping laughing, join me in applauding Arthur Hiller's direction.  The image of Ollie, bereft in the snow alone, bookends the movie.  The film starts at the ending, creating a closed time loop in which his pain and loss can be savoured -- er, suffered -- over and over again. It is brilliant.  It is the best use of that particular writing device since, oh, The Outsiders.  I can mock Love Story, but I can't resist it.

After the first few scenes I thought she would get it under control, but no, she had that horrible performance all the way through. Ryan Oneil was just as bad. Over acting and sappy. The scene with the doctor was most annoying. What kind of Doctor tells him flat out she's dying then suggests 'treatment'?? Also, his response was ludicrous. No question about what can be done to help her. Sorry folks, but wow, I thought this was bad. One major directing failure was almost the entire movie was just the two of them including the sickening sweet montages of them frolicking in the snow - which went on wayyyyy to long. Big thumbs down for me. However, I think the script has potential for a modern remake with some re-writing, better acting, and please no 'zoom ins' and 'zoom outs' like this movie.

I will give TEN for the Music. This was greatest romantic, haunting piano music ever. The only other tune would be Lara's Theme in Dr. Zivago. Arthur Hiller, who refused to do God Father ended up directing this movie. He made some great casting choices, which was instrumental in catapulting this movie to the cult status. Both leading actors were wholesome, handsome and fresh and their love for each other and disdain for inheritance and prestige identified with the generation. Ryan O'Neil was the Travolta of the 60's and his acting was better than Ali Mcgraw's. John Marly as Phil and Ray Milland are subtle and good. All said and done this movie would have been another tear jerker if not for the Francis Lai's music who did not even speak English and in fact Hiller said to have wept when he first heard the composition. Robert Evans, who was a Paramount visionary, was instrumental in getting this movie made.

Neither of them ever really attained similar success again but they are both still widely remembered today. Probably largely due to this film. The music and cinematography are superb and those people old enough to remember Andy Williams' haunting  recording of the main theme will most likely get a double jolt when they hear the instrumental version.

How could this small film have been nominated for eight Academy Awards? It was nominated for most of the biggest awards in Best Picture, Best Director for Arthur Hiller, Best Actor in Ryan O'Neal, Best Actress for Ali McGraw, Best Supporting Actor for John Marley and Best Screenplay for author Eric Segal as well as Best Score and Best song for Francis Lai. Well, Lai was a deserved nomination and in fact won those two Oscars but the rest of the nominations were a cinematic joke. The novella story by Segal never had enough material to be a full length feature film. He could have at least added a mindless car chase or a flying saucer scene to the screenplay to give the film some depth. This was McGraw's only third film and her follow up role in The Getaway with husband Steve McQueen was a far better performance. After that her career stalled and she never made of film of note again. Ryan O'Neal had made a couple of minor films before and was most noted for his television roles and he like McGraw turned in a stiff, wooden performance here and there was no on screen chemistry between them. John Marley and Ray Milland were good in supporting roles. Director Arthur Hiller had made the leap from television to feature films with a string of mediocre movies until moderate success with the Out of Towners before Love Story and after would see more moderate success in comedies in The Hospital, The In-Laws and Silver Streak but any success he ever had were in comedies. This as a serious film tries to be so serious it goes overboard. I would give this a 6.0 for good music and set direction and for sentimental reasons for once having had a teen aged crush on Ali McGraw.

While  not the best romantic tear jerker to run through a projector, it is certainly not the worst either.  It does have it's strong points, and if someone had dared to break away from Erich Segal's novella, then perhaps it would have been a very good film.  Unfortunately, since Segal also wrote this screenplay, and he stayed faithful to his best selling book almost to the letter, it ends up with the same problems as his novella.  When the first line of your novel or screenplay, tells the audience that one of the main characters is going to die at the end, you had better put that death and what leads up to it on the screen in such a way that it will pull some kind of emotion out of those watching.  Though I'm sure many people weeped heavily into their handkerchiefs at the end of this film, I am more or less inclined to believe that many of them did so because it was either expected of them, or maybe it was like some sort of communicable disease.  I had read the book, enjoyed it, but the ending affected me little as did the ending of the film.  More about that later.Many reviewers have been extremely critical of both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw in their criticism of Love Story.  Though neither is a particularly gifted actor, I found them quite pleasant as Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavilleri.  The role of the preppy son of a millionaire seems to have been made for O'Neal, and MacGraw's Jenny has just the right amount of brashness, that we actually like her spunk instead of being put off by it.  MacGraw makes us believe that a baker's daughter could harangue a rich millionaire into falling for her, and that she could love him back.  Most of Jenny's and Oliver's scenes together are of two people, who use their own brand of verbal sparring, to express how much they care for each other.  Some say that is not possible, but speaking from experience I know for a fact that it is.  And in this film, it's always fun to watch.Ray Milland plays Oliver Barrett III, and does it with a cold austere demeanor, but yet we can still sense his love for his son.  John Marley, as Jennifer's father, Phil, is delightful in his few scenes, and his relationship with Jenny draws a sharp contrast to that of Barrett III and Barret IV.  His scenes near the end of the film, are the best Love Story has to offer, and won him an Academy Award Nomination.So what went wrong?  Since we know from the very first line in the film, that Jennifer is going to die (so you know I'm not giving anything away here), you would think that when we reach that crucial point, her death would be gut wrenching.  Unfortunately, when Oliver learns of Jenny's impending doom, Segal in his novel and in this screenplay, rushes to the death scene so fast it's as if he had an airplane to catch when he was writing it.  After Oliver returns from the doctor's office with the bad news, we get three quick meaningless scenes between Oliver and Jenny, so poorly written and staged even worse, that it leaves us feeling quite empty during the most important part of the film.  Even at the end, when either director Hiller or writer Segal could have redeemed themselves in a scene between O'Neal and Milland, they totally blow it.   A first year film student could have done better.  So instead of being moved to tears, we are simply left high and dry.  It also doesn't help matters that when Jenny does become ill, she never really looks it, and even in her final scenes looks as if she could get up and go out for dinner and a movie.  It is frustrating that the way this ending was filmed, almost destroys the good will it had built up before getting to that point.So what do we end up with?  About two thirds of a good movie with good characterizations by the four main actors, and an involving story.  It's just too bad the ending goes as sour as a fresh lemon.

The answer is simple. Jenny had to die because in real life people do die, and this movie is based on a true story. Erich Segal wrote the novel this movie is based on after he found out that one of his students lost his young wife to cancer. Segal started from this simply tragic fact and crafted a romance out of it.Anyway, I saw this movie (and read the novel) over ten years ago and liked it. Then, I saw it last night with some friends of mine who had never seen it. I was a little disappointed. The story is simple and sad, and the final scene makes women cry; yet, as a conservative guy, I could not help noticing some scenes that put me off. The two main characters' approach to life was too modern, they took the name of the Lord in vain repeatedly, and the way Oliver treated his father was absolutely disrespectful.Without these elements, it would be a real good movie to shed some tears on.

The movie has a lot of good things about it the absolutely beautiful views of Harvard University and Harvard Square in the winter; O'Neal and McGraw are both gorgeous; the theme music (a deserved Oscar-winner) is haunting and truly beautiful; seeing Tommy Lee Jones in his first movie is fun; old pros Ray Milland and John Marley are having a great time (and give the only good performances) and seeing what Cambridge looked like in the early 70s (it was working class back then--it's now wall to wall condos). Unfortunately there are bad things which greatly outweigh the good. The bad O'Neal can't act and McGraw is truly abominable--her character is very foul-mouthed and her acting is wooden; the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book (with swearing); that line Love means never having to say you're sorry is the STUPIDEST line I've ever heard, and two characters you really could care less about. I'm a sucker for sappy movies like this, but I was dry-eyed when McGraw died at the end. All I could think was, Good! Maybe she'll stop swearing now! But what really bothered me is these two characters had no personality or attraction to each other. I spent the whole movie wondering why they were together. Also the dialogue is pretty horrendous.A better script and actors would have helped. I'm only giving it a 6 for the music and the scenery and one exchange--Oliver, you're driving like a maniac!

LOVE STORY is a film that I just watched for the first time and it's one that I knew about the ending long before. I guess everyone who knows anything about movies knows about the ending here but I'll get to more on that in a bit. I really, really, really understand why so many people love this movie and I understand why it was such a huge hit back in the day. Sometimes I watch movies and don't see what others see in it but there's no doubt that I fully understand the love some have for this film. With that said, it didn't completely work for me. There's no question that it will keep you entertained from start to finish but there were still a few major flaws that kept me from falling for it more. The biggest issue I had with the picture is that the screenplay was way too simple and cute for my liking. Not for a single second did I ever really feel like I was watching a real relationship and a real couple. Even their meeting scene and the eventual falling in love just seemed way too cute for their own good. It really did seem at times like the screenplay was just overbearing in its attempt to show how much these two loved one another. The dialogue was really forced at times and I think less would have been so much more. I also didn't think O'Neal was the greatest actor here. He perfectly fit the role and it's not hard to watch him here but at the same time I don't think the performance is great. MacGraw was good in her part as she certainly made you believe she was this character. Ray Milland was also extremely good because he didn't have to go over-the-top to play the mean father. I also enjoyed John Marley in the role of the girl's father. The film does benefit from some nice cinematography as well as a good score that perfectly fits the film. As for the ending, even though you're told about it at the very start of the film, it still manages to be quite good and perfectly handled by the director. LOVE STORY is a decent little movie but I think it could have been much better with a few changes in its story.

Like how the film was needed at the time it came out because the 60's ended being the me me me decade, where if someone didn't agree they'd be the enemy. (I always thought the 60's sucked anyway) so Love Story showed people how love was done again, especially when love stories were out in Hollywood at the time. So while that may true, it stands to see how the film was huge in 1970, coming at the right time, but evidently as time went on the film because less important and its impact lessened. But in 1970 I'm sure this was major stuff.The director also states how the original beginning had Ryan O'Neil being told the girl was dying, and how that was changed because the audience didn't know the girl well enough to feel for her, with that news coming so early. So it was placed later in the picture. Thing is, who cares, when the audience gets to know Ali McGraw's character we see she is a wise-cracking unappealing wiseass, almost completely unlikable. Ali does a fine enough job, but the character is just someone you would avoid if you were a guy.Ryan does a fair job, nothing too special, he's ok, but just ok. He probably got the part more on his looks than his talent. He looks good in the role. Ray Milland is pretty cool as his dad too, but underused. The mom is there for a minute than disappears. No one cares anyway.One thing you can't say about this film is that it wastes time kicking off. They meet in the film's first scene and are in love just mere minutes later (screentime minutes). The verbal jousting becomes kind of tiresome really fast, and Ryan's character even says that to some extent in one scene, but it doesn't change anything. She is still a wiseass, for the entire film.And that damn music theme - it's all over the place. The only saving grace with it is that the vocal version is not to be heard here. At least I don't think so. Sometimes my attention was fading a bit. Did I mention Ali is almost the only girl in the whole picture? And she did overstep her bounds on the telephone with Ryan's pop.Being a hockey fan, I liked seeing the 1970 hockey scenes, and also all the cool old cars driving around. Love Story wasn't great but it was good. It was certainly better than The Way We Were but not as interesting because Streisand is fun to laugh at. I admit I was sad at the end, but I couldn't decide if it was because the girl died or I was disappointed about another legendary film not living up to the hype I've heard. Maybe a bit of both. Still, good to get yet another film  off the must see list.

That book, along with many others that I never had any interst in, had been collecting dust on that bookshelf for as long as I could remember. That day, I was bored and felt like reading something, so I picked it up and thought I'd read it real quick (it's very short).  I knew nothing about the book, the author, or the movie at the time.  I ended up being quickly drawn into it and had it finished very quickly.  I loved the book, and naively thought What a great movie that would make.  Even though I knew nothing about film and had relatively little interest in it, I thought the book would be very easy to adapt to a movie and I had a lot of great ideas about who would play the roles, how I would alter the dialogue, etc, etc. However, I was only 16 and lost interest fairly quickly.  But I did love the book and would think to myself (and only myself) Someday...someday...About four or five years later, when I was in college, I saw something shocking on the shelves of a local video store and I was crushed.  You see, I still hadn't given up on my dream of writing Love Story for the screen, but there it was.  And it had been done nearly 30 years earlier.  I immediately abandonned plans to rent Mallrats and rushed home to see how my vision had ultimately played out.I enjoyed the Arthur Miller/Segal adaptation, but was disappointed for a number of reasons.  Over the years, as my knowledge of film has dramatically increased, I still find myself with the same complaints about Love Story that I had many years ago.  The biggest problem I have with it is the haphazard way it plows through the first part of the book, basically Oliver and Jenny's meeting, courtship and engagement.  That early part of the book is so critical because it's there that we meet Oliver and Jenny and see (read) their banter and bickering quickly evolve into love and infatuation. Emotionally, I was hooked by the book at that point.  I cared about the characters enough to be seriously moved by later events.  The film, in skipping so much early dialogue and interaction, doesn't give us the chance to make the same investment in the characters and it's hard to be moved as a result.  This is through no fault of the two leads, Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, as the script doesn't give them a chance early on.After Oliver and Jenny are married, the screenplay actually follows the me at of the books story almost to a tee, which is frustrating because I felt it was more important that it followed it to a tee early rather than later. It's not as though Love Story is a long film (barely 100 minutes) and needed to be pared down for time.  Perhaps if I hadn't read the book and had simply seen the film, I wouldn't have these complaints and would have thought it as great as so many people did in 1970.O'Neal and MacGraw as the leads have actually grown on me over the years. I knew of O'Neal when I first saw the film (from Irreconcileable Differences!), but had no idea who MacGraw was.  Of course, neither would have been my choice at 16 to play the roles, but they do an admirable job with one serious exception  Almost without question, the most important line in the film is Love means never having to say you're sorry, and it is spoken twice.  Once by Jenny to Oliver and the other by Oliver to his father.  Both O'Neal and MacGraw's deliveries of this line made me cringe before and still do.  MacGraw's crying fit while she speaks the line is so nauseating that it makes the line almost comical.  O'Neal speaks the line so matter-of-factly that it conveys no emotion or comprehension of what it means.  The film definitely takes a serious hit because of it.  The emotional punch that that line delivered in the book was lacking in the film first because of what I stated earlier, and second because of these terrible deliveries.John Marley as Phil is a solid casting and his role in the film was one of the few things about it that didn't disappoint me, even when I didn't know who he was.  Fortunately, I hadn't yet seen the Godfather either, so his more memorable scene from that film hadn't been permanently planted in my mind.  Ray Milland tried to play Oliver III admirably, but was just too stiff.  Unfortunately, that's probably what he was told to do, so I can't blame him.  What seems to have been lost in the film version about this character was that he probably wasn't totally the old sonofabtch that Oliver IV thought he was in reality.  That's how IV saw him, and that's how he ended up on screen.  The emotion that III did exhibit in the book is lost onscreen.This film is not bad by any means.  Again, I actually enjoyed it, even the first time I saw it.  It captures the spirit, the time and the location of the book very well.  The leads play the characters very well.  And the second half of the film is superbly adapted.  But it was just utterly disappointing for me to see then, and now, the emotional wallup that the book contained almost entirely lost onscreen.  Maybe a remake will be in order someday.

In addition, the Love Story Ending has become a cinema cliche in the last 33 years...though this film created that particular cliche.  But I thought the chemistry between Jenny and Oliver was great, and it was nice to see a female romantic lead willing to put the male in his place to some degree (quite a feat when you consider the film was made in 1970).  In addition, some of the attitudes about males and females are dated, but once again the movie was made 33 years ago and when I took that into account, it didn't really bother me.

Harvard Law student Ryan O'Neal (Oscar-nominated) falls immediately for Radcliffe music student Ali McGraw (also an Oscar-nominee). There is friction at first, but we all know that an unbreakable bond of love and admiration is going to take place. Naturally O'Neal's wealthy father (a cold and chilling performance from the excellent Ray Milland) decides to dismiss his son all together when he realizes that he is indeed going to marry the much poorer McGraw. McGraw's father (priceless Oscar-nominee John Marley) loves the idea of having O'Neal for a son-in-law, but does question the couple's views on family and even more importantly religion. Throughout it appears that the main focus is for O'Neal and Milland to put their differences aside and come back together as father and son, but the film takes a much different turn in its final act and it is blatantly apparent that disease will break the earthly union that O'Neal and McGraw share. Love Story is another one of those films that acts strictly with emotion and not necessarily intelligence. Oscar-nominated director Arthur Hiller (easily doing the best work of his career) would rather speak volumes with silence than with loud verbal outbursts. The somber tone of the movie and its Oscar-winning score dominate the production and end up being the film's strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. Overall Love Story is a movie that will stick with you like glue. There are just some human emotions shown here that cannot be denied to movie-goers, but really sometimes raw emotion cannot overcome the lack of a possibly more intelligent approach. Watch for then-unknown Tommy Lee Jones as one of O'Neal's Harvard friends. 4 stars out of 5.

Above all, the two leads are so totally unlikeable and unsympathetic.  We're supposed to feel sorry for Oliver while he's crusing around Boston in an expensive European hot rod?

Jenny isn't any better, but her excessive and gratuitious profanity makes her totally repulsive on top of her arrogance, nastiness and self-absorption.  Sorry -- it's just hard to get into a romance when you absolutely despise the couple.I will say, however, that I thought the cinematography was pretty good.  The hockey scenes at the beginning are very well done in particular, and the scene at the end where Oliver III and Oliver IV face each other through a revolving door (as one leaves and the other enters) is a very powerful shot.  Indeed, it's the cinematography that makes Oliver and Jenny seem even remotely human and likable.I found this to be an interesting contrast to a film from the same era -- Bang the Drum Slowly (1973), which has a large number of similarities (relationships; illness; success / failure; death; parents).  The contrast is that the story in Drum is outstanding, while the cinematography is absolutely dreadful.  LOVE STORY is the direct opposite.  I found this to be an interesting comparison, at least.

Having only seen his performances in 'The Lost Weekend' and 'Dial M for Murder', I was pleased to see that he adapted well to the role of Oliver's conservative and rather domineering father. In fact Milland's character is pivotal to the whole film, though he appears in only three or four scenes and has relatively few lines of dialogue. For me the real love story of the title was that between Oliver and his father; it's clear that Oliver's father never stops loving his son, even though Oliver junior can't bring himself (because of his pride) to apologise for rejecting his father's love. Oliver quotes 'love means never having to say you're sorry' at his father towards the end of the film as if to forestall his father's apologies, when really he knows that it is he who should apologise for not reciprocating his father's affections. So a son's desire for the unconditional love of a parent is I think what is really described by the tagline.The eventual separation of Jenny and Oliver by Jenny's fatal disease is paralleled by Oliver's estrangement from his father, but I think the latter is in a way more tragic because it is caused by Oliver's pride and the two men's stubbornness and is ultimately avoidable. The father's pain at his son's behaviour is no less poignant than Oliver's grief at his wife's fate. One answer to the question 'why does Jenny have to die?' is that her death removes the bone of contention between father and son; in the best tradition of Shakespearian tragedy, the characters have gone through hell, but in the end order is restored. Though we see the death of one character and the end of one relationship, paradoxically this results in the longed-for reconciliation of Oliver and his father. The situation at the end of the film is essentially the same as it was just before Jenny met Oliver, except that both Oliver and his father are now sadder and wiser men.

It of course coined the phrase love means never having to say you're sorry, which sounds good but in fact is worthless tripe.  Anyone who knows what love really is also knows the value, the importance of saying I'm sorry when it is warranted. However it is amazing how many people latched on to this phrase, just because it was in a movie.

It is better than most movies because it portrays above average, intelligent sensitive people, capable of love and fun. O'Neill may be likable, but he is horribly miscast as an intellectual.   The film's major flaw is the death of the girl. Pointless and irrelevant. It didn't move me at all. With a happy ending, as well as a better script, it could have been great. A great movie about true love would certainly not deal with squabbles and pettiness.   Love means never having to say you're sorry' - What on earth does it mean? 1990I like it even more now. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, a true gem. It captures romance, it has an incredible stylistic maturity. Granted, the golden tune is half the movie, but there is much more to it. From the very beginning you know, that this film is inspired. This is not at all a tear-jerker. The girl's death is handled with breath-taking good taste. The pacing is admirable, classic. There are no long, boring scenes. There is a fleeting quality that gives the impression, that the director realizes that a movie has to be organically whole, not a patchwork. By God, even the credits are presented in a breath-taking manner, and the title itself is lapidary in its stark simplicity. No doubt, this is one of the ten greatest American movies. A movie is more than its plot.  Am I a hopelessly silly romantic, or have I struck gold?  I never change my mind about things. Even at ninety I would love this movie. Love means never having to say you're sorry, is in itself not very meaningful, but the way it was presented, made it seem like some magical oracle. The actors were totally mismatched. O'Neal is not at all believable as a romantic guy.  1997The effect has worn off slightly. I begin to find fault with the many facial close-ups, but it is still a fine movie. I love many of its details. There is no doubt I will be seeing this movie again and again, although it is inferior to The Strawberry Statement.2000I haven't seen it recently, but my increasing cynicism prevails Why must the poor girl die? Could it be, because she dared to break the social taboo? Do the actors themselves like this movie, or did Ryan and Ali erupt in hysterical laughter about their silly roles? And the famous phrase could be paraphrased `Love means never having to say I hate you'.

It is simple, like love &#150; and it does translate well onto the screen with our two leads being Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw. Together their chemistry is shattering, bring to life a small piece of Americana, and the depth of life. As Jennifer and Oliver pour their literal hearts out on screen, the issues of Love Story, while not many, do break free and run rampant throughout. The lacking development, the clutter of language, the electric music, and the cheapened edits all culminate as utter distracts to this film. These errors pull from the story, creating a mediocre tale that could have been the greatest love story ever sold.Let me begin by saying that as much criticism as I give Love Story, it still (and probably will with another viewing) brought a tear to my eye. It is ultimately a story about the power of love, and even if you can see through the clich√© language, parts of this film will remind you of a love you have or once had. It has sentimental value that presses on the right heartstrings at the right time. We can thank, and denounce at the same time, writer Erich Segal for this. His story takes us to love, but his words violently pull us away. Throughout this film, one cannot help but wonder if O'Neal and MacGraw read their lines off cue-cards behind them, or if the words coming from their mouths were to be staples of clich√© for decades of romantic films to follow. In one corner we have a witty, independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind, in the other corner, we have a guy who takes direction well &#150; OK &#150; I get that, but what else is there about these characters that we could learn about. If this is to be a talking film, let the words they speak to each other express their emotion stronger &#150; or at least develop a subplot around them that allows the viewer to see all the dimensions of both Oliver and Jennifer. I knew their connections, but I finished this film without really knowing them. From the book, one could hear their inner-voice, without that in the film, we were lead on a one-sided voyage through love without any potholes or pitfalls. Each and every time a conflict occurred, simple words were spoken, we were taken to a new city, and we began our story all over again. With conflict comes resolution, and one cannot resolve with just one phrase &#150; Love means not having to say your sorry.Clarification. The simplicity of this story is what kept me glued to the screen the entire hour and a half. The acting force behind O'Neal and MacGraw was consistent throughout, providing me with excited moments, emotional moments, and a heavy cardboard aftertaste. While their characters were enjoyable to watch, they lacked the depth needed to really pull further at my heartstrings. I knew what sort of characters they were, but they needed to take one more step to fully make me believe they were who they were pretending to be. Arrogance comes to mind because I believe writer Segal and director Hiller knew what they had for audiences by the end of their film, they knew that if they kept these two one-dimensional characters together long enough; they would have the audiences coming back by the third act. To me, this ploy seemed arrogant of them. Give us more, give us characters, give us at least impressive scenery &#150; but instead we were handed one phrase and tears. Not enough. The music could have benefited from either a dedicated theme song or a better composer, the strum of the piano chords never quite hit that level of emotion I needed to bawl my eyes out. The music was potent at first, but by the second act, it felt stale of overplayed. It wasn't the theme music of Oliver and Jennifer's love that could have further strengthened their relationship. Coupled with elaborately bad edits, our film stands solely on the doorstep of the actors. They are good, not quite great, but worth viewing merely for those small moments of joy where you feel like you are watching a film, not being a sinister voyeur on their lives. Love Story is a sad love story, alas, it needed something more &#150; a stronger element that would have shown Oliver's hatred for his father, his dedication to his life, and his ability to discover love anywhere in life. One needed a few more chapters of the book translated to the screen to make these characters full bodied enough to bring that climactic ending to a stand still. Instead, Hiller's direction just made it feel like an opus of clich√©s.Overall, Love Story was worth the singular view, but repeat viewings will not be needed. The choice of casting Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw was superb, these were two people that could carry the weight of this world on their shoulders, but Hiller never gave it to them. There was never that oh yea moment in the film, where we suddenly realized who these two were, and why they were together &#133; mind, body, and spirit. Not thinking about the dreadful A Walk to Remember, this film could benefit from a facelift. Build the two characters stronger together, introduce more problems for the two to solve, really illustrate the confusion between Oliver and his father, and I think you would have yet another blockbuster on your hands. This is a rich film, executed poorly, but the groundlings are there. Love Story felt like a cold flat soda &#150; it still quenches your thirst on a hot day, but it just misses that punch.

My feelings on it are quite mixed. On one hand you have the everlastingly beautiful music, excellent picture quality and a lovely setting either in brilliant white snow or a deep blue sky which gives that crispy wintry look to everything. The story itself is objectively moving and the tragic end without doubt brings tears to one's eyes. The closing shot of Oliver alone with himself in the snow is approaching the limit of the emotionally bearable so to speak. Because the film has matured with time, like a good wine, it now seems dated, just as the films of the 1940's appeared dated in the seventies. But whilst the films of the forties have kept their charm sixty years one, certain aspects of Love Story lead one not to have nostalgia for the seventies !My main bone of contention is with the level of language and some of the ideas developed, the dialogues are often crude and lack elegance. Presumably the script writer of the time wanted to be hip and with it, but love is universally and eternally a magic thing alas not within everyone's grasp and my idea of being in love is certainly not via the sort of language and aggressive overtones used in the film. This way of speaking may have some historical interest as a souvenir on what it was like in the seventies, but is not suited to a romantic film where the subject is the development of an amorous relationship. One almost gets the feeling that the writer of the dialogues is seeking to deliberately use crude and unromantic dialogues either for the purpose of provocation or quite simple to be with it at the time. It's less a question of how many dirty words in the film than that of the general tone of the dialogues used. In 2001, a film about a similar subject ( now who mentioned Autumn in New York &#133;&#133;&#133;! ) would not contain these unpleasent dialogues. One also feels that the fad at the time was if you are rich it is bad and that one should stand up to one's parents and send them to hell, so to speak. In fact, its Olivier who is violent and disrespectful, not Jenny who in fact is much more level-headed and wishes Oliver to be less unkind to his parents. The other thing I could not bear was the fact that they didn't want to get married in the Church. I mean, if you don't want to get married at all just live together, but if you are deciding to opt for marriage then it should be done properly in a church (given that the film is taking place in a Christian Country ). This sort of rebellious-against-authority-for-the-sake-of-it-attitude  was unfortunately typical of the seventies and is far overplayed in this film. Though it can be argued on the other had that it remains for years to come a depiction of the prevailing rebellious attitude at the time. Anyway I feel this kind of attitude is off-putting and spoils the romantic side and charm of the film to which I am very attached ! Don't forget that the film is not supposed to be a realistic documentary of cruel life but something that makes you dream. The aforementioned negative observations put a damper on that side of the film but I reserve my definitive judgement for after a few more viewings of the work !!

I heard about its popularity from my parents who were teenagers at that time and also liked it.

Some scenes last forever, especially the one when Jenny walks to hospital with her husband. In fact, there is not much action in the film whatsoever. Perhaps because it is a love story and nothing more.The music? It's not bad as for the drama but too melancholic. I know that a lot of people may criticize me for my skepticism when applied to the beautiful song that was written later and the whole story. Yes, if you are deadly sentimental, you may say that my opinion is cruel. But, what I notice in the film is sadness and forcing you to be touched and cry. The terribly sad music combined with a very sad story is too much! It makes people grief just for the sake of it. It is something entirely different than being touched by a single scene in a movie or feeling a right empathy with the characters retaining awareness that it is ONLY a movie! Like with blood or sex, films may also exaggerate with sorrow. Then, it all becomes unnatural!I would, however, not do justice to the movie failing to notice the good sides of it. Of course, there are a lot of moments that move me in the right way (not melancholy but something that leads me to reflect and teaches me empathy). There must be a mention about the last scene and the profound words Loving means never having to say I am sorry. Yes, I admit there are moments for which the movie is worth seeing. It gives some kind of lesson of life. Moreover, love is showed gently. That is true. It means not only sex, as it is in many films concerning this topic, but it is understanding, unity, and faithfulness.All in all, the movie clearly fits to that period of the early 1970s Make love not war.

It is very much a product of its time. It has early 70s written all over it, and though I actually liked the 70s (remember more of the latter half, too young to remember this early), this film is the archetype of modern love stories that seem to dispense with God, the very paragon of Love itself. The early 70s were just emerging from the rebellious 60s in which we moved furthest from God for the first time. Everything became rely on yourself or believe in yourself, without that rock of security to fall back on. The characters celebrate life (and mourn death of course), but there is no gratitude for the life they have been given, or gratitude for the love they share. They take it for granted. And although the portrayal of love seems genuine...it ultimately falls flat. Yes it is a beautiful story and very well acted and well directed...but when I hear the lines spoken by Ali MacGraw, We're kind of negative on the church thing. We're kind of negative on the God thing. It really makes me sad. True love can only be appreciated and demonstrated by following an appreciation for God's most fervent love and a worship of Him who created us. To me, true love was the selfless expression of Christ's sacrifice on the cross. That's not being religious. That's simply acknowledging truth. I think the only way two people can express true love that really lasts is to abide in God's existence, His expression of Love, and His Word. These characters do none of that. They don't pray to God when Jenny gets sick, they rely on themselves...and we are all woefully inadequate to surmount our own illnesses and sufferings without God's help. Morally speaking, this is not a REAL Love Story...just one that makes us THINK it is. A nice try, but it ultimately falls way short. "}]
