He is able to play complicated musical pieces, pen deep and meaningful poems, calculate complex mathematical problems at an age when his classmates are still learning to tie their shoes and mastering their alphabet. He's a child old before his time, capable of thoughts far beyond the average adult's understanding, but at the core of it all, he is still just a seven-year-old who wants to fit in at school and have friends. His mother Dede, played by Jodie Foster, determines the best way to raise her beloved son is to treat him like any other child to the extent that she never really acknowledges his gifts, whereas Jane Grierson (Dianne Wiest) is on the other end of the scale as a psychologist whose speciality is gifted children. Jane takes an interest in Fred, believing his intelligence must be nurtured even if it means plonking a tot of seven into a university full of young adults.Jodie Foster and Dianne Wiest deliver strong, solid performances as two women who both love this child and just want what is best for him, even if their approaches are very different. However, it is Adam Hann-Byrd who steals the show as the lead character of Fred. He depicts the brilliance of the character as well as his awkwardness in dealing with both 'normal' contemporaries and fellow gifted children. He is wonderful in showing how Fred is just a kid who wants to be liked, and how he desperately needs the adults around him to provide him a balance between being treated like the seven-year-old he is while allowing his towering intellect to thrive.This film takes us into the heart of what it is to be a child prodigy and how it can be both a gift and a curse. We see Fred surpassing his adult classmates in his university course yet he struggles to interact with peers his own age who are of average intelligence. Through him, it is easy to see that being perceived as 'normal' can be the greatest gift of all. It also highlights the abysmal state of the state education system in teaching such children.I really recommend this film as it delivers this fascinating story in a manner that is bittersweet, touching and, at times, humorous. The characters are all interesting and likable and you can't help but feel for Fred's joys and woes.

It's a pleasure to watch. The story shows beautifully what a thousand articles on math prodigies cannot- that even geniuses need love and that no matter how genius that child is he is still only a kid. She brings out the subtleties of her character. Fred seems adult-like in a child's world and yet deals with child-like simplicity in an adult's world. Jane is the headmistress of a school for the gifted, who believes that her theories on child-prodigies can bring out Fred's best talents, but forgets that Fred's best is not in his head but in his heart. Working to give her child the best yet fierce-fully protective of Fred is his mother Dede. This movie perfectly capture the heartbreaking events that can happen when a child is given too much attention but no affection. Hats off to Adam Byrd who gives a very nuanced performance. Both Jodie Foster and Nancy show the little personality clashes very well. Jodie foster has done a great job when she shows Dede's reaction and then later Jane's reaction to the fact that Fred has had a nightmare.I hope to be able to see more movies from her.

It's found that, at the age of 2, Fred can already read the print on the bottom of a dinner plate. Dede, and the rest of the world, realize that Fred is a genius, but Dede is determined that Fred, while given ever opportunity to expand his gift, is not exploited by the well meaning, but pretentious head mistress of a school for gifted children, Jane Grierson, portrayed by the outstanding actress Dianne Wiest.The story's told, mainly, through the eyes of Fred; however, we also see the viewpoints of Dede & Jane who each feel that she alone has Fred's best interests at heart. We are given tremendous insight into how Fred sees and relates to the world around him. He has the understanding that's beyond most adults but only the emotional experience of his 7 years of life.Through Fred, we can see that the academic world of gifted children isn't just filled with the nice, polite, precocious, bespectacled children that we are often shown on news magazines or public television programs. We are allowed to see that some are as outright rude and pretentious as the adults who claim to be only nurturing their gifts.In her feature-film directorial debut, Foster is able to capture the world as Fred sees it. She's able still allow us to see Fred as the youngster he is. Fred's intellect isn't the basis of the story, just one element in it. She lets the story do the work, and she let's the character's tell the tale. She allows the characters to be real people not just the stereotypes that so often are found in films dealing with this subject matter.Jodie Foster's only directed two films since this one (Home For The Holidays-1995 & Flora Plum-2005), and I've seen Home For The Holidays which I also feel was very well done. It seems that Ms. Foster is being very careful in picking her projects, much like the late Stanley Kubrick did. I only hope her unique talents are recognized and she's given more green lights for future projects.

The scene with Harry Connick Jr. at his apartment is in a dilapidated apartment building on Ludlow Ave. The scenes of Odyssey of the Mind were filmed at the Wexner Center of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. During filming Jodie Foster kept a low profile, as she also directed. This story is truly timeless...gifted education is still in the formative stages today. The movie shows that a careful balance between the nurture of the parent and the wisdom of the educator can give children an environment to reach their potential in a healthy way.

She plays a mother who wants her genius son to have an ordinary life, once his intelligence is discovered, yet in his normal life, he's a total misfit.  The way Foster brings these fragile little egos together is intriguing.  The film is also a showcase for Wiest's quirky charms, she adds much humanity to a character who on the surface is unlikable, although it is Foster who gives the more subtle performance.  (I disagree with one reviewer at the time who suggested they should have switched roles, it's more interesting seeing them each cast against type.)  There are brief but nice supporting turns from Celia Weston and the late Danitra Vance.  But it is Adam Hann-Byrd who makes the movie a total pleasure.  If The Sixth Sense were made during this time (1991), he would have been the only choice for Haley Joel Osment's role.  Never precocious, never going out of his way to pull at heartstrings, he could give several grown-up actors lessons in how to give a nuanced performance.  A thoroughly enjoyable film.

Simplistic Conclusion.","Date":"9 April 2002","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I was mainly interested in this film because of the subject - the predicament of a child genius. Half way through it I was captivated, not so much by the subject(in part because of the way it was handled), but by the child genius himself. Adam Hann-Byrd is thoroughly captivating. Rendering a sympathetic performance, he's almost bewitching! He even looks a lot like Jodie Foster. And it's to her credit as a director for finding such a perfect little actor to play such a complex role. Jodie Foster herself gives a moving performance as a struggling mother who is suddenly made to feel incapacitated, both financially and mentally, as the mother of a child prodigy. Diane Wiest's choice of characters has always been interesting. From 'Edward Scissorhands' to 'Birdcage', 'Practical magic' and still other films, she's usually played characters who are slightly quirky, odd or non-conformist, with a touch of humor in them. Over here she plays to perfection the role of the demanding, independent mentor of Fred Tate with a warped emotional intelligence. One grouse though...as far Diane Wiest's character is concerned. I think her role is too much of an extreme as compared to Jodie Foster's. At the end of the film, Wiest's character, Jane Grierson ends up looking sheepish, repenting and even stupid to an extent. The end is almost sort of an ode to perfect motherhood, decrying the failure of the poor mentor spending tons of money by taking prodigies under her wing. It seems to say, child prodigies don't need all that specialized atmosphere, don't need special benefits, when in fact they do. I'm not saying that they ought to be living in state-of-the-art cages where they will only interact with other prodigies. But they do need a lot of other benefits that ordinary schools which underestimate the intelligence of even normal people just cannot provide. Child geniuses need to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in mind their advanced faculties all the time and an atmosphere has to be created for them to properly nurture their special gifts. Somehow this film, by showing Jane Grierson as obviously insensitive, indirectly puts forth a bad case for special training for child geniuses. The real test of motherhood and Dede's feelings of jealousy towards Jane would have been explored if Jane, along with her maternal feelings for Fred would have also been shown to be sensitive or considerate. Instead we are made to laugh at Jane because she offers Fred some brown fruit/veggie juice and he asks for Coke... So that's it. This film is good, not for the content or it's resolution, but for the acting. Kudos to Adam Hann-Byrd!

Jodie Foster's debut as a filmmaker shows a little boy genius, who we've all seen before.  The difference is the little boy is human, and not just a brain.  He worries about people dying, envies the popular athletic boy, all the while plays music in competition form and forms math problems on his head.  The conflict between Jodie Foster, the mother, and Dianne Wiest, the child genius grown up, is somewhat annoying, but it makes sense, as they are both extremes of parenting.  The child in this movie plays it superbly, as does Foster and Wiest.  Some points of this movie I was about to worry that the emotional music was coming and we'd see some sappy speech.  Thankfully that never happened. What this movie is, is an emotional movie that doesn't have a bad guy or good guy to root or cheer for.  Everyone here's prerogatives make sense, and it's up to you who you support, and what you think about Fred Tate, the little genius.

Jodie and Dianne are just such a terrific pair of actresses and are perfect casting for the film. I know Jodie Foster was in charge of the film and she did a terrific job. The boy who played Fred was so charming and fit the role perfectly. The story is so touching and beautiful, not to mention original since the story of gifted children isn't really discussed that well.Fred is a young boy who is extremely gifted, his intelligence is something very special. But his mom, DeeDee, doesn't really let him expand since she is a single mom wanting her son just to be normal. But Fred is discovered by Jane Grierson, a professor of highly intelligent and gifted children, giving Fred the chance to expand his world and even takes him to college at a young age. Fred meets interesting characters throughout his journey learning that maybe life has more to offer than what he used too.Little Man Tate is a very good movie and very charming. I know some might find it a little boring, but honestly, you have got to give this movie a chance, it has great drama and some fun comedy along the way. David Hyde Pierce was such a fun addition to the cast, he really makes his screen presence enjoyable, so does Dianne. But the whole cast is just perfect and seemed to enjoy doing this movie together.

It's a deep film that tackles an unusual subject--the gifted child's place among his or her peers. There are many memorable scenes throughout the movie, and Foster's direction shows a true understanding of the film-making process. What I find interesting is that Foster has created a world that's devoid of any strong adult males. Fred's father, or any mention of him, is nonexistent in the film. David Hyde Pierce plays a character who has some sort of relationship with the Dianne Wiest character, but it's never defined. Although he seems to works with Weist, he has no interaction with her young geniuses, including Fred. The only other prominent male is played by Harry Connick Jr. His character, Eddie, is a feckless college student who almost kills Fred accidentally. Eddie then befriends Fred for a day, but later gives him the brush-off, initiating Fred's meltdown. Foster seems to be saying that Fred needs a male figure in his life, but it ain't gonna happen. I've read interviews with Foster in which she spoke about her anger toward and resentment of the father who abandoned her as a child. Since no one in this film even comes close to being a father figure, she's clearly sending a message here, whether consciously or unconsciously. My message to Ms. Foster is We're not all that bad. There was no need to write us out of existence (she reads these comments, right?).

Nevertheless, this is an accomplished well acted, little film looking at the gift-cum-curse of being a gifted child in a largely misunderstanding world.To be fair, the movie looks little more than a better-than-average TV movie, but is elevated by its director's star turn in front of the cameras, plus some neat little (that word again!) directorial flourishes, like a slow cutaway into the distance of Foster's workaday waitress Dee Tate's mother/son dance with young son Fred and at other points interesting suffusions of light and animation to perhaps demonstrate the surging thought process of the precocious infant.The narrative gets a little skewered as Fred is adopted by a wealthy philanthropist female, childless naturally, whose feelings quickly move from professorial to matrimonial and a too obvious conflict with Foster's more down-home mother love. Some of the situations are a little too pat also, for instance the way that Fred cleaves to older boys, one a maths prodigy himself, the other a piano-playing college boy (played by a young Harry Connick Junior), the lad obviously groping emotionally for a male bonding relationship with his natural father nowhere around.Freak occurrences too like Connick's initial encounter with Fred (symbolically dropping the whole world on his shoulders!) and a side-lined Foster's rescue of a drowning child just as Fred's making an appearance at the professor's side on national TV also jar credulity a little and of course sentimentality rears its largely unwelcome head before the happy ending, but I'm perhaps being too severe on what is when all is said and done, a warm, family entertainment on an off-beat subject.

In Little Man Tate,  Foster plays the role of Dede Tate, a single mother struggling to provide for herself and her ingenious son, Fred (Adam Hann-Byrd), who is modestly aware of his talents, but simply wants to be accepted by his peers; to be `normal'.  Dianne West plays the role of Jane Grierson, the director of a special school for gifted children, who notices Fred's abilities and wants him to join her group on a trip to academic competitions.  During that time, she becomes attached to Fred and begins to act as a mother figure to him.  She pretends that Fred is her own son since she has no family of her own.  However, Fred is pushed too far and returns home to his mother. Dede Tate successfully portrays the strong bond between mother and son and the love they have for each other.  Neither one really realizes the importance of having the other to support them until they are apart.  Throughout the movie, Fred encounters moments in which he makes a mental advancement and it is portrayed through his eyes; showing the viewer what he sees.  For example, Fred envisions a game of pool as a series of lines and forces, and at the math competition he is depicted solving the equation with a bright whirlpool of numbers and equations.  This aspect of the movie attracts the attention of the viewer and makes it a little more fun to watch.  Viewers are drawn in by the child's wit, yet are still even more perplexed by his modest attitude.  Above all, they are most attracted to the excellent representation of a mother and son relationship.  It is an amazing and inspirational movie that will keep viewers glued to the screen till the end.

Fred Tate isn't a happy, sunny kid--he's pensive--and he's almost always a fish-out-of-water. Director Jodie Foster (who also stars as Tate's mother) does a good job of steering us through all the complicated emotions inherent in this story, but slips a bit at the end. Too much melodrama comes to a head near the finish, which then veers sharply off track for a really happy ending. I didn't buy it, yet I believe Foster might have added it for the benefit of the audience (as an emotional release). Despite this--and a wayward section at the university which seems designed to show off Harry Connick Jr.'s sass and musical talent--the film has a velvety kind of vulnerability which is quite touching. Foster as an actress does a very good job (although her trashy mouth gets tiresome), but Dianne Wiest is unable to come up with anything surprising as Fred's mentor (who, too easily, is shown to be brilliant but lonesome herself). **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Tough Being 'Different'","Date":"28 August 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  In many respects savants, polymaths and autodidacts are in the same fix as slow learners, retards and idiots.

"},{"Title":"A good film that could have been great, had it not been pushed to be mainstream","Date":"13 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Before I go on with this review, let me share exactly why a film like this means so much to me, and why I can relate so much to it. The film is about a boy genius, a young man with exceptional intelligence and skills. I don't think it's ever clearly stated in the film, but his personality and his intelligence points to him being an autist. Now, suffering(what a misdirecting word... like it's a disease or something) from a mild case of autism myself, being diagnosed with asperger syndrome, I can relate to the kid on a very personal level. However, the film has been pushed into being a mainstream drama, instead of being, shall we say a good one(or, at least an accurate one). The personality of the kid is accurate, but not all of his symptoms are. I actually saw a TV special, which involved a real person, a teenager, diagnosed with asperger syndrome. During the ten minutes that the special lasted, I learned more about being an asperger, recognized more of my own personality traits, and realized more about myself and being an asperger than I did through the 90 minutes of this film. It holds a lot of truth, but too much of it is watered down and forced into being mainstream, in which everything has to end fine and dandy, and in which everything has to make perfect sense. Maybe the film should have been longer; maybe it should just have been less mainstream, and more deep. I don't know. The film just lacks something. Everything in the film just immediately evokes some outbursts of Aww Ohh, and doesn't really spark any further thought in the subject. I suspect that, was such a statistic made, most people who saw this film would prove to have done no further research or give no further thought into the subject of autism. And that's just the problem with the film. It evokes the emotions that it's supposed to, but that's it. Afterwords, everyone forgets about it, and gives it no further thought. Just like the audiences of mainstream dramas want; an hour and a half of emotions and drama, and then to return to their normal, everyday lives, with no new experiences or even the notion of thinking about autism, or any other non-commercial subject. However, apart from that, the film is well done. The plot is good. The pacing is good enough. The acting is very good; the three leads, Foster, Wiest and Hann-Byrd(the child actor) all do their jobs well, all give good performances. The child actor was a pleasant surprise, and truly delivered a believable performance. The characters are well-written and credible. I like that there is no definite bad guy; both Foster and Wiest mistreat the child, and mistake what he wants with what they want themselves. The graphics that are done to show when the kid concentrates on something or figures something out in a particular way are good, well done, and give a pretty good image of what it's like to be gifted and figuring something out much faster than a normal person could. Of course they're oversimplified, but what would you expect from a mainstream film? I suspect an independent film dealing with the subject would have been much better. All in all, if you're interested in the subject, it's decent, but I would recommend looking up the real information about it instead. If you have no knowledge of the subject, you can watch the film; just don't expect everything in it to be true. If you don't care about the subject, you can just watch it as you would any other mainstream drama. I recommend it to fans of dramas, but I warn anyone who knows a lot on the subject to approach with caution and take the film lightly. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Touching, One of the Best","Date":"30 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Little Man Tate is one of my fave movies of all time.  If you're a fan of Dianne Wiest or Jodie Foster, it's a must see.  Adam is great; a promising actor.Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd) is a 7-year-old genius that is invited to attend the 'Odyssey of the Mind' program run by Jane Grierson (Dianne Wiest). His mother Dede (Jodie Foster) is reluctant to send him there, but at last consents when she accepts the fact that her son needs more than she can give him.I highly recommend this movie.  There are a few laughs here and there, and contrary to what some may think, this is NOT a boring movie!!!

The depiction of the loneliness of a gifted boy, and also the way his mother has to juggle both loving her son above all other things and guaranteeing that they both survive the necessities of life is viscerally touching. Hann-Byrd is an absolute find, and Wiest delivers another rich performance. The music selection also helps at the good-looking of this movie, and at the end the viewer is fully satisfied with its special point of view. Pity that the film remained in the underdog status among the media, films like this one are really rare.

She stars as well, and also in a very different performance than Clarice in 'The Silence of the Lambs' she does a great job. The real star is Adam Hann-Byrd. He plays Fred Tate, a seven year old kid who happens to be a genius. A genius, but also a kid. He learns quantum physics on university, but also misses his mother and doesn't watch when he is crossing a street. He has not many friends because he is different. Jane Grierson (Dianne Wiest) is a woman who helps the highly intelligent kids in a special school. Dede and Jane are both a parent for the kid. They are both right about him, and both very wrong. Dede only sees the kid-side, Jane only sees the genius-side.A very nice film with great performances, especially by Adam Hann-Byrd. Sometimes it is funny, sometimes it is moving. You will enjoy.

The little boyFred Tate is excellent played by Adam Hann-Byrd,he deliveres a performance which can only be measured whith Haley Joel Osmond in the Sixth Sense. Jodie Foster also delivers a great performance,she has also directed this movie.The movie shows how difficult it can be to be different.It tells the story about Fred Tate who is only a little kid,but also genious(unlike anything you have seen),he can solv any mathematic and is also a poet and an art artist,but unfortunantly he has no friends,except his mother(who dont understand his potential). But one day an oppurtunity comes along,that will change Fred's life.

Fortunately, it doesn't run into the problems of other kid-oriented movies by falling into stereotype.  If it did, Fred would have glasses and acne problems like every other geek.  I am happy that they found a decent child actor to carry the weight of the production (much like Empire of the Sun).  There just isn't that much to say about this movie other than that it appeals only to a selective few.I will be honest, this could have been better and deeper, but Jodie Foster didn't want it to and so she winds up being the Virgin Mary in this movie.  I know that doesn't make a lot of sense here, but if you see it you'll understand.  Perhaps she is becoming an egotist.  Still, between Revenge of the Nerds and this, I'll take this.Overall, not necessary viewing, but you could do worse.  3 out of 5 stars.

It must really be difficult for all involved.Adam Hanna-Byrd, as Fred, is the star of the show and plays that young kid. Jodie Foster plays his mother. The kid's a neat little guy and the main adult characters, played by Foster and Dianne Wiest, are interesting, too. The latter plays the head mistress of a school for gifted children. She and Foster clash a lot about how to bring up the child.The only thing that marred this film was the language. There is too much profanity (six usages of the Lord's name in vain, for example) for a family film like this. There is no reason for all of it in a thoughtful, kid-themed movie. Anyway, it's still worth a look.It's nice to see Hanna-Byrd, in real life, is living much more of a normal existence, having gone to college and graduating in 2004 "},{"Title":"Horrifying","Date":"5 October 2002","Score":"2 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Cliched dialogue, story & symbolism.
