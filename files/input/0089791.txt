The first film by Paul Ruebens, Tim Burton and the incomparable film composer Danny Elfman, it bubbles with the pure joy and exuberance of three talented people playing with a brand new toy. No film has ever been more fun to watch.Reubens' media crucifixion in the early 90's was a crime against pop culture. America's snickering sanctimony stifled and virtually silenced one of the few original voices in the entertainment industry. I'm only thankful that Pee-wee lives on in video-land, so that my children and I can continue to enjoy his film and television work (the new DVD of Big Adventure, by the way, is a treasure).Pee-wee Herman, it's time to come back!

In fact this is as straight a comedy as the Marx Brothers created in their films, totally without seriousness and with no opportunity to just do something funny passed by. Ruebens was inspired, well supported by cast, pacing and minimal props. His Pee Wee appears as a genuine person which gives the comedy enough bite to stick.

The envy of the neighbourhood, his bike is his life and he is horrified when he finds it stolen.  With the police unwilling to start a statewide search, Pee-wee sets out on an adventure to try and find his bike.Pee-Wee Herman is a fairly acquired taste and won't please all audiences.  I quite liked him here but couldn't have watched his show on a weekly basis.  In this film though his `man-child' style and outlandish sense of humour really work out well.  The plot is fairly pointless and just sparks off a road trip, which has a series of bizarre characters and adventures along the way.Tim Burton's darkly comic imagination certainly helps and he gives the whole film an other-worldly feel to the whole thing, whether it be in the delivery of Herman's dreams or just the look of the film as a whole.  Not all of it works of course, some of it misfires and isn't as funny as it would like to think that it is, however much of it is weirdly amusing and will be entertaining if you like Herman's style.Herman can be annoying but here he stays on the right side of irritating and he is amusing in his delivery.  He certainly suits the material and his OTT/hyper style helps the audience get into the very silly plot!  Support is good and has lots of small roles that are weird and funny.Overall this film is very much a matter of taste.  If you like Herman then you should enjoy this film as it is very well done and is blessed with a real other-worldly touch by a great director in the making.

But I, however, find it to be entertaining, very funny, and a good family movie made back in the 80's.  It has a lot of jokes that are mostly the ones that are funny because they are weird and never seen anywhere else, but it does also have some one-liners that make even the most stern of audiences laugh.  What I liked about this movie was that it had a lot of people involved in it.  There were also a lot of locations that were shown in this film, even if the places were not the initial location that they intentioned of in the movie.All of the characters gave pretty good performances that were done at optimum level of expectation.  To be honest, I cannot think of any reason off the top of my head that could make Pee-wee's Big Adventure better.  There are plenty of jokes as I have already said that make you laugh .  The camera angles that they used also coordinated with the way that the jokes went together.  The camera might be having a close-up frame and behind the character's back Pee-wee might do something to make that character turn around with the camera behind it.  The things like that are what make this movie good.  My other favorite parts of this movie are the scenes of Pee-wee's house, that had a very creative touch to it, and how Pee-wee had such dedication to his magical bike.  To see if I am right, you should go out and rent Pee-wee's Big Adventure.  I guarantee at least five long and hard laughs.  With all of it's silliness combined, I give this movie ****/****, a 10/10.  It was really a good experience to me.

Adapted from Paul Reubens' hit children's (and adult's) television show, it is a delightful fantasy that is bound to entertain. The tagline for the film describes it as the story of a rebel and his bike, and that really about sums up the entire movie, but there's something about Pee-wee that taps into everyone's inner child and captures the care-freeness of youth, making his adventures irresistible and utterly captivating ... because -- afterall -- Pee-wee is still the coolest man-child out there (take THAT, Michael Jackson!). The plot (which is really rather insignificant) revolves around Pee-wee's prized bike, which is tragically stolen while he's shopping for novelty toys at the mall (who DOESN'T wish they had this man's life?). After deciding that the police couldn't possibly help him in his endeavors, he takes the law into his own hands and sets out on a quest to find his bicycle -- which a phony fortune-teller has told him is in the basement of the Alamo. The film can be enjoyed on a number of levels while there is always the sheer fun and hilarity of Reubens comic genius, there is another genius at work here -- Burton's. One of the many pleasures of watching a Burton movie is that you can tell you're watching a movie by a man who's watched a lot of movies, and each feature of his is drenched with homages, parodies, and inside jokes Pee-wee's Big Adventure features references to beach blanket movies, horror movies, Godzilla movies, Tarzan movies, and even The Wizard of Oz. The other great thing about Burton is that he always adds a dark edge to his work, regardless of how flippant the work may be when Pee-wee's bike is stolen, it's a moment of almost Hitchcockian intensity. Burton's playful use of shadows and cartoonish set pieces conveys a sense of simultaneous lightheartedness and malice; his films accomplish that rare feat of creating a world entirely of their own. But even if all of this film-geek babble means absolutely nothing to you, you can still have fun on this adventure, because Pee-wee is one of the most likable characters in the history of entertainment anyone who claims to find Reubens obnoxious or unfunny is either lying to you or has no sense of humor. The screenplay for Pee-wee's Big Adventure was written by Reubens and Saturday Night Live alumni Phil Hartman, and its combination of childish humor (I know you are, but what am I?) and unexpected insight is absolutely charming. With top-notch direction and full-blown hilarity (the Tequila scene is one for the time capsule), it is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever made; it's that rare cult movie that's just as good as its fans would tell you it is. So go on give into your temptation and watch it. As Pee-wee himself would say, I triple-dog-dare ya not to like it.Grade B "},{"Title":"Why it's my favorite Tim Burton movie","Date":"22 September 2002","Score":"31 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  I absolutely love everyone of Tim Burton's movies, but if I had to pick which one was my favorite, this would be the one.

However, when this movie came out, my sense of humor officially began to gel. At age 7, I saw this movie on opening night with one of my sisters and our cousin. It actually appealed to my sense of humor but my sister and cousin were also rolling in laughter. It quickly became a family classic; a movie that I would come to watch over and over again. Fond memories came to attach themselves to it, and I will proudly admit to having the entire script committed to memory.Nowadays, my sister and I use it as a bonding experience. We watch it together every time we visit one another, and we make friends endure it too! However, I never thought I would look so fondly upon such a silly movie.When people think of Pee-Wee, his arrest in 1991 is usually the first thing that comes to mind. If you can look beyond that, and beneath the seemingly stupid exterior of the movie, it is possible to enjoy an unmatched delight of off-the-wall stupidity and unique humor.With Pee-Wee and Francis portrayed right from the as grown men that act like kids in the sand box, it is clear that you're in for something truly bizarre. Dreamy conversation at a dinosaur-guarded truck stop, an amazing breakfast machine, and run-ins with Godzilla and Twisted Sister are just a few of the many hilarious traits of this movie.

Paul Reubens lives and breathes this role, (literally - he's credited for the role of Pee-Wee as himself) and he couldn't have asked for a better partner than the similarly quirky, fringe-dwelling director Tim Burton (in his first major picture). Reubens is genuinely larger-than-life in this loose collection of vignettes and skits, with the whole mess tied together with all the care and subtlety of a spaceship made of duct tape and cardboard. Even when he's not making a direct footprint on the screen, Pee-Wee's influence is positively oozing out of each frame, coating everything from the scenery to the wardrobe to the manic, impulsive style of shooting. It's a perfect interpretation of the character's famous stage show, an ideal introduction for the unfamiliar masses, and a natural launchpad to super-stardom. I'll grant that it's not for everyone, but for those of us with an appreciation for drag queens, John Waters, the B-52's and sixties housewife chic, it's a direct hit. It's that rare crossroads where unbridled mayhem, conscienceless good times and hysterical laughter collide in a loud, twisted, dirty ball of pandemonium.

Pee-wees' world is subsequently shattered when his beloved, custom built, all- important bicycle is stolen from him, and he embarks on a cross country journey to find it again. Along the way, he will encounter escaped criminal Mickey (Judd Omen), wistful diner waitress Simone (Diane Salinger), an ominous sounding trucker named Large Marge (Alice Nunn), a gang of bikers known as the Satan's Helpers, and runs amok at Warner Bros. Studios.This viewer can understand how a character such as Pee-wee wouldn't be to all tastes, but speaking personally, he has a blast with this amiable movie every single time. Debuting director Tim Burton, a former animator, was obviously the right choice to take the helm of such zany shenanigans. He and his production designer David L. Snyder have a great time with the material, which was conceived by Reubens, his fellow Groundlings member Phil Hartman (who has a bit as a reporter), and Michael Varhol. One good thing must be said, and that is that if one is seeing it for the first time, it has a gleefully unpredictable quality to it. The rich array of characters also helps to keep things interesting.The whole chase through Warner Bros. Studios provides what are far and away the brightest moments. Pee-wee rides his bike through the sets of a beach party movie, a Christmas movie, a Godzilla movie (!), and, most uproariously, a Twisted Sister video.Reubens is great fun as Pee-wee. Elizabeth Daily as Dottie and Ms. Salinger are endearing, and Mark Holton as Francis is a hilariously unsubtle villain. There are cameos for Morgan Fairchild, James Brolin, Cassandra Elvira Peterson, and Tony Bill, and bits by the likes of Lynne Marie Stewart, John Paragon, Susan Barnes, Professor Toru Tanaka, Jan Hooks, and Jason Hervey.Danny Elfmans' score is one of the heaviest assets.

I can't imagine anyone hating him after they see this imaginative comedy. Paul Rubens is a very funny and talented man and it's a crying shame he's been ostracized by the hypocrites in Hollywood. 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' was Tim Burton's breakthrough movie that launched him on what is now a brilliant career, a career that goes from strength to strength, with the occasional great film, like 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood' and 'Big Fish'.This is the only movie I know centered around the theft of a bicycle, other than Vittorio di Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves' which is anything but a comedy. Burton makes this slight plot line work and holds the viewers' interest through 90 minutes of absurdity and charm.There are the now-usual Burton touches, like scary clowns and stuffed animals and startling facial effects, Large Marge, for instance. The film is a series of vignettes, like the Large Marge scene in the truck and the bikers in the desert and Mickey the convict running from the law and a very funny scene at the Alamo and Pee Wee riding a bull in a rodeo and a wild and wonderfully ridiculous chase scene through the Warner Brothers studios back lots and sound stages. It sounds banal but is very entertaining to watch.There is a great deal of subtlety in the performances and they are easily over-looked if you happen to be rolling your eyes in disbelief at the childish naivety; sometimes Pee Wee's personality gets to people and they have to express their impatience, only to be re-engaged a moment later. Roll your eyes at your peril, this is very funny stuff, and the scenes never over-stay their welcome. There isn't a boring moment in the whole thing.It even has a great ending which is the most notoriously difficult thing to write in a film script. Pee Wee gets a small role in a film about his big adventure in which he plays a hotel clerk, and it is a comic gem equal to some of Charlie Chaplin's better work. The 70s hunk, James Brolin, plays Pee Wee in the film within a film, and to see him in a Pee Wee suit with the red bow tie fighting international criminals with Morgan Fairchild is to see something wholly unique on film.Kids and adults will love this comedy.

Many seem to consider it a guilty pleasure, or stupid humor.  But it's much more than that, and the key to understanding and enjoying Pee Wee's Big Adventure is to realize that his world is simply the adult world seen through the eyes of a child.The most wonderful thing in the world when you are a kid is your bike.  It is the first thing that a young boy really treasures, as it represents freedom and the possibility of adventure.  A child learns to love his bike (or at least kids used to before video games - I think that's why the bicycle in the movie has such a retro feel), and truly believes that it is the best bike in the whole world.But Pee Wee's bike is no ordinary bike, of course, because he is an adult and adults (according to kids) should have much cooler bikes.  And so Pee Wee, who never really joined the adult world, has the most decked-out bike in the world.  And we, as an audience of children, connected with Pee Wee, because that was the kind of bike that we would have when we were grown up.And yet the bike is not the only part of this film that reflects how children think adults should live.  Pee Wee has a house full of cool toys - a fireman's pole to get from his room to the rest of his house (didn't we all want that?), a kitchen with a massive machine that actually cooks your breakfast for you (designed the way we would have designed it when we were kids), and a secret storage compartment on the side of his home that housed his wonderful bike.  Pee Wee didn't work, he didn't spend money, and if he only wanted to eat two bites of his Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes & Mr. T cereal breakfast... he could.  Because he had no parents and was therefore free of those stupid rules that your parents always seemed to place upon you.Even Pee Wee's friends are reflections of our childhood pals.  He is sorta-friends with snot-nosed Frances, even though the two do not like each other - and who amongst you never had a friend like that?  Frances seems rich, even though his father dresses like he is actually a painter - but didn't it always seem like your friends had more money than you and could get whatever they wanted, regardless of reality?  Pee Wee's best friend, Dotty, is clearly interested in him, but Pee Wee looks at her as if she has cooties - as all girls do until you enter puberty.And this is just the beginning of the film.  The loss of Pee Wee's bike sets off a sequence of events in which we get to see the world through the eyes of this child, with the innocence and insanity that the illogical mind of a child provides.  Pee Wee tries to hitchhike (that thumb!), and gets a ride with a convict that wasn't really that bad.  He tries to drive and runs off the road and over a cliff.  In one of the most famous comedy scenes of all time, he meets what we learn is the ghost of Large Marge.  He rides in a rodeo (and does really well). He runs into a gang of bikers, but they're really not that bad.  He visits the set of Warner Brothers, gets to be in a movie, and finds his beloved bike, the greatest bike in the world.  And he made friends with everyone along the way, except the 8-foot tall bully.In its own way, his bike becomes Pee Wee's gateway to adventure, the way that we all hoped our own bikes would.  No other movie has more accurately dipped into the minds of our own childhood the way Pee Wee's Big Adventure has, and for that reason it stands as a true classic.

Ah, if only he knew how prophetic those words were...But hey, I digress. I honestly can't think of a movie that I enjoy watching more than Pee-wee's Big Adventure. For my entertainment dollar, it is easily one of the best movies ever made. It's also the quintessential surreal movie a crazy, nutty, escapist romp through the circus-like dreamworld of Pee-wee Herman and company. In fact, I like this movie so much, that it compelled me to do something I've never done before, and that is, to put the movie on a tape so I can listen to it while driving.Yep, that's just what I did I recorded the entire movie onto an audiocassette tape, and I often play it while driving in my car. Believe me, it's great fun to come up to a stoplight, roll down the windows, and then crank up the volume so that people in other cars nearby can look around with utter puzzlement on their faces as they hear various crazed snippets from the movie.So, I'm driving along, listening to The Large Marge scene. The scene where he dances to Tequila by the Champs. The scene where he is in the tour group at the Alamo. The I know you are but what am I ad infinitum scene. The conversation with Dottie (I'm a loner, Dottie, a rebel). The conversation with Simone (C'mon, Simone. Let's talk about YOUR big but). The wonderful tune Burn in Hell by Twisted Sister. Plus, What makes you think the Soviets are involved? Would you like a piece of gum, Mr. Buxton? Paging Mr. Herman, Paging Mr. Herman. And on and on. Wonderful stuff! Finest form of escapism there is!For all you fellow Pee-wee fans out there, I'm sure I don't have to list all the great scenes in the movie, but believe me, they play almost just as well on audio as they do in the audio-visual form. Take my advice, make your own audiotape of the movie and listen to it while driving. You won't regret it. Like I said, it's escapism at its finest. Driving never felt so good! (But do be careful, lest you end up going around laughing like Pee-wee Herman Heh-heh! (laugh like Pee-wee.) Heh-heh!

All those words fit, especially the last one. Spielberg could not have made this, nor could Cameron. Only a truly twisted individual like Burton could have held on to Pee Wee long enough to share his world with him. The result is a unique experience. 90 minutes of craziness that is as unpredictable as Burton's career has been. Any movie that has Godzilla, Twisted Sister, the Alamo, shrunken heads, a gypsy fortune teller, Large Marge, a full-size hollow T-Rex, Amazing Larry and a ride in a railroad freight car with a singing hobo has to be seen at least once.

It's all like an old Warner Bros. cartoon that's come to life, with wild sight gags and situations, lines that are so silly and pointless that you can't help but laugh at them, melodramatic and delightful music by Danny Elfman, and characters that are so eccentric that you can't help but love them all. It's all handled so skillfully by Tim Burton, making his feature film debut as director here.Of course, you have to be in the mood for it and allow your practical, sensible mind to turn off for 90 minutes in order to enjoy the fun and humor of it all, especially if you're an adult&#x97;Burton's bizarre sense of humor won't appeal to everyone. The film's sense of humor is different from the Zucker brothers' films (AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN films)&#x97;although the actors did their comedy while keeping straight faces in those films, here the actors rely on intentionally melodramatic acting and odd facial expressions to make the weird, totally absurd humor work. And the one who relies on those behavior methods the most is the title character, Pee-Wee Herman (Paul Reubens).This type of plot may have been done many times in so many movies before (including IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934)), but the situations and characters are so otherworldly, absurd, and bizarre that I doubt that there has ever been a comedy like this one before or since. My one complaint is that the fresh, original style of the film wears thin during the middle. As Leonard Maltin so agreeably put it, Some real laughs and clever ideas as Pee Wee searches for his stolen bicycle, but not enough to sustain a feature-length film. This film would've worked better as a short film&#x97;but the film goes back on its tracks once it reaches the wildly funny climax. If the film were shorter, it could've been a masterpiece&#x97;but we'd be missing some great characters that Pee-Wee meets throughout his wild and wonderful adventure. I was never really a Herman fan, but this film has so many priceless scenes that it's definitely a keeper. To this day I've never seen such wild things in films before or since&#x97;except for the best Warner Bros. cartoons, that is. And who could not smile at the wonderful Danny Elfman score throughout the film?All in all, a film that is very hard NOT to like&#x97;especially for the young and the young in heart.

Before he struck box-office gold with Batman, he was hired as an animator at Disney. While in their employ, his sensibilities were somewhat different from theirs. His creative style was just too bizarre for them. He got the chance to make two personal films, Vincent, a six minute stop motion film about his idol Vincent Price, and a 27 minute short film Frankenweenie. Both films were canned by Disney because they were considered unsuitable for children. It looked like Burton's career was about to hit the skids.But fate had something else in store for him. The actor Paul Reubens, best known for his alter ego Pee-Wee Herman, was looking for a director to bring the character to the big screen. He saw Frankenweenie, and was impressed by the film's unique visual style. The two got together, and introduced to audiences one of the most unusual films ever made, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.For anyone unfamiliar with the character, Pee-Wee Herman is a man-child. He describes himself as a rebel, which shows in the way he dresses. He wears a suit a couple of sizes too small for him, a red bow tie, a military style haircut with a defiant quiff on the fringe, and faint make-up to accentuate his pallid features. When you think about it, Pee-Wee is an admirably proud non-conformist.He lives in a very colourful house that looks like a cross between Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson. It's filled with toys, gadgets, gimmicks and all kinds of off the wall weirdness. What seems strange to us is perfectly normal to him. He lives a simple life, is friendly with everyone, and has no intention of changing things.The one thing that matters most to him, is his bike. Some people have described it as a girl's bike on steroids, and it is definitely not like any bike I've ever seen. Pee-Wee's bike is his pride and joy, and the envy of the neighbourhood. A spoilt rich kid in town Francis (in actuality a man-child just like Pee-Wee) wants the bike. And when Pee-Wee refuses to sell it, Francis steals it.Pee-Wee goes berserk as his world falls apart. Desperate for help, he goes to a phony psychic, and she tells him the bike is at the Alamo, in the basement. Pee-Wee goes off on a road trip across America to find his beloved bike.I'm not afraid to admit this, I have never seen a film quite like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. It's no surprise Tim Burton quickly established himself as one of the most visually striking filmmakers in the business. The film is a visual treat, with bright pastel colours, surreal settings and a breathtaking palette of America. If you watch the film enough times, you will realise it is actually a very sly satire on suburban conformity. A theme that Burton would explore again in Edward Scissorhands.Whether or not you take to Pee-Wee himself is really a matter of individual taste. His nasal voice and petulant antics can be wearisome at times, and then there are times when you can't help liking him. His child-like enthusiasm can be very infectious, so I think a lot of people would grow to like him.I also love road movies, and this definitely counts as one of my favourites. Typically, he will meet a lot of quirky characters along the way, including an escaped convict, a phantom truck driver, a lonely waitress, an Alamo tour guide, a biker gang, and finally, in one of the most inventive climaxes ever put on celluloid, a mad dash across Warner Bros studios.Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is certainly a consistently inventive film. Tim Burton often finds new ways to keep surprising you, such as Large Marge showing her true face, Pee-Wee's Tequila dance, some very surreal dream sequences, a fantastically sustained sight gag at a burning pet shop, and causing chaos at Warner Bros only for them to buy the rights to his story. The Hollywood version of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is a blast, and really has to be seen to be believed.The quirky tone of the film is helped no end by the edgy, whimsical musical score by Danny Elfman, making his feature film debut too, and marking the first of what would become a lifelong collaboration with Tim Burton. The music is just incredible, that helps the film sprint along at a cracking pace.A huge surprise to everyone, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was a huge success, and became one of the sleeper hits of the 1980's. Tim Burton started off his trend of casting outsiders or misfits as the hero of the piece with this film, and Pee-Wee Herman certainly qualifies. The idea may sound off the wall, but if you just give the film a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised, and a little charmed too.

It's still as funny today and when I first watched it long ago. I'm still as obsessed about this movie today as I was about it then. I practically got all the lines memorized.What is amazing about the movie is the star himself, Paul Reubens. As a kid I actually believed there was a person named Pee-wee Herman. When you watch him, you don't see an actor playing the character of Pee-wee, you actually believe he is Pee-wee.After watching the movie again, I was so surprised to see that Danny Elfman did the score for this film. It's pretty obvious. It's reminiscent of the music for the Simpsons. Danny Elfman's score was amazing! The music so fit the type of character that Pee-wee is. The music is manic and crazy just like Pee-wee.I was also surprised to see that Tim Burton directed this film and that it was his first directorial debut. I love his use of colours in the film. It made the whole movie seem like a cartoon, a lunatic's version of a sideshow.One of my favourite scenes is the Mr. Breakfast scene. Here we see that Pee-wee is a demented fellow, possibly with a history of mental illness. He talks to his pancake breakfast (Mr. Breakfast) and he eats Mr. T cereal. I loved his imitation of Mr. T's voice. We see him using oversized cutlery and toothbrushes and he has a scotch tape fetish which he uses to mold his face into bizarre contortions.Then when he embarks on his Big Adventure, and meets all those crazy people (like Mickey the escaped convict, Simone the waitress, the hobo, the Satan's Helpers), you actually begin to see that he is actually pretty normal compared to them and that is where the humour lies.This movie had plenty of visual gags and many cool catchphrases by Pee-wee himself. Also, if you were a child in the Eighties, you'll understand all the 80's stuff (like radical, BMX bikes, Mr. T cereal, Twisted Sister).All in all, it's a great movie and really funny.

Paul Reubens) was mostly familiar to American audiences via his MTV appearances, inserted gamely as a stunt comedian between segments, or as a guest on David Letterman's show. Certainly few people believed an entire movie headlined by Pee-wee Herman would take off (indeed, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert didn't even review the movie during its theatrical run; Siskel later put it on his Worst of '85 list). Luckily for Reubens, green but imaginative short subjects filmmaker Tim Burton was assigned to direct, and the picture does indeed fly despite some fundamental problems. The plot--Herman's prized bicycle is stolen by his nemesis, sending him across several states to reclaim it--doesn't really matter because so much of the extraneous detail is effervescent enough to completely captivate an audience. However, Burton plods a bit through some episodes, and he isn't helped by the editing, which feels blunt or choppy; he also drops the ball with about 10 minutes left on the clock, finishing the film rather conventionally. Still, Pee-wee isn't tarnished by the picture's faults; in a natty gray suit and red bow-tie, his hair in a '50s-style crew cut, Herman is a grown-up child living in his own world, and not above an occasional outburst or getting into mischief. He's funny and foolish--and scarily appealing. *** from **** "}{"Title":"Well, I liked it as a kid","Date":"2 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Tim Burton's directorial movie debut is a film for acquired tastes. I remember seeing it on television when I was around 5 years old in the 1980s and thinking it was very funny; time hasn't been kind to it since then, however. Pee-wee Herman feels like an American version of Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, although nowhere near as funny.Indeed, Paul Reubens gives such an over-the-top performance of constant mannerisms and tics - not to mention THAT laugh - that he becomes irritating after about, oh I don't know, five minutes. The resultant film, which follows a journey narrative as he goes on a nationwide hunt for his stolen bicycle, is therefore tiresome. For most of the running time I kept thinking about the various run-ins with the law that Reubens has had since, and for some reason I found THAT funnier than the supposed humour here.PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE isn't a complete mess. Burton's direction feels assured and confident even at this early stage of his career and he certainly puts in a lot more effort here than he did in something like the CGI monstrosity that was ALICE IN WONDERLAND. There are also a handful of funny moments along the way, like the bar dance, although my favourite moment is the excellent homage to the Japanese Godzilla series. A shame the rest of the movie couldn't have followed suit.

Reuben appears to have great comedic sense/timing, Burton whips the second string cast into decent shape, and Burton's general skills in directing set design, choosing shots, setting theatrical tone, and (no doubt) his contribution to the final edit make the flick actually work. In spite of it being a bizarre, cubistic picaresquerie, the story continually rewards your investment of time and attention.But, of course, it's not a great movie. At heart, it's a string of comic bits which range in quality from watchable to classic. The premise isn't that someone stole Pee-Wee's bike; it's that Pee-Wee woke up in the morning. Hence, something fundamentally milkable for comic value was bound to ensue, regardless.I loved this flick, as I also loved P-W's Playhouse, back in the day. The man was absolutely ON FIRE as Pee-Wee, and I hope his legacy is appreciated as a significant part of American pop culture history.The Big Adventure is a not-half-bad encapsulation of the wonder of Pee- Wee. "},{"Title":"That laugh gets in your head","Date":"21 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" That laugh is contagious, in fact even when this guy is just generally doing something basic he makes a little laugh come out. I am of course talking about Pee-wee Herman, a man who wears a suit, rides a tricked out bike and just generally talks like an 8 year old kid. The movie is all about his beloved bike which is stolen, Pee- wee is devastated, in fact so much so that he faints in the local bike shop. We then follow Pee-wee as he travels far to find his bicycle and over that time he gets into many situations and meets some crazy characters. OK this movie is funny, in fact some scenes are actually really funny and you can't help but find most things Pee-wee does pretty humorous. The movie is though no masterpiece and can be not so funny at times, it is good don't get me wrong but not as good as I have seen some claim this to be. If you take away its cult status then you get a good and very welcome entry into the world of directing from Tim Burton who makes this even funnier than it probably should have been, his odd style actually improves this to an extent that Pee-wee seems crazy and yet so does everybody else. Phil Hartman, Paul Reubens and Michael Varhol create a screenplay that is pretty nicely done for the movie and although most laughs really are generated from the physical side of Pee-wee, it still is very nicely written.One of the writers Paul Reubens is of course Pee-wee himself and creates an extremely memorable character who is likable albeit his kind of annoying personality. Reubens recreates his character for the big screen and brings a kind of person who can make both children and adults laugh. I think one big thing about this is really the fact that adults can enjoy this too, I said about Reubens making it funny but also the way in which the jokes are done are in a way in which all ages can laugh and I feel Burton was really the one who made that work.This movie is as I said before not the very best when it comes to comedy though, some jokes fall a little flat and the movie by the end can feel like a crazy ride where you can't quite remember some of the jokes on show. I did however enjoy the story and that is another thing which makes this a good movie and one that is likable, you don't just have the comedy stuffed in there, but genuinely an interesting story about a guy who loves his bike so much he has to travel far and wide to find it.So overall a recommendable movie and one you could easily watch again one day, it's nice and snappy and at a running time of 90 minutes it doesn't' feel like a slog in anyway. Tim Burton may be remembered for a long time in the future for making his Gothic and very dark films that although are mostly humorous, they never feel like this one, it isn't exactly dark and is a very basic story, never goes over the top and just feels nice, a good little watch for anyone of any age.

I must say there is no logic, no real development of any theme at all, except absurdity and tomfoolery, maybe some masquerade and charade in shambles. And it is funny just because it is absurd.But really what's left at the end of it, will you ask or shouldn't I say shall you ask? Life us absurd. We knew that. Crooks end up in prison. Let me doubt that one. Love is number one human interest. Ah Ah maybe in Hollywood but is it for real in life? Let me be dubitative, or is it doubtful I should say? Some physical episode maybe but Pee-Wee loves his dog and his bike more than anything and anyone else. Love is mental not physical like they pretend in Hollywood. The film then is some good exercise of a rookie director who is learning his job and tries to make teenagers and children laugh. A dinosaur in your cup of tea is always funny and a few snakes in your hands will make any infant laugh like hell. Or be frightened to high heavens.Some will say we have all the magic of Tim Burton in this old film. I don't think so. Tim Burton's art is not in this twisted absurd story but in the spirituality he will often reach beyond the surface of things. And here the spirituality is rather light and the surface is rarely pushed aside to get something more empathetic and sweetly cultural.The only moment I see something deeper is when he makes fun of Hollywood. That is both deserved and justified. Hollywood has to put some flesh on this absurd skeleton of a story and that flesh is a couple of kiss, a lascivious girl friend and some hot steam we can imagine in the background, though we know better and the pee-wee actor and his girl friend actress are only making out for the screen and in real life they may hate each other, the man may prefer men and the woman may prefer women. Make believe and nothing else. But the real Pee Wee is just the same. Make believe and nothing else. Well, I guess the first steps of Tim Burton were not yet very brilliant as for the mental side of things. I guess he could not go lower and he was bound to improve.

But it does have the elaborate inventions he is sometimes associated with. Reubens and Phil Hartman wrote in the script that a machine makes breakfast, but it was Burton's crew that really made it something memorable. (Reubens was the one who hand-picked Burton, narrowing the choice down from 100 options. He actually went against the studio's choice, who remains nameless.)But not only did this film launch Burton's wildly successful career, it also launched the career of Danny Elfman. Elfman had already been in music as part of Oingo Boingo, but had not yet transitioned to composing. After this film, he never looked back and is now among the most successful in the business. Besides his work with Burton, he is now known for the Simpsons theme, which is probably one of the best-known songs throughout the world. (As of 2014, he has four Oscar nominations but zero wins. Come on, Academy!) Heck, this film even launched the career of E. G. Daily, who plays Pee-Wee's sort-of girlfriend. She is now better known for Rugrats and Powerpuff Girls, among others. This was also the same year she signed a recording contract. (She was later married to Rick Salomon, a man known for his relationships with Paris Hilton, Shannon Doherty and Pam Anderson.) The DVD commentary is very insightful, and we learn a bit more about Reubens and Hartman's background in the Groundlings, and how Pee-Wee sort of developed out of his rejection from Saturday Night Live. In retrospect, it may have been the best rejection he could ever have wanted.

This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and it never gets old. I first saw this movie on VHS as a kid and certain scenes scared me as a kid which were the Large Marge scene and the clown dream sequence, I remember I would always turn my head during those scenes because they freaked me out. I did still enjoy the movie though and would watch it a lot, because those scenes didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie.I still enjoy watching this movie even today and appreciate more now than I did then. Those certain scenes though don't scare me as much as they used to, but they are still creepy, the Large Marge scene though kind of makes me laugh now because of how random it is, and how you don't expect it when watching it for the first time. Anyway, there are a lot of things I love about this movie too.First off, this movie is hilarious! yeah, most of the dialogue is silly, but it's Pee-Wee Herman, and his style of humor. This movie has a lot of funny quotes that are very memorable (I know you are, but what am I.), and a lot of memorable scenes, it's hard for me to really pick a favorite. Another thing I love is the score by Danny Elfman, I believe this is Tim Burton's first collaboration with Elfman on the score, but it's a great score.My only complaint in this movie is really a silly nitpick which is when Pee-Wee only takes two bites of cereal after that breakfast making invention, or whatever it's called, makes him all of that breakfast which looked really good, by the way.Overall, this is a hilarious and enjoyable movie with some silly, yet memorable moments. I highly recommend this movie to fans of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, which this movie inspired, it's a very fun and entertaining movie.

Watching it again after many years it's interesting to see bits and pieces of pure Burton scattered throughout - the dream sequence with clown medics, for instance - but it's actually quite a flatly directed movie that can't sustain the comic invention it sporadically displays.The first scene, in which Pee-wee wakes up and gets ready to start his day, is absolutely hilarious; my favourite part is when he sits down to eat the fried breakfast prepared by a complicated automated process, pours a mountain of Mr. T cereal on top, eats a mouthful with a giant fork and heads out. The way he crunches that cereal had me on the floor! I had high hopes for the rest of the movie, which I remembered being absolutely bananas. The rest of it isn't as good as that opening. It's a fun film but it isn't particularly funny; enjoyable but a wee bit dull, possibly because it doesn't add up to much, being an episodic collection of silliness that doesn't always quite come off. Pee-wee is certainly an original character, by turns creepy, childlike, hilarious and cruel, and Reubens is certainly committed to his creation (leading to a TV series and an inferior sequel). The chase through the studio backlot is an obvious highlight, as is the movie within a movie with James Brolin starring as Pee-wee! But I couldn't shake the feeling that all this needed to be so much weirder and visually less based in the real world. Whether this was the studio hedging their bets or a restriction of the budget I don't know, but it does feel like a movie that never quite bursts open the way it should.

For instance, in one scene Pee-wee finds himself abandoned in the middle-of-no-where only to be picked up by a creepy trucker. This trucker, inconsiderate of hitch-hiking etiquette, finds it necessary to immediately terrorize Pee- wee with a creepy story.

Forget everything you learned about Reubens and Pee-Wee before you watch this. Pee-Wee Herman as a character is bold and bright and childish, a concept which can be incredibly jarring for the viewer if they are unfamiliar with the character. If you're like me, your only experience with Pee-Wee is through modern American shows that give throwaway references to Reubens or the Playhouse. I feel that the reason it's so jarring is because he portrays his role brilliantly. It's possibly quite difficult for anyone without prior knowledge of Pee-Wee Herman's theatre and television history to reconcile the idea of a sincere manchild with themselves. Which is, of course, a true shame.The film itself is lots of fun, with a simple plot that rarely branches off. Manchild loses bike. Manchild tries desperately to retrieve bike. Hilarity ensues. It's such a simple formula. The only problem I really had with it was time. I know that most studios don't like their kids' movies being too long so much of what gets filmed ends up on the cutting room floor. In the case of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, it feels almost as though the big part is overstating it a bit, especially since the final part seems a bit rushed after the racing climax. Since I don't want to give too much away and I want no spoilers in my review, I can't actually say much, but I will say this. Despite the end- of-movie flaws, its familiar humour and charming simplicity will have young and old alike laughing and smiling. Just as long as you can allow yourself to become attached to Pee-Wee Herman. Sure he seems a bit difficult at first but forget your alarm - you'll find, as I have, that Pee-Wee is simply adorable, possibly something like you remember your early years, no matter what age you are now. "}{"Title":"It's just something you have to experience","Date":"18 March 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" There's a kind of comedy that cinema has been lacking since the silent era, the style of such legends as Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. Pee-wee Herman is one of the few comparable figures we have in modern times. It's not the slapstick and sight gags that he has in common with the silent comics, although there is a fair bit of that in Big Adventure. No, what really makes Pee-wee a great comedy figure is that his comedy is driven by his character. Like Chaplin, Lloyd and Buster Keaton, Paul Reubens developed his persona (Pee Wee Herman) and the stories sprang from that character's potential.At the time of Big Adventure's release, many in the audience would be familiar with the character from the popular Pee-wee Herman Show. The opening moments of the movie however introduce Pee-wee and his brand of humour, his childlike playfulness his Heath Robinson-esque inventiveness. And like Chaplin before him Pee Wee is constantly interacting with his environment, exploring it, making bizarre gags out of everyday objects. The comedy in Pee-wee's Big Adventure takes many forms &#x96; wordplay, cheeky satire, crazy leaps of logic &#x96; but it all stems simply from the Pee-wee character's encounters with one road-movie cliché after another. It's the mixture of familiar situations and the oddball tangents with which Pee-wee enters them that keep the laughs coming.Pee-wee's Big Adventure is also noted for being the feature debut of Tim Burton. Although this is very much Pee-wee's movie, the distinctive cult director still lays his now-familiar print upon it. Even then Burton was clearly getting himself heavily involved in the production design and cinematography, and he has this uncanny knack for making normal things look strange and baroque. He uses an odd mix of bright colours and the kind of high-contrast lighting more often scene in black and white. He throws in the occasional odd angle to heighten things further, but normally his crowded shot compositions and the pure weirdness of the sets themselves is enough. A great Burton moment is when Pee-wee realises his bike has been stolen, with the once innocent-looking mechanical clown now appearing nasty and mocking. I would say that Burton even allows the sets and props to overshadow Pee-wee, but nothing could really do that. As it is, Burton's visual creativity provides a nice counter-balance for the hero, stopping him becoming too wearing on the audience.Pee-wee's Big Adventure is certainly hilarious from start to finish, but a great comedy picture should be more than that. The movie also provides a well-rounded story, and that gives the audience a sense of satisfaction. On his journey Pee-wee seems to spread a little joy and goodness to everyone he meets, and this is important because it makes him a proper hero rather than just a funny man. This, again, is something the great comics of old did when they graduated to full-length movies &#x96; made their characters into heroes without losing the laughter. It's a shame their aren't many like Pee-wee around these days, but at least we have his masterpiece, his Big Adventure.

He is well supported by a great cast, including Elizabeth Daily. The film looks great as well, with great locations and cinematography and Danny Elfman's score is brilliant. Tim Burton directs wonderfully too, and the script is very funny while the story is charming and has plenty of fun moments(too many to list actually) and the film moves briskly with very few dull moments.

From the very first scenes this had me laughing out loud and me doing so for the remaining film. Paul Reubens is utterly brilliant as the kooky and sometimes child like Pee-Wee, who provides some brilliant laughs often just through altering his voice. There are some fantastic scenes dressing up to evade the cops with Micky the con the onslaught of people with various types of bikes after his is stolen the Alamo tour Pee-Wee acting in the film version of his life and when Pee-Wee asks the bikers to be quiet as he's on the phone.They are just a few of the wonderful moments the film contains, one that also shows the amazing visual style of Tim Burton that we have come to love and that this was his first full feature is wonderful. The film contains great cinematic references and though it does drag slightly towards the end it is a rare treat to see a film that entertains so fully from start to finish. It is difficult not to fall for Pee-Wee, he is a wonderful character, an oddball but his character never veers towards something too strange otherwise you'd have a whole different story.Full of silly, absurd and almost surreal ideas, there are also some great animated scenes the two white eyes among the blackness broken when Pee-Wee puts on his light beam goggles and the nightmare of the dinosaur eating his bike, these are more reasons to put this film high up there with the best.Deserves several viewings and gives the desire to revisit some of Burton's other greats like Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com "},{"Title":"Tim Burton, you've done it again","Date":"26 March 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" This is a very good movie.

Two main reasons1)I had pretty much been disowned by practically all of my friends and 2)I was thirteen and couldn't drive yet. That may sound depressing,but it was just reality to me back then. I bring this up because this was one of about four movies I saw back then(by contrastI see,on average,twenty-five movies in theater per year and have done better than twenty per ano since 1991),and because of that sparsity of filmgoing,each film had a more special feel to it.EArlier that summer,I saw a film that meant a lot to me, BAck to the Future. And while those memories of that great film gave that experience a gilded feel to it,this movie was a lot of fun,too.Expanded upon the hugely popular exploits of Actor/Comedian Paul Reubens' stage show and HBO TV Special(first aired in 1982),this movie is at once,both preposterous and yet so right. THe tale of a overgrown man-child's search for his beloved bicycle that will take him practically across the country. That's it. And filled out--besides by Reubens,who co-wrote this with the late PHil HArtman--by a cast of hearty but somewhat obscure actors such as Elizabeth Daily(as Pee Wee's long-suffering girlfriend),Diane SAlinger,Mark Holton,JUdd Owen and Alice Nunn and directed by then-unknown Tim BUrton,this movie is so gleefully pure and memorable that one would have to have a truly low sense of frivolity or fun to not get enjoyment out of it.I suspect I may've come away still remembering fondly this film EVEN IF it weren't from a period of time when the movies I saw were so few and far between,during such a formative part of my young life. HAving seen this at least once since(though I could stand for another viewing about now),I think I can say safely that it's still a greatly appreciated film offering.

I'm not the greatest fan of his work ( I very much like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood but I'm not one of those many college students that goes epileptic when they talk about his grandiose palette of colors ) but I've got to say that Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is an astonishing debut. Pee-Wee Hermann gives a brilliant, unforgettable performance ( even if he sounds like the turtle in the Sly video games ! ). Danny Elfman wrote a flabbergasting score for this one ( if alive and well Tchaikovski would probably have adored it ). I'm sure the top executives at Warner Brothers scratched their heads wondering how to market this movie, and were it not for the subsequent success of Burton it probably would have been buried by now, so I'll suffer any Mars Attack ! they release and just watch Pee-Wee again to console me.

The writing, production design, music score and photography work together successfully in a zany and whimsical way. Tim Burton decided to go for a colorful and playful story and main character, instead of his trademark dark style, in this, his first film. The story, set in 1985, is simply, Pee Wee's beloved 1950's style cruiser bicycle is stolen and he is out to recover it no matter what. Some 1980's TV drama and comedy stars and Milton Berle make cameos in the film. Some may not like the boy-man character of Pee Wee Herman (Paul Ruebens). His character is basically the mind of a child in an adult body. I found his character to be likable, charming and funny. To balance the zany and playful humor of the story and main character,there are some dark humor moments in the film. I'm guessing this is Tim Burton's influence on the story. The production design and cinematography are impressive. Tim Burton's uniquely imaginative visual style is on display here. Paul Ruebens is one of three screenwriters for the film.

Its a live action cartoon with no pretense of being anything other than pure, silly entertainment.The plot (which exists only to set up the gags) involves childlike adult Pee Wee Herman (played hilariously by Paul Reubens) who lives in perpetual boyhood, surrounded by toys and games. His most prized possession is his super rigged-up bicycle. When his precious bike is stolen, Pee Wee becomes obsessed with finding it. When he is falsely directed to search for it at the Alamo in Texas, the scene is set for a wonderful parody of road movies.Pee Wee travels across country, meeting bizarre friends, foes and even a ghost. Nothing will deter him from finding his bike. The chaotic finale at the movie studio is probably the weakest part of the movie, but getting there is the real fun.Burton managed to give a genuine charm to this antic film, and Reubens is genuinely likable as the childlike Pee Wee. He just wants to live his Peter Pan life without the problems that plague most of us adults. I can empathize with him. Can't everyone? "},{"Title":"Discovered at last! The Missing Link, the Bridge between Live Action and the Animated Cartoon, Proved by the tell-tale Funny Bone!","Date":"27 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Erupting onto the Movie Screen, rendering a seemingly serious scene into a laugh riot! That is how this PEE WEE's BIG ADVENTURE(1985)opens up. The strong, action-filled, lively opening has been a hallmark of all of Paul Reubens' PEE-WEE projects had in common. The sheer manic, high energy, rapid movement of the character demands proper handling. This was one point that David Letterman recognized and Pee-wee's appearances on either Dave's NBC Late Night Show or his CBS Late Show were conducted with that in mind. Hence, Dave would introduce Paul, he would devote all of the available time to the presentation of his Pee-wee Act and when all of the crazy schtick was disposed of,and what ever Film, Television Show or Personal Appearance was plugged, Pee-wee would say good night. Reubens can do just about anything as Pee-wee, except sit still.When Joan Rivers had her last late night's show, she had Mr. Reubens as a guest, Paul having also guested on Joan's first show of that series. Well, after he was brought out and did the old Pee-wee Act, he just moved down the couch, a la Jack Parr/Johnny Carson's Tonight Show Style. After a short while, it was apparent that the lack of center stage activity was as painful on Pee-wee as it was for one watching it.Anyhow, after a high energy, curve ball of an opening sequence, we're given a fast lesson of what it's like to be a man child. Morning toilet time is shown (by the way, that means bathing & grooming, not defecating-look it up, Buster). Preparing breakfast cereal and feeding his little Dog is featured. It's when on a trip to the local pet store, for the purpose of purchasing some more Gold Fish, and his own Super Customized 1950's Style Retro Bicycle is stolen, that the story really takes off.An interesting confrontation with the neighborhood Spoiled Rich Kid, Francis(Mark Bolton)just adds fuel to an already existing feud. Francis is the Prime Suspect, but his 'Butler'(Pro Wrestler, the Late Professor Toru Tanaka) greets Pee-wee at the door with Francis is having his Bath!, to which Pee-wee replies in his falsetto high pitched voice, Where're they hosing him down!(my own personal favourite gag line in the movie!)A cross country odyssey follows as info about the missing Bike is fervently followed up. The meandering journey takes them to the Southwestern Dessert country and to the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. He crosses the path of escaped convicts and Motorcycle Gangs. Quick thinking, Tequila and 'Big Shoe Dancing', saves the day once(another favourite gag! See the movie!)The team of Reubens(Pee-wee), Director Tim Burton(Batman 1989), and writers Michael Varhol, Reubens and the Late Phil Hartman, provide the proper situations to fit this character. There are some very well made and character appropriate sets. Pee-wee's home makes it look as if he lives in the Toy Department at one of our finest,old downtown department stores.All of the action is underscored by the original musical score, courtesy of Danny Elfman(Batman,Batman Returns,Spiderman,etc.) This turns the film into a feast for the senses, especially the funny bone!The effect of the World we have entered in here is to bring us something that has been little in evidence in recent years. That is comic figures that are just that, comic all the way. We had their likes in bountiful supply in the days of some guys with names like Sennett, Roach, Chaplin, Turpin, Arbuckle, Keaton, Langdon, Lloyd, Semon,Laurel & Hardy, etc.One last comparison that has been made to Pee-wee's world is to that of the Animated Cartoon. There seems to be plenty of evidence here as his behaviour is closer to Bugs Bunny & Company than to the Bob Hopes, Jack Bennys or Rodney Dangerfields of the World.And by the way, I didn't forget about Paul Reubens' troubles with the law. Well, here's wishing,hoping and praying all of that business is behind him.

It has been suggested that if Mr. Herman had been Kunta Kinte in Roots it would have been more of a commercial success as would have The Terminator series if Arnold Schwarzenegger would have relinquished his role to Mr. Herman.But, back to the movie, purportedly based on actual events Mr. Herman's true love is taken from a small strip mall in southern California. Heartbroken and confused Mr. Herman prepares to meticulously search to the four corners of the earth, even to the Alamo to bring his beloved back home. Bravely encountering numerous dangers including biker gangs, ghouls, escaped convicts, and a French speaking waitress, Mr. Herman's devotion gives him strength to overcome all odds and fight through all the injustices that mankind has to offer.An inspiring movie that has found a place in military training bases, motivational seminars and mental health institutions, all movie goers owe themselves this delightful treat. There also seems to be a grassroots effort in Texas to make this the Texas state movie, however Oklahoma with the same desire to claim this as their state movie has claimed that the Alamo was actually in the Oklahoma panhandle and that Texas hooligans moved it during the dust bowl.

With a great musical score, a superb acting performance by Paul Reubens, and a nice script full of wacky characters and even more wacky situations, this became the surprise hit of 1985. Adding to the magic of the film is then-rookie director Tim Burton, whose unique talent, out-of-the-ordinary imagination and directing style added to the quality of this colorful movie. If you are in the mood for silly comedy, this is the perfect film. Actually, it sounds like one of those things that is so much better when you are drunk. So it is lacking in sense and coherence but honestly, who cares? This is Pee-Wee Herman for crying out loud, what else are you going to expect? This is as close as you will get to watching a non-animated cartoon.Meshing plenty of physical comedy with clever one-liners, excellent comic timing, unexpected surprises, dark humor, double meanings, and even cheap shots at other genres of film-making, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure has a bit of everything for the entire family. To add to that, there is a bit of horror and action as well, and a fun musical sequence involving a tough gang of rebels. Quite the accomplishment for a film that doesn't surpass 95 minutes, and that can be traced back to the writing (and eventually Burton himself). Written by Phil Hartman (Saturday Night Live, the annoying neighbor in a personal favorite of mine, Jingle All The Way), Michael Varhol, and Pee-Wee himself, the talented staff behind the script and storyboard packed in plenty of content from start to finish to make sure the film never runs dry at any moment. Even whenever the jokes aren't there, Tim Burton throws in his two cents to the work, by creating visually appealing, yet creepy nightmares from time to time. Burton was at his best with sight gags here, as there are some hilarious moments that did not require a single word of dialogue.To separate your comedy from everyone else's, you need to have excellent pacing. This film's strongest point comes in its pacing. Within the first 10 minutes, the viewer already knows why Pee-Wee loves his bike so much, why he's well-liked amongst the townspeople, and why he wouldn't live in the real world of today. Before you are even a third into the film, he already has you almost on the ground laughing, and he would have already been far in his quest to recover his bike. Oh yea, the plot, well, I just revealed it. Basically, Pee-Wee escapes the safe haven of his town to recover his bike, which was stolen and was then taken to who-knows-where. Along the way, he will save animals, encounter ghosts, remember the Alamo, and also even engage in conversation with a fugitive. That's just a little sample of what he experiences, because believe it or not, he does a lot. There is only build-up in the first ten minutes, after that the jokes come flying at you and for the most part, they hit.Will Pee-Wee annoy you? Of course he will; Pee-Wee would get massacred in the real world if he were caught riding his bike laughing the way he does. But, as much as you are sometimes annoyed, you are also just as engaged in the film. Paul Reubens is superb as Pee-Wee, it is not easy smiling all the time and having a corny laugh and sounding like you just inhaled a tank full of helium. Reubens is like a campy Jim Carrey, willing to embarrass himself to the extremes just to locate some laughs&#151;of course the only difference is that Carrey would injure himself severely to get people laughing. He runs this film, but all the small roles throughout the movie helps a lot indeed. What actually is a rarity in movies nowadays is the fact that the biggest laughs really don't come until the final portion of the film, as if Reubens and the rest were saving their best moments for last. The ending should also leave pretty much everyone satisfied, as it strongly affirms the belief that there should always be a sense of closure in the film, the ending needs to be just as strong as the beginning.Bottom Line Forget what you all think, I totally enjoyed Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. So it isn't Oscar-worthy nor should it be mentioned in the same sentence as the great films past and present, but it remains one of the funnier silly films to ever come out. Why Burton stays away from these kinds of films now is beyond me, because this movie put him on the map and this one is among his better works. The writing wasn't amazingly clever but still gave plenty of content to keep you laughing, the acting wasn't Godly but remains funny, and even Burton seemed like he wasn't trying too hard but it nonetheless worked. Whether its Pee-Wee dancing to a classic oldies tune, delivering one of many awesome one-liners, being chased in the Warner Brothers studio lot, or even eating some Mr. T cereal, this film should have something for everybody. Otherwise, you do not have a sense of humor. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure grab some friends, grab some Tequila, and enjoy.10/10 "},{"Title":"makes you feel like a child all over again","Date":"19 April 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" I have to admit that I don't know too much about Pee-wee Herman outside from his real-life mishaps, so this is pretty much my only exposure to him.

This a great movie; the kids and I have seen this about 15 times altogether. Big Top Pee Wee is interesting because it's so different and not as good as this one.

Cameo Phil Hartman.Hahaha...this movie is so stupid, yet so clever. It's a pretty mild comedy about a man child named Pee-Wee Herman (Reubens) that has his bike stolen one day when out. At first, he suspects his other man child nemesis Francis (Holton), but he convinces Pee-Wee that he didn't. Francis actually did have a friend steal the bike, but he feels so under pressure that he tells him to just get rid of it somewhere. To make the plot thicken, Pee-Wee goes to a psychic and she tells him that his bike is in the basement of the Alamo, so off Pee-Wee goes. This movie doesn't seem like it would be very good, but it came out quite well. Paul plays Pee-Wee without ever going out of character and has his role mastered completely. The writing on it is really so stupid, that you can't help from laughing with a great script co-written by Paul Reubens and Phil Hartman (RIP). The direction, from a young Tim Burton, is very stylish and easily recognized as one of Tim's movies. It has weird moments with claymation mixed in to real life, like many of Tim's older films, and it has those Burton-y disfigured dream sequences. Danny Elfman does the score, and it is really excellent. It fits the movie so well. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy silly family comedies. ***Next year Pee-Wee would have a playhouse in his hit children's show.My rating 3/4.

My sister and I have been quoting this movie since we were little. I can't tell you how much this movie has impacted my life- it teaches viewers to pursue their dreams and to stand up to opposition (Frances), no matter how frivolous those dreams seem to others. The character Pee Wee has passion AND compassion for others (reference to Dottie, Simone, and the pet shop scene). Pee Wee is innocently fun loving and adventurously joyous, yet still the actor Paul Reubens is judged for his alleged crimes in Sarasota. This film and the crimes allegedly charged against the actor need to be distinguished- in my opinion, the plot of this movie is discordantly paradoxical to modern video games which evolve around hurting others. BRAVO to Paul Reubens and Tim Burton- this film is a classic in my book and, one day, I will show it to my children.

The character of Pee-Wee Herman is fantastic and entertaining no matter what your age. Children love Pee-Wee because of his child-like life and behavior, adults love him because for an hour and a half you remember what it's like to be young again, as cliché as that may sound. Me, maybe it's because I still remember the days of Pee-Wee's Playhouse on TV, or it might just be because I love being a kid again. That's the power this film has. If you just give it a chance you will love it.Some may try to pass it off as being just a kids movie. Most of the humor is directed at children obviously, but there are many jokes and references for people that have been around a little longer, too. For example, Pee-Wee getting Texans to all clap in sync and sing Deep in The Heart of Texas when on the pay phone, or after he rides the bull and finally comes to. The cowboys ask him if he remembers anything and Pee-Wee's classic reply, I remember the Alamo.The goofy story line is just that, goofy. It may seem stupid, but when you are a kid your bike is quite possibly your most important possession, and everyone wants their bike to be the best. Like I said earlier, by watching this film you are letting yourself become a care-free child again, no matter what your age.The movie contains heaps of memorable scenes. Some of my favorites include Pee-Wee's trip to the Madame Ruby the fortune teller, his confrontation of Francis in the giant bathtub and of course his last request of dancing to Tequilla in the Satan's Helpers biker bar.I'm a grown man who loves Pee-Wee Herman and I'm not afraid to admit that.

I just watched the DVD with commentary by Tim Burton, who mentions it was made on a low budget, and I believe it was Burton's first full-length movie.

The bizarre, utterly infectious characterization represents a truly unique and captivating persona (though for some sad people, he is the definition of the word annoying...)  The film centers on Herman's obsessive love of his bicycle, a decked out, souped up dreamcycle which is coveted by his rotund enemy Francis.  When the bike is stolen, Herman sets out on the title adventure to retrieve it, running across a myriad of odd, often hilarious, people and situations culminating in a large scale chase through the Warner Brothers studio lot.  From the moment Herman wakes up in his eye-popping house with it's unforgettable kitchen, it's clear that this will be no ordinary movie (the first feature directed by Burton.)  Herman flawlessly displays the never-ending childlike fun and innocence of his character, yet includes a sarcastic, knowing quality which makes him clever and even more unusual.  Because Reubens as Herman is so completely immersed in the character and presents a world of his own, the audience accepts the string of inanities and comic situations with glee.  Even if a certain episode happens to be less enjoyable, they all go by so swiftly that the pain is over rather quickly.  Burton infuses the film with wondrous set decor, color and camerawork and is aided greatly by a tremendous Danny Elfman score.  A galaxy of inspired character actors help move the tale along (a tale that is smartly trimmed of most of its fat, as evidenced in the less amusing deleted scenes on the DVD.)  Omen, as a furrowed prison escapee, Nunn as a doomed truck driver and Hooks as an insipid tour guide give highly memorable performances.  There's even a delightfully ragged little dog named Speck (his unfortunate, dotted coat couldn't earn him the name Spot?)  The film is chock full of kooky, simple humor paired with sly parody and witty repartee.  Children and adults alike find many lines to quote and many moments to recall.  One of the most remembered scenes involves Herman doing a dance to the old song Tequila in a biker bar.  The campiest joke of all occurs when the adventure is spun into a film within a film and Herman finds himself cast as an extra in his own story, only to be replaced by James Brolin as the lead!  He, along with Morgan Fairchild as his leading lady, provides the perfectly silly payoff to this wondrously one of a kind film.  This was spun off into the highly praised children's show Pee wee's Playhouse.  Avoid the horrendous sequel Big Top Pee wee as it doesn't begin to capture the magic of this first film.

Perhaps I'm saying this because I do have a significant bias towards Burton's works, and I think he's one of the best visual directors around today, but I think under anyone else's direction, this would have been a film swept away with '80's nostalgia and left there.This film is so visually intriguing it still works well for me today.Pee-Wee Herman.  The name alone brings up several images and associations to various points in his career.  But this was one of the finer ones.  Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is a thoroughly enjoyable trip into Burton's surreal Americana, that does what Burton does best Promote weird as normal and normal as weird.  You can buy into the fact that a grown man acts like a little kid and has a super-bike that can easily compete with any James Bond vehicle.  The search for the bike is where the fun is, as Pee-Wee meets everyone from homeless people, to truck-stop brutes to the ever unforgettable Large Marge (a scene which emotionally scarred and amused me all at the same time).  And the Alamo's basement is about as ludicrous as one can get, but that kind of attitude is what makes this film so darn enjoyable.  (I've yet to find that basement myself, nor any tour guide that speaks like Jan Hooks).  The best thing to compare this film to is a fun house.  It's quick, a lot to see, and it provides laughable entertainment.  Unlike the fun house, this one tends to stay with you after seeing it.  If only to provide a few in-jokes or movie quotes (God Bless Mr. Breakfast and Mr. T Cereal).  And of course, there's always the pop culture references from the '50's to (what was then considered) today.  Danny Elfman's score (Burton's personal John Williams) only adds to the film's atmosphere with it's maddeningly catchy carnival-esque music.I enjoy a fun movie, and this ranks in there as one of them.  As I said before, I'm a Burton fan, and other fans probably know what it is that makes this movie so unique.  Fans will love it.  Those uninitiated will probably either like it, or think it's just too out there.  But you can't help but get into Pee-Wee Herman's adventures before the Playhouse.

He's a rebel because he never gives in to danger -- he knows exactly what to do and what to say to get what he wants, whether acting like a vampire to scare off hoodlums, or dancing to Tequila to soothe bikers.

When I was little the parts that scared me the most were the scary truckdriver, the French lady who had a crush on Peewee(the one that looked like a man), and the actual scene of them two sitting in some kind of plastic animal watching the sun set. Her boyfriend sees them together and gets ticked. I'm not so sure if it's the situation or purely the lighting and background music that make these parts so freaky.        I don't remember if the biker bar dance, where Peewee is breakdancing and dancing to Tequila, is in this film or not, but that's a good part.       If you haven't decided if you want to see this flick yet, imagine watching this a Beetlejuice-ish Atmosphere with Beetlejuic-ish music, but without the supernatural and with Peewee as the lead.

Though he has his oddities (like the scotch tape mischief in front of the bathroom mirror) he comes off very friendly and most everyone he meets on the road takes a liking to him. His quest is to find his hi-tech, flashy bicycle which has disappeared. Pee-wee goes through standard road movie mishaps, but its terrificly goofy stuff that Im a sucker for.

On this journey he will come across a killer, the ghost of a dead trucker, a few bullies, a biker gang and various other oddballs before landing at a movie studio. A minor story has to go along with this film because this was actually the first time I had ever seen Pee-wee in any type of action. I was a kid when this show and movies were out and people always made fun of Pee-wee so I never wanted to check anything out with him in it. It took quite a while to finally few this cultural phenomenon and I ended up enjoying myself a lot more than I thought I would. I must admit that it took a few minutes for me to warm up to Pee-wee and his personality. Once you get use to it then I think it's nearly impossible not to somewhat enjoy his charm and over the top qualities. I think it's rather amazing at how well Reubens can morph into this character because you really don't see any type of actor but instead a real person. You could have fooled me that this wasn't a documentary capturing a real eccentric person instead of me just watching a movie. There are quite a few good scenes because the screenplay is smart enough just to throw this odd character into a pot with other odd characters who normally wouldn't enjoy him. The scene with the bikers was a true gem as was his car ride with the man who escaped from prison. More credit also needs to go to Burton who really makes a colorful film that's great to look at and that includes the wonderful breakfast maker at the start.

He's innocently childish, plays the role gleefully in a Buster Keaton sort of way (never stepping out of character), and the cartoonish material, as thin as a wisp about his feverish pursuit of his missing bike, suits his comedy style admirably. Burton was wise enough to get everyone else in the cast to act accordingly in spirit with the farcical situations.That Burton was the director of this offbeat film is especially evident during Pee-Wee's nightmarish scenes where he's pursued by strange creatures--but it's also evident in all the sequences on the road whereby Pee-Wee hooks up briefly with various eccentric types in his quest to reach the Alamo where he's been told he'll find his bike, by a fake fortune-teller who took his money.Of course, not everyone will be enchanted with this sort of wildly improbable adventure which, while catering to the child in all of us, requires adult understanding to get the connection between this film and the many others that are spoofed along the way. What I wasn't prepared for was the movie version of Pee-Wee's adventure being portrayed by JAMES BROLIN and MORGAN FAIRCHILD. I'm not quite sure that this bit of odd casting, meant to be intentionally funny, really worked.Tim Burton's fans ought to enjoy it (unless they have an aversion to Pee-Wee Herman), but it's recommended as just the sort of silly madcap comedy/adventure that passes the time pleasurably, no more, no less.And finally, a word of praise for Danny Elfman's jaunty score which helps immeasurably in setting the right tone for the comic adventures.

That is why it's so fun to watch over and over again, you always catch something new or understand something more.The ending is the real kicker, where Warner Bros. ACTUALLY makes a movie out of Pee-wee's story which stars James Brolin (all equipped with a grey tuxedo and red bow-tie!) and Morgan Fairchild as ninja-fighting secret agents. Just that scene was enough to inspire the jokes in BOWFINGER, but there's way more.Plus Tim Burton's wacky visual effects including some twisted dreams with clowns and dinosaurs and (don't miss this!)

To start with, the make-up of the leading actor. It is repulsive quite definitely. Lipstick, rosy cheeks&#x85; It's wrong. You feel it. And if you don't, then it is your problem. Why should a little kid of male sex apply lipstick and rouge to his cheeks? A vomiting choice for a family comedy. Maybe it would have passed unnoticed, if it had been a black and white film&#x85; Well, we can stop here and give it the lowest mark already, but if this is not enough, read further.The creepy fillings go next. They are scattered all over the place. Even in the very beginning, when the main character prepares breakfast. It's all wrong. And he plays with his food, - something, which should never be done (remember the famous Lion King phrase?). Skeletons, human prop heads, weird clown-devils, an old lady-ghost, etc. If there is a need to watch a horror comedy, my choice is Toxic Avenger, Elvira, or Killer Klowns, which are far from being family features but impressively good horror comedies.Funny material is not scanty - it's almost absent. Of course it is very subjective but to sit in front of a TV and being fed with some thrilling mishmash, neither scary nor funny, for almost 2 hours is cheating. Tried real hard to laugh at anything here but failed.The bad-ass bikers are fake too. Because they are soft-ass wanna-be bikers. The real ones would kick Pee's butt into non-existence for his gay looks and uncool behaviour (his jerking dance is stupid and simply cannot evoke any admiration at all, only shame).And if you start discussing the plot&#x85; It goes nowhere, though the hero is touring America and travels quite a lot. The main character does not become a better person (cf. Bean, where Mr Rowan Atkinson showed us a real quality jump in the main character's mental development) - he is the same queer jerk at the end of the feature, painful to stare at and listen to. And the actor does not do any inspiring gags (cf. the masterful Buster Keaton) either.My advice watch Bean the movie. It is a tear-jerkingly funny family feature devoid of any disgusting moments and full of witty dialogues and brilliant physical comedy, though dealing with the same material the grown up man behaves like a spoilt brat. Or try the original Dumb and Dumber if you still haven't seen it.Tim Burton missed a lot in this feature. But he did amazingly well in Batman dilogy. It's a mystery to me how the American public could endure this kind of character and this kind of flat gags in a numerous shows and movies a few decades ago...A sheer example of bad taste - can give this one only a one 1 out of 10, one of my biggest disappointments in cinema.

The movie is so successful at using cartoon logic in a live action format that it's easy to think I've seen this before instead of realizing Wait, I've never seen this in a real movie before! Nobody could predict that the scene immediately following Pee-wee's prosaic stint as a dishwasher would take place inside a giant, hollow dinosaur. It makes no sense whatsoever that Twisted Sister would show up in the film, much less in the same sequence as pair of elephants in full body paint. You could hardly come up with a justification if you tried, but in the movie the transitions are so smooth that these things almost pass as logical. Most of the movie's madness is closely linked to one of two themes, Americana and Americana Childhood Edition. The occupations and settings are straight out of America's Best Of truck drivers, roadside diners, rodeo cowboys, biker gangs, The Alamo, Hollywood, Mister Potato Head, clowns, drive-in theaters, and so on. These things have a certain familiarity and consistency, but the actual sequence of events that links them together is truly unpredictable. And yet, even inspired and well-structured zaniness does not necessarily equate to laughs. There are a lot of chuckles, some extended ones, in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, but there are some strung-out dead zones as well, and some parts that are more funny huh than funny hah. A chase through a movie studio lot, for example, is visually and conceptually interesting, but it lacks the great punchlines of the scenes in Texas. As man-child heroes go, Steve Martin's is more likable, more of an innocent, more hilarious in his total misunderstanding of reality, than Paul Reubens' Pee-wee, who has a certain aura of irony and, dare one say it, perversity about him. Yet the persona and the film are entertaining enough to spend 90 minutes with.

Like the title suggests, this is at least as much Pee Wee Herman's film that it is Tim Burton's. In fact Herman has also made the script. Tim Burton's movies are important to me, just like to so many people who grew up in the late eighties and nineties. This don't feel like a Burton movie very much, so I try to review it as an independent movie. It's a movie about a weirdo guy who lives in his own childish fantasy world. To me it feels more like a pictorial of some kind of mental problems than, say, a funny comedy for children. Anyway the main character is about 35 years old. The viewpoint of the movie is from this guys perspective, from where everything seems miraculous. Pee Wee is more like a sad clown, not someone who would make you, or at least me, laugh. In all his strangeness he's kinda unhuman and distant. I think this film portrays this guys communication with the world quite interestingly; he don't have much contact with it. But, there is another possible way to watch at least some parts of this film, and I realised that only after the first twenty minutes or so As an old time-style comedy. Pee Wee Herman is just like some Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd or Chaplin -kind of mute comedy character. Only difference is that now we would have the sound, the capability to communicate by speaking. If you would want it. With no doubt this is also a tribute to those old movies. In any case, I think this movie is quite boring; at least it don't manage to get me interested of itself. Maybe it is a children movie, that only children are able to watch. Generally I think that most of the best children's stories work also for adults, and have many different dimensions and depths to see for people of any age. But this don't work like that. I think the other Burton's work I've seen from the beginning of his career (I mean before he started to make REALLY great films), for example Amazing Stories episode Family Dog (with Brad Bird) and other animation Vincent are really great movies, and I would recommend those instead of this, if you'd have to choose. But because you do not have to choose, and if you're interested, then see this just for the general education. It's not bad, it's just boring.

The three sequences I think really stand out are Pee Wee's breakfast scene, Large Marge's immortal moment, and the tour of the Alamo with Jan Hooks (that gum!), all of which I attribute to great writing, not directing. In addition, there's plenty to recommend here, not the least of which is Danny Elfman's incredibly nuanced score.

Just then, Andy shows up again and chases Pee-wee into a rodeo where Pee-wee rides a mean bull, then he runs afoul of a biker gang, especially when he knocks over their motorcycles.

It was a cross between voice-breaking puberty and utter blandness. I cannot think of anything worse than an American Mr. Bean but here we have it. Believe me it isn't pretty - in fact it is unbearable to watch. To add insult to injury, we then have the most annoying laugh in the history of cinema to contend with. If everything else about this film doesn't kill you, then I guarantee that Pee-wee's cock-sure chuckle every 30 seconds, will! Get this tool off my screen forever!!!!I wouldn't watch it again, I wouldn't recommend it, I won't ever talk about it or mention it to anyone again. In fact if it was up to me I'd burn every copy of it in existence.A woefully immature baby film.

Its material isn't defined enough. Is this supposed to be a kid's film? Then what for the sexual puns and innuendos, or the soft, yet present, critics to Hollywood and studio executives? It seems a mixture that doesn't glue together.PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE isn't entertaining. At least, it isn't entertaining enough. Its dialogues are undeveloped and basic, in its worst sense. There's an absence of a strong story-line and our main character doesn't grow up in his journey. What's the point of having a journey if the character doesn't evolve? In the beginning, the only thing that matters to Pee-wee is his bike. In the end, he feels everything exactly the same way with the exception of the opportunity he gives to the girl. Naturally, Pee-wee is helped through his journey when initially he though he wouldn't need help from anyone, but this isn't strong enough to denote a change in the character.I like Tim Burton and his universes but I find this film very poor. It's not a visual extravaganza like some of his posterior films would be. There are a couple of interesting scenes &#150; the dinosaur in the Pre-Historic Museum and Pee-wee's dream inside the hospital - but in general the film is not as rich as it could be for a Tim Burton picture. Even though, I can understand Burton was preparing territory for his following films.Special mention must go to composer Danny Elfman &#150; in his first collaboration with Burton &#150; who delivers a wonderful score, sometimes scary, sometimes radiant, always magical and powerful. The soundtrack is predominantly present and, ultimately, that's what brings some color and life to Pee-wee's adventure and gives some cohesion to this film.As an adult, I didn't enjoy this fantasy film but I can't either imagine what message a kid can take from it? `Mommy, daddy, can I have a new bike?', `No, you can't! And stop talking like Pee-wee!' Is that it?

I frankly don't care who is doin' what in the bedroom, but the truth is some of my friends are annoying. When I saw first ten minutes of Pee Wee's Big Adventure I knew that it's going to be long movie to watch. Pee Wee's hardly likable, easily fooled and very selfish. That's like Wonka in Chocolate factory but Wonka was charismatic and charming, after all Johnny Deep is Johnny Deep. I'm not Deep fetishist but I hope You get what I mean. Pee Wee isn't charming, he's annoying just like some of my friends are. One of the advice almost every writer can give is If Your character isn't likable give him a dog. So Pee Wee's got the dog. He even saves animals from burning Pet Shop. Wow. I think he's still a prick. So much for the main character of this story.Secondly I enjoyed most of Burton's movies (specially Ed Wood and Batman Returns, both of them I consider as masterpieces). But scenario this time is weak. Why should we care about a stolen bike? Because we like it's owner. I don't like him, so I don't care.Directing and misdirectingSome shots are great, but let's be serious as for Tim Burton camera works is rather poor.The only character who isn't just a paper cut figure is Simone - waitress, who dreams of living in Paris, rest of characters are simply cliché and inhuman.Some parts of this movie are really good. The highway scene with Pee Wee's bike going the other way is nice, also the scene with police officer, but it's easily predictable.The worst part of this is, that everything in this picture is obvious and predictable. Everything must be shown in loudly manner, as if audience was 5 years old. I know it's a fairy tale, but come on. I don't like to be treated like an idiot.Should I admire this movie because it's signed Tim Burton? Nah, I don't think so.Music, acting - the operaI like Danny Elfman since Oingo Boingo but this time it's all to loud and turns into killjoy. Music is exaggerated and ruins almost every scene (exception is chase at the end - frankly the Hollywood part is quite good). And so is acting. It turns story into some comic opera, which isn't very comic but rather pretentious and annoying.SummaryIf You think Burton was great from the beginning You're wrong. If You don't believe me - watch Pee Wee's Herman Big Adventure "},{"Title":"The Worst movie I've ever seen","Date":"4 January 2000","Score":"5 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  I watched this movie as a kid and hated it then.  I just watched part of it again, and I couldn't finish it.  This movie had no business being made. There was only one part worth watching.  That was with large Marge. That's the only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10.

Tim Burton is my favorite director and most of his other films are excellent.  He really needed practice when he did this one, though.  There are a handful of funny scenes, but eventually Pee-Wee becomes too irritating to laugh at.  My advice would be to skip this one and watch Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, or Sleepy Hollow instead.

We rented this some time back as my husband had read somewhere that it was a good, fun film and an obvious plus was being a Tim Burton film as well. Honestly I can count the number of videos that I've not been able to finish watching after renting on one hand. Half of one hand. Okay, one finger.It hadn't even make it past 15 minutes when I remarked I hope this gets better real soon now.Unfortunately it never did. Definitely don't waste your time on this one.

Anyway I couldn't get passed the part where he is fixing breakfast in the very beginning, why.... because I was so disturbed. I don't know what it is about this movie, the lighting, soundtrack, Peewee himself, but it honestly just freaked me out to the point where I had to turn it off. Some of it might have to do with Paul Reuban's getting arrested for the Sex crimes. The atmosphere of this film is just so dark and freaky, the 80's had something to do with for sure but I just don't understand the appeal of this film. Don't get me wrong, I love Tim Burton. I also really enjoy horror movies and such but this film is just to eerie and disturbing. "}]
