I noticed the cable TV guide gave it one star. While certainly not a great film, giving it only one star is a bit harsh. Granted, I wouldn't have wanted to sit through two hours of such a movie, but it breezes by in a relatively enjoyable 90 minutes or so (if even that). I must say, as an American I kinda cringe to think of how Waking in Reno must satisfy every unflattering stereotype about Americans in the eyes of Europeans. The four characters are about as Red State as you can get (one of the Arkansas accents is done with remarkable aplomb by British actress Natasha Richardson). Richardson and Charleze Theron, the two female leads are none too tough on the eyes (which the men will appreciate). And Billy Bob Thornton give his usual interesting performance (without a doubt the most intriguing actor in America today). Swayze is just so-so, but not much is demanded of him. Not much is demanded of anyone or anything, for that matter, by this harmless, and quite funny, bit of fluff. Make a note to catch the wry commentary and numerous deadpan jokes about redneck culture (the script could have been written by Jeff Foxworthy). As it is, I believe one of the writers is a childhood friend of Billy Bob's from Arkansas (no doubt Thornton's presence in the film, as well as that of big time stars like Theron, was as a favor to the writer/childhood friend of Thornton). The movie reaches it climax at a Monster Truck show. That alone should be all you need to know about the setting and plot. I give it a recommendation to catch on cable/satellite if one of your movie stations is carrying it, though there are probably better things to spend your money on at the video shop.

The characters are a delight from their trailor trash mentality to their hillbilly accents and you really begin to care about them right away.

Swayze and Theron are the younger couple with Life's road ahead of them and if a vaction to Reno to watch a MONSTER TRUCK RALLEY is anyindication it's going to be a doozy of a ride.

Roy (Patrick Swayze, Forever Lulu) and Candy (Charlize Theron, Sweet November) tag along with their best friends Lonnie Earl (Billy Bob Thornton, The Gift) and Darlene (Natasha Richardson, Blow Dry), picking up a brand new SUV from the dealership that Lonnie Earl owns, and head off for the wild blue yonder. They're armed with a AAA Trip Tik, which is animated onscreen from time to time as we follow the bouncing auto from point to point on its way out west. Along the way, they stop at a few roadside attractions -- but only the ones Lonnie Earl wants to see, because he's got to keep to their schedule. This is very important to him, even after he eats a 72-ounce steak and winds up in the emergency room. Meanwhile, Candy is ovulating and Roy's got to accommodate her whenever her temperature drops to that magic number. Little does he know, Lonnie Earl may have already planted his seed before they left home. Lonnie Earl's wife, Darlene, doesn't know either -- but you think she might not care, as she hasn't let her husband touch her for the past two years.This is a pretty simple story and there isn't a lot going on, but it's well directed, and particularly well written and well acted. It all comes together beautifully, and the four actors are completely believable in their could-be country caricature roles. Lonnie Earl's got the Van-Dyke look going on, complete with snakeskin cowboy boots and his faux snakeskin shirt, and Darlene starts off bumpkin-geek with her overalls and badly bleached hair. She later goes babe-chic when she takes the cheating Lonnie Earl's credit card, raids the expensive designer boutiques, and treats herself to a Tony Orlando concert. While none of the characters have especially good qualities, the actors who portray them make them likable and relatable.While the subject matter is serious, Wakin' Up In Reno is played (mostly) for laughs, and there are plenty of them. It's too bad it's only getting a limited release, as this is one of the smartest, funniest adult comedies I've seen in awhile.

Billy Bob Thornton is Lonnie Earl, a used car salesman married to Darlene (Natasha Richardson) but who has had a recent fling with her best friend Candy (Charlize Theron). Candy's husband Roy (Patrick Swayze) is desperately trying to get his wife pregnant but suspects his sperm may not be working. While on a vacation in Reno to renew their wedding vows, the foursome's relationship comes to a head when Roy's non-existent sperm count is confirmed the same day as his wife's pregnancy and everyone notices Lonnie Earl's shifty eyes upon hearing the news. While amusing and likable, the movie isn't quite as good as it could have been... and it often seems to be setting up future situations (like a suddenly-ignored attraction between Roy and Darlene) that never come to fruition. (I was expecting much hilarity from a scene of Lonnie Earl's attempt at eating a 72 ounce steak in one hour... but the scene winds up being mostly uneventful.) The actors do a great job though... particularly Thornton, whose skill at blurting out totally insensitive and inappropriate lines is unsurpassed, i.e. She's on her deal, y'know? And I will take any excuse to see the lovely Mrs. Liam Neeson (Natasha Richardson) on screen!

Trust me, you won't miss anything of the story if you catch it from the second half but make sure to catch Penelope Cruz's sizzling but hilarious cameo first with Billy Bob and then with Patrick. The story is nothing new, nor interesting and has been done x times. The characters are irritating particularly those played by Thornton, Theron and Swayze. However, Natasha Richardson's Darlene is very likable. Performance wise, all the actors fit the bill especially Natasha Richardson (who remarkably pulls off the Southern accent)and Charlize Theron (in the later scenes). The lads, Billy Bob Thornton and Patrick Swayze are alright. The ending was somewhat awkward but a happy one nonetheless. The 'catfight' scene in the lift was hilarious and there's a wonderful moment of acting by Richardson when she's in the lounge after her tiff with her husband when she finds out that he cheated on her. One might feel hateful towards Theron's character when she advises Darlene and supports her like a friend when she had shagged her husband but in the latter half one feels sympathy for her as Theron displays Candy's remorse quite well. The soundtrack is quite fun and of the foot-tapping sort. Overall, this is an okay movie to watch after you've had a very tiring day and just want to relax and watch something that won't use up your energy too much.

I loved this movie because it showed four people living life as it really is. The production team pegged those individual personalities with great accuracy! Every multi-dimensional character was portrayed effortlessly by each actor. Billy Bob did a great job with Lonnie Earl. He showed us his naturally snide demeanor, while still being able to convey his vulnerable sincerity in scenes with his wife, Darlene. Natasha portrays Darlene (who narrates the opening & closing scenes)with utmost grace. Oh, & the fact that she's English is totally hidden by a well sculpted southern accent. Her transformation was very beautifully reminiscent of a fairy tale, yet still astoundingly believable. Patrick shows us a very sensitive & sweet Roy, while still being a good southern boy mused by the monster truck jam & plenty of Pabst beer. He is everything a gentleman should be, and Patrick showed us how raw a man in his position can truly become. Honestly, I would love to have seen Darlene & Roy hook up, but in the end, I'm glad that what happened in Reno, stayed in Reno. Now, Charlize gave us a very interesting piece of eye-Candy ;) She once again proved that her acting is unsurmountable to any badly feux-pased script. Sure, Candy made a couple of bad decisions & seems a bit confused, but through all of the trips travesties, she pulls off an amazing comeout. Charlize managed to bring to life this very down to earth, redneck vixen with ease. She put so much emotion into her roles that she literally consumes them into herself. I've never seen heartbreak on any other actor's face the way I've seen it on hers. The realizations & character growth for each person i believe are all in great thanks to the actors who became those people. The storyline would have been sufferingly basic if it weren't for a cast of geniuses. While it did contain some clever dialogue, Waking Up In Reno was obviously carried by the greats who headline in this redneck love-comedy.

Candy wants to get pregnant of Roy, but is having an affair with Lonnie. Once in Reno, Candy finds that she is pregnant, while Roy's doctor advises that he is infertile, based on the results of his sperm test. The inevitable quarrel happens between the four travelers. Waking Up In Reno is a very disappointing movie, specially having such a cast. The result is not balanced, oscillating from a comedy of bad taste to a dramatic romance, but without any explanation for Candy cheating her beloved husband. The accent of the cast, probably from the region of Little Rock, is terrible to be heard. Maybe some of the best attractions are the beauties of Natasha Richardson and Charlize Theron, in a comedy that rarely made me laugh.

What a cast this movie had! Theron and Richardson sink their teeth into these roles and create characters with fully developed personalities. Thornton may have been the best here but I must say Swayze, who I've always thought was a bit under rated, was excellent and I really enjoyed seeing him in this role. I also loved Penelope Cruz in this role and wish her part had been larger. The whole cast was way above average.But the movie still lacked a lot. With all the possibilities this movie had, I didn't think the central subject matter fit very well. Although the cast is great and they develop their characters, there isn't much development in the way the characters interact with each other. Therefore it is kind of difficult to buy into the movie.Plus you kind of feel a little gypped at the end, as you don't really see how much is resolved. There are occasionally some really good scenes such as the confrontation between the two women, which unfortunately, is turned into a cat fight (after a really poignant scene I might add) and the scene where Swayze says he wants respect. Even the interaction between Swayze and Cruz is practically non existent after she starts talking to him at the bar. This movie is WAY to short. And I also think maybe it would have played better as a drama or at least a dramatic comedy. It really wasn't very funny anyway although it had a few moments toward the end.Also considering this is a road movie, I thought more could have been done from a cinematography standpoint. Again-there's a few moments, examples being a breathtaking scene of the nighttime sky and of coarse the last scene. But way more use should have been made of the photography and way more interesting adventures should have happened on the way to Reno.I wouldn't really recommend this movie but fans of any of the performers might want to check it out for some really good acting.

There's nothing special here that you need to see. Story is about two married couples from Arkansas who go on a trip together to Reno. Couple number one is Lonnie Earl Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton) who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage. His wife is Darlene (Natasha Richardson) and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time. Lonnie has been sleeping with Candy (Charlize Theron) who is the wife of his best friend Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze). They all drive to Reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite. Roy and Candy have been trying to have a baby and finally Candy discovers that she is pregnant. But Roy phones his doctor in Arkansas and finds out that he's sterile. Candy and Lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos. This film is directed by Jordan Brady and he's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive. Unfortunately Brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him. This script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level. Just because they're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic. Thornton's character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar. And Swayze's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day. Penelope Cruz pops up as a prostitute and it's a totally worthless and pointless cameo. She barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines! I think she was fulfilling an obligation to Harvey and Bob Weinstein who are executive producers for this film. The only person who actually isn't to bad is Richardson. We watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche. All of these actors should know better and it's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it. It's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid.

Natasha Richardson, Billy Bob Thornton, Patrick Swayze, and Charlize Theron play one of the dumbest foursomes I have ever seen in a movie.  This was in no way their fault whatsoever.  If anything I would have to give them some extra accolades for giving these characters any depth at all, seeing as how they were not given much to work with.If these characters had woken up in Reno they would have in the least swapped mates and made themselves truly happy.  I mean these are four of the most clueless characters I have ever seen.  In some ways their backwoods, child-like behaviors make them a bit more appealing and humorous, but they learn nothing in this story - except whose best friend slept with who's husband/wife.  After all the arguing and reactionary behavior ceases, its go to the monster truck rally, and then go home, where magically everyone kisses and makes up like nothing ever happened.It's preposterous and so silly that it's painful.  I did find myself waiting for the end to come, which when it did was completely unfulfilling.  This movie is just a lame duck with a loaded cast.  What a waste.

A critically slammed comedy about two married redneck couples from Arkansas who take a road trip to Reno, this corny  flick is Razzie material. With enough star power to bring some credibility to an awful screenplay and script, this film doesn't really work and you only have to listen to the director/writer's track to see why. I got more laughs from watching Theron seriously describing of the film in the extras section of the DVD than I did watching the film. Among the more notable offerings during the 1.5 hour run are Thornton eating a 72 ounce streak in 1 hour; Cruz playing a prostitute for a heartbeat; a giant mechanical monster that eats cars at a monster truck show; and...and, well, that's about it. The rest of the time it's a sort of worst of Jerry Springer review. Best saved for broadcast. (C+) "},{"Title":"Oh My... (spoilers)","Date":"22 April 2004","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I've seen some crappy movies in my life, but this one must be among the very worst. Definately bottom 100 material (imo, that is).We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on a roadtrip to Reno.Apparently, Lonnie isn't too happy with his sex-life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who's despirately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, isn't too sure if his sperm is OK so he's getting it checked by a doctor.Now, I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend didn't, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes 'oh yeah, she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's'. Spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible.An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police-officers, as they didn't stop at a stop-sign. The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer. Not only is this scene pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk and talk and talk, without ever going somewhere.I still have to puke thinking about the ending though. Apparently, Roy ISN'T having problems down there so he IS the father of the child. How many times does that happen in the movies... try something new! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after. Yuck.Best scene of the movie is right at the end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes?One would expect more from this cast (although Thornton really tries), but you can't really blame them. Writers, shame on you!1/10.

How or why this movie was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me.  Strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick  DO NOT waste your time on this 'film'.

And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her watching paint dry.Being curious, I checked this site's production info. It made a whopping < $600 per screen its opening weekend, and just over $400 each, after its month's theater run in latter 2002. Overall gross was $261K, which I'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location.The story is pretty benign, and even the use of the usually interesting locale of Reno is as dull as the rest of the goings-on.It's something like several SNL bits all pieced together, none individually too great at all, and the overall presentation even worse.Whatever, the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if all worked for less than their usual fees - so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob's present (albeit understandably somewhat laconic here , compared with his usual work.Think of the three superb, totally diverse characters he portrayed in Sling Blade, Bandits and Bad Santa, and you know he realized this work was below standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this. One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, the typical Lifetime flick.

And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, a has been trying to be a redneck. I really can't stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good in Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie get? The storyline was stupid. I'm usually not this judgemental of movies, but I couldn't stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade.My mom found this movie for $5.95 at Wal Mart...figures...I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my Grandma for Christmas. It could just be that I can't stand redneck accents usually, or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn't in it. I didn't laugh once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they had shown someones fingers getting smashed, I might have laughed. people's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh.  "}]
