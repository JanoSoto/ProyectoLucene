It didn't feature the best acting in the world but it was suitable and the atmosphere was very scary.The sequel, Candyman II Farewell to the Flesh, is as most horror sequels typically are -- inferior and less scary. It's like Halloween II, Friday the 13th Part II and Psycho II not as good as the original! Yet for what it is, Candyman II is quite entertaining, and still manages to remain rather atmospheric. The film takes place in New Orleans around the Mardi Gras and it's got some good scary segments. Some aren't so scary but are fun to watch. We know what's going to happen but it's still entertaining.No this isn't expertly made but it isn't mind-numbingly bad as some of the genre are. Basically it's loads of blood but it also retains its creepy cinematography and the direction is better than expected.Overall this kept me entertained, which is all I expected in the first place.

Candyman has moved from the slums of Chicago to the streets of New Orleans, during Mardi Gras. A schoolteacher named Annie Tarrant, whose father was murdered Candyman-style a few years earlier, does not believe in Candyman and says his name 5 times into a mirror to prove to her students he doesn't exist. Wrong move Annie. Soon after she does this a series of brutal murders occur while Candyman seduces her to Be with him. Lots of bees and blood in this good sequel!

I have to say, as far as sequels of slasher movies go, this ain't that bad. It has good production values. But of course the great acting performances of the original are gone except for Tony Todd's, who is almost equally as good as he was in the original. But also gone are the great editing and photography, the gritty realistic feel of the original, the eerie and moody score of Philip Glass. Candyman just continues ripping people up with motives that are standard in slasher movies. The bees are involved more in the gory scenes, but are still underused.Not half as good as the first movie.

While the story worked in some ways, I wasn't that thrilled about it. Not to mention I didn't like the city change, I'm just filled with so much Chicago pride, you know? Annie is a school teacher and her brother is up on murder charges, he is also being accused of murdering her father who was truly murdered by the famous Candyman. Annie knows that her brother is innocent, but her kids start to test her patience on the Candyman myth, to prove them wrong, she calls to the Candyman and makes a big mistake. She finds out that her great grandmother was the lover of Candyman and he wants her now to bring out his past.Candyman Farewell to the Flesh was an alright horror movie and the story could've worked better, but it just seemed like your typical horror sequel and it could be predictable at times.

The first Candyman did just about everything with the concept that needed to be done whilst keeping the character himself full of mystery and menace. The relationship between the Candyman and Helen was wonderfully drawn, and any sequel would have an insurmountable example to follow. This said, I dug Candyman 2 Farewell to the Flesh quite a bit. Kelly Rowan makes for an appealing heroine, she can act, she's pretty and it's funny to see her pre The OC. Tony Todd is fearsome as ever, although the dialogue isn't up to the standards of the first. The music is pretty much the same I believe, maybe with slight alterations, and it works. Director Bill Condon keeps the film tightly paced and watchable and has a nice sense of atmosphere, although the film doesn't really deliver scares. The handful of kill scenes are nicely bloody and vicious, but the scenes are more efficient than scary. They are fun, and a strong point of the movie, but they just don't have the impact you expect from the Candyman. The strong story and acting are the best thing about this, keeping the film constantly watchable and fun and developing the character of Daniel Robitalle in interesting ways. All considered, I say this is a decent film with a number of cool moments, definitely worthwhile for the horror fans although its best to forget the majestic original before watching.

Although the accuser's sister a schoolteacher tries to discover who actually did kill the expert and learns that the legend of The Candyman is for real. She has conjured up the mythical serial killer by repeating his name in front of the mirror five times. This is where the horrifying nightmare begins and some surprising revelations occur.The sequel to the underrated original you could say its just another slasher because it lacks the psychological edge, but I thought it was a reasonably good one and above the usual routine slasher. Sure it doesn't have the hypnotic power and impact of the original, but it still delivers enough well arranged shocks and has an mildly interesting plot that delves a little a bit more into the Candyman's background. With it showing us flashbacks of the painful ordeal he faced and how he became this legend. The plot isn't entirely focused on the Candyman legend (like the original was), with the investigation leading more towards the sister finding out about her family secrets while trying to get her brother of the hook and basically the legend is woven into it. Though, it's not as smart, or incredibly gripping this time around, with it leading more towards graphic violence and having some tedious moments slowing down the pace. It starts off rather slow, but it gets better as the story moves along and some moderate surprises pop up, but really it isn't that hard to guess to where the story is heading and some things just don't add up. The cloud of mystery around the Candyman just seems to be gone, or I should say far less evoking, with it seamlessly rehashing a lot material and ideas which were done so more effectively in the first film. On a whole it just doesn't capture the intense power and poetic tussle of the original's subtle plot and elegant dialogue. The material seems to want to force-feed us the information and the narration by the damn DJ was really starting to get on my nerves after awhile. But nonetheless, it's a bloody treat (literally) and at least it's not just another slasher involving horny/drunk teenagers with a shallow plot.The look and direction of the film was alright, but it lacked the polish production values and the touch of detail and class. Atmosphere was slightly disappointing, because the dreaded build up is only effective in short pockets because it's was replaced by too many jump out scares that eases the tension. Although saying that it did provide some freaky sequences, but that was on the behalf of Todd's towering presence. Also there's a nice amount of nasty deaths and blood splattering for gore fanatics. Great makeup achieved and you got to love those special effects. The score from the original is used again and it creates that sense of mystic and doom that flooded the original. On show again is strong camera-work that truly catches your eye. The performances are fair with two reasonable standouts. Easily Tony Todd as the harrowing Candyman, who lives the part as the tormented soul perfectly and Veronica Cartwright turns in a surprise performance. Kelly Rowan as the heroine isn't bad either. The dialogue isn't that riveting, but Todd's echoing voice causes chills to run up your spine. Something about this fictional legend is quite impressive in my eyes. He lives on the pain and the people's fear of him. This is what gives him power and keeps his legend alive. Really, he is nothing but a heart lorn soul.Overall, it doesn't hold up to the original, but as for a sequel, it's not all that bad.

In front of his audience, Purcell invokes the Candyman but nothing happens. But once the lecture is over, Purcell is torn open by the Candyman in a bar bathroom. The police arrest Ethan Tarrant, a mentally disturbed man, who had assaulted Purcell earlier. But his sister, art teacher Annie Tarrant, believes otherwise. With her husband Paul McKeever, Annie revisits her childhood home, which is now an abandoned property filled with vagrant squatters. She begins to find links between the Candyman legend & her own family history. And as soon as Annie herself invokes him in order to disprove the myth in front of her students, the Candyman appears, killing people around her in order to get her to believe in him. Dodging both the ghost & the police, who are convinced that she is responsible for the Candyman's victims, Annie discovers that Candyman &#x96; real name Daniel Robitaille &#x96; was a former slave who was brutally murdered by his owners after getting a white woman pregnant. And the kicker is that the child that Robitaille fathered was Annie's great-grandmother.Candyman Farewell to the Flesh was the first of two sequels to CANDYMAN, an impressive but slightly overrated horror sleeper of the 1992 season that became a big hit & was the second major cult creation of horror master Clive Barker, already famous for the Cenobites of the HELLRAISER series. The film was based on one of Barker's short stories.While the original was an excellent horror flick that engaged on both a cerebral & a visual level, this sequel is strictly by the numbers. Bill Condon relies on far too many false jumps & red herrings during the first half that becomes tiring to watch. This, coupled with the overuse of Philip Glass' score from the original to the point that the ethereal effect it had in the first film became nothing but meaningless in this one makes the film's first half decidedly mediocre.But once the story kicks in the second half & Kelly Rowan's heroine is on the chase to defeat what is essentially her ancestor, Farewell to the Flesh picks up considerably to rank as a passable sequel. The visual effects are good, especially the ending where Tony Todd's hook-handed ghost is defeated by Rowan smashing the mirror, causing his form to shatter like glass, an effect that looks remarkable. Another thing that elevates the film slightly is the whole connection between the heroine & the Candyman, as well as revealing the ghost's origins, finally solving the mystery behind the legend.The acting is okay in places. Tony Todd practically owns the film from his first appearance. He is probably the only actor besides Hellraiser villain Doug Bradley to really get into the nuances of his character, giving the film a good monster. As for the rest of the cast, everyone does passably well, although I found Veronica Cartwright's neurotic mother a bit of an eyesore.

Actor Tony Todd would argue that the entire series revolves around a tragic story of unrequited love and the vengeance rained down upon those who dare disturb the tortured soul of the title character. I would absolutely agree with him, especially after Candyman Farewell to the Flesh expands on the backstory of our antagonist.Candyman moves on to New Orleans and starts his horrific murders once more. This time, his intended victim is a school teacher. Her father was killed by Candyman, and brother wrongly accused of the murders.Instead of the usual horror film retread we get when it comes to sequels, Candyman Farewell to the Flesh actually expands on the history of the character by visually telling his tale on screen. It pounds home the tragedy surrounding Candyman and brings more of a sense of humanity to the villain of the story. Tony Todd brings Candyman to life and makes you both feel sorry for and fear his character. He brings an air of refinement to what could have been just another slasher icon. Veronica Cartwright plays a widowed southern belle who has a secret of her own to keep. Even in 1995, she was already a veteran of the horror genre because of roles in Alien, The Birds, The Witches of Eastwick, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and more.I'm fascinated by writer and atheist Clive Barker's attraction to Christian religion and Catholic imagery as showcased once again in Candyman Farewell to the Flesh. This time it's exemplified through the events of Mardis Gras in New Orleans and the religious meanings behind the celebration. I also found it interesting that one of the main focuses of the lynch mob was a middle-aged lady carrying her Bible and encouraging the torture of Candyman. Candyman Farewell to the Flesh is rated R for violence and gore, and for some sexuality and language. There's the expected amount of blood and on screen butchering you would expect from a horror movie. A couple are shown having sex in public on two occasions. They're nude and shown from the side, but no actual privates are shown. Candyman Farewell to the Flesh rises above what could have been just another pedestrian follow-up to a slasher flick. Instead of simply lining up new faceless victims for the killer to take out with his hook hand for no reason, our dreadful anti-hero is given substance and motivation for his actions. An air of mystery and a dark family secret add another level of elegance to the movie.

In this sequel, the Candyman has moved on to New Orleans to continue his reign of terror. The movie opens with a lecture from a man who wrote a book about the Candyman urban legend and phenomena. After saying the Candyman's name five times for his audience, he heads to a local bar, but soon meets his grisly fate to the hooked killer in the bathroom of the saloon, whom he considered to be only legend. Now, a school teacher named Annie is pulled into the Candyman legend after some of her students introduce her to it. But Annie is quite familiar with the legend, as it is believed by her brother that the Candyman was responsible for her father's mysterious death. After saying his name five times, Annie is now the Candyman's new intended victim, and she must find a way to stop him before he takes her life.Surprisingly, this was actually a pretty well done sequel. The story was interesting, not quite as much so as the first film, but it works out well. Some nice southern imagery and the spooky New Orleans setting really add to the atmosphere. The acting was good, and there were some well crafted shock sequences and plenty of fairly nasty violence. Teens of today's generation may recognize Kelly Rowan as the lead, who is now most popular for the hit TV series The OC. Tony Todd returns and is as creepy as he was in the first film, as the hook-handed monster that is the stuff nightmares are made of.As in many horror sequels, we get a bit of a back story on who the Candyman was before he became the ghostly legend that he is today. Turns out that the man was an artist who was punished after having relations with a white woman. His arm was brutally sawed off, and he was covered with honey and attacked by an enormous swarm of bees, while the town people chanted Candyman, Candyman... five times, until he was dead. His lover, Caroline, kept his soul maintained in a small mirror, thus explaining why his ghost appears after you call his name five times in the mirror. I thought this explanation was rather clever. To sum it up, this was a fairly good sequel in my opinion. While it may not quite live up to the original film, this is a valiant effort that turns out to be a pretty good movie overall. It's better than you'd like to think, and could've been a whole lot worse. Recommended, whether you've seen the original or not. 7/10.

I do admit that the film's explanation regarding the origin of Daniel Robitaille's power seemed rather silly(the idea that Candyman's soul was trapped in the mirror of his white lover Caroline due to the extremities of his torment, hate & agony for what the racist white township did to him), but the film has so many things I enjoyed that I was actually able to look past it.Annie(Kelly Rowan, many who watched THE OC might recognize her)is a schoolteacher in New Orleans whose father died at the hook of the Candyman. Her brother, Ethan(William O'Leary), is in jail for the possible murder of a novelist(he wrote a novel about Candyman, was asked by Ethan's father for help), who we see at the opening of the film, calling out Candyman in front of a crowd at his book-signing. Ethan furiously questions why the novelist didn't help his father and later attempted to brawl with him in a bar. The novelist, who cynically called on Candyman's name, enters the bar bathroom and is gutted. Annie's mom, Octavia(Veronica Cartwright)hides a secret in a locked drawer and we will find that it holds a key to a certain mystery regarding their family and the Candyman. Annie has a student, Matthew(Joshua Mayweather)who is plagued with dreams of the Candyman, and to satisfy her frightened class that the hooked-madmen from the mirror doesn't exist, calls his name across a reflection inviting true horror into her life.The film's mystery is what Candyman's relationship is to Annie. There's a history here that Annie will seek answers for..but will she like what that answer yields? I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric setting(Mardi Gras, New Orleans, mostly the slums areas), the menacing Todd(an actor I'm quite fond of), the wonderful Philip Glass score, Condon's photography, and the well-staged death sequences.I won't lie to you, this is, above all, a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach, often lifting them right in the air..Condon, for added effect, often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie re-visits the home of her youth(which was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby), follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out.There's a great scene where Detective Levesque(David Gianopoulos), who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her, calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.

The script by Rand Ravich & Mark Kruger takes itself extremely seriously & moves along at a fairly sedate pace, there is just about enough going on to retain ones interest but there's nothing particularly memorable here. The character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue the same & even though I saw it only a few hours ago I'm actually struggling to remember anything about it apart from a highly annoying DJ called Kingfisher who makes a regular appearance on the soundtrack. This one spends a fair amount of time on Candyman's background which isn't overly interesting I'm afraid. It plods along, Candyman occasionally turns up to spout some dull speeches & kill the odd person until the somewhat predictable ending where Annie defeats him. The script seems to be full of those annoying false scares as people sneak up on each other & grab their shoulder thereby scaring everyone, why can't people in these type's of films just announce their arrival properly? There's nothing wrong with this sort of cheap scare but it's used several times throughout this film & it grows tiresome. Having said that it's watchable enough I suppose, there's a reasonable body count & while I didn't love it I didn't hate it either.Director Condon does OK, the whole film has a very muted colour scheme which started to get on my nerves after a while. There's an OK atmosphere although there's not much tension going on. There's a few gore scenes, a few people are killed by Candayman with his hook although they are all virtually exactly the same & there's a flashback where Candyman has his hand cut off.Technically the film is good, it looks like it had some money behind it & it's certainly well made. The acting is alright but making this stuff seem believable isn't easy.Candyman Farewell to the Flesh is average at best, I neither loved nor hated it. It's OK but nothing special.

The director creates a special aura upon the proximity of the Candyman; a crescendo of bees, sudden fear, and inexorable violence.  This atmosphere separates Candyman from most other horror films in my mind. We do not simply experience fear; we are drawn into a story of supernatural revenge, played against an innocent beauty whose survival becomes our most sincere desideratum.All of the Candyman elements seem to merge best for me in this excellent installment. I really love Kelly Rowan's portrayal as Candyman's devastated but determined protagonist. She is a compelling actress, and excels in her role as Annie. I find the resolution quite imaginative.

On a book tour, he stops off in New Orleans to show how much he believes the tale to be hokum. He says the name Candyman five times in the mirror in front of the crowds he is speaking with, only to wind up gutted by the very spectre he claims does not exist when he is alone. The police arrest Ethan Tarrant, due to the fact he had an argument & assaulted the man earlier in the night & feel he is responsible for the murder, he also happens to be the brother of school, teacher Annie Tarrant. Investigating the Candyman legend. Later on at the children's urging, Annie says the name Candyman five times in the mirror in front of her class, in order to make them not fear the legend. Candyman later appears to her in her own home, before slaughtering her friends & family in bloody succession, leaving Annie to be framed for the vicious killing spree. In order to clear her name, She decides to find out all she can about the Candyman. While investigating, she learns his real name was Daniel Robitaille, a black man who decades earlier, impregnated a white woman whose portrait he was hired to paint. When the townsfolk found out, they formed a lynch mob & chased him down to a field, where they sawed his hand off, covered his body in honey & allowed him to be stung to death by bees. Annie comes to learn that the child Robitaille fathered was her own great grandmother & soon learns that he wants to re-incarnate himself inside of the unborn child she is carrying & learns that the Candyman killed her father years before. Annie seeks to find out a way to stop the Candyman's reign of terror before she to winds up as another victim of his.Despite it's some what mixed reaction from fans & critics, CANDYMAN FAREWELL TO THE FLESH is actually a fairly entertaining sequel in it's own right, while not quiet the letter of the first movie, FAREWELL TO THE FLESH stands on it's own as a fairly decent sequel. What's weird is despite the financial returns & good reviews from fans & critics, the original CANDYMAN didn't revitalize interest in the horror genre. Despite the scariness of the original, Candyman never really took off, his bright & shining moment in the mainstream was only for a short while, the film only was able to conjure up two sequels. It's a shame this sequel wasn't a success, because this sequel does a lot right, the acting is really good, the character development is very well handled & BILL CONDON steps into the role of director from the original films director Bernard Rose & fills his shoes quiet well. The cinematography is truly excellent & TONY TODD again delivers another commanding performance as the hook handed bogeyman. The film also features some fairly decent gore effects & nasty kills, which are much more elaborate than what was seen in the first & a light sprinkling of nudity as well, which is required of the genre & the film is blessed by the PHILLIP GLASS orchestral score which still serves the film well & which was featured so prominently in the original film. The film also makes mention of the first films massacre & Helen's (the heroine of the first who returned as a malevolent spirit at the climax) Legend as a now hook handed myth herself, something that thankfully this sequel avoided exploring.Unfortunately CANDYMAN FAREWELL TO THE FLESH falls into the same trap that most sequels done to fairly entertaining movies fall into & that's in telling an origin story for it's main villain & giving him a family to deal with, which I felt was unnecessary. The flashback on how Candyman was murdered unjustly, simply because this was all covered during a conversation in the original movie. Even more so is the plot element surrounding his family, but this has never really gelled with horror fans, as everything from Freddy's Dead, Jason Goes To Hell, Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers used this plot thread & those entries all received mixed reactions from their fans. Outside the twist that the Candyman is indeed in pursuit of his own bloodline this time out & the New Orleans backdrop, the film does nothing new with the story, nor does it offer anything new for fans of the movie, it merely just extends the Candyman universe & nothing more. The plot of the school teacher being blamed for a spat of vicious Candyman style killings, is a plot point lifted from the first film. I also felt taking the character of Candyman from being a mere urban legend to an almost religious iconic figure ala Santeria, with shrines & junk temples being dedicated to him, scenes of children scribbling pictures of him & talking about him made the character less effective. The film also fails to capture the right mood & atmosphere of the original & the film relies on cheap jump scares that fail to convince, such as mardi gras dancers bumping into windows in front of the heroine & derelicts jumping into frame, hands plopping onto peoples shoulders, people appearing in cabinet mirrors after they have been closed, when before there was no one in the room before the person opened them etc. All in all, CANDYMAN FAREWELL TO THE FLESH is a fairly enjoyable sequel, again while the film doesn't quite measure up to the first film, it's still a worthy follow up to a classical horror film & what is sadly one of the most criminally underrated horror icons to ever grace the silver screen.

The acting was very decent, especially Tony Todd of course. He was as creepy as in the original, and Kelly Rowan was OK. Veronica Cartwright was good too, after her great performance almost 20 year before in Alien (1979). In every way, this was a good well-done sequel ALMOST as good as the original.

This sequel P*************ed me off! I love the original and consider it to be one of the scariest horror movies of all time. They took a giant dump all over Candyman's legacy just to make more money. There is some OK suspense at times, but I didn't give a damn about any of it. New direction was needed and once again, they didn't have the balls to go in a creative direction. There were two things they could have done with this sequel. They could have done a complete prequel, showing Candyman's origins. We get snippets of it in this movie and the first, but a full prequel could have been really interesting. They show Candyman's death as a human in flashbacks and it had no effect on me. It was emotionless and boring. To be even more audacious, Helen could have taken over Candyman's role and supplanted Tony Todd, leaving Candyman as a side character. The first movie was in a similar place as Halloween IV. They took the safe route in Halloween V, and they did the same with this movie. I wanted to see Virginia Madsen return and unleash hell. Her and Candyman could even reluctantly team up! They obviously saw dollar signs and gave us this predictable BS. The New Orleans setting had major potential and it's not fulfilled. Even the deaths are boring. If you like very bloody stabbings with a hook, this movie's for you. I get so tired of the incompetent cops storyline and it's become one of the most annoying horror clichés. The evidence is clearly there that something unusual is happening!!! The acting is OK. Tony Todd is fine, but he's on-screen way too much. He was so effective in the first, because his screen time is limited. He was a creepy person, but here he's on way too much. He also had way too much dialog. It isn't Tony's fault though. Kelly Rowan gives an inconsistent performance to say the least. Sometimes she's on, others she's off. She wasn't convincing enough for my liking. Bill Nunn looks like he doesn't wanna be there. He phones it in and collects that check. There is a clever tease in the ending, but the ending was horrible for the most part. When Tony Todd says he dislikes the sequels, you know there is something wrong. This is a boring sequel that should have never been made. I have yet to see Candyman III, but I'm dreading it.

One of the better examples here is the continuing nature of the film's expanding story of how the Candyman came into being, furthering the connection even more than it already did. Bolstering the legend quite well with the flashbacks to his torture and paring that against his legend between the family really makes for an entertaining horror effort. The main attack here concerns the appearance at the curio shop which turns into a thrilling chase through a carnival parade as he continually appears among the patrons, though other attacks are bound throughout here. The penthouse attack where he first appears to her, his attack on the detective in the holding cell and the cemetery attack that leads into the final confrontation are all filled with incredibly chilling and fun action. Likewise, the finale gets a lot right here by managing to come full-circle and fully discloses the back-story from earlier but also mixes in some action and spectacle along the way by using the raging thunderstorm to wash away not only the characters but also the landscape in the water torrent and also forcing into it the escape from the collapsing monument. It's a really fun finish and helps to stave off the few flaws in here. One of the biggest issues here is the irritating and useless voice-over narration from the radio show host that permeates this one as none of what's said is in any way, shape or form original, imperative to the story or gets to the point of the scene by just being utterly irritating quite quickly. This also manages to continue the series long flaw of having no real point for his actions against her since he spends so much of the film time simply appearing behind her without actively making threats. That comes off here as a tired act of something that was utilized in the first one and continues in this one. These here drop this down but not enough to really hurt it.Rated R Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity. "},{"Title":"Candyman Returns, and Now We Have His Origin!","Date":"3 July 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The Candyman (Tony Todd) arrives in New Orleans and sets his sights on a young woman whose family was ruined by the immortal killer years before.So, how did this sequel come to be? Bernard Rose, who had made the original film, had written the first draft of the script, and it is interesting because Candyman never actually appears in it. (Apparently about this time he was also working on a script for Midnight Meat Train, but the eventual film was written by Jeff Buhler, so it does not seem any of Rose's ideas made it very far.) Director Bill Condon actually came in late, only a few months before shooting began. By then, it had gone through multiple drafts and at least three writers (after Rose, Rand Ravich and Mark Kruger were on board). Condon shared an agent with Clive Barker, which helped get him in the director's chair. As he puts it, he was in movie jail and had been stuck making made-for-TV movies for a few years. (As of 2016, he has become wildly successful with Dreamgirls and some Twilight films, just to name a few.) As for the setting, after Cabrini Green, where do you go? Well, there is another impoverished place where the desperate might believe in Candyman New Orleans. And, this film offers him an origin story that was barely fleshed out in the first film. Perhaps we can feel some sympathy for this monster? Although not as strong as the original, this is a solid sequel that keeps the same feel and relies heavily on the same Phil Glass theme music (much of the original soundtrack is carried over). The sequel is more traditional in its approach to horror, being more of a slasher than a mood, and where Candyman was something of a myth in the first film, we now know he truly exists as a flesh and blood being. The mirror theme is brought back, both literally and in new, subtle ways. The lead character has trouble painting her self-portrait&#x85; this is, in a way, the failure to see herself in a mirror.There are a few too many jump or bus scares, but also plenty of decent gore shots for those who need the blood. Roger Ebert noted this, writing, It's got one of those soundtracks where everyday sounds are amplified into gut-churning shockaramas, and where we are constantly being startled by false alarms. Even Condon concedes the point; he calls them boo scares, and is sort of embarrassed about them in retrospect, not realizing how they might play outside of a theater audience.The film has something to say on race and slavery, though it is not heavy-handed about it. So far as I know, Candyman is the first black horror villain to have a sequel since Blacula. With the third installment, he may be the only black horror icon ever to have three films. Although not black myself, it is interesting how the black community has latched on to Tony Todd as their horror icon &#x96; conventions that are typically 90% white male have a bit more color when Todd is a guest.As always, Scream Factory provides some great features on their blu-ray for a film that mainstream movie watchers would not think was worth the trouble. The Bill Condon audio commentary is very insightful, though Condon does tend to stutter and stammer a bit. Along with that are new interviews, including with the Candyman himself, Tony Todd. He deserves the attention. "},{"Title":"Blah","Date":"20 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" 'Candyman Farewell to the Flesh' isn't a bad movie as such, but it's inferior to the original film in just about every way. 'Candyman' didn't really cry out for sequels, and this movie proves that point by being completely redundant and failing to come up with anything more interesting than a less satisfying but bloodier spin on what's gone before. It's well made, it's watchable enough, and it benefits from a likable performance from Timothy Carhart, but it's a typical horror sequel.It's Mardi Gras season in New Orleans, where inner-city school teacher Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan) proves to her class that there is no Candyman by looking into a mirror and saying his name five times. As we know, the Candyman is real - and her brother Ethan (William O'Leary) knows it too, as he's been wrongly accused of the murder of the smug fat bloke from the first film. The real culprit is the hook-handed killer (Tony Todd), back to wreak more havoc in the lives of Annie's family while she delves into the legend to discover the truth. 'Farewell to the Flesh' departs from the original with Annie's deep, dark family secret, which is not only predictable but also totally uninteresting. Other than that it uses the first movie as a template, repeating the black urban setting, the missing kid, an innocent accused of the Candyman's crimes, and the Candyman's spell over Annie. The attempted twists come after far too much draggy set-up where the movie attempts to create mystery about the existence of the Candyman despite this being a sequel to a film where that mystery was resolved. The menace of the character has disappeared; his appearances are too numerous and lacking in impact, and the moments when he pops up to stick his hook through someone's back lack surprise. In the film's biggest mistake we're shown the origin of the Candyman in graphic detail. In the first movie we got a few sound effects and a sinister story, and that was enough. Here we see his hand getting hacked off with a rusty saw and a swarm of bees covering his body before he dies from the stings. The ropey staging and unconvincing period costumes add to the gratuitous and exploitative feeling of the scene, and that's before his soul is captured in a mirror that one of the men lynching him thought to bring along for some illogical reason. It's supposedly justified by the Candyman wanting to show Annie what happened to him, but the writers should have had the restraint to leave it well alone, as it's only there to provide the usual only-way-to-kill-the-monster plot point so beloved of slasher sequels.The Mardi Gras setting adds some colour but has nothing to do with the story and gives us the irrelevant, at times nonsensical radio show that weaves through the movie. The change of location also weakens the Candyman mythos, because an urban legend in one part of a town I can believe, but now apparently everyone in the civilised world has heard of, and lives in fear of, the character. The film tries too hard to turn him into a horror icon along the lines of Freddy or Michael Myers - and it succeeds only too well, because this time around the impact has gone, too much detail is revealed about his origin and the story is a pale imitation of what's gone before. All of which is pretty much par for the course for horror sequels, but as usual, demystifying the central character does nothing but make him less interesting.

Basically in New Orleans, the Latin carnival Mardi Gras is proceeding, farewell to the flesh relates to the festivities, and the carnival is celebrating lent, and it is at this time that murders are being committed around the city. People are still testing out the theory of whether the Candyman (Tony Todd) exists or not, by saying his name in the mirror five times they see if he will appear, and of course every time he does, and brutally kills them. Young schoolteacher Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan) has some connection to the man who became the Candyman, slave Daniel Robitaille who, seen in flashback, was punished for having a relationship with a white woman, and the villagers captured him, sawed his right hand off, replacing it with a large hook, and smothered him in honey (hence the name Candyman) for the bees to cover and sting him to death. She says his name in the mirror five time, but he does not want to kill her, because of the connection she has to him he sees her as his love that he will take back with him to hell, and until she accepts her destiny and goes with him he will kill many people around her, and of course those who call his name five time in the mirror. Of course in the end, following investigations of the origins of the Candyman, numerous people being murdered, including Candyman expert Phillip Purcell (Michael Culkin) and Annie's mother Octavia (Veronica Cartwright), and being accused of involvement in the murders, she finds a way to defeat him and send him back to hell, and he is killed off once again before the end of Mardi Gras. Also starring Timothy Carhart as Paul McKeever, William O'Leary as Ethan Tarrant, Fay Hauser as Pam Carver, Bill Nunn as Reverend Ellis, Matt Clark as Honore Thibideaux, David Gianopoulos as Detective Ray Levesque and Joshua Gibran Mayweather as Matthew Ellis. Todd is still relatively creepy with his hook for a hand and saying a couple of familiar lines in his cool voice, but the rest of the cast are naff, the origins story is relatively good to watch, and the deaths are still bloody, but it is predictable and a bit ridiculous, it is a rather pointless horror sequel.

Here, Candyman is given a back story (and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production) while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants.This is a lifeless and vapid film, one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original, and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress (Kelly Rowan) and gives her an equally uninteresting brother (William O'Leary), neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd, of course, is exceptional, but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film.Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying &#x96; and dated in the worst, mid-1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks, I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired, with Candyman whittling off one character after the other, while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clichéd sub-plots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience, either.

Candyman is not very spooky in this film because we are manipulated to feel sympathy for his plight (his humanity rather than his mythos is emphasised. Without the mythos Candyman is nothing more than a deranged serial killer indulging other people's suicide fantasies but without a will of his own. Hardly the stuff of great horror!)

Not very pretty or sexy either she never seems able to carry the movie. The great Tony Todd suffers from an over exposure of Candyman so not even he can save this mess.A boring and uninteresting flick. If not for the great soundtrack by Phillip Glass and the cool gore it would be a complete waste.Even so its close. Only for the fans of the series. For the rest of the audience skip it. Its not scary, there´s no nudity, no camp fun and you can find better gore pictures than this. Candyman rules but not this film.

Taken from a short story in Clive Barker's Books of Blood, the tale of an urban myth-become-reality has transferred from Liverpool to New Orleans with no perceptible gain in atmosphere or vibrancy.Look in the mirror and say his name five times, and the hook-handed anti-hero pops up to wreak gory havoc on the living. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Director Bill Condon has nothing more to offer than did Rose, whose original movie at least had the excuse that it was riding on the popularity of other murderous movie villains like Freddie and Jason.The story staggers along with laughable predictability, telegraphing it's final twist in pantomimic fashion, with the hook-handed ghoul involved in a nonsensical showdown with the token dreadful leading lady.Sequels invariably fail to live up to the standards of the original and this is no exception. Unfortunately, when the original is a load of blah, you're always going to be on to a loser.  "},{"Title":"More Is Less In This Inferior Sequel","Date":"15 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Like most horror film sequels, Candy-man Farewell To The Flesh is vastly inferior to the original film Candy-man. Tony Todd returns as the candy-man again, and Philip Glass' hypnotic score is used, but that's where the similarities end between the two films. Kelly Rowan, currently from The O.C., stars as a descendant of the candy-man clan in this film. She's a school teacher, provoked by her students into invoking the candy-man curse. Shortly afterward, mayhem starts once again. She's drawn in by the candy-man, and we learn much more about his origins than we care to know in gruesome detail. There are several differences between this film and the first one that make it inferior. First, the pacing of this film is much slower and less taut than the original. This is due partly to the direction and partly to the very gradual revelation about the candy-man's origins. Creators of the first film were smart to realize that the audience didn't need all that exposition to make the story work. Second, the film is set in New Orleans during fat Tuesday, but Bill Condon, the director, does not use the locations effectively.Most of the scenes are filmed on obvious set pieces, which greatly limit the ability of the film to build masterfully like the first one. Real locations helped pull viewers into the myth in the first film. Here, we are too aware that we are watching set pieces. Third, there are numerous red herring boo scenes, even Condon admits this, which greatly limit the fear factor after a while; because, we're just waiting for the next false alarm to scare us. This is a sign that there really isn't much here to scare us in the first place. The first film had little, if any of this; the story propelled its scares naturally by good plot development, not loud cue music. Fourth, the biggest reason why this is inferior to the first film is that Tony Todd appears much more frequently in this film than he does in the original. This, of course, demystifies him so much in our eyes that he becomes ineffective as a scary figure. There's so much posing and posturing by Todd that you can almost hear him getting direction. How often have we heard critics say less is more? Apparently not enough times. Veronica Cartwright, of Lost In Space fame, appears as Rowan's mother. It's hard to believe Condon went on to direct Gods & Monsters. * of 4 stars. "}{"Title":"Average Horror Sequel","Date":"8 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  In this first sequel to Clive Barker's 1992 masterpiece &#145;Candyman' we meet Annie Tarrant (Kelly Rowan), an attractive young teacher who's life is suddenly turned upside down when she becomes involved with the legend of the Candyman (Tony Todd) after calling his name in the mirror following an altercation in her classroom regarding the legend.There's nothing particularly brilliant about this movie, but at the same time there is nothing particularly bad. The storyline is in some ways a rehash of the first movie but still maintains a certain degree of originality and is actually quite interesting for at least one watch. Whereas the original movie was quite dark and suspenseful, &#145;Candyman Farewell to the Flesh' has a somewhat lighter atmosphere despite obviously trying to remain as dark and serious as the original. There are some pacing problems with the movie but generally the film plays well and, despite the odd few scenes that weren't really required, manages to remain at least fairly entertaining.Tony Todd is given more screen time in this movie than he was given the original and it helps to substantiate him as a menacing presence and figure of doom. Unfortunately the extra screen time also loses some of the mystique that the Candyman had in the original movie. Kelly Rowan is great as Annie Tarrant and her interactions with Tony Todd as the Candyman are almost poetic almost like there was some type of chemistry between the two. The rest of the cast were mostly borderline average with their performances but despite that they all worked well together which aided the watchability of &#145;Candyman Farewell to the Flesh'.This movie is worth checking out for fans of the original and is in general an averagely entertaining horror movie. The eerie and occasionally uncomfortable suspense of the original is replaced with a lot more gore and bloodshed which unfortunately is responsible for the loss of the loathsome atmosphere the first beautifully created but in return adds more action and more Candyman. It's not brilliant and definitely not on par with the original but nonetheless I personally think that it's worth watching at least once and is far superior to the abominable &#145;Candyman Day of the Dead'. My rating for &#145;Candyman Farewell to the Flesh' &#150; 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Disappointing, fright-free sequel","Date":"8 October 2005","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Many die-hard horror fans (myself included) absolutely worship the original Candyman because it's so genuinely scary and intelligently adapted from a Clive Barker story. This sequel (it looks more like a prequel, actually, with all those flashbacks) is not entirely unwatchable, it just immensely pales in comparison to the original, like so many other redundant sequels do. It seems like director Bill Condon and his army of crew members totally missed the point of Barker's tale and of the original film. Candyman isn't really about the killer himself! It's about the whole myth/urban legend behind his persona and how it scares superstitious people that believe in it. Is he real or are the bloody murders only committed in his name? Farewell to the Flesh pretty much takes away the entire mystery-aspect, as it extendedly reveals the origin of the Candyman character. Besides, we already heard the brief version of that story in the original. The rest of the film revolves on Annie Tarrant, who becomes dangerously close with the hook-handed bogeyman when she starts investigating her family history. The script suffers from too many tedious moments, there's almost no connection with the characters and the voice-over radio dude really annoyed the hell out of me. The violence is not that disturbing here as in the first film, but part two also definitely has its cruel and nasty moments. Tony Todd acts like he realizes that this is an inferior sequel and he doesn't really bother anymore to look (and sound) truly nightmarish. Judging by the other user-comments on this site, Candyman 2 Farewell to the Flesh appears to be reasonably successful and repeatedly referred to as a worthwhile sequel... Well, I disagree. I think it's a waste of time totally not worth of the Candyman-title.

Typical sequel for a horror, yet there is much more blood and guts than an investigation. Much of the acting is more sillier than the original. So is the dialogue (The Candyman himself steps up his silly one-liners a notch). Everything that there was to like in CANDYMAN stays in its sequel.The Candyman is in New Orleans killing people and an innocent man claims he is the killer. Our innocent guy's sister, an elementary teacher is having none of this and does some investigating of her own to find the real killer.The story of Candyman is taken deeper but that is just about all that FAREWELL TO THE FLESH has going for it. Everything is either boring or silly. It has the same sound track from the original. Learning more about the Candyman does not save this over done sequel from falling flat on its face.

There is infinitely more to that brilliant film than black dude kills people with hook. However, if that was what you liked about it, heck, you might enjoy this. Bigger, not better. The first carefully built up, this goes through the motions. This begins with a dull retelling of the myth(which, as you may remember, took time to get to last time around... and no, that wasn't an accident), and then, perplexingly, proceeds to go over it again(and showing flashbacks to what we already know happened... does a different way of saying the exact same thing count as creativity now?). This spells out what the first hinted at so expertly. Is it really such a tough concept? If we are not told a lot, we will fill in the blanks, and what we imagine will be lightyears past what can be put on a screen. I love this medium, but you can't possibly think that one set idea is superior to each individual viewer's imagination. This tries to explain things that ought to remain unclear, and the effort is boring. Todd gets increased screen-time(and is given lofty-sounding BS to spew, half of it doesn't make a lick of sense... and yes, of course he can deliver it impeccably), and as you probably already know, the man can not look bad regardless of how he is presented. Still, it isn't satisfying. We become used to it, obviously. This awkwardly forces in kills by him, in spite of the strict rules related to that. The continuity is screwed over repeatedly, unless you consider this to be an alternative to the '92 one(it needed no sequels, it was *perfectly* self-contained). This is utterly predictable, it is no longer clever or layered, and the script increases in stupidity at an exponential rate as it progresses, until it spins out of control and then blissfully ends, on what you know is a low note. They didn't even bother to experiment, this uses the same score, and a ton of other things that worked in the film preceding this, without nearing it in atmosphere at all. The plot exists solely to provide a follow-up. A slasher? Arguably, though this is lousy regardless. This has boo-scares that don't pay off by the truckload. The FX are poor(and not necessarily convincing), including the make-up. Acting is decent at best(the kids are *atrocious*). I also personally couldn't stand Kingfish, absolutely painful, and he just would not shut up. What is memorable about this? Name me one thing that is remotely interesting in this, that was introduced in this. There is a lot of disturbing content, bloody(at times gory) violence, a little strong language and sexuality, and brief female nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this purely to those looking for bland horror that delivers what you'd expect and *nothing* else. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Candyman Farewell To The Flesh (Bill Condon, 1995) **","Date":"29 October 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film.Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook.While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres &#150; and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved... "},{"Title":"Candyman II  Farewell To Finesse","Date":"20 June 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Candyman II is a shame. It's not only a mediocre attempt to expand on a series than should've never even been but a single movie, but it influences a ridiculous 'showdown' plot in order to satisfy the most brainless of horror movie fans. And it works. First off, let me say how proud I am to see how much director Bill Condon has grown up. This is a well-filmed movie indeed, with spectacular camera angles and (attempted) hearty characters. But no matter how good Condon can be, there is no substitute for Bernard Rose, the original director of the franchise and the headman of the first film. The movie is filmed in an entirely different funk than the first one, and no matter how much it tries, just because it has the same music, it can't be nearly as complex. It's disappointing, seeing how such a fantastic movie as the original Candyman is was shuffled this soulless sequel on a platter. So, I shall continue. The second and most definite problem of the movie is the acting. Despite Tony Todd's and Kelly Rowan's incredible performances, the rest of the acting is bland and uninspired, which, I guess fills out the forms of the characters as well. In the first film, we were fitted with a cast of interesting and unique characters whom we quickly grew to love. Now, instead, there are waves of generic persons who everyone can predict exactly what they'll do next. To it's effort, the movie is a bit character driven, but mostly by the main character, who this time around, is actually Candyman himself. The third problem with this movie, is, well, absolutely unforgivable. And that's the effects. While there's a sure amount of decent guttings and chop-em-up effects, all of the major effects of the movie are executed in not only a poorly manner, but look absolutely terrible (especially the death of Candyman effect, which is done entirely by computer graphics and is quite possibly the worst looking CGI segment of all time). I loved how the director wanted to show more this time around, but too many effects end up as just overly outrageous and unbelievable. It's sad, seeing how much potential these moments had. The final, and ultimately greatest, problem of the movie is one thing the scare factor. The first movie delivered dozens of scares, and did it without you knowing when or how it would happen. With this movie, not only does it offer only a couple (thats right, two) scares, but you can see them coming from miles away. It's so sad. The actors try, the director tries, the effects manager...attempts lazily, and the scriptwriters try, but in the end, this is like a baby Hitler it followed after something that died gracefully, and never should have been conceived, for it caused a lot of pain. Especially on us horror movie freaks. So, on it's own, Candyman Farewell to Flesh Can Be considered a good horror flick. The only problem is that it's not an original project, and it's instead a sequel with major plot holes and theories that crap upon the first (and better) flick. So now I'm off to watch Candyman 3. Who knows, it might just be the sequel I was looking for.

Like the first movie, things only get interesting when Candyman is on the screen, and while he's seen more in this one then the last its still pretty crappy.There were some improvements on the original in many ways. Candyman looked better, eliminating the big, puffy fur collar on his coat. There were more killings, and some creative effects (when Candyman's face is scratched, bees crawl out of the wound). Also, Candyman finally gets around to killing the doughy,  pony-tailed professor who somehow escaped death in the first movie.But this movie is, overall, nothing special. It's slow, the actors are dull or annoying, and most scenes of dramatic dialog have all the flare of a made-for-cable TV movie. Also, the movie takes place in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, but this colorful setting is hardly exploited at all.So far the Candyman movies have been pretty lame, but I will probably endure Candyman 3 because Tony Todd's creation has the potential to become a great horror icon. He's a fantastic character with wonderful screen presence who is tapped in dull, poorly shot movies, and I won't give up hope, because it took a couple of sequels for horror greats like Jason Vorhees to get up to speed.

We know what happens after that, and this film does all the expected with style if nothing else. Rowan's family, friends, and associates meet the hooks of the Candyman, and a hidden family secret which ties into the Candyman's past is presented. We learn why the Candyman is the way he is, etc... Okay, some of this was interesting, but much was just silly. Tony Todd gives another creepy, over-the-top performance as the man of dreams and pain(alright even now I am sounding like some of that tripe he spews). In some ways I enjoyed this film more than its original. The New Orleans setting is effectively shot and some of the character acting is decent. I especially liked the opening scene and the actor playing the professor. The murders are executed with lots of gusto as well. Again, I am just not a big fan of the Barbara Cartland-type romance between the Candyman and the girl amidst murder and mayhem. It just bores me. Nonetheless, Candyman 2 is a decent sequel in many regards. I think it will keep those that liked the first entertained, though they will more than likely enjoy the original far more.
