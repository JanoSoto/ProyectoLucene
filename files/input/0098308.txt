There's no swearing in this movie;they only say b**ch once, that's it. There's no violence, there is however some sex-related talk. Except for that, it's a good clean movie. A great movie for fathers and daughters to watch together. Lots of very '80's hair, clothes,and music!Very funny, very cute, a good choice. I recommend it! "},{"Title":"Danza's cheesy daddy dilemma. (spoilers)","Date":"4 March 2006","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" She's Out of Control was actually one of two light comedies released in 1989 regarding overprotective, single fathers and their fifteen year old daughters who have just started dating. The other was Dream Date, a made-for-TV comedy with Clifton Davis and The Cosby Show's Tempestt Bledsoe. Considering some of the minor characters in Dream Date (including Pauley Shore as a brain-dead high school student who was convinced that the father is the devil) and it being predicated upon more slapstick humor than we saw in She's Out of Control, it is a bit funnier in comparison, although probably geared for the more wholesome family film choice. But in the end, there is still something lacking (and probably at my age, I would no longer find it all that funny) in a tale of an obsessive, overbearing father trying to prevent his teenagedaughter from participating in the dating game.Be prepared for extra doses of Tony Danza, if you can. Here, he plays Southern California radio-show manager and single dad Doug Simpson, who's eldest daughter, Katie (Ami Dolenz)has just dropped her dorky vices (braces, magnified glasses) and gotten a make over. Now it seems, every boy in town is calling her or showing up at her doorstep to court her. And while this comes as a shock to her father at first, despite the insistence of his girlfriend, Janet (Catherine Hicks) that this is all normal for the girl and in fact, good for her, he is still unconvinced and becomes not only paranoid, but soon enters therapy.Doug's therapist, Doctor Fishbinder (Wallace Shawn), decides that his book would serve as a handy guide, which encourages Doug only to intervene into his daughter's dating choices even further. On the one hand this is funny (such as the scenes with him walking in on a party and then befriending her misunderstood boyfriend, which winds up costing him his Jaguar), but on the other, the repetition may start to weigh on the viewer as the story becomes insurmountably ridiculous (I'm not sure where Danza was going with the explanation about being involved in the lunch counter sit-ins when he is under the impression that Leroy might have come to pick up his daughter for a date).I would have to agree that this movie suffers from being too dated. That the appeal to audiences around the time of this film's release was probably the fashion, the music, even the actors themselves (Ami Dolenz for younger audiences and probably, Tony Danza, before he because more of a pop culture joke), things which are probably very cheesy by today's standards. Yet, I'm sure it is still a favorite among 80s nostalgics (although, I'll pass on this one). In any event, I think this kind of story much better done with Dream Date. Because it was a made-for-TV movie, it had to be sweet and concise.

This is the old cliche about the ugly girl with braces and glasses getting a makeover and suddenly ALL the boys want her.  Basically, Dad, who to me is just Tony from Who's the Boss, takes the backseat in her life and this new hottie with no personality gets tons of invites on dates, etc, etc.  To me, this movie is priceless because it has a high school prom scene, which, when done is the 80s, was just too cool.  NO ONE DANCES LIKE THAT!  Heehee.  I saw this when I was 9 and remember thinking how cool all the clothes looked.  I didn't like the stepmom, because she was just too crazy.  Basically, the only good thing about this movie is it's a priceless bit o' eighties history and nostalgic.  No one can make a movie this simple nowadays without getting laughed out of the director's office. Ah, those were the days....

An obvious and clumsy attempt to make Danza's then-current Who's The Boss? series into a theatrical movie, Danza replicates his overprotective father with a popular daughter to a near-pedophilic degree (something that, with more than a bit of irony, the film touches upon).The script hits every clich√© in the book, from ugly duckling turned into tousled-blonde It Girl, to crackers psychiatrist who turns out not to know anything about his subject, to the lolita in a swimsuit (with amazing lack of support) jiggling in the surf in slow motion, to the string of young punk suitors, to the Recapturing of Youth scene -- complete with candy-red Jag yet -- to the final scene of the younger daughter replicating the same behavior as the wayward lass. The resolution is far too pat, there are a few too many plot holes (excuse me, what orthodontist would pull braces from a minor on the say so of her father's girlfriend?), and surprisingly enough -- given that she loses few opportunities to do so on the 7th Heaven set -- Catherine Hicks is the only principal to avoid shameless overacting.In this alleged comedy, there are few smiles, no laughs, and very little that is entertaining or edifying. Give it a miss, unless you're wont to use VHS tapes as kindling for your fireplace.3/10, and that's fairly generous.

And this movie is no exception.Tony Danza plays Doug Simpson, a widowed father who's been raising his 2 daughters pretty much alone since their mother died.  And according to him (which I agree with) he's done a pretty good job of it.  He pretty regularly gets help from his girlfriend, Janet, played almost flawlessly by Catherine Hicks.  His life seems to be perfect and in control.  Then he goes on a routine business trip and comes home to find his eldest daughter, Katie, the hottest ticket in town.  Doug is in a state of shock and isn't used to guys calling all hours of the night, and Katie coming and going as she pleases. So he seeks help in a psychologist who specializes in father/daughter relationships.  But can the doctor help him before Doug does something that he will regret?This movie isn't the kind of movie you'd see on an Oscar Ballot but is fun to watch.  Tony Danza is perfectly cast as the nervous but loving father, Doug.  Ami Dolenz is well cast as Katie.  She actually looks like she's having fun playing the character.  Of course, who wouldn't enjoy playing a character that everyone thinks is hot and wants to date.   Laura Mooney steals every scene she's in as the sarcastic and under-appreciated younger sister Bonnie.  Matthew Perry (Friends) has a small part in this movie as one of the guys Katie goes out with.It's also interesting to try and guess who exactly Katie is going to end up with in the end.If you're in the mood for a sweet, often funny movie, or a fan of any of the cast, then I highly recommend this movie for you.

Although I was a guy, I was fascinated by the idea of a geek who miraculously changes and ends up conquering all. It seemed to me like an underdog story, and I've always liked that kind of story. But upon rushing to the theater on opening night--April 14, 1989--I was surprised to discover that the movie was really about the dad and his obsession over protecting his daughter. Still, I found it enjoyable enough, even with the PG rating.Exactly 25 years later, I find myself typing a review after having watched She's Out of Control for the second time--on DVD, and on my Xbox One. What compelled me to revisit a movie so notoriously reviled by Siskel and Ebert? I suppose I just wanted to watch again it 25 years to the day (for the perfect timing), and see it from the perspective of a 42-year-old, as opposed to my 17-year-old self in 1989.As many others have noted, this movie is really a movie-length sitcom with some mild profanity, and some other PG-rated material. It's mostly harmless, at least for people 10 and older. It doesn't break any new ground or develop its themes in any insightful way, but I found it reasonably entertaining and likable. It's what you call a family movie, meaning that it tries to appeal to everybody--children, teens, and adults.Those of you looking for late 80s nostalgia will be bombarded with music video-inspired editing and closeups, Paula Abdul-choreographed dancing, and Aqua Net-assisted hair. The girls' bedroom, with its George Michael poster, oversized Swatch clock, and Apple IIc, particularly encapsulates the final years of the Pastel Decade. Also, look for appearances by Todd Bridges and Dustin Diamond.So, what do I think of it today? Am I any smarter than I was in 1989, two months before my high school graduation? Nah, I'm still stupid--and had a good time being stupid for the second time.Exactly 25 years from now--April 14, 2039--I may find myself watching She's Out of Control for the THIRD time--in 4K. If IMDb still exists, I'll be sure to let all of you know about it on the review page.Happy 25th birthday, She's Out of Control.

This is a mediocre effort. I could use the word 'extremely', but the movie does have its moments. But mostly this plays like an episode of a sitcom that's been on the air for several years and has run out of ideas. Catherine Hicks is the only one who turns in a believable performance. And I did not believe, for a second, any of the scenes that take place in the psychiatrist's office. Yes, Danza's character needs help alright, but the acting between these two didn't convince me he was really getting it. Danza's hamming it up here, and a couple scenes towards the end are predictable.

It's one of those films that are good to watch really late at night, when you really just want to wind down.  It is pretty silly, but it has some funny moments.  Ami Dolenz can't act very well, but in the role she is playing it really doesn't matter.  Dana Ashbrook is very amusing as the leather clad boyfriend from hell.  But Matthew Perry is not particularly convincing as the all too perfect Yale college boy.  Tony Danza seems to be treating the whole exercise like an extended version of a Who's the Boss? episode, which is probably why he was given the part.  Although it's not very original, and similar theme films have done it much better, it's still not a bad effort.  At least it was not boring.

If you don't take yourself too seriously, and you can appreciate a good light hearted comedy once in a while this movie is for you. Call it what you will-- cheesy, over-the-top, etc., at face value this movie succeeds. Tony Danza does a good job at playing the loving dad, and the rest of the cast does well also. This movie works well mainly, in my opinion, because of the music. From Bobby Vinton's Venus, to the Kinks, this movie exhibits all sorts of music. It's used appropriately and timely. Overall the movie is a fun comedy. Now, some other reviewers, like the guy who posted on July 7 of 2000 and gave it one star, he just basically ripped his review off Ebert (go to rogerebert.suntimes.com and look the film up if you want proof) so his opinion isn't valid. He probably hasn't seen it. Just to reiterate, you don't have to lower your intellectual standards to enjoy this. If the only way you can enjoy a film is if it is labeled as independent and it has unwarranted nudity and absurdity, you might not like this. If you saw Donnie darko and now you talk down to people when speaking about it because you think you've gone to the far ends of the earth to expose yourself to new kinds of film, then you take yourself way to seriously and give yourself too much credit. If you are like me and you enjoy a vast array of films of all types, then you may like this movie. But if you hate good music you might also hate this film.

This movie does not disappoint. Danza's performance is one for the ages. I would say the ages of 6 through ten years old. Although I loved the movie, I had a hard time following the complex story-line. Danza's portrayal of a father trying to control his daughter (hence the clever movie title) ranks up there with Olivier, Brando and Kutcher. How this movie did not get Oscar consideration is beyond me. I would warn that Danza's character does launch into profanity laced tirades quite often. This is a great movie for the whole family. I have two movies that I play endlessly for my two month old The Godfather Two and She's Outta Control. Enrich your lives, enrich your worlds and enrich Tony Danza's pocket, buy this movie. I prefer the video version over the DVD version because of the better audio and visual qualities.Thoughts and prayers out there who do not see this gem! "}]
