[{"Title":"A must to see for anyone who liked THE OMEN.","Date":"10 November 2001","Score":"39 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  This sequel to THE OMEN is a fun film.  It continues the story of the anti-Christ Damien into his teenage years and his years in military school. Now adopted into the family of his father's brother, an unsuspecting Damien is unwittingly at the centre of a plot to bring Satan's son to the threshold of power.  Everyone around him is at risk as the secret of Damien's birth is under threat of exposure by forces emerging from around the world - and at the root of this threat are the mad depictions painted on an ancient wall that reveal the very face of evil.Jonathon Scott-Taylor gives a commanding and creepy performance as the ultimate misfit son.  Looking particularly significant in his military outfit, Scott-Taylor captures - as much as the script allows him - the torment of self-discovery as the truth of his existence is revealed to him. The script could have demanded more from such a fascinating scenario, and tried to make Damien more of a Miltonic Satanic Hero, but the film chooses to go for as much shock value whenever it can.  Mysterious and violent accidents - linked by the ever-present shadow of a raven of death - dominate this movie from beginning to end.  The scene involving an ill-fated lady on a deserted country road is one of its most grotesque.  As death and destruction mount, Damien goes from self-possessed orphan to self-recognized supreme power in the span of two hours.William Holden and Lee Grant play Damien's surrogate parents, Richard and Ann Thorn.  They are not really allowed to display their incredible talents in this film, but Holden does fine trying to duplicate Peck's memorable performance in the original. Grant does what she can with this supporting role, but has a great moment in the film that proves worthy to wait for. The always wonderful Sylvia Sidney makes a memorable appearance as one of Damien's greatest thorns - the troublemaking menace Aunt Marion. And the ending is a bit of a shock if you watch the film closely, particularly if you listen to the exposition early on in the film about The Whore of Babylon.Another highlight is Jerry Goldsmith's title score - empowering, commanding and downright evil, the opening score is one of my favorites.Although not as creepy as the first film, DAMIEN OMEN II has its moments, and is worth seeing for anyone who likes to have a fun time with all this biblical stuff.

DamienOmen II is an ambitious and entertaining sequel to the classic Omen. This film is an almost perfect stepping stone in the Omen trilogy, focusing on Damien Thorn becoming a teenager. The film obviously lacks the fresh originality of the first film but it still deserves credit for maintaining a sense of dread and menace when somebody crosses the young Damien Thorn. The death scenes are both chilling and creative and the film's trademark score is brilliant. As far as sequels go, Omen II is a solid effort, leading the pathway clearly open for the third chapter. In terms of comparison Omen II doesn't surpass the original but if you enjoyed the Omen then DamienOmen II shouldn't disappoint.

It has one thing that I particularly liked that moment of indecision,when Damien, in a mirror of Jesus asks himself, why is it me. The moment when whatever innocence is in him is finally lost. William Holden and Lee Grant are excellent as his aunt and uncle, and there are several actors who cement their acting careers in the parts they play in this film. I am referring to Robert Foxworth for one, and Lance Henrickson for another. Silvia Sydney is one of of her last roles as Aunt Marion (smelling of Lilac or lavender) and the one really weak role was Nicholas Pryor as the director of the Thorn Museum. I am truly sorry for those people who did not care for this film, as it is head and shoulders above most of the Anti-Christ movies made. If you liked the first one this is a must see.

Another one, another remake! Oh, well, this just isn't going to stop. So, anyways, I saw The Omen last year and figured I should finish the trilogy. I am curious and frankly, a bit creeped out that the new Omen is being released on 06-06-2006, 666, get it?The story itself is pretty good actually, now that Damien has been under the care of his aunt and uncle, strange things are happening again.

I think it was everything that The Exorcist is made out to be by fans and critics all over the world thrilling, intriguing and incredibly creepy. With it's apocalyptic open ending a second part could only take away from the original's ending.The truth is, Damien Omen II is by no means as bad as it could have been. Sure, the excitement and the perfect structure of the original aren't there. Basically, this plays out like an early ancestor of the Final Destination-franchise. Characters become aware of who Damien is and from this point on we know they're doomed and anticipate their gruesome death. Most of all the movie is muddled with bad character development. Lance Henriksen's character, for instance, is never elaborated on. It doesn't make him any more mysterious, it just feels incomplete.A good portion of the movie is spent with nothing much going on except for a few people dying around Damien while he just keeps on living a completely normal life unaware of who he his. Then, all of a sudden everything happens way too quickly. Damien finds out about his destiny and immediately accepts it. The same goes for his father, who is infuriated at first when someone suggests that his son might be Satan's spawn, only to accept that fact shortly afterwards. The final climax and ending arrive just as quickly leaving you wondering why the whole thing was so unbalanced.Still, as long as it's running Damien Omen II doesn't fail to entertain. Like every Omen-movie up to and including The Final Conflict this one has this nice 70's UK-flair that you can get lost in for a few hours on homey evenings in front of the television. It may not be enough to make the series go down in history as one of the best, but these movies are all very watchable in one sitting, making this one of the most coherent franchises of the horror genre.

Don Taylor's sequel, of course, has nothing on Richard Donner's original; and even though the film often gets too convoluted and is more than a little bit silly, The Omen II follows on from the original nicely and is an overall worthy sequel. For the sequel, the action has expectedly moved to America; and the film delivers more of the uncompromising gore that helped to round off the original as an all round horror masterpiece. Logically, the film picks up the story of Damien seven years after his father, Robert Thawn, tried to kill him under mysterious circumstances. The film starts off with the revelation that Damien Thawn is the antichrist, and from there we follow him as he joins military school, comes under the guidance of one of Satan's disciples and violently disposes of anyone who stands a chance of discovering his real identity! Jonathan Scott-Taylor is the actor given the honour of portraying the son of the devil this time around, and it has to be said that he does a really good job with it; even though the actor has hardly been seen since. William Holden is no Gregory Peck, but he does well in the older lead actor role; and he receives good backup from Lee Grant in the role of his wife. The cast is rounded off by cult stars Nicholas Pryor and Lance Henriksen. The plot pacing can be a little hard to follow, and not all the plot threads (the ones involving Thawn Industries in particular) are able to come through properly. However, director Don Taylor combats this by adding in an over the top and gory murder sequence every time the plot looks like it's going downhill. Here we have people burning to death, freezing to death, having their eyes plucked out and - of course - being cut in half in an elevator! The film just about carries off a mysterious religious tone throughout, and I was pleased that the film didn't get bogged down with theories surrounding Damien. The film ends with a nice little twist, before once again leaving the series open for a sequel - which, of course, it got three years later. The Omen II isn't a classic or must see; but it's a nice sequel.

No longer a toddler, Damien is closing in on his 13th birthday. While most pre-teens must cope with puberty and the confusion that accompanies it, Damien (portrayed by Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is more pre-occupied with his destiny, which is that of the son of the Satan, The Anti-Christ. He is now living with his Uncle and attends a military academy where he is quick to put his peers in his place and is encouraged by a sketchy teacher (the one and only Lance Henriksen!) who encourages him to read a passage in the Bible that tells him all he needs to know about himself. If only every teenager were given such guidance!The film faced an uphill battle when its original director, Mike Hodges, was swapped out for Don Taylor, but thankfully, the end results aren't as compromised as one would expect. On the contrary, Damien The Omen II is a rather solid companion piece to the Richard Donner original, with death scenes that are every bit as ground-breaking for their time and still shocking today (all about the crow pecking out the eyeballs) and a great cast that includes William Holden, Lee Grant and Elizabeth Shepard. Scott-Taylor seems born to have played Damien, managing the dynamics of being a sympathetic character turned a bone-chilling menace quite effectively. The film may rush a bit to its ending, which is perhaps its only flaw, but on the whole, it's a worthy follow-up that is almost every bit as mean and memorable as its predecessor.

I've seen some reviews here and elsewhere that bring up legitimate gripes, but I simply don't care. I love this movie and that's all that matters, it is high on my list of all-time favorites and I still often watch it once a year during winter, much like The Shining and other classics. The mood is appropriately foreboding throughout, and I've never seen another actor in my life that could so perfectly portray Damien as Jonathan Scott-Taylor---he was BORN to play Damien!! This is one of the first truly creepy movies I saw as a kid. It's fascinating to see the opulence in which Damien is raised and how he still feels empty in spite of it, knowing he is part of something bigger that hasn't been revealed. This is especially well conveyed in the lake house scenes where everyone is happy for Damien's brother's birthday on what should have been an ideal vacation as enjoyed by a privileged class, yet Damien knows something is......wrong. He still feels only emptiness, loneliness. I also enjoyed the sense of sheer dread in the elevator scene and the cackling raven in the roadside scene. You absolutely MUST watch the original Omen movie before this one, it is essential to the storyline and even better than this superior film. Unfortunately, Omen III totally dropped the ball and left a hideous black mark on the series. It's a shame someone couldn't have done a better job of completing the trilogy, perhaps someone will eventually....but not through excessive CGI, through mood and clever writing, as seen in the first two films.Highly recommended! Make sure to watch The Omen first...

Johnathon-Scott-Taylor is excellent as 13-year old Damien Thorn. There are some good suspenseful scares along the way, but instead of Rottweiler dogs foreshadowing that something evil is soon to happen, we get some menacing crows.Injuries and deaths occur in several different places; one to a reporter on a deserted highway, a man who falls through the ice while playing hockey on a frozen lake, a chemical plant, and a hospital doctor who gets graphically electrocuted by a suddenly malfunctioning elevator. The predictability is exactly what the audience would expect. Those who get too close to Damian in discovering who he is or anger him in any way usually suffer serious consequences, that most often involve death.Despite its predictability, the second Omen movie works because of young Johnathon Scott-Taylor's portrayal of Damien. There is a calmness within his character that gradually builds to anger when Damien is provoked or questioned. But Damien also sends a message that he feels bad after he has killed or hurt someone, and even worse, because he can't do anything about it. This is where Omen II is the only area where it is better than the original Omen. In the original Omen, Harvey Stephens played Damian amazingly well. However, because of his age, didn't really talk or converse his feelings about why he killed or hurt others. In Omen II, after Damian discovers who he is, he runs through the trees as if trying to escape the horror inside of him. You can feel the emotional impact, Why Me???! Why Me???! he cries.Being a teenager gives Damien more groundwork to explore his identity. I would have liked him to further discover his background. Adding additional dimensions to the why? element of Damien's personality would have made the film better. Unfortunately, the downside is that after the Why Me? Why Me? scene, nothing is answered, and Omen II goes back to Damien killing people who get in his way, without the substance that the movie could have had.The acting of Johnathon Scott-Taylor is very good, and there are enough suspenseful moments to make Damien-Omen II, better than most sequels of the horror era.

Now, I'm only fourteen, but I just loved this movie (and Jonathan Scott-Taylor). This is definitely a movie that I'm going to record on video to watch again, and again. On to the movie itself. It was very well acted and had good graphics for it's time. People rag on some of the death scenes, but I have to say that I was impressed with what they had. Maybe Joanne's death was a little silly, but I liked that you could even have a little bit of a laugh. I thought all of the characters were well acted, and that Jonathan Scott-Taylor was, in my opinion and a decent amount of others, the best Damien to hit the screen. With his eyes and black hair, he really set the feel of being the Antichrist. He was really, really good. The thing that I loved was how Jon made you almost feel bad for Damien. Like, when he killed Mark and then let out a strangled yell. There were even tears. It was especially heart-wrenching that Damien didn't even know he was the Antichrist until half-way through the movie. It was so sad when he screamed at the top of his lungs why it had to be him that was born of the devil and a jackal. Overall, it was a strong movie and I highly recommend it to people who enjoyed the first film, have an open mind and aren't to hard on things like this. Afterall people, it's just a movie.

The script and direction is a letdown but it could have been much worse.The acting isn't as good as the original Omen. William Holden and Lance Hendriksen are awesome as always but the rest of the cast fail to impress in any way. None of them are bad, but the material doesn't give them anything juicy to do. Holden and Hendriksen can do great even when the script sucks but that can't be said about other actors.Script is where Damien Omen II falls flat. 2/3 of the film are just recycled material from the original Omen, almost beat for beat. The setup and the way plot goes is almost the same. The only difference is the fact that Damien is older and can start to understand who he is, but , sadly, he is beyond underdeveloped and all the possibilities for interesting character study are lost. It just looked like producers wanted this film to be more like first Omen and made the writer cut the psychological character heavy stuff out. If they went for character study and mixed it with satanist horror, Damien Omen II would have been a great horror film that would rival the original or, even Exorcist. But what we have here is fairly decent and entertaining but hardly memorable.Direction by Don Taylor is nothing you would write home about. Not terrible and not very good. When you look at his filmography, you will see that he has done a lot of TV work and it explains the very TV movie feeling Damien Omen II brings. It's not as cinematic or interesting as original but by no means bad. Just looks fairly bland, but few with a director with a certain visual touch, this film could have looked great. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is cool and moody as always. It's not as memorable as the previous film but still manages to bring the creepy satanic feel up.Damien Omen II is bland and has markings of a great sequel. But like many other horror sequels, this film just reminds us how great the original film was. It's hardly the worst sequel out there and it's no Exorcist II The Heretic but you can hardly call anything but okay. If you liked the original and want to see how they continue the story, it's worth checking out for William Holden alone.

Lee Grant also took a good stab at the performance however not as creepy as Billie Whitelaw's and William Holden also gave a solid performance but not as good as Gregory Peck's .

However it does have a few silly flaws in it that can be rather ridiculous to believe which can make the film a little confusing . Top that off with a little bit of a twist towards the last closing seconds of the film and an ending which speaks for it-self and you have a good film that any horror movie fan would want to check out .

While not a perfect sequel, it is above average compared to most horror movie sequels. We follow Damien on the verge of becoming a teenager, as forces around him begin to make way for his foretold rise to power, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. The Thorn family is portrayed with excellency once again here, as we see Damien's interactions with his aunt and uncle and cousin Mark. The story flows along nicely, which is a strong point this sequel has. Despite moments of dull, slow pacing, it manages to keep you interested. The movie almost plays like a coming-of-age story rather than a horror movie. Damien is just beginning to uncover his destiny, learning more about his place in the world and what's to come. A good deal of time is spent on the Thorn family business, giving us a taste of what's to come for young Damien. The idea that the antichrist is the nephew of a rich and powerful businessman, attending a wealthy academy is somewhat creepy. One thing that seems to have no basis in the film, however, is the fact that everyone sees Damien as somewhat of a bad seed. Where this notion came about is beyond me, because at no point in the film is Damien uncontrollable or anything resembling a problem child. In fact, he carries on quite calmly, delivering his dialogue with a tranquil oddity that hints that something is a little off with him. Lacking the stylish direction of its predecessor, the film still manages to unfold the tale of Damien's self-realization and acceptance of destiny very well. A few odd deaths come every so often, to those who suspect Damien's true nature, and don't really serve the plot much purpose. One thing that makes the film great, though, is the lack of a villain. Never in the film is Damien portrayed as an absolutely evil and malevolent force. In fact, we somewhat feel for him and what he's going through. Damien isn't the one killing people here (at least not in the first hour) and he's not acting out violently, going on killing sprees for the hell of it. This film does well to portray the purity of evil, and the fact that it can reside in the embodiment of a boy. Despite a few over-the-top deaths, this film carries on what The Omen did by not over-milking the story with upside down crosses and images of demons or gargoyles. It's all very realistic and manages to scare us with what we don't see. Watch this film to see Damien slowly succumbing to his fate, and see by the end of the film how it changes him. While not a superbly crafted film, it's well above average for a horror sequel and carries on the legacy of Damien Thorn perfectly.

Seltzer refused as he had no interest in writing sequels. Years later, Seltzer commented that had he written the story for the second Omen, he would have set it the day after the first movie, with Damien a child living in The White House. With Seltzer turning down Omen II, producer Harvey Bernhard duly outlined the story himself, and Stanley Mann was hired to write the screenplay.After Bernhard had finished writing the story outline and was given the green light to start the production, the first person he contacted was Jerry Goldsmith because of the composer's busy schedule. Bernhard also felt that Goldsmith's music for The Omen was the highest point of that movie, and that without Goldsmith's music, the sequel would not be successful. Goldsmith's Omen II score uses similar motifs to his original Omen score, but for the most part, Goldsmith avoided re-using the same musical cues. In fact, the first movie's famous Ave Satani theme is used only partially, just before the closing credits begin. Goldsmith composed a largely different main title theme for Omen II, albeit one that utilises Latin phrases as Ave Satani had done. Goldsmith's Omen II score allows eerie choral effects and unusual electronic sound designs to take precedence over the piano and Gothic chanting.Richard Donner, director of the first Omen movie, was not available to direct the second, as he was busy working on Superman. British film director Mike Hodges was hired to helm the movie. During production, the producers believed that Hodges' methods were too slow, and so they fired him and replaced him with Don Taylor, who had a reputation for finishing films on time and under budget. However, the few scenes Hodges directed (some of the footage at the factory and at the military academy, all of the early archaeology scenes, and the dinner where Aunt Marion shows her concern about Damien) remained in the completed film, for which Hodges retains a story credit. In recent interviews, Hodges has commented sanguinely on his experiences working on Omen II.Academy Award-winning veteran actor William Holden was the original choice to star as Robert Thorn in the first Omen, but turned it down as he did not want to star in a picture about the devil. Gregory Peck was selected as his replacement. The Omen went on to become a huge hit and Holden made sure he did not turn down the part of protagonist Richard Thorn in the sequel. Lee Grant, another Oscar-winner, was a fan of the first Omen and accepted enthusiastically the role of female protagonist-later-turncoat Ann Thorn.Ray Berwick (1914&#x96;1990) trained and handled the crows used for several scenes in the film. Live birds and a crow-puppet were used for the attack on photojournalist Joan Hart. Berwick also trained the avian actors in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963).This more-than-competent sequel to The Omen raises some interesting questions about the nature of free will can the Antichrist deny his birthright?

The second is full of human devil acolytes, protecting and grooming Damien.This story has the seed of a good movie, because you have a child that is the son of the devil, but also he is the loved (and loving) child of the families that raised him. The inner conflict and powerful struggle that could have been portrayed here are reduced to a single scene when the boy realizes who he is and cries Why me?. Afterwards he's totally OK with it.And in this part all kind of people die in the most imaginative ways. People that didn't need to die, were less than a threat and were really ridiculous. I mean, you have your basic two sides, good versus evil; the good ones are represented by hysterical people talking gibberish and immediately dismissed as total lunatics; the bad ones have cunning men and women, infiltrated in all relevant positions, and they have dogs and crows on their side. Tough choice, isn't it? Hysterical lunatics or nature loving people in positions of power... )Anyway, compared with the first movie, it is crap.

I thought it was at worst fairly competent and at best pretty entertaining.That being said, the way that this movie absolutely tarnished the legacy of the first one, and the legacy of movie making as a whole, is very unfortunate.  Gone is the mystery and the flavor of the first one, replaced with a by-the-numbers plot and laughable death scenes.Yes, why don't we talk a bit about those death scenes?  Supremely awful.  In THE OMEN, the death scenes were sporadic (at least until the end) and actually meant something.  There were really only two (the Priest and Nanny) before the the very last part of the movie.  The Nanny suicide was strange and the justification behind it was not clear.  The priest's death was a bit more ridiculous, but there was at least a mild buildup for it.In THE OMEN II, it follows this pattern 1. Introduce character(s) 2. Have them realize Damien is the antichrist (and this is not even followed in a few cases) 3. Kill them, quickly.Now, I'm being purposely glib about my description, but it really isn't much more than that.  A doctor is introduced to the story through his discovery of Damien's apparent invulnerability.  Two minutes later, he's killed by a falling elevator in a scene so predictable that even children in the audience were sighing (or cringing).  The deaths just keep coming and coming, as a substitute, I believe for an actual compelling story.The story, what there is of it, is essentially the same as the first film, with a little more leeway given to Damien to make evil looks.  Like his brother, Damien's uncle takes until the very end of the film to realize that something is amiss and he comes to this decision based on practically no evidence -- as opposed to Gregory Peck, who scurried about the European countryside in search of the truth about the boy and who DIDN'T have multiple people instructing him on the reality of the situation.We get three evil helpers and a crow in this movie, instead of one evil nanny and a dog (aided my multiple dogs, later) in the first.  And although all that evil might sound infatuating initially, it's quickly evident that more evil does not equal more complexity.  The movie doesn't even make more than a token effort to allude to the allegiances of these characters -- although no doubt the progressives among us applaud the distinction of the very ardent capitalist and pro-globalization thug as aligned with evil.  But that's not enough to make up for the rest of the film.In summary, this film has all the heart and depth of a Friday the 13th sequel (perhaps excepting the fourth installment).  It's really not much more of a slasher flick, with the slasher being very unfortunate coincidences and timing.  Stick with THE OMEN and stick DAMIEN OMEN II where it belongs in movie hell, with the devil itself.

At the start I had my doubts about his performance but as the movie went on he became more and more entertaining to watch. I really bought his performance as Damien - it felt very real and it seemed to me like I was watching the real Antichrist unfold in front of my eyes.--The score, just like it was in the first film, is terrific, memorable and thrilling.THE BAD--Aside from the strong first half, this movie is basically a stale rehash of the original after a while. We get the daggers, the warning person (the reporter this time) and that same wall thing we got last time. It makes the film seem like they had no ideas for a second movie, which makes me how the hell they're gonna come up with a good idea for the third film.--This movie is WAY too repetitive. It feels like a slasher after a short while - its death, funeral/grieving, death, funeral/grieving.repeat until ANNOYED. What happened to the infrequent yet shocking and brilliant deaths of the first film, and the interesting storyline we got in the first film?--The characters aren't very well established (I forgot who was who numerous times) and I wasn't really interested in them as people and didn't really give a crap if they died or not.--What the hell was up with that stupid subplot with the Uncle's business? That had no place in the movie. We get so many scenes and conversations discussing that business and how it's gonna change the world and stuff and it doesn't amount to anything or have even any place in this movie at all.--Damien's character is really uneven and it was so frustrating. One minute he's this stand-up young gentlemen, then a blood thirsty little Antichrist brat, and then he's back to being that wonderful cadet in the military, and then he's back on the bratness. Did this piss anyone else off? In the first movie he was pure evil, but it seemed like in this one the writer tried to develop the character's grief and understanding of his life whilst at the same time continuing the run of evil Damien.

First of all, the scary images. You don't take your eyes off the film and yet you want to close your eyes, as the blood flows in gobbets.

There's no getting around it. The film is about the Anti-Christ, and you better freshen up on your theology.

One of the better elements is the fact that there's a much more impressive sense of grandeur than expected here in regards to the intense action throughout here, as there's much more here than initially expecting along the film. There's a fine energy here from the film's big action scenes such as the opening crypt burial with the two professors or the highway attack with the crow on the reporter which helps this one move along at a much brisker pace as these big energy scenes come along at a far greater rate in this one. For the most part, this greater influx of scenes also allows this one to pack in much more gruesome and graphic deaths with a much larger body count to work with getting that extra play by really upping the ante here with some rather spectacular kills which is what really gives this one some good moments with here. This spectacular sense, though, highlights the first of the film's flaws here in the fact that the film opts for the grand showcase rather than the realistic throughout here. The fact that this one goes for that grandiose sense of spectacular kills and action scenes really tends to throw the sense of logic and reason found in the original which loses the tense and scares there so it has fun and exciting scenes rather than chilling. The sense of atmosphere it featured is dropped off for a conflicting attitude which is quite disastrous to this one as it seems to conflict with the ominous tone from the storyline about the dawning of his legacy. This also brings up the other big flaw here about this one which is the lacksidaiscal plot pace here which doesn't really move along all that quickly so the spectacle comes off really forced in even more obviously against the storyline pace as it meanders along providing the opposite reaction intended against the stellar action by taking so long as it does to get the truth out. The last part here that doesn't really hold up is the finale which comes in really rushed and seems designed to set-up the next film rather than actually conclusively ending this one. Otherwise, it's a decent enough effort.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language.

He's a seemingly spoiled teenager whose great-aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney) knows immediately upon sight that something is wrong. Where there's evil, there are ravens, and Sidney pays for her suspicions immediately. So do others who stand in the way of Damien's destiny, including a schoolmate, the head of the military school (Dr. Kildare's Lew Ayres) and several others who pop in to expose the continuing evil that started long before Damien's parents demise. Jonathan Scott-Taylor has taken over the role of the aging Damien, and as his knowledge of his destiny takes affect, his initial despair disappears and the evil grows.While a follow-up to The Omen seemed as obvious as the real Anti-Christ's entrance into our world, it may have been untimely due to the failure of The Heretic Exorcist II from the previous year. Damien Omen II isn't nearly as bad as that disaster, but it does suffer a bit in comparison. Some of the horrors which occur are almost identical to those from the first film, and still, Damien is on the outside, looking in, even though he is certainly more evil than the infant version of the character. His evils seem to be things he can't control, like an inner part of that child is fighting to prevent himself from committing them, yet his destiny won't allow him to. Lance Henriksen takes over where Billie Whitelaw left off as Satan's emissary guiding Damien towards his destiny, providing an equal level of creepiness and giving indication that not all military leaders have world peace on the top of their agenda.Old Hollywood is highly represented here, with the presence of Holden, Grant, Sidney and Ayres, and that element alone gives this a slight touch of class in spite of the dark subject matter. 1978 was a spooky year for teenaged boys with 13 year old Hitler clones roaming around the world in The Boys From Brazil. The structure of the first film remains intact, presenting this story not as a glorification of the on-slaught of a desire for evil leaders to take over the ruling of the world, but as a warning of what might occur in our lifetime should the book of Revelations be proved true.

Some disregard it entirely and move straight on to 'The Final Conflict'; others adore it, sometimes even more so than Richard Donner's original film.I love it on a par with Donner's film, but I admit that, whilst he was away trying to make audiences believe that a man could fly, his presence was sorely missed.Overall, the film is a great horror sequel and an entertaining one at that.It takes the view that Damien Thorn is the Antichrist and charts his rise to power as he establishes himself further within the Thorn family, hoping to inherit a global conglomerate controlled by his adoptive uncle, Richard (William Holden). Although this loses the mystique of whether Robert Thorn was right or actually a raving lunatic taken in by the doubts that he had regarding Damien and the lie that he had fed his wife, to be honest, how else would a sequel to 'The Omen' have been crafted? Not all the Thorns could have been that insane or deluded!!There's a great cast here, with Holden embarking on his only horror film and leaving behind a memorable performance for posterity, whilst he is joined by the incredible Lee Grant as his wife, Ann. I saw Grant for the first time in this movie and only later discovered her performances in 'Columbo Ransom for a Dead Man' (1971) and 'Airport '77' (1977). She's a great actress in all, but this is the performance I remember the most. If you see or have seen this film, you'll probably understand why!Supporting cast members are also memorable, including Sylvia Sidney, Lew Ayres, a young Lance Henriksen, and the always sly Robert Foxworth. The latter two are almost criminally underused characters, but they use their time well enough. Novelist, Gordon McGill even crafted a further two sequels after 'The Final Conflict' that, had they been adapted, would have given Foxworth much more screen presence to show what a great actor he is. Nicholas Pryor also deserves credit for his performance and British stalwarts, Leo McKern and Ian Hendry also get cameos.And Jonathan Scott-Taylor is great as Damien, too! He grabs a few scenes that lend the character some inner conflict and even perfects his own icy 'Omen' stare as he starts to come into his powers. It's just a shame that the planned 1979 second sequel to 'The Omen' starring Scott-Taylor didn't go ahead, as there is too much empty time in Damien's life between this and the next film!Although it was implied in the first film that he was possibly aware of his demonic lineage and that he may be adopted by the President of the United States, these are not really big things that leave you wondering what happened here, then? Even though William Holden/Richard Thorn wasn't in the original, who cares? 'The Omen' was meant to be a one-off and accidentally led to sequels. Plus, as 'The Final Conflict' shows, Damien was far more effective and enjoyable when he did have parents running around trying to stab him!!But the film is cheesy. Elizabeth Shepherd's British journalist arriving in a terrible, gaudy red coat practically shouts it at you This is a film that isn't being taken quite as seriously as the last one. And that's it - this film is fun! It wasn't intended to be 'Haha' funny (despite some of the performances) but, when compared to the overbearingly grim 'The Final Conflict' and the deadly serious 'The Omen', this film has a real pace to it, particularly when Richard Thorn starts to realise that he can no longer ignore the omens surrounding him. Things just happen and you go along with them. It's like Marmite -- you either love it or you don't!Naturally, to compete with 'The Omen' and David Warner's classic end in that film, there is a whole spate of memorable death sequences here that are fun and, sometimes, quite chilling as well... You can see them coming -- but, again, who cares?Picture quality has improved a bit since 'The Omen', but largely due to the increased budget resulting from that film's success. There are more special effects, more family drama scenes, more Damien... It really complies with those three 'Scream' rules for a horror sequel, really more, more, more!And, on that note, be prepared to enjoy another musical contribution from Jerry Goldsmith. Although he didn't shoot to Oscar fame with this 'Omen' score (or its more lyrical successor, either), Goldsmith delivers racy, thrill-ride compositions, with a maximum of one pleasant interlude, a handsome amount of eerie uncertainty and foreboding, and a lot of that famous 'Ave Satani' returning, albeit in an altered form. It is clear that he was having fun tinkering with a set formula that he helped to create!There is some quite beautiful location work, this time set in Chicago, Illinois, Wisconsin and Israel.And, despite some confusion, if you're prepared to look hard enough for it, there is actually quite a decent chunk of plot involving Thorn Industries, Damien's rise to power and the interaction of the Thorn family and those surrounding it, as well as the usual contextual Biblical references. There are plot holes and strained plot lines, but films like this are still rather fun!Finally, to dispel popular myth, there is actually a church in this sequel...see if you can spot it!!

The movie knocked me out, as it does most people, but somehow, it has taken me another eight years to catch up with the film's sequel, Damien Omen II, which was released two years after the first. The second film of an eventual trilogy (part 3, The Final Conflict, came out in 1981), it does what all good sequels should do; namely, it expands on the themes of the original, advances the story line in an intelligent manner, and leaves the viewer wanting even more. The film ups the murderous violence of the initial entry considerably (there are 10 imaginative and stunning diabolic homicide sequences in this film, as opposed to five in the first), and if it is by necessity a tad less original in concept than its predecessor, yet remains an unqualified success.The sequel picks up only a week after the events of The Omen, with archaeologists Bugenhagen and Morgan (uncredited turns by Leo McKern and Ian Hendry, respectively, McKern being the only returning actor from the original film) becoming trapped in a cave-in whilst examining some incriminating ruins in Israel. The film then flash forwards seven years, to catch up with the doings of our favorite little Antichrist, Damien Thorn. When we last saw the lad, he had survived a murder attempt by his own savvy father, played by Gregory Peck. Now 13, Damien lives with his wealthy industrialist uncle, Richard Thorn (played by William Holden), his stepmother Ann (Lee Grant) and his cousin Mark (Lucas Donat). At this point, Damien is completely unaware of his satanic pedigree and of the 666 number of the beast that is branded on his own scalp. But all that changes, when he and Mark go off to a nearby military academy and become cadets. And as the number of grisly deaths both in the Thorn family and surrounding it escalates, Richard, like his brother before him, comes slowly to the realization that cute little Damien must die....As in the first film, Damien Omen II is given great gravitas, dramatic heft and credibility by dint of the terrific cast of seasoned pros that has been mustered to put the conceit across. Peck and Lee Remick worked wonders in the original picture, and here, Golden Age Hollywood stars Holden, Lew Ayres (playing Holden's business partner, in his final screen appearance) and Sylvia Sidney (aka The Face of the Depression, here playing Holden's Aunt Marion) perform the same office. They are more than ably abetted by Grant (another Lee playing the senior Thorn's wife), Allan Arbus (aka Dr. Sidney Friedman on TV's M*A*S*H), Meshach Taylor (in his first film, and eight years before achieving fame on TV's Designing Women), Lance Henriksen (as a very mysteriously motivated drill sergeant at Damien's academy) and Robert Foxworth (as a very mysteriously motivated executive at Thorn Enterprises). And then there is 16-year-old Jonathan Scott-Taylor, who does a marvelous job with his difficult lead role. Helping to put the film over is the very assured direction by Don Taylor, the imaginative lensing of DOP Bill Butler (I love the first shot of Damien that he gives us, with his face superimposed by the flames of a burning pile of leaves), and the freaky-sounding Latinate choral effects provided by Jerry Goldsmith. Shot in large part at Lake Geneva and Eagle River in Wisconsin, the film has a wintry beauty that must have looked very impressive on the large screen. The picture is well paced and consistently suspenseful, and those 10 gruesome homicide sequences (by cave-in, induced coronary, crow attack, drowning under a frozen lake, a chemical factory disaster, an elevator accident, the rupturing of a cranial artery, a runaway train car, by dagger and by fiery immolation) are all brilliantly staged and fairly horrifying. The film certainly does leave us with unanswered questions, mainly regarding the actions of the Henriksen and Foxworth characters, and of course as to the destiny of the 13-year-old Antichrist. Guess we'll have to proceed on to the 1981 film and hope for some devilish explication.... (Oh...and on a side note, I hope all IMDb readers will forgive me for writing this short piece on the Antichrist on Christmas Day, of all days!)

What powers and limitations would a 12 year old Antichrist have? Would he try to stand out or blend in? What would he be doing now to prepare for the great confrontation ahead?Alas, the film doesn't try to ask or answer any interesting questions. Instead, the various people who have suspicions about Damien, or even whose basic decency is just considered a hindrance to evil, are simply knocked off. This is, of course, a less-than-brilliant strategy since each death just convinces more survivors that Damien is very bad news indeed. The power of the Antichrist is supposed to come from the ability to deceive and manipulate people by the millions, not send a crow to kill someone.So the film's focus is on finding creative ways for people to die. And some of the ways people die in this film are creative. There are some chills in the film, and although other reviewers obviously disagree, I thought the acting was quite capable. But with one killing after another leading really nowhere, the movie is more like a slasher flick than a supernatural suspense film. Damien Omen II is good by the standards of slasher films, but it could have and should have been much more.

In focusing the story around Damien, we are presented with a All-American boy at a military academy, who happens to be a history whiz;in one scene, Damien is talking to two girls.  Also, it is surprising that Damien,who cringed in fear at the sight of a church in the first film, can read the Holy Bible without a grimace. I was impressed by the use of a raven as Damien's familar, as they call it, thus preventing anyone from suspecting for the sinister deaths.

Mainly it's because the story itself is a coming-of-age tale of the teenage anti-christ in a military school in Chicago, nothing more. Writer David Seltzer has admitted that he didn't want to whip up a sequel to his eerie original, but he did offer to the heads of 20th Century Fox the idea of creating a starting point for the second.  The idea was nixed and producer Harvey Bernhard was left to cook up a story kernel for part II. Berhard initially wanted the boy of the beast to be the age of 18, yet studio heads killed the idea and hired others to bring the age down to 13, an idea Bernhard didn't like at all. In fact, Bernhard didn't like many of the ideas for the picture, but did hire William Holden, an actor who had passed on the role of Robert Thorn from the first film (eventually played by Gregory Peck) and his Stalag 13 co-star Don Taylor to direct (who ended up replacing first choice, Mike Hodges, the movie's screenwriter).  Anyhow, the picture ended up being tortured by critics, calling the movie predictable and unscary. However, when seen under its own light, Damien Omen II isn't really all that bad. Sure, the picture doesn't live up to the Omen I, but few sequels live up to their predecessors. Omen II features Damien (a campy, not scary Johnathan Taylor) living with his rich uncle and aunt (William Holden and Lee Grant, both good) at their lush home in Chicago, IL. The movie goes onto to show the viewers that whoever knows the identity of the beast will be destroyed in the most inhumane act possible (a formula for all the Omen films).  The movie is corny, silly and predictable, yet Taylor gives us a quasi-entertaining picture with over-the-top scenes and performances. Damien Omen II doesn't rank as high as the first in the scare factor, but it ranks up with the same star rating, 2 1/2 stars out of 4.

This sequel, however, is right up there with Death Wish II (1982) on the Worst Sequels Of All Time register. As with the Bronson monstrosity, the 'II' in Omen II means twice the gore, twice the deaths, twice the attempts at shocking and upsetting the audience, and a script that's twice as trite as the typical schoolkid's creative English essay. SPOILERS...there are a couple (three, actually) of disturbing scenes in this film, but there is just so much garbage and pathetic dialogue surrounding them, you might want to walk out before they actually occur. Firstly, a female journalist gets her eyes pecked out by the malevolent crow. This is an extremely gut-churning scene, especially for anyone who gets nervous just applying eye-drops or putting their contact lenses in. But then the director just goes for broke and has the blinded woman crushed by the mother of all trucks. On a deserted highway in the middle of nowhere. Yes, subtlety is not this movie's strong point. The second horrifying scene that sticks in my mind has that fine actor Lew Ayres (who looks just as stranded and befuddled in this mess as the equally talented Holden) drowning beneath the ice on a frozen lake. The scene is very well shot and edited, and it'll certainly make you think twice about breaking out the skates next time your local park's boating lake freezes over. Finally, there's the doctor who gets sliced in two following a scary incident in a malfunctioning elevator. Again, this scene makes you jump and cringe, but it's nowhere nearly as impressive as the David Warner decapitation bit in the first film.That's really all this unconvincing sequel has to offer. You'll laugh at Mark's brain aneurysm scene, callous as that sounds, because it looks to me like the poor boy was listening to some Limp Bizkit on his Walkman when some trickster decided to crank the volume to eleven. And the film doesn't even look like a horror flick - it's all shot with flat, garish lighting, like a TV sitcom, and the photography is similarly devoid of light, shadow and character. Also, if Damien has been conspicuously free of any illnesses or ailments all his life, how come he has so many fillings in his teeth?Definitely one to avoid.

The score by Jerry Goldsmith (well known for scoring Star Trek  The Motion Picture and Star Trek Voyager) is more up-tempo, as well as matching the death scenes.In the first Omen, a surrogate parent and an Exorcist-esque plot was incorporated, but in the second film, a black raven is the icon of evil, as well as the symbolism of Armageddon.  The scene with the raven attacking a stranded motorist (by having your brains and eyes picked) on a roadside is graphic, as well as drowning in cold water (Lew Ayres is the unlucky victim), being hacked in half in an elevator (Designing Women's and Mannequin's Meschach Taylor, as a doctor), and death by cardiac arrest (Sylvia Sidney of Mars Attacks! fame).  Too bad that Sylvia Sidney is a little senile in this film, unlike the sweet granny roles in Mars Attacks! and the short-lived reincarnation of Fantasy Island.The railroad scene is less graphic, where someone is rammed between two railroad cars, which makes the decapitation scene in the first film more graphic.  Anyone that gets into Damien's way seems to die, or suffer some unfortunate event, the same way that he has done to his parents in the first film.One character that would later excel in future films is Lance Henriksen, who portrays a military academy commandant, and this led to other roles in films and TV, as well as being on James Cameron's alumni list.  For William Holden fans, this was one of his films that is seldom overlooked, not counting the black comedy S.O.B.

It is, of course, a sequel to The Omen; a film that had tapped into the 70's thirst for religious themed horror and had went on to be a big smash hit. Damien Omen II, perhaps unsurprisingly, doesn't have the originality of that first film but it maintains the story very well in my opinion. It's the one film in the franchise where the action has moved from the UK to the USA. It focuses on the now 13 year old antichrist Damien Thorn, who is being schooled in a military academy. It's also the part where he becomes aware of who he really is.In many ways its story arc follows quite close to the original template but with the addition of more frequent, inventive and gory death scenes involving the poor unfortunates who get too close to the truth. In effect, this movie plays out like a series of elaborate set-pieces strung together over a fairly basic plot-line. This isn't such a terrible thing though because these macabre moments are all really executed very well. In particular are three notable death sequences &#x96; on a deserted road a woman is attacked by a raven who pecks her eyes out, she is then finished off by being hit full force by a truck; a man is cut in half by a falling elevator cable; during a game of hockey on a frozen lake, the ice breaks and a man falls under resulting in the disturbing scenario where we see him helplessly floating just below the ice. These set-pieces, along with several others, constitute the highlight of the movie and they are all well-conceived and give the film its definite draw. Because the film is neither a beginning, nor an end to the story it allows this instalment to simply focus its attention on the macabre material in between and it's really not a bad thing.There are other interesting changes though, such as the use of the raven as the creature of the devil, I thought it was a better choice than the Rottweiler from the first movie and it was very well integrated into the story. The acting too is more than decent with the likes of William Holden basically taking on the role Gregory Peck filled in the first movie, while Jonathan Scott-Taylor looks right as Damien, his thin features can look cold and ominous but he is never cartoonishly evil, which was a good thing. He has one particularly memorable and original scene too where he knows the answer to every single question his history teacher throws at him. It's one of the less gruesome more subtly sinister moments that really stands out. Some things remain the same though and once again there is a really good score from Jerry Goldsmith. It's very dramatic with that ominous choir sound that is just perfect for this subject matter.

Following a wildly successful original, The Omen, was a risky under taking. One usually expects a let down. You will not find one in The Omen II. In fact, so rare is it for a sequel to succeed as powerfully as this one, I can only think of one time where it happened. The Godfather II was as brilliant as The Godfather.

He and wife Lee Grant are raising both Damien and Holden's son by a first marriage. But that's in name only because young Damien has lots of folks looking after him. As in the first Omen film, all kinds of people go to meet their Maker in a variety of bizarre ways. I will say the film does not lack for imagination that way. My favorite is Meshach Taylor and that particularly gruesome demise in an elevator.Damien also is told to read the book of Revelations to find out about himself while he's at military school. This is where I have a problem with the film and all films of this nature. If he reads the thing he knows he doesn't come out on top in the end.

Seven years pass, and Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor), currently living with his uncle, Richard Thorn (William Holden), is sent to a military school with cousin Mark. Once there, he will learn the truth about himself, while everybody who suspects something will face a horrible death.As I said before, this film is basically a pale imitation of its predecessor people find out who Damien is, they die under weird circumstances, etc. The only new thing is that this time the Devil's son knows, too, and is fully aware of his abilities. Sadly, this doesn't do much to make Omen II at least as good as its predecessor.

This time around we see the main character, Damien Thorn, as a pre-teen finding out who he really is and subsequently unleash some hellish mayhem upon his enemies. Though the story basically repeats itself (the only difference being that Damien is older and knows who he is)it never ceases to be boring. Some of the death scenes though, are beyond predictable, in the sense that you suspect who is going to get the devil's wrath. The manner of these deaths varies from being totally lame (a heart attack) to graphically gory and spectacular (a man gets cut in half). This sequel could have been superior to its original at the hands of a more skilled director, since there were many aspects of Damien's youth that are left untouched and interesting subplots that are dropped like hot potatoes near the end of the movie. Still, it is an enjoyable film that holds pretty well even to this day and age of digital wizardry and high tech FX. Jerry Goldsmith's unsettling score is pivotal in providing tension even in the most unfrightening moments and the acting by Veterans like William Holden are believable enough. Also, you'll get to see Lance Henriksen (ALIENS, Millennium) in what might be among his first roles. He does well as the mysterious Sergeant assigned to protect Damien. The sad thing about the new DVD version of the movie is Thia lack of a 5.1 Dolby mix.

Given that it also ended with the villain still alive and well, it was almost inevitable that a sequel would follow before long. Damien Omen II is an average horror sequel which follows the conventions and plot mechanics of the first film to the letter. Gregory Peck's US Ambassador might be gone, but another Hollywood legend - this time William Holden - is there to play the unsuspecting elderly relative about to learn the chilling truth about young Damien Thorn. And once again, the demonic child is out to fulfil his sinister destiny, with gory and spectacular fates awaiting those who unmask his unholy identity! While Damien Omen II is ostensibly a sequel, it might more accurately be called a remake.Following the death of his parents, Damien Thorn (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) goes to live with his uncle Richard Thorn (William Holden) and aunt Ann Thorn (Lee Grant). By the time he is 13, Damien is well acquainted with his new family and enjoys attending a prestigious military school near Chicago. A pesky old relative, Aunt Marion (great but brief performance by Sylvia Sidney), is pretty much the only member of the Thorn clan who suspects that there's something unhealthily devilish about Damien. But she is killed by a raven soon after voicing her theories. Similarly, a journalist who gets close to the truth is blinded by the same raven and staggers in front of an oncoming truck. Damien, still only vaguely aware of his powers, is told by a platoon sergeant, Neff (Lance Henriksen), to read the Book Of Revelations, which he promptly does. And once he realises that he is the Antichrist, he goes on a huge killing spree, wiping out anyone and everyone who threatens his plans to destroy the world.Don Taylor lacks the subtlety of Richard Donner as the director of this sequel and he goes for a more graphically gory approach. Each death is more elaborate and bloodthirsty than the one before (the guy getting sliced in half in the elevator is perhaps the film's gruesome highlight). As a result, the film caters more for gore fans than those who like a spooky, psychological flavour to their horror films. While unquestionably a heck of a lot bloodier than its predecessor, Damien Omen II is paradoxically nowhere near as terrifying. Holden holds the film together well (he reportedly hated the script and his role, but does well to conceal his disdain), but Scott-Taylor's Antichrist is somehow less chilling as a teenager than Harvey Stevens' was when he played the 6-year-old incarnation of this famous screen monster.

If only pubic hair and frenzied masturbation were the extent of it.Shorn of Satanic nannies and hell-hounds, but with the burping raven on constant call, facilitating his rise to badness are a bunch of well-appointed acolytes and corporate thugs, smoothing his entry into the obscenely rich and powerful Thorn Industries, which plans to control - or withhold - food distribution in famine-afflicted territories (good business say some, 'unethical' think others - and horribly familiar we say, from the vantage point of the 21st century). Meanwhile, anybody who gets in Damien's way is slaughtered, and which teen hasn't fantasised about that? Following the trajectory of many future captains of industry, Damien is packed off to military school, where brooding academy sergeant Daniel Neff (Henriksen) informs him of his true nature. Why? he howls despairingly. Why me? A playful riff on the traumas of puberty, it's the one truly affecting scene because it's so honest. The remainder can be fed to the flames.If The Omen had a certain vaudevillian grandeur, the sequel feels like a cheap, made-for-TV slasher. More reliable than buses, you can set your watch by the slayings, including a damn good pecking, a deadly plunge under the ice (the most effective set-piece) and death by lift cable, featuring a technician chopped in half width-ways; if the film was aiming to trounce the original's straightforward decapitation, it's just not half as effective in its execution.It makes one wonder what original director Mike Hodges could have done with it, before fleeing production three weeks into the shoot. As Hodges told the 'Guardian' in 2003, during a row about the design budget the apoplectic producer placed a handgun on the table. I said, 'Is that loaded?' And he said, 'Yes.' And then we just looked at each other for a bit. Hodges retains a credit (unlike Leo McKern and Ian Hendry, drowned by sand in the first 10 minutes), but the script might have been so different 'You're a big man, but in you're in bad shape. Now sit down and behave yourself before I summon Baal and Lilith to play conkers with your b****cks. With the exception of Henriksen, and the beguiling Scott-Taylor, the acting is uniformly stilted, and a quick buck for Holden who was originally pencilled in to play Robert Thorn, but passed as he didn't want to star in a film about the devil. Having seen The Omen clean up, he wasted no time hopping on board for the sequel. More pertinently, the original film was shot with an alternative ending in which Damien died but Alan Ladd Jnr, sniffing bucks, nixed the idea. All of which proves once and for all that the love of sequels is actually the root of all evil.

Uh&#133; it was intrusive and noticeable, that's for sure, but it didn't inspire much in me except laughter.Many people also say that this movie features good acting! I heartily disagree! Gads, everyone involved was SO AWFUL, particularly the hideous Lee Grant. Did anyone else notice that her hairdo makes her head look like an enormous penis? You can really notice a lot of styles of acting, screen writing, and directing that were prevalent at the time, but seem alien (and completely false and ineffective) today. The script was an absolute nightmare! But everything was SO banal, middle-of-the-road, and downright TACKY that you have to love it! I was literally slapping my knee all the way through.I also LOVE how the Holden and Grant characters have to absolutely psychotic in order to continue denying that anything is going on. So by the end like 5 people have died shortly after telling them to beware of Damien, and they're still like 'Damien? How could they possibly think anything's wrong with him?!?!?!' And so many of the deaths seem so unmotivated&#133; I mean, maybe this person has suspicions about Damien or warns someone, but what are they really going to DO that's such a threat to him? It just seemed pointless after a while.I think these films were the precursor to the FINAL DESTINATION films in that you have these elaborate deaths that come with lots of build-up, but aren't committed by a person, they just kind of happen.Oh dear&#133; well, that's about it.

That's because it has a silly plot involving the spawn of Satan, occasionally lame and overwrought dialog and a style that just needs to be seen to be believed! But, despite its many shortcomings, this is still a fun little film and not nearly as awful as I'd first suspected. That's because the previous film (THE OMEN) was panned and placed in Harry Medved's Fifty Worst Films of All Time book. However, after having seen both films I can definitely say that there are hundreds or perhaps thousands of worse films. In fact, since they entertain and keep your attention, they really aren't bad films but more guilty pleasures! The film begins with budding teen Damien seeming a lot like a normal boy--not acting at all like the result of a mating with the Devil and a Jackal (wouldn't that make him a son of a .....?). But, slowly, it is revealed that some around the boy are well aware of who he is and are there to serve him without fail. When he is finally told who he is, Damien suffers a short existential crisis before he ultimately gives in to the dark side....no wait, he IS the dark side! Along the way, there are countless exciting to watch and very silly deaths--some orchestrated directly by Damien and his followers and others created by either an unseen force or a nasty crow who seems to be the one behind all the mess. Because the deaths are so bloody and creative, the film reminds me a lot of the low-budget Vincent Price film, THE ABOMINIBLE DOCTOR PHIBES. The dumbest death was the lady who is hit by a truck and the most interesting and disturbing is the man who was sucked under the ice (a nice touch).While you will be entertained, please do NOT stop to think or reason this out as this is NOT a well-constructed plot. The Biblical passages are wrong--being twisted and misquoted and the film was not meant to be anything other than a silly little exploitation film. While this may offend some religious fundamentalists, if they actually sit still and watch the film, they, too, will probably find the whole thing ludicrous yet oddly entertaining.

There are some opportunities for character expansion, but the film never really develops, and begins to resemble all those terrible Friday the 13th movies where one by one the cast get munched, splattered and generally come to nasty ends.

We get a little of that from veteran actress Sylvia Sydney, but she is killed off within the first few minutes of the film. And, perhaps we get a little from Lew Ayres, but his demise -- an old man playing ice hockey -- just doesn't quite seem to make sense, although the special effects of him drowning under the ice was nicely done. William Holden was often a remarkable actor. But everything seemed to go downhill for him after Network, just 2 years previous. Here, his performance is nothing but disappointing. Lee Grant had to be in just the right kind of role to be really enjoyable on the big screen; this was not that kind of role. Dismissed. And Robert Foxworth just seems so mechanical here.And then there's the why of certain plot angles. The military school aspect works, but the scenario with the sergeant just seems to drift with no purpose, although it's clear that he is on the side of evil.The one plot twist that is worthwhile here is Lee Grant murdering William Holden (wife murdering husband) at the climax of the film.

Hence extremely predictable.","Date":"16 December 2014","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" O2 is an improvement over the overrated first part; it's very well-photographed and interesting - and most importantly doesn't have any tiny evil children who can't act - but is bogged down by several flaws, some of which it shares with its inferior predecessor.First of all, the story unfolds in a Godless universe &#x96; or at least a world in which God is disinterested or at the very least just a passive observer, never actively participating, never helping by sending over some well-armed uber-priest who slays demons for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Unlike Satan, who makes his presence known and who swats his enemies like annoying flies, one by one. This totally unexplained and lop-sided imbalance of power between Good and Evil, between the Church and Satan's minions, is frankly quite ludicrous.This brings me to the other major flaw, directly related to the powers of Good being on vacation the movie's increasing predictability. By the time we get to the 2nd half of the movie, the murders are so easily foreseeable (who will get killed, why and even when) that you can almost set your watch to them. This makes O2 play out almost like a cheap slasher film, at least plot-twist-wise. Yes, the killings are inventive, mostly unusual, and they are well-filmed but at some point I'd prefer to not have to know everything in advance.The general problem with the Omen series is that the imbalance of power between Good and Evil creates a one-sided battle (well, a wipe-out really) in which the outcome is a foregone conclusion. With God doing absolutely zip/zilch/nada/niente to help his obedient flock, Satan is poised to win every single time. This kind of one-sided nonsense can only be interesting to Satanist viewers, I'd imagine. Not only is this a bad way to conduct a religious-based horror film because it eliminates all elements of surprise, but it also defies logic. Surely, in a universe in which an all-powerful Divine Being is being challenged by a runaway ex-angel, that Supreme Being would make its presence also known in form of powerful priests, flying nuns, magic crucifixes and what-not. At the very least there should be some priest running around, warning everyone in Bible-speak gibberish, and being protected by God. One single priest, that's all I ask. But there is literally nobody, not even a half-dazed squirrel. How the hell did God &#x96; at least the one in this movie serial - even get to be in charge if He never helped the humans with magic powers? This is yet another logic hole, about as big as Oprah's ass.It is hence small wonder that Satan's (and later Damien's) serial-killing in O2 is so brazen, so lacking in caution, so bombastic, and so totally out in the open. Then again, why take stealthy measures when the opposition refuses to fight you? The movie is like watching John Cleese in the boxing ring against Connie Booth i.e. a full-grown man beating the crap out of a school-girl; it's like an adult rugby team fighting a team of kids (again the Pythons; that scene from The Meaning Of Life); very predictable hence a little pointless. Which is why the ending is such a boring affair; no end-twist &#x96; if we ignore that silly nonsense about Holden's wife having been a Satanist all along.But how can Lee Grant be one of Devil's disciples when she looked genuinely concerned and shocked at the old woman's death? Yes, we HAVE been cheated by the movie. Or was Lee perhaps PLAYING UP to the camera? As far as I know, characters in movies aren't supposed to know that they are being filmed hence feigning emotions for the camera for the audience's benefit is simply a moronic plot-device used by clueless writers and directors. Withholding information is one thing; but outright lying movie-goers like this sinks the movie deeper into its mud of bad logic.The set-up in The Prophecy series makes much more sense, hence makes for more compelling viewing. Even The Exorcist series involves a measure of balance, an actual power-struggle between Satan and God that ensures that stories with unpredictable plot-twists can be written, something that is quite difficult in this Satan-controlled Omen universe. It is hence also illogical for Satan to need SO LONG to re-gain power &#x96; when there is no visible opposition whatsoever from his adversary. This leads me to the inevitable and very logical conclusion that the Satan portrayed here is either incompetent or lazy, or both.The lush production values, the non-moronic dialogue, the good soundtrack, and the overall mood make up for some of these minus points, but there is no denying that the Omen series is far too linear and predictable, and that this movie is far too similar to its predecessor, with an almost identical basic plot.

In Omen II, viewers are treated to several equally gruesome scenes in which a variety of unlucky souls meet their fate (often heralded by the appearance of a raven and the genuinely eerie 'kaw' croaks of Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score). Buried alive, drowned under ice, eyes pecked out and hit by a truck, gassed to death, crushed by a train, and sliced in half&#x97;they all go in a decidedly nasty fashion, the deaths made all the more horrific by the extreme terror experienced by the victims in their final moments.

How true that is.Benjamin, I've got just one word to say to you Frogs.This has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith which sounds like a pastiche of the original 'Omen', only accompanied by a frog choir. DAN-DER *ribbit ribbit* DANER-DER *ribbit ribbit*. It's one of my all time favourite soundtracks but ever since I keep breaking out in a cold sweat every time I pass a pond. Later on in the film, a crow menaces a journalist and the frogs are back. *Ribbit ribbit*. Shouldn't that be KAW-KAW? Or maybe it's meant to be a demonic sound? Personally, I think it's frogs. But why frogs? Also, Damien's father is meant to be the Goat of Mendes so why was he born from a Jackal? Either way, we're up to our navels in barnyard animals so Don Taylor is the right director, as anyone who has seen his zoo scene in 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes' will testify. It's the actors who distract your attention.In 'The Omen', Robert Thorn meets Father Brennan on a park bench who tells him to seek out the priest BUGGENHAGEN! The row I was in at the cinema giggled. It's the way he said it. Being a God fearing man I told them to pipe down. Anyway, BUGGENHAGEN is back at the start of this film driving a jeep in a frankly reckless manner through some streets, although Buggenhagen doesn't sound very Italian. He meets his friend Micheal and takes him to an archeological dig to convince him of the existence of the Anti-Christ. Suddenly, there is a cave in and they are both trapped. After a full minute of just standing there having sand dropped on their head, Micheal suddenly exclaims we've got to get out of here! Nice idea, Mike. The Anti-Christ is upon us! Yells Buggenhagen at a volume that makes Father Brennan look like a piker. Yes, it's B-movie time again, given similar cache to the original by the hiring of top (if slightly gone to seed) talent. Although everyone is content to just fill in the numbers, this is Jonathan Scott Taylor's big break as Damien and he doesn't disappoint. He has a couple of cracking scenes including a harrowing one with his brother played by Lucas Donat who makes the supreme Christian sacrifice of rejecting the hand of the devil and ends up clutching his ears while screaming in pain. More titters from the audience. I scowled at them. Damien's not playing him Britney Spears, he means business. Why can't people take religion seriously? Or frogs.The problem with this film is it's not very ominous. They've ditched all the photography business and hence any suspense. After freaking out his history teacher at the Military Academy, Damien is taken to one side by the sinister Sergeant Neff and admonished for drawing attention to himself. I say, that's a bit rich isn't it? I mean, the devil has all the inconspicuousness of a SWAT team raiding a telephone box in this picture. The poor doctor who takes Damien's blood sample is a case in point. How about a discreet heart attack or something? No, instead he suffers a rather nasty stomach-ache in a runaway elevator followed by an avalanche of glass being dropped on his bonce. This beggers the question as to what happened to all those other doctors who tested Damien's blood since childhood. Didn't they notice all those doctors with twenty syringes stuck in their necks or accidently chloroformed and sent into operating theatres where they accidently had their heads removed? But a curator friend of Richard Thorn discovers who Damien is and drives over to Thorn's country house in icy, snowy conditions without a scratch so it's comforting to know that even the devil has to sleep sometimes. Or maybe he was busy with tax fraud that weekend. I'm so scared! The curator tells Thorn and I shared his trepidation. Or at least I did until I read a quote by Brian Seltzer who wrote the original I did it strictly for the money. I was flat broke. What does frighten me is how many people actually believe all this silliness. I went red in the face. He's right, how could I have been so foolish? It's only a small part of the Bible anyway, barely a foot note. Suddenly I could use elevators again and go ice skating. I could go to the pond and feed ducks. And get hit over the head by that old busy body who tells me to read the sign. Oh, how I've missed that. How silly I've been. As if a crow could sound like a frog. Solipsism is no longer a dirty word to me, I just don't know what the hell it means. And the Anti-Christ could not possibly be destined to rise from Great Britain.

That's something those Old Testament prophets neglected to mention; the 'Father of Omens' has a habit of introducing itself with a loud, beak-smacking gut-honk. Not only will it pop your eyes like fried eggs, it'll burp in your face for an aperitif.Set some 7 years after the events of The Omen, the troubled sequel finds the little devil living the high life with uncle Richard (Holden), Richard's second wife Ann (Grant), and gormless cousin Mark (Donat). Damien's turned out marvellously considering his first adopted father was gunned down while trying to turn him into a colander. Charming, cheeky, insouciant and savvy, he's Holden Caulfield with a helmet haircut. And like most boys on the verge of their thirteenth birthday (considered by many cultures to have initiation rites), Damien's going through some startling changes. If only pubic hair and frenzied masturbation were the extent of it.Shorn of Satanic nannies and hell-hounds, but with the burping raven on constant call, facilitating his rise to badness are a bunch of well-appointed acolytes and corporate thugs, smoothing his entry into the obscenely rich and powerful Thorn Industries, which plans to control - or withhold - food distribution in famine-afflicted territories (good business say some, 'unethical' think others - and horribly familiar we say, from the vantage point of the 21st century). Meanwhile, anybody who gets in Damien's way is slaughtered, and which teen hasn't fantasised about that? Following the trajectory of many future captains of industry, Damien is packed off to military school, where brooding academy sergeant Daniel Neff (Henriksen) informs him of his true nature. Why? he howls despairingly. Why me? A playful riff on the traumas of puberty, it's the one truly affecting scene because it's so honest. The remainder can be fed to the flames.If The Omen had a certain vaudevillian grandeur, the sequel feels like a cheap, made-for-TV slasher. More reliable than buses, you can set your watch by the slayings, including a damn good pecking, a deadly plunge under the ice (the most effective set-piece) and death by lift cable, featuring a technician chopped in half width-ways; if the film was aiming to trounce the original's straightforward decapitation, it's just not half as effective in its execution.It makes one wonder what original director Mike Hodges could have done with it, before fleeing production three weeks into the shoot. As Hodges told the 'Guardian' in 2003, during a row about the design budget the apoplectic producer placed a handgun on the table. I said, 'Is that loaded?' And he said, 'Yes.' And then we just looked at each other for a bit. Hodges retains a credit (unlike Leo McKern and Ian Hendry, drowned by sand in the first 10 minutes), but the script might have been so different 'You're a big man, but in you're in bad shape. Now sit down and behave yourself before I summon Baal and Lilith to play conkers with your b****cks. With the exception of Henriksen, and the beguiling Scott-Taylor, the acting is uniformly stilted, and a quick buck for Holden who was originally pencilled in to play Robert Thorn, but passed as he didn't want to star in a film about the devil. Having seen The Omen clean up, he wasted no time hopping on board for the sequel. More pertinently, the original film was shot with an alternative ending in which Damien died but Alan Ladd Jnr, sniffing bucks, nixed the idea. All of which proves once and for all that the love of sequels is actually the root of all evil.

It's definitely better than 90% that is being made these days! The movie is not surprising. We all known who and what Damien is, which means that this movie gets all the room to show of some of the things he can do and how he handles his own identity and faith, now that he has reached early puberty, without being forced to go too much back into detail about how and why. So yes the movie is kept rather simple, which provides the movie also with some more gore and deaths.The Omen movies aren't really horror type of movies like we're accustomed to. It aren't movies with scare moments, monsters or anything of that sort. It are movies with an eerie story and character, that all work out so well due to the realistic approach of the story. The movies are always atmospheric and have a certain uneasy feeling all over it.Damien gets more than enough interesting to do in this movie. In the first movie The Omen, people mostly did the killing for him and lets face it, it above all was a Gregory Peck movie. In this movie all focus is on him. The character gets developed and is made more interesting and complex, without loosing any of its power as a scary character. Jonathan Scott-Taylor is a great Damien in this movie and its nice to see how much he really looks like Harvey Stephens, who played Damien in the first movie. William Holden is no Gregory Peck but then again no one is asking him to be. He does a good job acting in this movie, although his character could had gotten a bit more interesting to do. The movie also features Lance Henriksen in an early 'big' role, who is always great to watch in any movie. The only actor reappearing from the first movie is Leo McKern as Carl Bugenhagen. It perhaps makes it hard to connect the first two movies at times but also if you see this movie as a standalone one it's a great and original one to watch!The movie has a couple of great and memorable sequence in it and some good and original gore. Too bad that the ending feels way too rushed and is a sort of an anti-climax, that doesn't work out as it was supposed to.The movie has some creative cinematography from Bill Butler, which also provides the movie with a great typical '70's and Omen kind of atmosphere. This also goes for The Jerry Goldsmith musical score. He uses all of the themes from the first movie and mixed them together to a new unique and also certainly unusual score. It was like all the gloves were off and he pushed things to the extreme, without crossing the line.A much better than you would expect sequel!8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Solid horror sequel.","Date":"18 July 2005","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Damien Omen II starts a week or so after the events of the original Omen (1976) in Israel with an exorcist named Karl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern, uncredited) pleading with a archaeologist & colleague named Micheal (Ian Hendry, uncredited) to travel to America & convince Damien's uncle to finish what his brother couldn't & kill the Antichrist, as Karl tries to persuade Micheal of the importance of the mission they both die in an 'accident'. Cut to 'Chicago Seven Years Later' & Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is in his early teen & lives with his uncle Richard (William Holden) & aunt Ann Thorn (Lee Grant) who also have a son of their own called Mark (Lucas Donat). Richard & Ann pack both Damien & Mark to 'Davidson Military Academy'. Damien's other aunt named Marion (Sylvia Sidney) knows that Damien is the Antichrist but dies in mysterious circumstance's shortly after trying to tell Richard & Ann the truth. A journalist named Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shepherd) has been investigating around the archaeological site where Micheal & Karl died & has also discovered that Damien is the Antichrist, she too meets a gruesome end when she tries to talk to Richard. Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor) also starts to become suspicious of Damien but will he be able to convince his good friend Richard of his nephew's evil before he too falls victim to an 'accident'?Originally started by co-writer Mike Hodges who left after 'creative differences' & completed by director Don Taylor I thought Damien Omen II was a good watchable sequel. The script by Stanley Man & Hodges moves along at a reasonable pace & never becomes too dull or boring, the first half is slower than the second which when it gets going has one demonic killing after another with a scene where a Doctor is cut in half with steel wire & a scene when a journalist has her eyes pecked out by a large crow & subsequently is run over by a huge articulated truck being the stand out killings. Damien's attention this time is focused on business matters with him killing various members of 'Thorn Industries' which he will own eventually, turning the company into a cold-blooded organisation catering for his own needs. Most of the characters a little bland & forgettable with Damien himself not developed that much beyond a teenager who suffers with some personal angst as he becomes aware that he is the Antichrist, he takes it pretty well considering! I thought the twist ending was quite good as well. Director Taylor manages to create some great set-piece killings with the aforementioned two being particularly impressive, there is also a great sequence where a company executive named Bill Atherton (Lew Ayres) gets in Damien's way & ends up under some ice desperately banging as the current drags him further away & stunned spectators above frantically trying to rescue him as he slowly drowns trapped under the rock solid ice. Technically Damien Omen II is very well made & obviously had a reasonable budget, special mentions for the cinematography by Bill Butler & one for composer Jerry Goldsmith who turns in yet another fantastically atmospheric score. There isn't much blood or gore with only the Doctor being sliced in half containing any real grue. The acting is OK & the familiar face of genre favourite Lance Henriksen is here in a small role. Overall I liked Damien Omen II, it is a very well made & an entertaining horror film in it's own right. Having said that it's one of those films where I tend to think that there's nothing wrong with it but at the same time there's nothing outstanding about it either, definitely worth a watch though.

One one level, it panders to a viewer's voyeurism and bloodlust. Lots of characters get killed, some of them in rather creative ways, and there tends to be plenty of splatter (don't eat before the scene where the lady reporter in the fake fur buys it). Now, that's sick, but it has its own sort of integrity. What makes DO2 especially hideous, however, is its hypocrisy. In this movie, only the crazy characters are right about little Damien, and after proclaiming the truth -- that he is the Anti-Christ -- they are destroyed by a vast, sinister conspiracy. So Christianity, a global religion that preaches selflessness and love, is turned into an underground movement defined by paranoia and revenged. It's a survivalist's wet dream.You have to work hard, though, to be disturbed by DO2 since the film-making is so laughably bad that you don't notice the rancid ideology. Bill Holden is a great actor, but somehow he's made his share of bombs and Damien Omen II is his thermonuclear blast. His trademark cragginess and churlishness don't suggest a man being overwhelmed by dark forces so much as a man who wants to punch his agent. And who can blame him? In one scene, he gets into bed with wife Lee Grant, kisses her goodnight and lies there, looking disturbed. Is he wondering whether his stepson is the Anti-Christ or pondering the sad decline of his career, as evidenced by the sad decline of his co-stars? From Audrey Hepburn and Gloria Swanson to Lee Grant and Jonathan Scott-Thomas . . . it's a precipitous arc downward. If Holden is embarrassed, his co-stars are embarrassing. Lee Grant has two facial expressions, mildly amused and mildly menacing, and should sue whoever costumed her, although you'll finally learn where Boy George got his fashion sense. And there are a couple of scenes that wouldn't make it into an undergraduate student film -- the long shot of William Holden's cab driving into Chicago's Cabrini Green housing project, which is doubling for New York City (!), and a scene at a military academy in which you can see the headmaster squinting at the cue cards.

So Omen II is starting off behind the eightball, and in spite of its best efforts, it never really gets out of there.The acting is deadpan enough, but shifting the focus to Damien rather than those who deal with him was a mistake. However, there was a chance to recover from this. Damien goes through most of the film seemingly unaware of what he is. This could have worked to the film's advantage. We could have had a catastrophic event that makes Damien decide to embrace rather than shy away from his origins, for example. With the rampant accusations of paedophilia and rape being levelled at the clergy nowadays, playing out such a scenario here would have done the film wonders. Instead, we get a thirty-second character arc with some of the worst acting in the history of cinema. Oh well, if there is one thing you can count on Hollywood to be, it is undaring.Gone too is the mystery or detective element. The film pretty much erases any doubt the viewer has from the very beginning, and using one of the silliest substories you can imagine at that. The film basically begins with all of its cards on the table, and that is what kills it in the end. With a total absence of interesting plot twists, the whole thing becomes so by-the-numbers that one can guess what will happen next without the barest of hints.Another element that shatters the film's credibility is the number of amazing coincidences that happen around the titular character. One relative cacking it under suspicious circumstances, I can deal with. But when people keep dying over and over with the only common link between them being they had something to do with Damien Thorn, the obliviousness of the people Damien needs to gain influence from is a hard pill to swallow. This is where my summary comes in. It is a well-known theory of film that if you don't get your audience to believe in one part of your plot, they're going to be disconnected entirely from the rest.Ultimately, Omen II, like its companion films, exists in a vague fantasy land where a secret plot exists to eliminate the Christian empire. This, ultimately, is what destroys their credibility. As the films get more and more fanciful, they forget to give the story enough mooring in reality for the viewer to go with the rest. This secret underground Satanic conspiracy that exists in the Omen series must be very, very secret indeed, because the people who are the most likely candidates to become members generally have never heard of it.So when the chips are down, Omen II is basically nothing more than The Omen with the mystery element firmly removed. Given that this mystery element is the only thing that made the original interesting, I can't even recommend this turkey for a viewing at 0400 hours. Two out of ten is about all I can give this in good conscience.

Unfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case. I think the main problem with this movie is its sheer predictability. Basically the formula is as follows person suspects who Damien is, person dies (usually in a nasty unpleasant fashion), and everyone scratches their heads and puzzles over the strange accident. Victims can also include people who do not suspect Damien, but are people who show integrity and might therefore be getting in the way of the evil plans. They also have to go. Those who suspect Damien's true nature are surely aware of his capacity for evil (being the son of the Devil and all), but still it never seems to occur to them that they might be a target. There were no surprises in this movie. The second major problem this movie faces is it's lack of character development. Damien himself experiences a moment of distress on comprehending his true nature, but it passes in a flash and there is no sign of further soul searching. But the most ridiculous example of this is the uncle, Mr Thorn. He spends the movie (understandably) scoffing at all the supernatural mumbo jumbo, but once the truth is made clear to him he quite matter of factly heads off to find the daggers and deal with it, with a boy he's loved as his own for years. Contrast this with the distress of Damien's father in the first movie, and the anguish he experiences even as he tries to do what needs to be done.

It's less intense and a lot less scarier; it falls too much in love with its craft and is badly paced in its reveals and epiphanies &#x96; it takes what was frightening about The Omen and removes it, focusing instead on conglomerate takeovers and the trials of a polite young boy who's on the cusp of his coming of age and based at a boarding school. Donner's film was able to dig out an awful lot of both tension and atmosphere whilst feeding off the simpler and more agonising things; an infant boy, of whom remained mute throughout, reacting strangely to certain things and looking on at certain happenings without so much as making a sound as exasperated adults tried to figure things out was much more interesting and a lot more affecting in The Omen than what is done here in the form of focusing on a well spoken, puzzled thirteen year old boy and a crow going around killing people. Ultimately, the film is a lot less fierce and surprisingly so, for the coming of The Devil and the threat of the end of the world looming ought to be 'up there' in those sorts of departments.Damien Omen II begins in the dusty surroundings of Palestine, and a gentleman more broadly connected with certain events towards the end of The Omen speaks exasperatedly to another of whom is there in the country (sorry, Authority) on an archaeological dig. Some dialogue ensues, during which one tries to convince the other that a centuries old image on a tomb wall is that of Jonathan Scott-Taylor's titular character &#x96; he believes him, and after trying to leave to tell everyone else, the age-old infrastructure gives way causing them both to perish. Was it a coincidence? Or were fouler powers at work. Such a sequence goes onto epitomise the film, a piece generally consisting of people finding out the truth behind the situation; desperately trying to either report or inform someone else, before perishing in some nasty way made to look wholly natural at the bereft of Satan himself.Following the events of the latter stages of the first film, which I will not go into here out of the fact the film still works as a stand alone thriller, the child born of a jackal; born with the beast's number of '666' on his head and who burrowed his way into a rich and wealthy family name out of the fact their own child died, has grown up. No longer are expressionless faces and aggrieved reactions that plagued the titular character, and which made The Omen so effective, the run of the norm; Damien, played by the aforementioned Jonathan Scott-Taylor, is a walking, talking and opinionated young boy at a Marine academy with his cousin. When we first see him, director Don Taylor laboriously shoots him walking through the haze of a foreground bonfire on his residence's grounds, whilst the kid is still several yards away from it. His coming out of fire and brimstone leads him into the residence proper, of which is a mansion of sorts owned by the brother of the first film's protagonist - a man named Richard Thorn (Holden) and a higher-up in the Thorn industries agriculture organisation. Damien is spoilt by his father; maintains a good rapport with his new-found family and comes across as quite the little scamp.The film manoeuvres us down routes which results in the thing feigning to be about both a clash of egos young Damien has with a staff-Sergeant at the school as well as a similar sort of power exchange in the Thorn company itself, when someone looks to challenge the ideas and practises of the existing chairmen. Nothing comes of either of these ideas, in spite of both of them sounding better than what we end up with. Instead, the piece takes an absolute age to force Richard into a corner of realisation when the worst is implemented unto him and when it gets there, darts off into thriller territory which is over too quickly and not interesting enough in its general happening anyway.There are a lot of sequences sharing common ground with that of the first scene, ranging from broken elevators to road-traffic accidents and where The Omen got across its scares and shrill atmospherics through the frightening possibility of these happenings, Damien Omen II wallows in the spectacle of it all. Recall, if you will, that instance in which the photojournalist from 1976's The Omen developed a self-portrait only to observe a pole-like object through his head on the actual print. After the establishment that this method of shooting those whom then possess implements about their person foretells their death, the journalist takes it upon himself to get out and underway on the quest to stop the forces of Evil doing their bidding by putting himself on the front-line and in harm's way. The kick was in the anticipation of when it might happen, indeed IF it might given how informed on the situation the journalist was. Damien Omen II gets more of a buzz out of the shrill spectacle of the people falling afoul of it all, an often tiresome project with very little in the way of character despite one individual having to come to terms with the fact The Devil is among us; very little narrative in spite of the fact The Devil is preordaining the take over of the globe and very little interest in spite of the fact, well, you know....

Damien &#150; the son of the devil &#150; is an adolescent now and lives with his aunt (Lee Grant) and uncle (William Holden). He pretty much acts like any other teenager and is rather irritating in other words. Yet, every time someone becomes suspicious towards him and/or his past, this person brutally comes to an end. These ingenious and horribly showed massacres are the only highlights in an overall lame film. Don Taylor desperately tries to maintain the breath-taking biblical tone of the first and adds multiple Christian topics as well as an equally great musical score. Holden is a worthy follow-up for Gregory Peck but he deserved a better script to work with, for sure. There's a giant lack of tension and involvement in this sequel! The character of Damien as the Antichrist was much more scarier at the age of 5 than he is at 14&#133; Still, as mentioned earlier, there are a couple of great death-scenes like who's getting sliced up in an elevator and a chilling bird-attack. For the fans of religion-themed horror especially!

Film is so badly structured that a fight between Damien and a taunting classmate results in unintended laughter (the woman who gets her eyes pecked out and then stumbles in front of a truck also got laughter from the audience I saw this with). There's no momentum for the terror the filmmakers are trying to mount; they release all the tension by giving us outlandish, shock deaths (as with a lengthy elevator sequence, so painstakingly mounted with precision it can't help but be an anti-climax). Good actors like William Holden, Lee Grant, Sylvia Sidney, Robert Foxworth and Lance Henriksen struggle through this, but most of the movie rests on Jonathan Scott-Taylor's lead performance he's well-cast as Damien but decidedly one-note, with a monotone voice that seems mired in indifference. If the Devil really did put a disciple on Earth, wouldn't that boy be a terrifying and dynamic presence? This kid squints his suspicious eyes and makes heart attacks happen... *1/2 from **** "}{"Title":"Poor","Date":"2 November 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Inferior sequel that's little more than a series of grisly death set-pieces, some of them downright silly and not shocking or frightening in the least. The entire point of the movie seems to be to introduce people just so we can see them die a horrible death. There's none of the suspense or intrigue from the first movie and certainly none of the creepiness.The script is weak. Whenever it isn't focused on setting up a death scene, it seems confused. There are entire subplots that go nowhere and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie, so far as I could tell. The acting ranges from terrible to competent. Vets like William Holden and Lew Ayres go through the motions while the lead, Jonathan Scott-Taylor, is unimpressive to say the least. The film does boast of being the debut of Meshach Taylor though! Avoid it unless you're really bored or a devotee of the first film who feels compelled to complete the series.

The plot, in a nutshell Young Damien, Anti-Christ that he is, is adopted by the brother of his Earth daddy who tried to execute him in the first film. Puberty age Damien goes to military school...and does nothing for most of the film. Meanwhile, there's lots of dirty work afoot in the annals of Thorn Industries, which young Damien will eventually inherit. We get lots of characters we've never seen before, who are all apparently part of the Satan Fan Club, plotting Damien's future for him. Anybody not in the hell clique and figures out what the hell is going on is immediately, and graphically, murdered in ways that put any of the Final Destination deaths to shame. Eventually, Damien literally reads the truth out of a book, (the bible, in this case) and then...does nothing some more.During all of this, upper tier actor such as William Holden, Lee Grant and others shamelessly overact the silly scenes and ridiculous dialog they're given to perform. Everybody but Damien dies, setting us up for the inevitable and even worse third movie in the series, The Omen The Final Conflict. And as Porky Pig would say, Th-th-th-that's all, folks! Seriously, I've just told you the whole movie, now you don't have to waste two hours of your life sitting through this. Aren't I a nice guy?I'm a lot nicer then the powers-that-be that put together this stillborn sequel. For a film named for it's Anti-Christ central character, Damien is given pretty much NOTHING TO DO for the whole film. Everything that happens, all happens around him, most of it in the midst of his ignorance of it even happening. When Damien DOES get wise to what's up, the film is almost over, anyway. So, if Damien isn't the cause of all the horror and bloodletting, who is? The aforementioned ciphers of characters, who have no context or back story, they're all on Damien's side because A) they're devil worshipers and b) they're convenient to the plot. Them, and the damned black crow that shows up whenever it's time for a murder and even gets involved in one of the killings at one point. When a god-damned BIRD is scarier then the Anti-Christ, it's definitely time for some script-doctoring. But no, Omen II is nothing more then it was intended to be a Hellish money-grab, leaving audiences asking God why they coughed up perfectly good money for this. If there's one positive to be said about Omen II it's that at least it's not as bad as Omen III The Final Conflict, for what that's worth. Do yourself a favor, just revisit the original Omen and treat this sequel like the Star Wars prequels and just pretend it doesn't exist. You'll be happier if you do.And look out for black crows!

I've finished watching The Omen not two hours ago, and I must say I haven't been entirely impressed (even when taking consideration of the facts it's over 30 years old). However, I must say The Omen II has been pleasantly surprising!Unlike most reviews I've seen, I've found The Omen II Damien to be far, far better than the first one on virtually all accounts (even if it has been made only two years after). The acting is better, more convincing and realistic (although the actors still seem too emotionless about all the deaths of their friends and relatives). The story and plot are better and less predictable. To top it off - there's even a twist towards the end, one that caught me completely off guard!Of course, the film isn't perfect. The greatest shortcoming is still the main character, Damien (this time played by Jonathan Scott-Taylor). While doing a much better job than Harvey Stephens in the first film, the character of Damien is still not as frightening and unnerving as it should be, in my opinion.What I might have neglected in my previous review is the music - which is one feature in which the first film is better than the sequel. However, in all other aspects - The Omen II is one of the best sequels I've seen, and a fine well done film. I'd recommend it to any Horror fan and/or late 70's films fan, but do watch the first film first, as it will make you enjoy this one all the more.

McKern is always very full of life and he speaks his final lines like he's King Lear cursing the heavens. If the movie would have continued with McKern and the Niven-type guy (and if they had lived, of course), the movie ultimately would have been far more interesting.Once the movie gets started on Damien, it is very boring and lifeless. Lee Grant acts angry, Jonathan Scott Taylor, as Damien, seems like he should be in the Dead Poet's Society, and William Holden tries to be a good sport about the whole thing.The death scenes are suitably graphic, drawn-out and imaginative, but the film is a complete repeat of the first movie (although more uneven and less interesting). This movie actually cheapens the memories of the first Omen film, since it's emphasis on death scenes makes the whole movie series seem like an excuse for such unsubtle exploitation.The first Omen film had a subtlety in the characterizations and some genuinely scary characters (Mrs. Baylock was memorably sinister and had a mysterious sense of danger). This movie, on the other hand, has forgettable and boring characters. One of the villains, played by Robert Foxworth, looks and acts just like Mike Brady from the television show The Brady Bunch. Another character is played by Alan Arbus, who played the psychiatrist on M*A*S*H. He plays his character the same way in this film, talking like an ethnic Alan Arkin. The lack of scary characters and the addition of generic ones make the film boring and unintentionally funny. Damien himself seems like a cuddly little kid going to prep school and wearing oversize military outfits. It seems like he's playing at being a grownup. Needless to way, there's no sense of evil from him at all. There's some first-rate actors involved in this (Elizabeth Shepherd, who plays one of the victims, is a very well-regarded actress), and it's not a little dis-spiriting that they didn't use their talents on something more worthy of them.A staleness and lifelessness hangs over the whole movie, and it ends up leaving the viewer feeling depressed, and not in a scary way. There are some good scenes, which show what the movie could have been. Besides the scenes with McKern, Jonathan Scott Taylor has an effective scene where he tries to talk his cousin into joining him on his satanic mission. It has a certain intensity that stands out and seems genuine. But ultimately, this movie is just an empty, deadening cash machine, written to squeeze the most out of the Omen franchise.

The truth is, Damien Omen II should be on the Bottom 100, somewhere adjacent to From Justin to Kelly. While Richard Donner's original film was superb and harrowing, this mindlessly bloody follow-up has a pre-teen Damien Thorn coming to terms with his demonic heritage (who died and made this movie American Graffiti?) and, bizarrely, absent for most of the movie, away at a military academy while a few people back home struggle to unravel the mystery of his identity. And what really happened that night at the church at the end of the first film.Therein lies one of the main problems-- no Damien! While he does end up wreaking quite a bit of havoc (once at the school, several other times on quick trips home), the directness of the plot is taken away from him. It's really not plausible for him to be causing so much destruction from so great a distance (yes, I attacked the plausibility of an Omen movie, not the most defensible of positions for me). Another huge problem is that the writers misinterpreted the point of the first one completely *plausible* deaths that were scary without being excessively bloody, and could be legitimately explained without resorting to blaming the bad guy. As The Omen Legacy documentary narrator Jack Palance said, the death scenes are spectacles of big-screen gore. There's an horrific raven attack, an icy demise on a frozen lake, an accident with industrial chemicals, and much more.And ravens? As the bestial residencies of evil spirits-- the role taken over from scary Rottweilers in the original-- birds, even ravens, aren't very effective. Well, okay, the bird lady from Mary Poppins just got a little scarier.After the first director, Michael Hodges, demonstrated a knack for moving along at a snail's pace, he was replaced by Don Escape from the Planet of the Apes Taylor. But Taylor is so concerned with finishing the movie on schedule that he doesn't take time to wring good performances out of the actors, even the legends like William Holden (here an emotionally impotent hack) and Lew Ayres (whose role does not suit him in the slightest). Worst of all are Lee Grant as Damien's preposterously skeptical aunt and Jonathan Scott-Taylor as an irritating Antichrist.And don't even get me started on Bill Butler's so-called cinematography.Damien does have one legitimate shock the shock that a sequel with so much promise could suck so bad.

In fact I thought it was so good that there was no way the original needed a sequel and this movie proves it . It fails for three obvious reasons 1 ) The audience know that Damien Thorn is the anti Christ hence we're one step ahead of all the characters in the movie unlike in the original where we were shocked by the plot revelations 2) This possibly ties in with the first point . Several characters are aware of the fate of Damien's parents but are very blasé about it all . In other words these characters seem impossibly stupid 3) Damien Thorn is around 12 years old and very polite . Is there anything less menacing than a polite 12 year old child ? The problem with sequels is that if they play out in an entirely different manner then fans of the first movie will be alienated , if they play out in the same way ( As is the case of this one ) then you've got a very predictable movie . In other words it's a case of heads you lose , tails you don't win . Aside from a couple of novelty deaths ( One of which was recently remade as a beer commercial ) there's not much to recommend this movie .
