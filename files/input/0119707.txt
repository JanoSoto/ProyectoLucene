The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.Line example Kitana My mother is dead. Sindel As will be her daughter! Gimmie a break!

But this....this....defies belief.How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.The special effects were truly special, but only in a special needs kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin. Because only someone truly demented would want to sit through this terrible, terrible film. Eh? What's that Doc? Yes, I know I sat through it. But it was all in the name of science, you see. I was doing research. By the way, you couldn't loosen this jacket a bit, could you?Anyway, as I say, the best actor was Brian Thompson.

It wasn't a work of art, but it was fun, funny, colorful and had some great fight scenes. Anihilation, though, suffers from an extreme case of sequelitis, with about half of the characters re-cast, all of which were a step down, a dumb story line, wooden acting, effects that were less advanced than the ones in the first movie, and a feeling of blah pervading the whole thing. Perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad CG animalities, a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game. Liu Kang's dragon looked like a pear with wings and a tail. Definitely avoid this one if you wish to keep your glowing memories of the arcade game intact. "},{"Title":"Oh, I'll tell you how bad this movie is, allright","Date":"3 February 2004","Score":"32 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  You know, I really liked the original Mortal Kombat. Sure they ripped off the premise from another movie, but at least it was good (Enter the Dragon). I loved the games until the 4th one and was widely known as being one of its best and most devoted followers. So maybe all this is why my then-girlfriend's idiot stoner brother told me that he heard this movie was incredible, and I excitedly went to see it.I'm a patient guy, and I have almost never felt the urge to walk out of a movie due to boredom (Tank Girl is the only other one I recall). But MKA here is a joke. If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised, then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.Here's one right off the bat. MKA isn't a sequel proper to the original Mortal Kombat. The original MK was, reasonably, based on the first game. A couple future characters made cameos, but that's it. So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game, the one most fans widely regard to be the best. But whereas the MK film was made at the time that part 2 was yielding to part 3, a lot changed in the extra couple years it took for this film sequel. As MK the movie was leaving theaters, MK3 the game was getting kind of a lukewarm reception, and people got sicker and sicker of it by the time MK4 came out. By now the games were in 3d and the storyline had gone from basic Enter the Dragon tournaments to all out apocalyptic robot wars and sorcerors controlling the fates of a bunch of new, generic characters. Until its decent reinventing in 2002, the MK games had hit a rough and oversaturated spot and would take 5 years to bounce back.So here in this worst time comes MKA, which skips the best chapter of the games entirely and jumps in at sort of a story junction between the 3rd and 4th games, the worst.  So we have characters from all 4 games running around and interacting, which is goofy as it is, and things get worse when sense is tried to be made of it. For example, (spoiler), in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage, a main character and semi-hero of the first movie, is summarily and unceremoniously killed off. My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.Soon after (more spoilers. In fact, there will be several so if you continue, do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA), robots from game 3 come in, negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero, a character killed in the first movie.  Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn, who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.Making things moe complicated is that elder God Raiden, played by Christopher Lambert in the original, is here played by someone else and seems to not want to fight at all, as the character has gone from wizardly power god to short haired, weasely Power Rangers nerd, giving up his immortality in the process and teaching our heroes a thing or two about friendship and courage.  Huh?Sticking things out, unfortunately for them, are Robin Shou and Talisia Soto, who play central characters Liu Kang and Kitana and who've returned from the original film. This time, neither of them are allowed to do anything much more than look shocked at the stupid story developments, and Liu Kang engages in a few fights that capture none of the magic or uniqueness of the original film. And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember. In the original, the fights were well choreographed and showcased a good selection of acrobatic and martial arts skill. Action was conveyed through close combat, good angles, and lengthy tradeoffs. And at the very least, there was a genuine moment or two where one might say wow, that was a cool move!. This time, a lot of the action is illusional, with the camera making quick cuts and sudden moves to sort of convey that stuff is going on. There's nary an actual hand-to hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds, and when you see what else was thrown in instead, you'll want to kill someone yourself.For example, remember the character Baraka, with his beast face and bladed arms? He's here, and in fact is joined by several identical others, who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a high-flying trapeze act straight out of the circus.  And what about Sheeva, 4-armed character that should have been the answer to decently done Goro, 4-armed creature of the original film? Well, whereas he was conveyed through puppeteering and animatronics, here Sheeva is played by a tall woman in generic spandex who tries to look menacing and does a couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms.Things (don't) pick up later on, when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf, who explains that Liu must harness his animality to succeed. Anyone familiar with the MK universe knows that the animality was a ridiculous player rumor which supposed that the MK games contained a method of killing one's opponent by turning into an animal and committing not a fatality but an animality. This dumb rumor was added to the 3rd game as fan service, and apparently delighted the producers of this film enough that it was actually explained as a real, feasible occurence. Feel your animality, N.Wolf says to Liu, urging him to harness the beast within. Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it, and then asks,pretty cool, huh?We who haven't left the room yet are saying no, but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise. At the end of the film, Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy (er, Shao Kahn), and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs, we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant, god awful stupid computer-generated beasts who do combat with each other. No, I mean it.  They turn into giant computer animated beasts. And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here- I mean big, shiny, plasticy-looking we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eye-strainingly obvious effects. Liu Kang could reasonably have turned into a cool chinese dragon or something, but instead winds up being this big-nosed, cross eyed, dopey dragon thing. Shao Kahn turns into something equally ridiculous and less memorable and the two have it out. Then at the last minute Shao Kahn's sorceror dad decides he's gone too far, disgraced the family name by becoming a crappy visual effect, and makes him disappear or something. Then everyone hugs, and more or less runs far, far away.I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film, because I actually haven't seen it in several years. I don't hate myself enough to watch it more than that. But if you want an actual review without the sarcasm, just look at it this way It is an insult to the MK franchise and its fans, it fails as a follow-up to the fun original MK film, it fails TERRIBLY as a martial arts film, and in general it just is a dumb waste of time, an arbitrary, thrown-together cash-in sequel. Do yourself a favor and just watch the original, and if you still crave more, go play the games. And if you do insist on seeing this movie, then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.

MKA is terrible.I loved the Mortal Kombat games, and was pleased to see that MK The Movie was better than Street Fighter II The Movie. Sure, it was a light-on film, but it had some moments and I spent most of my time laughing at the unintentionally bad bits. MKA makes MK The Movie look sophisticated.The first five minutes basically drops a piano on the head of the first movie - new bad guy, Johnny Cage dies, new heroes appear, minimal explanation. From then on you have a sub-standard martial arts film packed full of cheap costumes on cheap actors following a cliched script. I know there's not a lot of narrative you can squeeze out of a fighting computer game, but surely the writers could have tried a little harder to make something work. Having gone to the movie with a guy who didn't play the games, I had to explain what the hell was going on for the first half (like why is that guy fighting him?) and gave up after that.That said, this movie contains the most unintentionally hilarious moment I have ever seen on film. Towards the end of the movie, Raiden moves from having flowing straight white hair to a peroxided flat-top. There's a brief mention of Raiden getting a haircut, and that's it. It makes absolutely no sense, and thinking about it still makes me laugh. "},{"Title":"Nothing to add.

First of all, the death of Johnny Cage in the beginning scene of the movie destroyed a lot of expectations as there were many who became fans of Johnny Cage in particular. In addition to that, the action scenes from Liu Kang were rather fake, in contrary to his action moves in Mortal Kombat. The introduction of Jax was not explained, how did he get into the hospital. Subzero's entry was understandable, but was it the same of Scorpion? Baraka, Mileena, Sheeva, Ermac, Nightwolf, Jade etc. are high profile fighters in the game, but in this movie, they were represented horribly. Sheeva died without a fight, Nightwolf came in just to hit an axe on Liu Kang, Jade was JUST A TRAITOR.Shao Kahn's acting was the worst. His fighting style lacked the depth and originality like Shang Tsung had in the previous film.All in all, I would recommend the fans of Mortal Kombat to avoid watching this movie if they want to maintain their good impression of the first movie.

The only thing I knew about it going in was that James Remar was replacing Christopher Lambert as Rayden, which I was upset about, but I thought Remar would do a good job.Boy, was I wrong. The whole cast, even Robin Shou, who was decent in the 1st, and great in Beverly Hills Ninja, can't seem to act his way out of a paper bag in this one.*** Mega Spoilers, Cause You Shouldn't See This Movie Anyway ***The big mistake the writers made with this movie, was trying to incorporate all of the characters, even the hidden ones, from not just Mortal Kombat 2, but Mortal Kombat 3 as well. (The plot is taken from the MK3 video game). MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3, a trio, a team, and their teacher Raiden. And only 2 bad guys (Goro, Shang Tsung). In MK2, we have a virtual plethora of heroes and baddies.Heroes (8) Liu Kang/Rayden/Kitana/Sonya/Jax/Johnny Cage/Nightwolf/Sub ZeroBaddies (14) Shao Kahn, Shinnok, Sindel, Motaro, Jade, Sheeva, Cyrax, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Ermac, Rain, Baraka, Smoke, and Mileena.Yeah, I thought that was a lot too. All of these characters have lines and/or fight scenes too. This doesn't even include the characters from the games that are mentioned, but not shown. A bunch of these baddies (and even some heroes) die or just leave, never to return, in about a minute after they appear. For instance, here's the plot of some of the sub charactersRain Says hi, gets thrown into a fiery pit.Sub Zero Shows up, says hi, fights and kills botty Smoke, tells Liu Kang you are not ready, then disappears, never to be heard from again. Smoke Killed within a 2 minutes by aforementioned Sub Zero.Baraka er.. I think you see him.. once.Mileena Shows up, attacks Sonya, somehow dies from a bonk on the head.Scorpion Shows up, fights Sub-Zero, kidnaps Kitana, disappears.Johnny Cage Shows up, says hi, Shao Kahn breaks his neck a good minute into the movie. Sheeva Has a few lines early, Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.Those are just some examples. On top of these character issues, the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take. There are literally *tons* of continuity and placement errors. A few quick examples, all from the same 10 minute stretchRayden leaves Sonya, and tells her to find her buddy Jaz, then to head to The Temple of the Elder Gods. Of course, after she finds Jax, she immediately knows where it is.When we first meet His Jaxness himself, he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax. We pan away with his fist somehow stuck in a wall with a good inch of space around it. We pan back a few seconds later, and his entire arm is stuck in the wall.Sonya gets into a muddy fan-service fight with Mileena. After a muddy battle, and a split scene later, all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned.During aforementioned Muddy Fan-Service fight, Sonya gets thrown into a rock. This big rock, about 10 times the size of her, waggles and moves a bit with her weight falling on it. Again, those are just some examples, but they're *rampant* in the movie. As for the plot, well, the idea and premise is interesting, but they delve way too deep into it. It would have been better if they kept it superficial, the way they did in the first movie. But, no, they had to try to explain everything life, existence, the tournament, and why the toast always lands butter side down.The result of all this atrocity is a corny, poorly directed, aterribly written, underbudgeted (looks like most of the stuff *I* could have pulled off with my home computer) nightmare that's worth buying solely to laugh at. 0/10 "},{"Title":"God no","Date":"18 June 2003","Score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  I really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat movie, I like action flicks that aspire to be more.

So since the first film was a success, naturally they were going to make a sequel and they did manage to mess this one up badly. I'll start with the plot first and explain in a moment all the badness that is the mess.The evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld to the Earthrealm and has reclaimed his queen Sindel, who is Kitana's long-dead mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which Liu Kang and the others must fight to prevent. Sonya enlists the help of her old partner, Jax , while Kitana and Liu Kang search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf , who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn.

The acting is horrible, like really bad, like they went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting bad. The special effects are something that could be easily done on an elementary school computer. The editing is too fast and gives you a massive headache.There's a mud wrestling match between Sonja and Mileena, which I'm sure the director was telling them it was for the cool effect of the fight while I'm sure he was playing with his stick shift behind the camera while this was going on. There is no explanation for why Scorpion and Sub Zero are back, except that Sub Zero is Sub Zero's brother, yet they have the same names? Doesn't make much sense does it? The fight scenes are so badly put together, there's a scene where the ninjas look like they're doing ballet, not fighting. Rayden spends so much time talking to the group and finally when he has a chance to fight, he bows out like a coward.Yeah, that's just some of the film that I'm describing. Scary sounding, isn't it? I don't know what they were thinking when they thought that this was OK to put in the theaters. The first film was a lot of fun, it stuck true to the video games and is one of the best video game movies of all time.

I enjoyed playing the games but was never that into them. Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat, to be fairly entertaining. Mild stuff really, verging on almost could be cool if... A real four stars out of ten fiasco, but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild in-depth studies, they jetisoned that for seven main characters, each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example1) A new Raiden. Lambert, gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person, so to have him say i've had a haircut rar rar is a tragic way of saying i know i'm not lambert so I did something different. 2) Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor, only in for his mild kung-fu knowledge, on the premise he could act. Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun). In this one, he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment, before the final confrontation, it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is i want to do it, but i'm not ready, and you layer over that with dialogue, meanings, symbolism, action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation. The writers obviously fed up at this point that their obvious talents were wasted on this low budget tripe, so just had the character say it, so they could invariably fit in more action sequences. 3) Far too many to go into. The fact that everything is figured out so matter of factly. Raiden figures out the prophecy (don't ask) was a lie. Surely not??? So to explain this travesty of events he claims they must of lied to me. Bravo. Many nights burning the midnight oil for that one huh? It is all too, it is so because it is soThe special effects truly are tragic. The only ones in the original were Sub Zero's Ice Blast, which in fairness was quite tastefully done if you are a hardcore fan. Scorpions get over here, which is always a crowd favourite. Reptile, and Lui Kangs dragon punch (goro was Plasticine). But here they've wanted to go over the top with not nearly enough money. Sindels spinning to escape is woeful. Scorpions get over here is a pitiful remake (which also reminds me, Sub and Scorp are back, the two greatest characters ever, and yet they're midgets. About half the size from the original, looks as if they've been on three simultaneous atkins diets), and everything else is shambolic.The action skips from one scene to the next, but nothing grabs the eye.

In addition, some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation for- Why did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie?  Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal?  And where was Christopher Lambert, anyway?- What was the third test?  Where did that Wolf-guy go?  What happened to Sub-Zero?- Why did they do that stupid thing with Jax' bionic arms?  Stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies.  Stupid movies which try to have serious elemends become bad movies.- Same deal with Katana's mother.- What was point of that huge monster that came out of nowhere to attack Sonya, then immediately went back to it's whole when Jax hit it on the head? Was it a whack-a-mole?- How is it that Sonya and Jade began to fight IN A DESERT and they immediately fell into a mud pit?- Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?- What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon?  He just turned into a human again, without having done anything effective as a dragon.  How was that useful?- Why didn't they spend more then $80 on the special effects for that dragon?  I could do better then that with miniatures and clay animation.- How is it that this movie could have been made so badly, with such bad cinematography and such pathetic martial arts effects, after the first one was so good?

As said before, Raiden goes from the Thunder God to a weeping coward. The new Liu Kang is nowhere near as good as the one in the original movie. Not to mention the fact that half of the new actors, such as the actor who portrayed Shao Kahn, were nowhere near good enough to play a character in a franchise such as Mortal Kombat.Another problem I had with this movie is its inconsistency with the game. For instance, it is revealed that Raiden and Shao Kahn are brothers, and Shinnok is their father.There is also the issue that the movie seemed a bit rushed. The reason it was rushed, as I can see, is to cram as many characters as possible into the movie, to properly represnt the game. Ermac served no purpose, nor did Rain. Ermac is one of my favorite characters in the game, and to see him in the movie as a 2 minute segment which ends with him being quickly killed off does not satisfy me.I would give this movie a 3 out of 10, simply because, although it was lackluster, was based on Mortal Kombat, and I will grant it something for that.

In Mortal Kombat you had a series of fighting games that, unlike most games of that genre, actually had interesting characters with somewhat interesting back-stories (admittedly things got pretty stupid by MK 4, but that's another review ...). It's amazing that this piece of childish, Saturday-morning-cartoon, plotless nonsense could come out of that. I mean, after all, look at the first movie; it wasn't so bad. Not GOOD, but not BAD either. They utterly ignored the Scorpion/Sub-Zero feud, they killed Kano off far too early, the last scene was totally out of place, and the Goro effects were awful, but other than that it was okay.But MKA is an insult to every long-standing fan of the games. Hey, Hollywood movie-makers, take note gamers are not ALL illiterate, bloodthirsty, sex-crazed teens who are so stupid they'll love anything with loud noises, people fighting, chicks in tight clothes, and lots of pretty colors.MKA loosely follows the back-story of the third MK game, which saw Outworld emperor Shao Kahn take over Earth by using a cosmic loophole to re-incarnate his queen, Sindel. Not Oscar-winning stuff for sure, but it could have been done with SOME class and style. And it wasn't. What we got was a little bald Shao Kahn about as menacing as Big Bird, a bunch of insipid crap that had NOTHING to do with the games (family crest tattoos, anyone?), and not even a halfway serious attempt at creating a plot or story.This isn't so much a movie as it is a long strung-together series of arcade game matches played out by actors OTHER than the ones who were digitized into the actual games. Scorpion appears, then Sub Zero. Subby beats Ol' Yellow Drawers off, hastily explains that he is the younger brother of the original Sub Zero, does some freezing tricks, and then we see no more of him; it's on to the next match. And on we go ... Characters are trotted in; a pathetic, completely un-exciting fight ensues; one character is promptly killed or removed in some way; Repeat step 1. Play MK Trilogy for two hours straight sometime; it's not only the exact same experience as MKA - it's BETTER.And it gets worse. It really does. I don't know how, but it does. Which brings me to the Animalities. Most fans I've talked to agree (and so do I) that this was one of the lamest things ever introduced in the games, and lo and behold the filmmakers fell on it and INCLUDED it in the movie, making for some incredibly cheesy and badly animated monster battles. Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turning into Godzilla-style creatures? Come on. The mud wrestling match between Sonya and Mileena was better than that. And THAT was pretty pathetic, too.Other wonderful features of the film include Sonya's miraculous ability to become squeaky-clean - complete with a lush mane of blow-dried hair - after suffering that mudbath. And while the filmmakers (I use the term loosely) mindlessly crammed in small story tidbits from the game with no attempt to make a story out of them, they studiously ignored Kabal and Stryker - both of whom would have made for some GREAT material - by having somebody casually mention that they'd both been captured. Then its back to the mindless series of matches.And to those of you who may say chill out, it's not meant to be taken seriously, I say this even though that may be true, you should still expect a certain level of intelligence in plot and story. This movie has not one shred of anything even approaching intelligent writing. Look at how good the X-Men flick was - who'd have thought a story about a bunch of comic-book mutants could be pulled off so well? MKA could've been as good, and it bugs me that it wasn't. I live in fear of the next MK movie...

I also was sad when the two heroes died, but not angry. Granted, the special effects and settings are bad, but in many ways the pacing is better than the original Mortal Kombat film. The storyline itself is a fantastic port of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game.MKA completely targeted all the 1997 gamers and gave us everything we could want, if you really think about it. MKA had the secret characters from the game, animalities, fatalities, special moves, bosses, and correct costumes. There were several fights, and in many ways the new actors of Rayden and Sonya fit their roles better.

And if Paul Anderson thinks something sucks, along with half your potential cast, surely that's a cue to revise it? No. Not for Leonetti. He decided to direct the movie himself around this horrible script, with embarrassing lines like I have already claimed THOUSANDS of souls!, Centaurs are renowned for their hunting prowess!, and the legendary Too bad YOU... will DIE! to keep everyone laughing at the original script reading.

UH UH, NO WAY, he doesn't fire missile in ANY of the games, he fires a 3 prong spear, Scorpion-style, and only throws those little cyrax-style bombs like in his fatality move.

In the first, you had the four heroes (Cage, Sonya, Kang, and Raiden), and about five villains (Kahn, Kano, Sub-zero, Scorpion, and Goro).  This meant that at least some amount of time could be spent building on characters.  Thus, before we see Sub zero,Goro and scorpion fight, we know who they are , and their reputations.  This doesnt happen with a single character in MKA because it is too busy trying to throw as many characters from the games at you as possible that it often doesnt even have time to mention who they are (e.g. Smoke, Cyrax, Rain, Baraka, Mileena).2)  It's had a $30 million budget, yet seems to have spent on completely the wrong things.  I would have much rather they had halved their SFX budget and hired a decent fight choreographer.  Put it this way Iron Monkey cost less than $4 (if I remember correctly) for the entire film, and there isnt a single fight in MKA that comes close to the worst in that film, which leads on to the next point.3) The direction is TERRIBLE!!  Especially during the fights!!!  Watch any decent fight sequence, and generally the cuts are kept to a minimum.  It both makes the fight easier to follow, and shows off the skill of the participants more. Its rare in this film that any flow between moves occurs without cuts.

I mean, it tried to show all the characters (even from MK II) and their special powers. Every character from MK 3 and UMK3 are present in the movie, even only by reference (Kabal and Stryker). The f/x were quite good until the horrible, cheesy Animality combat between Kang and Kahn.So the plot is exactly the same as in the MK 3 game but with a few dramatic insertions such as Shao Kahn being Raiden's brother, and some things about Sindel. It's true that MK 2 is the best game so far from the series, but it's also true that MK 3's plot is the best. It deals with the Outworld squads invading earth in order for Shao Kahn to take full control of it. Luckily for humanity, there are chosen warriors who are brave enough to face Kahn's extermination armies and save the world. But basically, this is a copy of the MK 3 plot but with different lead characters. The premise is really good but the director didn't know how to display the events in a decent manner. The success of MK 3's plot is how it's explained and developed through the characters' background. In Annihilation the events happen in a non sense manner and we don't have enough character development. Only Raiden tells the chosen warriors to believe in themselves and mocks about Jax's arms. The rest of the movie are pure scenes of mindless combat scenes. Which by the way, aren't as good as in the previous MK movie that had truly great martial arts moves. In this one, the sequences aren't as good as in the video game! The main problem with the movie is that it tried to explore many character backgrounds and also tried to display many special powers, fatalities, etc. in such a short running time. Why would they only mention Kabal and Stryker? Why would they include Rain, Mileena, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Nightwolf, Ermac, etc. if they only appeared for 1 minute?! Sheeva was a waste of running time and Motaro wasn't even as cool as Goro from the previous movie. But the movie deserves credit for trying to be almost a replica of the MK 3 game. Heck, Johnny Cage also dies in this one. You may chuckle at some points after noticing references to fatalities, friendships, and character backgrounds from the game. But that is not enough. Annihilation is a mediocre attempt to capitalize the huge success of the first movie. A good sequel does not means copying the techno music, or f/x. The actors weren't that bad. Robin Shou and Talisa Soto were great in their reprising roles. Talisa is a delight to watch. The same goes for Sandra Hess. Sonya couldn't be hotter! Brian Bosworth was an over the top evil character but he has good in the role. The actor who played Jax was a nice addition because he added some comedy moments. Raiden was a wuss and wasn't as bad-ass as the original but still had his moments.Overall, watch this movie ONLY, ONLY if you are a die hard fan of the MK games, specially part 3. If not, avoid this like the plague!

That's why it's so disappointing that this sequel was below par. First off, several of the cast members I enjoyed from the first film decided not to reprise their roles for this film - the main example being Christopher Lambert as Lord Rayden (though James Remar tried his best to fill in Lambert's shoes). Another problem is that the Johnny Cage's character (again a different actor this time around) is killed off right off the bat. The script in essence is very poorly written and the visual effects are appalling. I just the filmmakers redeem themselves with the 3rd outing of Mortal Kombat in 2006 - Devastation. 4 out of 10.

Bridgette Wilson, Christopher Lambert and I think they replaced Johnny Cage too.I like how they brought Brian Thompson and Litefoot in to play Shao Khan and Nightwolf and the rest of the new cast to play the characters weren't so bad, but the story was dreadful.Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are great but the overall plot is confusing. Suppose the merger did take place, what happened to all the human beings? There are what 6 billion people on earth and the only ones wandering around the merger are the warriors? The extermination squads couldn't even wipe out Jax and Sonya how could they take out 6 BILLION others? The animality scene was also a little far-fetched but that was from the game so no real damage there.I guess I couldn't get over the transition from Chistopher Lambert playing Rayden to the guy who played Ajax in The Warriors playing Rayden.

So, in other words, MK Annihilation is a perfect adaptation of MK3Ultimate Turbo Spaz Fighting or whatever the final sequel of that one they came out with was.Don't try to follow the storyline.  As far as I could tell, these 3-5 people who seem to be the main good guys (Rayden, Liu Kang, Sonya, Jax, Kitana) walk around randomly and fight random people, for little to no reason at all.  They're supposed to be building up an army and building their skills or something, but that never happens.  In fact, Liu Kang just magically gets his skillz back before fighting Mr. Evil Man for no reason also-after having spent most of the film getting beat up by everyone and their second cousin.  I think even I could have a good chance of giving this yutz a beatdown, as directed.Don't try to follow all the characters.  MKA tries to force in EVERY SINGLE OBSCURE CHARACTER that's ever been in these games, which I guess may be good if you're initiated.  Otherwise, you won't give a Motaro's tail about anyone.  I suppose even Boon Saibot was in there somewhere-and Stryker (the dopey-cop who only I ever played in the game) even gets a mention.  You'll just throw up your hands in the first 15 minutes, and give up on these people.Don't count on the effects or the fighting to save you either, because both are woefully poor.

The plot.....wait a minute, what plot, this didn't have one, they may have mentioned something about the world ending in six days, but i wasn't really paying attention, the special effects were so bad that they weren't even worth laughing at, i noticed that someone on here said that they didn't want to give away the ending, why not, because somebody might not actually predict it in the first half, rayden dies, and the good guy and the bad guy turn in to CGI dragons and have a fight, good guy wins, rayden is brought back life and everybody lives happily ever after, except the viewer, that is.

The same applies to MKA.  However, in this case, they should have gone for direct translation.  It seems as though this film's only purpose was to cram in as many Mortal Kombat characters as could fit in an hour and a half.  The film was also ruined by inconsistant casting there were about eight (Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Blade, Cage, Rayden, Liu Kang, Kitana, and Jax) characters that appeared in both films.  So how many were cast the same the second time around?  Two (three if you count Ed Boon as the voice of Scorpion).  If you're not a fan of the games, don't even bother.

Needless to say, I decided to give this film a chance. All the other reviews mention the main problems an overabundance of special effects combined with a plot similar to the anecdotes a 3rd grader writes on a bathroom stall. This film wanted to be what the first film was unique, fun, even entertaining. IT ISN'T. However, let's remember a few things. (1)video games RARELY translate well into movies (cases in point - Double Dragon and Super Mario Bros.). (2) Sequels should have more than 2 actors returning from the first film (you know that even Christopher Lambert was glad he dodged this bomb). And finally, (3) Films should have a plot people can follow. This film tried to cover material in 2 video games and it simply ended up being a colossal mess. Personally, I would be less interested in the 'fate o' the world' stuff and more interested in asking questions like Hey, how'd he age backwards? Who invited the Minotaur to this party? and the like.

If the bad guys don't give a damn about the Elder Gods, why the heck did they play by the Gods' rules in the first movie.  Undercutting your first movie's basic concept just doesn't help you.And the plot is just too full.  Apparently Boon and Tobias, buoyed by the success of the first movie, said to themselves, Cool, now we can throw in all the faceless villains the marketing guys they told us would be too much for the audience in the first movie.  Whoops - this inundation of characters is too much for the audience in the second movie as well.  Why is Sub-Zero a good guy, and where does he go?  Who the heck is Nightwolf, and why doesn't he help save Earth other than to give Liu Kang the test(s)? What purpose do characters like Jade, Sheeva, and Montaro serve other than to provide some kung fu cannon fodder?  It's like we had one good human villain (Shang Tsung) and one good F/X villain (Prince Goro) in the first movie, so they decided, Hey, lets put in two human villains and two F/X villains in this one.Which brings us to the F/X.  Arrgh.  There is none of the care that obviously went into the first movie, which whatever its deficiencies, at least gave you something good to look at.  In the rush to kick out a sequel (barely two years), they obviously spent neither time or money.So MK A is mildly viewable in a martial arts/fantasy kind of way.

It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first Mortal Kombat instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first Mortal Kombat movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last Mortal Kombat movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to Terminator 2 producer Lawrence Kasanoff.Robin Shou who starred in the other Mortal Kombat movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

After the fun first installment, I was looking forward to this. Perhaps my expectations were too high. That's not the only problem.This is a very bad movie. One notable mention is the fact that only two actors from the first movie reprised their roles. That's a very bad sign alone. Christopher Lambert is not back as Raiden sucks. Lambert was good as the Raiden and the schmuck that played Raiden here looked and acted like a total flake. He cannot fill the shoes of Lambert at all. This movie also has some silly to lame action sequences. Another problem is despite the many characters here, many of them are just cameos. We only see Nightwolf for a minute and that's that. The likeness of the Kombat characters here is the only redeeming quality MKAnnihlation has got.This movie is also unintentionally hilarious. There is a lot of cheese to fly around and lots of campy acting to be the ultimate B movie, just without the fun.The first installment is worlds better than this. It featured a fine cast, a good story, interesting characters and a fantastic villain. Shao Khan here comes of as a club bouncer in a costume.Now I know why many of the actors did not reprise their roles, after reading the script, would you blame them? The Last Word Total disaster. Mortal Kombat had the potential to be the next big movie franchise. With this, those dreams were destroyed. Pity. I would like to find the director and Finish Him! Jerk.

Every time I get together with my cousins, we all sit down and watch it. And, every time, we find something new to mock and criticize. We rarely meet, talk over the phone, or IM each other without a quote from Mortal Kombat slipping in. Such favorites as you will die for this, Jade and Too bad you...will die are more common. (Yes, I know it's sad.) This movie is just god awful. The fighting scenes are so fake. I just love it when they do their little flips instead of walking three feet. There is a feeble plot that has many holes and mistakes. The first scene is one of ninjas falling out of the sky in fireballs. And it doesn't get much better then that. If you love to make fun of movies, this is the best movie you'll ever find. If not, don't watch it. The worst (or best) scenes are when 1. Kitana's mother screams and walks up the steps whith rock music playing, 2. When Kitana is kidnapped and Lou says I've got to find Kitana and 3. when Jade appears in the middle of the Hopi mason wearing a loin clothe. Of course, the rest of the movie is riddled it equally bad scenes. As said before, I would definitely recommend this movie to all people who love to mock movies. I would also recommend, if you get it on DVD, to read what all the actors have to say about their character. It's sad how serious they take it.

But, seeing as how I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat as a young adolescent male, I figured I'd give it a try, it would only cost me 3$ and barely 1 & ½ hours if every instinct I had proved to be right. Well, after trying to watch this film (I guess you can call it a film since it is barely feature length. but even that was too much for me since I turned it off after 20 minutes) for the first time on home video, I can truly say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The sample (thank God I had the sense to turn it off when I did) was enough for me to rate it as `almost' one of my least favourite films, garnering a 2/10. Some might say 2/10 was gracious, however I've seen some truly wretched films (Not another teen movie, Batman & Robin, Caligula etc.) and I felt I couldn't give it worse since I only managed to stomach 20 minutes. I took the hit, kissed my three bucks goodbye, rated it and forgot about it as quickly as I could.Unluckily, as fate would have it, I recently decided to make a compilation of some of my least favourite movies and rate them anew, and although Mortal Kombat Annihilation did not make the cut it was somehow in the back of my mind. Like the memory of the aftermath of a night of binge drinking, I couldn't shake the ghastly feeling of sickness any time I though of the first viewing of the film. So when the film happened to show up on TV (who knows what the station directors were thinking when they OK'd that programming), I thought to myself `I should watch it to see if it truly does deserve to be on my list' and that `it couldn't have been that bad'.  Plus I had to kill 2 hours before going out so I thought `why not?' For some reason I must have repressed more than I thought, or I just didn't get a good enough sample the first time, but in any case the full viewing of this utter waste of celluloid will haunt me for the rest of my days. I won't go into detail as to why the film is so putrid, I believe many here have already accurately recounted the many shortcomings, however I did want to mention that the film is now firmly enshrined in my top 10 worst list, having been revised down to a 1/10 (and now that's being gracious). If there's one recommendation I can make it's to not see the film, save yourself 91 minutes of pain (or if you're into S&M, pleasure), or if you absolutely have to see it (ie. you have a death wish) then bear in mind that you're in for a movie that should really have been directed by Alan Smithee, and then even he would have wanted to change his name before it was released.

This is probably the biggest flaw of the second movie. A character appears seemingly out of nowhere for a fight scene and although MK fans know who they are, the general audience has no clue. Most of the characters that appear like this are either killed off in the single fight scene or disappear and are never heard from again. In a couple of instances, the names of the characters weren't even mentioned. It was a bad attempt to try and squeeze every single character from the video game into the movie. (And it's still missing some character - Kintaro and Kung Lao come to mind.)Another huge problem with the movie is that a sequel should not require that you have watched the original in order to enjoy it and understand everything that's going on. This movie picks up the second that the original one left off and spends only about 30 seconds explaining what happened the the first movie, but someone who hasn't seen the original has no way of identifying with the characters at all, who are never really introduced because the very first scene starts with Shao kahn invading the earth.Probably the next biggest fault of the movie is that it's missing Christopher Lambert as Rayden. Though the new guy that played Rayden tried hard, it just wasn't a good casting decision. And the other actors were pretty bad as well. The original MK certainly didn't win any awards for its acting, but the acting in this one is just plain bad for the most part.Another problem with the movie is continuity and other such issues. A good deal of the movie revolves around Liu Kang searching through the desert trying to find a character named Nightwolf in order to 'find his animality', which is supposed to prepare him for a final battle with Shao Kahn. However, all of this was totally unnecessary, since learning his animality had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the final fight scene. Also, we have Shao Kahn's father who is trying to destroy the earth .. we are told nothing about him, except that he is an elder god. Heck, we don't even learn his name. He says that breaking the 'sacred rules' of the elder gods to invade the earth could have dire consequences if they ever found out, but we learn later in the movie that they already know about it in the first place. WTF?People say there's no plot in this movie, but I disagree. It's about an evil emperor of a place called 'Outworld' who tries to merge his world with ours, therefore destroying the earth in 6 days. A group of humans have to keep this from happeneing. Even though this movie is bad, I think saying it has no plot is a little unfair. (If you really want to see a movie that has no plot, watch Forrest Gump.) As for the special effects, I've never been one to judge, but they seem ok to me *shrug*In the end, though I did enjoy parts of this movie, I thought it paled in comparison to the original. If you didn't like the original, you definitely won't like this one. If you loved the original, well .... you still probably won't like this one.

Unfortunately the party is cut short when evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) & his generals, the four armed Sheeva (Marjean Holden), the half horse half man creature Motaro (Deron McBee) & Kitana's also not unattractive Mother Queen Sindel (Musetta Vander) appear & announce their plans for the destruction of the Earth as we know it. Shao Kahn has opened portals between the Outworld & Earth which will merge the two within 6 days & he will rule both unless our unlikely group of heroes can stop him & save the human race as well as themselves. With the odds seemingly stacked against them can they do it?Directed by John R. Leonetti Mortal Kombat Annihilation is the sequel to the decent Mortal Kombat (1995) & both were based on the popular video game series of the same name which I can vividly remember playing with my mate on my Super Nintendo during the mid 90's, it was one of those games that you could have great fun with & one which we always went back to. Anyway, the script by Brent V. Friedman & Bryce Zabel takes just about all the character's up-to Mortal Kombat III which what the video game series was at when this came out & sticks them in one long fight sequence, to be perfectly honest there isn't a story really & any semblance of plot that is buried in here merely sets up the next fight or is there to introduce another character from the game. Sometimes you can just sit back & enjoy a film for what it is & that's what I did with Mortal Kombat Annihilation, for me it brought back good memories of years gone by, it moves like an absolute rocket & you never have time to catch a breath before the next fight/monster/explosion/favourite character or just some good looking lady in a tight fitting costume kicking ass, what more do you want? On the negative side the Mortal Kombat games caused controversy because of the on screen violence & bloodshed like Sub-Zero's fatality where he would rip his opponents head off & the spine would still be attached, unfortunately the filmmakers obviously had a teenage audience in mind & I just thought it was far too tame & the fights had no satisfying pay-offs, also Mortal Kombat Annihilation is probably the most far removed from reality film I've ever seen & it's just incredibly silly so anyone looking for something meaningful would probably be wise to skip this.Director Leonetti does a good job, the sets are cool with some nice colour schemes, the action is shot nicely by which I mean the camera doesn't jump cut every millisecond like a lot of films these days, this has the added bonus of us, the viewer that is, actually being able to see whats going on & keeping track of where everyone is & what their doing. The fights are very well choreographed & a lot of special moves from the games are here although I must again bring to your attention the general lack of ferocity & violence, it's just so tame & I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood during the entire film. Some of the CGI is absolutely terrible, some of the monsters are embarrassing to look at. The costumes are neat although I think the women could have worn a bit more leather if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 it's well made, bad CGI apart, & you get plenty of fights & action for your money. Surprised to learn a fair amount of it was shot in England as well as Wales, Jordan & Thailand. The less said about the acting the better. There are some nice looking ladies here & a special mention goes to Talisa Soto whom is very easy on the eyes.Mortal Kombat Annihilation is one of those films that I liked a lot but I'm positive that many will hate, I don't really care though as films are all about personal opinion & I liked Mortal Kombat Annihilation, it ain't going to win any awards but for non-stop action, fights & mindless fun I doubt there's much better out there. I just wish the filmmakers had some balls & made it more violent & stick some gory fatalities in there. Oh well, nothings perfect I suppose... I liked it but I'm sure many won't, the choice is yours.

It's looks like an S & M kung-fu movie made by a film group of a college campus!  I mean, Community Theaters have better costuming than this!  And then they get rid of the two best elements of the original  Johnny Cage and Christopher Lambert (if you can't even lure Christopher Lambert back for a sequal, stop making your movie IMMEDIATELY!).

Mortal Kombat Annihilation. I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still ok not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.Mortal Kombat Annihilation has no substance, form, direction or anything remotely resembling a competent cast of actors. The director must have been a coffee machine or something, I really can't see why they decided to make a sequel. The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK Annihilation...A dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MKAnnihilation. So I was like...Damn, this is a glorified power rangers... I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit. RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do? They give us a Doogie Howser lookalike who is in need of orthodontic work. Every time we see him he's through a brick wall or falling off something high. He's like a piece of ham, but with less acting ability. All his words of 'wisdom' are like We have to work as a team, courage...courage...look within yourself at your...courage. Jax is just a token black guy, Sonya is admittedly hot, but not as hot and/or as kick ass as the original Sonya. Johnny Cage gets instantly killed by some 'thug' in a skull (the final 'boss') at the very beginning. Kitana and Liu Kang are just like the 'sexually' tense element of the film. They have the funniest (not meant to be funny) part of the movie, where the hardcore Sheeva, with 4 arms, having spent the entire movie looking fearsome and generally like a big, brutal beast...runs in and says The date is over. In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks. 10 seconds of pure Why was she even in the movie? goodness.There isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are misty and firey/smokey and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use We needed to make money as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like I have to see MK annihilation because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something good. Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct. At least not anything past Power Rangers or something? Anyhow, thats just how I felt about this movie.

The special effect were kinda cheap and cheesy... correction they ARE cheap and cheesy.The story development was nearly non-existent, how Kahn was able to merge the realms, and when they did bring up the plot it was the same point over, and over again, which was Queen Sindel is the key to all of this, and that is it, they also fail to mention things like, How Scorpion came back from the dead, why their are Robot ninjas, I know the answers cause I played the games, but for the casual viewer they won't know.They tried to fit more into this movie then there was in the first one, and yet they cut the run time shorter than the first movie. They also tried to give fans what they wanted by putting a fight with Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the movie... but it was a best a minute long, and really lame... the match between Scorpion and Cage was better. And they mention Kombatants from the game and never even show them, and guess spot the some,like Nightwolf is in the movie for a solid 3 minutes, they show Noob Saibot but he appears as part of Ermac and no one realizes he is a separate character (in reality he is the original Sub-Zero returned from the dead as a wraith), Mileena appears for mud wrestling match with Sonya only to be beaten in like a minute. Cyrax and Smoke pop up out of nowhere and are easily dispatched. Also Storyline wise regarding the games, they when from Mortal Kombat to Mortal Kombat 3, skipping the second game and cutting out the introduction and character building for some characters, I know they used some of the elements from MKII in the first movie, but the second movie just bypasses Shao Kahn's tournament and goes straight to his invasion. Mortal Kombat and MK Conquest are much better to watch than this movie. The only positive in the movie was the costumes for Smoke and Cyrax were dead on.

I was happy on how well the first movie was, as most (mainly 90% +) movies based on video games, are very bad. I saw the second movie, and well I was more let down by how bad it was. Basically this film starts off, where the first film ended, with Shao Kahn coming to Earth realm and having a plot to take over Earth in 6 days. You are also giving a quick review at the beginning of what happened in the previous movie. When the movie starts after the review of the last film, you will notice right off the bat, that most of the characters are played by different people. Johnny Cage is now played by Chris Conrad, instead of Linden Ashby (which I'm guessing probably seeing the script and seeing what happens to his character, he chose not be in this film). Sonya is now played by Sandra Hess instead of Bridgette Wilson. Lord Rayden is now played by James Remar instead of Christopher Lambert (who was committed to another film, thus could not be in the film). There are two initial problems with this film. The first problem being miscasting, and the second problem is not explaining/having too many characters in the film. So the first problem with this movie is miscasting. Sandra Hess may have had the looks to be Sonya, but did not having the acting skills to become the character of Sonya as Bridgette Wilson did. James Remar being Rayden. That had to be the biggest let down of them all in this movie. When Christopher Lambert portrayed Rayden, he WAS Rayden. Christopher Lambert hit the nail on the head, as I could see him being Rayden. James Remar fell very short of being Rayden. James made Rayden seem less like of a god to me, and just was one of the biggest let downs in the movie. The second problem in this film would be the amount none explaining/having too many characters in the film. A film can be a great movie with a lot of characters in it, if those are explained why they are there and their purpose. Even if it's a six second description of why they are there and who they are, that will work for me. This film fails to grasp that concept in a few ways. There are a lot of characters in this movie, but it is not explained why they are there in the first place or who they are if you don't already know who they are. One example of this would be Rain, who is like only seen for a few minutes in the film, and then meets his fate for his actions. Another example of this would be when Mileena attacks Sonya. Again it's not explained who she (Mileena) is and why she is here. There are other areas in the film, that this occurs, but I do not want to ruin any more of the film for you. This movie did have some good points to it. The fight scenes were well done, and gave an impression that the combat and fighting was real. Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprise their roles of Liu Kang and Princess Kitana, which both do a good job of being their respective character. So looking at this film, the two big things that didn't make this movie good as the first film, was miscasting and having too many characters and no story behind certain characters. Although at times, the recast can be better for a certain role, it does not always make the character seem better. In the case of Sony and Rayden, the miscast only hampered the roles that they played. Having too many characters in a film and not have them properly explained can also hamper a film. With the appearance of Rain and Mileena in this film, neither character is explained why they are there, and thus we are thinking either during the film or after Who was that character or what their point of being in the film was. Also by the fact that some characters are not explained who they are, people who have never seen the first Mortal Kombat movie, nor have played any of the games (Mortal Kombat II and up), may be confused by who some of these characters are. Unless you are in the mood for a bad film, or are either drunk and/or high avoid this film. Trust me, you won't regret it.

I'm glad this movie had more fighting because that's what MK is all about, but the story didn't match up to it and the acting was even worse.They should have expanded the story into two films, with this one finishing as a cliffhanger because the story was to big to squeeze into one film.

If that happens, mankind shall no longer exist. So it's up to a couple of martial arts warriors led by the Lord Rayden to stop that from happening.My, my, my. Why did I waste such precious time on this? Even I'm confused. I guess that's one of lives many mysteries that cannot be explained. The first film, which was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, was rubbish too, but at least it was enjoyable in that aspect and the time flew by quick enough that you didn't have many moments to nick-pick over the inconsistencies. 'Mortal Kombat' also captured some of the visual power of the game, which 'Annihilation' fell incredibly short of. This sequel picks right up where the first left off but instead it goes for a grand epic (but derivative) story then that off the first film's basic premise. So, soon before it begins, the film has already run out of steam and turns into one banal and convoluted mess. I couldn't stop thinking that I was watching a long-winded episode of 'Days of our Lives' with a fantasy twist involved. I say that because of the corny dialog and melodramatic speeches and conversations that had me flinching. Also throw in some moralistic jargon and a script that takes itself far TOO seriously. The whole we're a family now and feel good drivel drove me crazy. It threw in everything, but the kitchen sink. After all that you just want to break out the tissues! The underlining humour in the first is all but forgotten in the follow-up and makes for one colourless viewing. The performances treaded the same path as well. Flimsy characters that bore you to death because they're so uninteresting and limp. Some just disappeared without a trace to never be heard off again. Those who stood around would rather pose most of the time. The shapeless bad guys follow the standard traits and intentions that you can see the writers really stretched their minds to come up with. Gee even the gimmicky (Halloween) costumes they wore were inferior. Although Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade was nice to look at, but the acting from all involved left a lot to be desired. No wonder why the likes of Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson kept clear of this massive stink bomb.I wouldn't put it pass it being one of Uwe Boll's (House of the dead, Alone in the dark) favourite flicks. Surely the filming techniques here were an inspiration for Boll. There are some uncanny similarities from the techno soundtrack kicking right in with the bland action scenes. Hectic editing mixed with some slow motion. While the phony set designs are plain pitiful. It was all artificially void. Boll would be right at home here, that's for sure. But then again I wonder just how much of a budget this flick had compared to Boll's flicks. This one tries to look all-snazzy and throws in a lot colour in the cartoon background and unconvincing effects. But it lacks the sharp grace and the bit of style and charm that made the original entertaining. This flick's fights seemed pointless and without merit, with one lethargically repetitive one after another. The direction is poorly executed and the pacing is somewhat too slow. Simply put, this sequel that drains the life out of you, was just uncalled for.Wake me up from this bad dream. Well, it can actually put you asleep with its insipid output. Overall, it doesn't do any justice to the already awfully weak sub-genre of video game turned movie. Listen to the majority, avoid like hell!

I didn't get to watch it in the cinemas and never got to watch it even when it came out on video. One of my elder sisters managed to watch it and she said it was just hilariously crap. I was thinking she only said that because she was a girl. I'm 20 now and i just managed to watch it on TV. It was aired at 1240 midnight and for a good reason. This movie has got to be the biggest load of nonsense i've ever seen! The fact that it was shown in cinemas would have seriously degraded the Mortal Kombat franchise. The first movie actually made Paul Anderson look like a good director compared to this rubbish. It looked like a straight to video-type of a film. Lets see why I'm giving this film a 1/10, a 0/10 would have been more like it but IMDb doesn't allow for a 0. 1) It had HORRIBLE acting, everyone looked so stiff and the fight scenes where so badly choreographed. 2) The Special FX has got to be the funniest thing anyone must've seen in any film made from 1990 onwards. (SPOILER) The part where Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turn into dragons was so fake, it seemed like the producers thought of it just in the last minute to extract the most out of the Mortal Kombat series. In general, the CGI looked exactly like the ones in Mortal Kombat Conquest.....a TV series. 3) The backdrops (inner rooms of most scenes) just looked like a studio. The directing and camera work didn't help it hide the fact that it was a studio. Overall, this is such a bad film, I'm glad i wasn't one of those who watched it in the cinema and ended up leaving embarrassed for wasting some hours on a film like this. Mortal Kombat devastation (Mortal Kombat 3) looks as if its going to go on... lets just pray that it isn't as tacky as this film was.

Perhaps too much, because I was very disappointed with it. It reminded me of an earlier disappointment - the Street Fighter live action movie, but worse. A lot, lot worse.The movie is filled with obvious, and bad CG (the dragon/hydra battle in the end, what the ---- was that animated with? Amiga?), the plot is shaky at best and 90% of the cast have been swapped for actors (and I use this term rather loosely) with even less talent than the original ones. I think the only originals are Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and Talisa Soto (Kitana); mainly because they were pretty much the only ones whose career did NOT pick up in some way after MK. Now, while losing Bridgette Wilson and Linden Ashby might not have been a very great loss, losing Christopher Lambert was. He was replaced by James Remar, who, while a decent enough actor, does not possess Lambert's sheer charisma that made Rayden so likable in MK1. Now he's just a wig-wielding, buffed up replacement, and that's exactly what he feels like a replacement, though to be honest, I didn't pay much attention to his acting or fight scenes, I was too distracted by the gap between his front teeth. This pretty much sums up the entertainment value of the movie - there is none. It's just bad. Not funny bad. Not so bad it's good. Just... bad.The plot in a nutshell the evil Emperor, Shao-Kahn (Brian Thompson, who is best known for playing the alien bounty hunter in X-Files), Lord Rayden's brother (um, what?), is invading the world with his extermination squads (which consist mainly of stumbling ninjas no one can apparently stop - guns/armies don't exist in the MK realm?) and only a handful of people (Liu Kang (the ultimate Gary Stu - Robin Shou), Lieutenant Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Lord Rayden (James Remar), Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) and famous actor Johnny Cage (I have no idea who plays him)) can stop it. Too bad Johnny dies about two seconds into the movie, Kitana is kidnapped by the surprisingly whole Scorpion (who was pretty much blown to bits in the last part) and Sonya's foul attitude is almost a disability, but fret not! The group is joined by Jaxx, Sonya's partner, who, as far as we know, was in Hong Kong a day earlier (MK2 takes place immediately after MK1), worked as a cop and had no metal arms. Now, he's some military honcho and *has* metal arms. Ah, well. We also meet Jade (supermodel Irina Pantaeva, the only big name in MK2), who betrays the group by luring them to the Outworld to save Queen Sindel, Kitana's mother, whose mother's love (*gag*), according to legend, can close the portals that spew the stumbling ninjas to Earth and overthrow Shao-Kahn for good. Too bad the legend was a lie (um, what? And since when WAS Sindel Kitana's mother anyway?) and the whole thing was just a heinous plot to trap the goody-two-shoes group in Outworld. Amidst this all, Rayden is made mortal to protect mankind, he cuts his hair, Sindel shrieks and destroys an entire ancient temple in the process, Sonya rolls around in mud with Mileena, and Jaxx makes a pass at Jade. Um, OK. But, in the end, there's a big battle and the good guys win, and we find out pretty much everyone is related (we know this because Rayden mentions a family crest tattooed into each family member - save for Mileena, whose tattoo was basically fake (it flew out of her after she died in a fight with Sonya) so she was NOT a member of Rayden's family. Um, Kitana IS Mileena's sister, hence she WOULD be Sindel's daughter, hence she WOULD be family - where are you going with this, Mr. Writer?) and everyone lives happily ever after - complete with a shot of Jaxx, Sonya, Liu, Kitana and Sindel walking on green pastures, pretty much hand-in-hand, smiling brightly. I'm sure they're just happy they got to leave Gaptooth behind. No, really, that's basically the plot. We also meet Sheeva, Baraka (who resembles a bulldog), Motaro, Smoke, and Sub-Zero's little brother, Sub-Zero. Wow, what imaginative parents they must have. We also get a mention of the police officer from MK3, Stryker, and another MK3 character Kabal.The soundtrack is your standard issue action flick variety; Scooter, Prodigy, the lot. At times, it works, and at times, it doesn't. Sometimes the music isn't quite in rhythm with the scene, the best example of this is the royal rumble before the final battle between Liu Kang and Shao-Kahn. But in other scenes, like when Scooter's Fire plays during the battle between Liu Kang and Shao-Kahn's assassin (I forgot which one), the music works - the timing is perfect and the flow of the song goes with the flow of the scene. So it varies.This movie is not worth the rental money, and if you were one of the unlucky ones who actually bought it after it was promptly removed from theaters worldwide, I feel sorry for you.

The main enemy of the movie (Shao Khan) appears with his minions (among which are Sindel, Sheeva, Rain, Ermac, and Motaro). Then everything goes downhill REAL fast.Why? MK focused on the MK1 video game storyline. MKA made the fatal error of trying to incorporate the story lines of MK2, MK3 and MK4 in the same movie (probably because all of those games had been released as of 1997). For those who are avid MK fans, you know that this is a very bad thing to do. In doing this, many characters who have prominent stories in the game are given very minor roles in the movie (Mileena, the Robots, all of the ninjas) and the focus is placed on characters who had minor roles in some of the games (Sonya wasn't even in MK2 but Johnny Cage was but he was killed off in the movie).

The big baddie, Khan, is played by Brian Thompson who you'll probably recognised as the alien bounty hunter from the X-files, various roles on Buffy, a role on the TV series Werewolf, or various other cult appearances.

Yes and no. This film is universally hated, and I can understand why. I am a huge movie fan, and a huge Mortal Kombat fan, so I do have mixed feelings about this film. What the film doesn't give is an accurate portrayal of Shao Kahn, Shinnok, or Raiden. I'm not badmouthing the actors, Brian Thompson, Reiner Schone(I think thats how you spell it) and James Remar are all good in the parts for what it is, I blame the script and the not so good (however his first) attempt at directing by John Leonetti. Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade was a definite upgrade from Bridgette Wilson, Robin Shou was still...well there, Talisa Soto was so-so, Lynn Williams was good as Jax, and the rest of the cast was fairly good, especially Musetta Vander as Sindel. The early (though expected) death of Johnny Cage (one of the most popular MK characters) was not nearly sensational enough, he should lasted a bit longer for dramatic purposes. Sheeva, Baraka, Rain, Cyrax, Smoke, and Mileena were all killed fairly easy (at least Baraka, Cyrax, Smoke, and Mileena got to fight). Nightwolf and the whole animality bit was just not needed. The movie did however boast good fight scenes, the special moves were a little overused, but overall very good. The FX weren't very good, but it didn't bother me much. Some of the story was told very well, while other parts were well just ignorant. Raiden getting a new look was a joke, and him and Kahn being brothers...LAME! The first thirty to forty-five minutes of this film is actually pretty decent, but after that its pretty crappy. Overall a nice try, and deserving of being recognized as a piece of MK, but not to be taken seriously (kind of like Kenshi) if your not an MK fan its about a 4.5 out of 10, but if you are its about a 6.5 out of 10.

Anderson being the director). This sequel picks right up where its 1995 predecessor left off and sort of goes downhill from that point on.MK cameos abound in this sequel, almost none of which are given their fair share of screen time or character development. You know who I'm talking about; I'm talking about Cyrax, Smoke, Kabal and Stryker (who are mentioned but never seen), Mileena, Nightwolf, Rain, Ermac, Baraka, Sub-Zero (unmasked), Scorpion, Noob Saibot, and Reptile.All these characters are seen (or talked about) in this movie but are barely given the time they were so kindly awarded in the video games. Most of these characters had made their debuts in Mortal Kombat 2 or 3 but we barely see them or know who they are (this is especially troubling for those that may have never played the games).The acting is way out there, the script tried to be something more than it was (apparently a lot more was filmed but dropped from the finished product - damn execs) and the fights are sub-par.The reason for my disdain is the fact that I loved Anderson's first movie and I found it difficult to sit through this entry.I only hope 3 redeems the series.3/10 "},{"Title":"Pathetic.","Date":"9 October 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Having seen this movie the year it came out, I only joined the IMDb recently and I'm posting comments of the movies and Television shows that I've seen.Let me begin by saying that I'm a Mortal Kombat junkie; however, I am not a fan of this movie by any means.

Mortal Kombat Annihilation fails miserably. Where MK1 took the time to introduce you to the characters and submerge you in the world, MKA picks up from the end of the first movie and just throws a whole bunch of stuff against the wall.Rain, Sheeva, Noob Saibot, Mileena, Smoke, Cyrax, Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Baraka all make completely unnecessary cameos that cripple their ability to actually play out their storylines in any future sequels. Raynor Scheine is a weak Shinnok, another character who just seems forced into the story. Nightwolf is a character with promise, and indeed, he does- promises to teach Liu Kang three things. Instead, he chucks an axe at Liu's head and teaches him nothing.Sandra Hess takes over Bridgette Wilson's role as Sonya, but fails to give the requisite attitude needed to win over the audience. We don't believe her connection to Cage, who is not only replaced by another actor, but killed off altogether within the first five minutes completely unceremoniously.James Remar is laughably weak as Raiden, a role which veteran actor Christopher Lambert previously completely owned. His performance is bland and uninspired, and the jokes seem forced. Brian Thompson gives a cringingly bad interpretation of Shao Kahn, the super villain who's afraid of his own father and leaves the audience wondering if he was really suppoed to be all that bad. John Medlen's Ermac is silent and unimportant, and Deron McBee's Motaro is a completely two dimensional character.Meanwhile, original cast members Robin Shou and Talisa Soto act emotionlessly and without gusto, something definitely not lacking in their earlier performance.Some of the bright spots in the film come courtesy of newcomers Lynn Williams, Musetta Vander, and Irina Pantaeva, who do surprisingly good jobs as Jax, Sindel, and Jade, respectively, though Pantaeva's character is disposed of at completely the wrong time.The movie is cheap, and cut corners, including Baraka's supposed death scene, which is just a repeat of Rain being knocked into the fire, and the cheap animalities that closed the movie, which are infamously the worst feature of an awful movie. Overall, one is left with the sense that the producers didn't care about the characters of the Mortal Kombat universe, which the first movie definitely left you satisfied.So, overall, I give it an 8/10. Why?It's so bad, it's good.It's the kind of movie you sit down and laugh your ass off at. Not because it's a comedy, but because it's so bad, that it's genuinely entertaining.So, if you can put aside the fact that the premise for a possibly good sequel was butchered by bad acting, bad effects, too many characters, needless deaths, and cheap production, it's a fantastic flick to watch with your friends if you're in the mood for what will soon be a cult classic.

It makes all the mistakes of the Street Fighter film, makes the mistakes of typical sequels, and comes across as a slapped together project from the script on up.The SF mistakes - way too many characters from the games in this movie in their colorful videogame-esque costumes, most cameo's are completely unnecessary.  What point was there behind the Cyrax fight?  The Mileena fight?  How 'bout Jade and Smoke's presence?  To show Kahn's extermination squads in 'pretty' costumes on screen?  Okay fine, show the extermination squad but make them look like extermination squads and not a Power Rangers episode . . .And in the game Mileena and Jade go after Kitana.  Cyrax and Smoke have nothing to do with Khan.  What's happening?  They're rewriting half the characters.  In MK1 it was okay that they tweaked Scorpion/Sub-Zero since those were the only ones that really got a backstory makeover.  Not only that, but they're rewriting character stories as an excuse to get them on screen and participate in one lousy fight.  I don't think so.Sequel mistakes - everything the first one did has to be done on a bigger scale.  More characters, more finishing moves, more effects, more moves from the game, even more exaggerated lines and camera moves . . . the problem lay in the fact the first Mortal Kombat walked a fine line between serious martial arts flick and campy video game flick.  Exaggerate anything and you immediately start hitting camp territory.Christopher Lambert and Cary-Hiroyuki Takawa's memorable, slightly over the top performances are replaced by James Remar and Brian Thompson's way-overdone-over-the-top-100%-ham performances.  Speaking of the actors, very few reprised their role for the original . . . which never goes over well unless the new people surpass the old cast (or the old cast just flat out sucked).  Add to that the fact everyone flips everywhere with exaggerated martial arts moves redundant lines that stoop to a new low and you have Mortal Kombat Power Rangers.  Can't they walk normally and have a normal conversation just once?Also, nowhere in the first film or the game is the plot about a finishing move.  True, maybe MK's trademark `Fatalities' made the game, but the game itself and the first movie was not about Fatalities.  So why is Annihilation about the corny (even in the game) Animalities?  MK2 (the game) threw in joke finishing (Friendships and Babalities) moves to poke fun at the anti-violence in video game movement at the time; MK3 took it too far with not only reprising the joke finishing moves but adding more the stupid additions of Animalities and Mercies.  They were stupid in the game; was it ever stupid watching it on the big screen.  But hey, they had to one up the first film right?  Wrong!A slapped together set of ideas?  You bet.  Character cameos that come across as an excuse to get someone on screen at said time with little regards to their actual backstory in the game.  Like a fan-fic, `Hey, let's just use these characters however the hell I feel like using them.'  A desperate bid to shock the audience by killing off a character in an unimaginative and anti-climactic matter (lacking the emotional and plot impact it should).  No character/plot arc for the main characters, the good guys need to find inner strength-blah-blah-blah throughout the first half of the film, make absolutely no progress and are suddenly ready to save the world.  They don't even wake up one day and poof have it, he just has it for no reason.At least Street Fighter had the excuse of trying things in a pretty much unexplored genre and failing.

Well, I've seen some K.A. movies in my day, and this isn't one of them.  If you want a kung fu, special effects action spectacular, rent the first Mortal Kombat.  I believe that the first one is probably the best game-to-film movie around.  Though that's not really saying much, because that movie was bad too.  But at least it had a plot, good special effects, good kung fu, and characters you actually cared about.  Mortal Kombat 2 is probably one of the worst game-to-film movies I've ever seen, mainly because it follows the game TOO well.  All the game had was fighting.  Strange, because that's all the movie has too!  It's right up there with Super Mario Brothers! HA!  Now that's funny my friend!

I had seen the original and I was going to see this too. It was that simple. I should have listened, but at least, I didn't have to pay to find out the inevitable. I consider myself lucky.Most fans will agree that the first Mortal Kombat movie could have been so much more. Darker, violent, etc, but at the end of the day, it wasn't horrible. It was cheesy, it entertained, it made sense. Seems someone at New Line Cinema took that to heart and felt obligated to unleash an epic fail on the world never seen before. They titled it, Mortal Kombat Annihilation. Let's be blunt. It's flat out awful. First sign of impending doom? Lambert didn't want to come back. Ouch. That should say something. Add to that special effects that look like they're out of some college graphics art school project circa 1995 and mix in a plot that I couldn't even make sense of or keep up with half the time. If you aren't familiar with Mortal Kombat trying to keep track of everybody and whats going on is near impossible. They throw around the fighters from MK2 so liberally you can't do anything more than identify them and then watch them either die or disappear pronto. What's the point!?I was in my early twenties by the time I finally got to see this and I found it confusing and aggravating. I can only imagine what twelve year old kids with their butts in the movie theater seats felt like back in 1997. Pretty sore treatment. Yeah, MK2 on the big screen has numerous fight sequences, but they're so boring I bet even kids fell asleep during them. It's few redeeming ... features ... the location shooting, a supposedly respectable budget and an appearance from Brian Thompson (mainly known to me for his role of the Alien Bounty Hunter in the X-Files) can in no way, shape, or form ever get me to watch this movie again.What went wrong is so bloody (excuse the pun) simple. They should have never taken a violent video game and dumbed it down into a PG-13 kid friendly movie. Both the original and this sequel are guilty of this, but at least the original made sense. If you crave bad acting, awful special effects, a non-understandable plot line and characters that go by so fast you couldn't care less, give Annihilation a go. Otherwise keep a wide berth.

He played Rayden. Well, that's not what worked about it...what worked was, Lambert played his part comically, stuffed with sarcastic remarks and one-liners. Lambert didn't take the role seriously, and therefore, since the major star wasn't taking the movie seriously, the viewer didn't feel obligated to either, and one would just looked at the film as a fun little, circus of a picture. While many don't like Lambert, I feel he at least made the first picture work in his choice to play Rayden the Thunder God with a comical tone. This new guy, however, abandons the humor and takes the part a little too seriously. As a result, the film takes itself too seriously and falls flat.There's really not much difference between this one and the first film. Same basic idea. Same flat characters (for a fighting movie, though, that's acceptable). Some far-fetched fighting scenes. But the first film didn't take itself seriously, thanks to Lambert.

Then one day leader of the outer realm Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) opens up a portal between the two realms and announces that he intends to merge the two realms in six days. With time ticking away, can Liu Kang and his crew stop Shao Kahn in time? I didn't care much for the first film, but curiosity got the better of me so I decided that I'd give the sequel a shot (really just to see if it's as bad as its rating suggests, and sadly it is).The first film had a storyline that was quite poorly developed, but it wasn't totally ridiculous. Here we basically have a 'world domination' storyline in place because the outer realm lost the battle with the Earth Realm. If you take away all the pretence then it boils down to the outer realm being sore losers. Playing this sequel as a straight forward revenge film would have been a better move.I'm probably giving this film too much credit by discussing the story because it seemed like the writers didn't care much for the story themselves. It seemed that any time there was an attempt at character interaction or plot development that we would have a ridiculous fight sequence coupled with the over-bearing soundtrack that we saw in the first film. The first film was directed MTV Style, but this film looks as though it was directed by someone on acid - the fight sequences were much more over the top, the editing was choppy and the choreography was laughable. It's almost like the director went for the bigger is better approach, but it just doesn't quite work here.The dialogue between the characters was laughable and painful. One of the worst examples of this is when Kahn is looking for a new general. This scene gives us some of the most cringe inducing exchanges of dialogue that I've ever heard. We're also handed some laughable plot twists, villains that are more cartoonish than anything else and don't even start me on the final fight scene between Liu Kang and Kahn sigh....The only thing that made this film very slightly tolerable was Jax. He provided the film with the occasional moment of comic relief, but this aspect alone is not enough to save this utter shambles. The only other minor positive that I took from watching this sequel is that it made me appreciate the first film more. Yes the first film was quite a bad film with a multitude of problems, but it was nowhere near as embarrassing or laughable as this sequel.

It's clearly noticeable that the ONLY goal as far as the story, was for it to include as many characters and their 'in-game moves' as they could regardless of their back stories. For example, Jax is a character that lost his arms in the game and replaces them with robotic ones. In the movie, he has his arms but they are 'muscle enhancers'... doesn't even make much sense to me.I honestly can't tell if the script is god-awful or the acting. Was it a great script that was poorly performed or great performances that had to be executed the way they were due to how it was written? I take that back. I can tell. It's both a terrible script with god awful performances. Sets, costumes, and stunts were all pretty bad as well. The costumes make you feel like you're in a college Halloween party while the sets look like they were cheaply made at my mom's house.

But it's found its way in to my guilty pleasures collection. In spite of the terrible acting and dialog, it still has it's enjoyable parts. Perhaps it's awfulness contributes to that.The problem with MKA is that it both tries too hard, and doesn't try hard enough. It doesn't try hard enough in regards to it's acting, dialog, or even character utilization. When I say the acting and dialog are bad, I mean it. To the point where I felt like Sindel's antagonistic dialog was ripped straight from a bad 1970's children's cartoon. I kind of felt embarrassed for the actors for having taken part in it.But it also tries too hard in regards to bringing every character from the Mortal Kombat series in to the film. When this film came out, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the most current video game, and there were just under 20 characters or so that could be utilized. Well, this film decided to try its best to include almost all of them. Leaving out only Shang Tsung (due to the plot line of the first film), and two other characters whose off-screen deaths are addressed on-screen for closure. Because of this, a good deal of the characters are hardly utilized, some disappearing just as soon as they appear. Both Baraka and Noob Saibot literally have about 30 seconds of screen time each. Mileena and Smoke get a WHOPPING minute longer. Rain and Nightwolf don't have fights. What's the point? The focus of this film could have been much better had they sacrificed a good handful of characters for the greater good. Sure, I expect there to be more, but don't try to stay faithful to the game if it means sacrificing good character utilization.As well, they didn't really try to stay all that faithful to the game in regards to the plot anyhow. Having been a fan of the games for years, I don't ever recall Raiden, Shao Kahn, Mileena, and Shinnok all being related. I even checked online prior to this review (just to make sure that it wasn't retconned in to the story) and couldn't find it. This is just one problem with the entire plot, let alone the fact that Liu Kang's three tests turn out only to be two (maybe they were hoping we'd forget that there was supposed to be a third one). Sure, they got the main concept down. But unlike the first movie, they also veered a little too far off course.Is the plot itself terrible? It's average. About what I would expect for a generic action flick. Pretty flimsy in certain areas, that's for sure. But that's not even the worst of the problems of the movie. The execution is by far.It's such a noticeable dip from the first movie. Mortal Kombat was a solid outing. Not terrific, but pretty good. This movie made some attempts, but missed the mark greatly.MK is an absolutely wretched movie. But it has some pretty entertaining (albeit cheesy) action. And perhaps it's B and C-rate elements make it entertaining as well. I can't recommend it without acknowledging that you will most likely be disappointed by it, regardless if you're an MK fan or not. It truly is a terrible film. I just can't help but find it entertaining in some regards.

When most saw it, the film was a total disaster and a box office flop. Viewers not familiar with the games knew it was terrible b/c the recasting was horrifying, the direction was bad, the dialogue was wooden, the acting was lame, the script was poorly written, the special effects were cartoonish and the fights looked more like carefully choreographed dance routines.

Well Except for Robin Shou and Talisa Soto because they were the only actors from the original that came back for this one. Not only did they come back Shou looked like he had forgotten how to act and Soto looked like she had forgotten how to fight.Overall the movie looked like an 85 minute Power Ranger ripoff! Most of the outfits looked like cheap costumes bought out of some Halloween shop. Most of the characters were just thrown in there for (3 minutes) no reason. It looked like their only goal was to fit in as many characters as possible without developing them. Even though they did that it felt like there weren't enough characters in the film. The fights were way too short; they were less than 2 minutes long. What was the point of going underground in those metal balls??? They looked like an American Gladiator ripoff! Sheeva and Motaro looked more like humans in costumes rather than vicious-threatening creatures. Shao Kahn looked more like a human bully without his mask. The annoying techno/dance music made it look more like a trashy music video.The recasting on the same characters was a disaster. You got these new actors that were so not talented like the original actors. The new Rayden (James Remar) and the new Sonya (Sandra Hess) failed to bring out the appearance and portrayal Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson brought into them.

Picking up where the same obvious story left off, this strident follow-up feels more like a video game than an actual move; it's an unconscionable exercise of mind-numbingly repetitive fight scenes, weak performances, and special effects that aren't very special considering the innovation of the first installment.

The only reason I can find for why all this negative publicity , is of course that the reviews were written by people who weren 't related anyway with the Mortal Kombat video game or were not true fans of it .As a natural result they were confused due to the fast pace of the plot and the way-too-many-characters who were squashed in breathlessly . Therefore I will officially declare that although you have a point , MK II is addressed to the hardcore fans of the game who know the entire history and so will be my review . If you are a fan who hasn 't still watched Annihilation this is a must see . The rest of you should stop reading and  stick to the first Mortal Kombat which is a more easy to follow and digestible film with less characters . For the ordinary audience the first installment is a decent enough kung fu movie I guess .First things first  the original Mortal Kombat was a genuine letdown for the fans . It had underdevelopped characters , mediocre script , LOUSY SFX (especially the freezing power of Sub Zero) , predictable and rather badly directed fight scenes ( Johnny Cage Vs Goro anyone ?) and a quite disappointing climax with the obligatory cliffhanger epilogue as a setup for the sequel . The final result was lame beyond words . Something had to be done and fortunately the sequel came in quickly . Who cares if Christopher Lambert (Rayden) and Bridgette Wilson (Sonya) didn 't reprise their roles and were replaced ? Both of them , along with the wisecracking , pretentiously cool , dislikeable Johnny Cage were nothing more than decorative roles existing only due to the storyboard formula of the Mortal Kombat I game . The only likeable star you rooted for was Liu Kang and the narration 's heart beats with him . Thank God Robin Shou returns in the main role . A nice touch was also the return of Talisa Soto as Kitana as her sub - erotic interplay with Kang is interesting and keeps the attention (they share good chemistry) . The two of them are great (the acting is miles better this time) and the two substitutes for Rayden and Sonya are passable. I also digged the sceptic , puzzled and simultaneously funny and comedic aspect Lynn Williams managed to infuse to the character of Jax ( who was portrayed very faithfully and kicked a** with his bionic fists ) Every part of the sequel is improved  acting , much more convincing and well directed fight scenes and better plot . I really can 't understand why all this whining  why Johnny Cage is killed off so easily ?  . PLEASE do some research next time !!!!! This is exactly what happens in the story of the MK II game . The movie begins with the invasion of Shao Kahn 's troops from the Outworld . Then we are introduced to Kitana 's mother the Queen Sindel who is supposed to be Shao Kahn 's bride (just like the MK 3 story) and is probably the key to Earth 's salvation or destruction . From there on the story follows the 4 leads (Jax , Liu , Sonya and Rayden) struggling to save themselves from Kahn 's minions .  Yes you guessed right there is plenty of action and the fight scenes are great . The plot is a mix from the stories of MK II & MK III .I can still hear complaints  woo woo , too many characters too little development  . GIMME A BREAK ! This is an action film not a social drama . The ninja choreography and the SFX for the most part are great and are enough to keep you hooked on  . Some examples are  the aforementioned freezing power of Sub Zero and the bionic punches of Jax , the net traps by Cyrax , the tele-transport of Ermac/Noob Saibot , the great CG Motaro who is frighteningly impressive and compelling , the banshee-esque supersonic screams by Sindel etc . Moreover I would like to point out that most of the characters of the video game are secondary and somehow naturally DESTINED to make a cameo and nothing more . The best example is probably Mileena  in the game she is a clad-in-pink evil duplicate of Kitana , fabricated by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung . In the film she pops out in one scene and fights Sonya with her triple-edged knives (of course she loses) . What did you expect from the script ? A whole subplot with Kitana 's two sides and a psychological doubt game about who-is-who a la Uma Thurman in the Avengers ? I know that each one of you has a favorite character and hated to see him in blink appearances but you should stop whining and think logically . Cyrax and Smoke are nothing but robots programmed to annihilate Sub Zero after his betrayal . Nightwolf is a mystic Indian Shaman and shouldn 't be seen fighting physically rather than mentally so his brief appearance in a dream sequence as Liu 's mentor was wise . All these characters along with Scorpion or Baraka have cameos and that is the most fair . The focus should be on the leads and not on the henchmen - villains . My personal favorite was the groundbreaking Sheeva and I disliked seeing her written out quickly without any decent fights . The same goes for the weather-controlling Rain but I compromised since the good parts of the film are more than the bad ones .I will agree that some of the most powerful characters are dispatched easily but the movie needed some realistic action and the leads are constantly on the run , pursued by the bounty hunters . I really digged the fact that the stories and the background was followed accurately and faithfully e.g. the hate relationship between Motaro and Sheeva , the origin and motives of Jade (I won 't say more) , the Kitana &#150; Sindel weird relationship and the fact Rayden sacrifices his immortality to join the tournament (this takes place in the Ultimate MK 3) . I won 't say that the film doesn 't have some serious defects .1) The greatest flaw was of course Shao Kahn . AGHHHH! As soon as he is unmasked his myth is shattered !! The actor did a LOUSY job - he wasn 't even remotely threatening or scary . Where is his commanding chilling voice ? Even worse he loses center stage since the main villain seems to be Shinnok from MK4 . In the film Shinnok is Kahn &#145;s divine mighty father . Shao Kahn ends up as a weak , whining boy who doesn &#145;t have his will to make decisions and constantly expects his father to find the solutions !!!. GRRRRRRRR......2) The beyond ridiculous , ingenious plot twists at the end (what were they thinking ?????)3) The ludicrous and corny Animality effectsIf you can overlook these facts and concentrate on the merits you will have a nice dose of entertainment . The ending hopefully restores the script and gives the much needed resolution . I should give this a 9 but due to the awful depiction of Shao Kahn I am compelled to give a8 / 10This sequel is a very good adaptation of the game , at least for the ones who know the story . I hope that MK 3  Domination will overcome all the script flaws and be even better . In the meantime Annihilation is the best of the bunch .

MKA is made up of 3 things. Fast Paced martial arts action, crazy moves, enterainment value. This is coming from a person who has only played the 1st MK game that ever came out. The plot is easy to follow and basic which I like. I can't think of a movie like this having some complicated plot that requires the use of a pad of paper and pencil to take down notes. Basically the plot is about a guy named Shal Kahn who opens the portals from his world called outworld to Earth. Rayden the thunder god gathers a bunch of supposely best fighters in the world. Each has there own thing to do. The character JAX and Sonya do nothing but fight various people that come upon and go flying 10 meters away when hit. JJ Perry's stunts as Scorpion and Cyrax were pretty decent if not good. The fight scenes were unorganized and sort of hard to follow. Using a million different cameras they were able to make the fights look faster which was good. Fight scenes aren't usually hard to follow but in the team fight with Jax and Sonya they kept on switching fights every 2 seconds where they fought Cyrax and a bunch of Ninjas. Special effects were decent. Obvisouly you could tell the last fight between Liu Kang and Shal Kahn was computerized as they turned into there animalities. The fights were a bit overdone. Jax pushing a metal platform at Cyrax and Cyrax for some reason finds the need to almost a 360 degree flip in mid air (showed in slow motion). Alot of the falls were over done. Lots of fighters flying off of platforms onto padding you can't see. Must of had alot of medical technicans near by just in case during the filming. Explosions were used frequently. In the fight between Smoke and Liu Kang Smoke goes flying down a hole in the ground and a extremely stage looking controlled explosion errupted naturally showing Sub Zero covering his face as a stuntman does when an explosion occurs. The editors did there best to make the special effects pyro and actual stunts work together but you could really tell what was being used at the time to make the scenes look more exciting. Can you please tell me why Shal Kahn and Rayden needed to fly through the air to get to each other to talk? Just another example of something used to cover up a boring part. that bow to me line sounded unconvincing and something that came out of a school stage production. Overall I did enjoy this film and have it on video.

The original made a whopping $122 million on an $18 million budget, with a talented cast of actors and martial artists, plus some expert VFX work.Sadly, this film truly dropped the ball from square one. To start off, only three actors from the first film returned Robin Shou, Keith Cooke, and Talisa Soto. Christopher Lambert, Linden Ashby, Bridgette Wilson, and director Paul Anderson were all asked to come back, but refused. That should've been the end of it, but no...those idiots in Hollywood will truly do anything to make a buck. Annihilation quickly went from anticipated to despised, making just $51 million on a $30 million budget.So, what was the main problem? In all honesty, there wasn't just one. Anderson, Lambert, Wilson, and Ashby's departures were just the beginning, like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill. The movie had far too many characters, most of which weren't needed, and some even went unnamed in dialogue. The whole project had zero seriousness about it, unlike the dark mystery of the original effort.The story (if anyone could call it that) is as follows Outworld emperor Shao Kahn invades the Earth, resurrecting Kitana's dead mother Sindel to use as a pawn in merging Earth with Outworld. The few who survive have a grand total of six days before the merger completes, killing everyone on the planet...hence the film's title.The massively-overcrowded cast of characters includes the following Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Kitana, Mileena, Rayden, Shao Kahn, Sindel, Jade, Baraka, Cyrax, Smoke, Jax, Motaro, Sheeva, Rain, Ermac, Noob Saibot, Nightwolf, Shinnok, Scorpion, and a second version of Sub-Zero. The characters of Kabal and Stryker are mentioned, but remain unseen. Of all those, the only ones with major screen time are Liu, Sonya, Jax, Kahn, Shinnok, and Rayden. Johnny Cage is killed by Kahn a few minutes into the film, briefly played by Chris Conrad. Sandra Hess replaces Bridgette Wilson as Sonya, while James Remar fills in as Rayden. Jax is portrayed by former American Gladiators star Lynn Red Williams.There's so many inconsistencies with this movie, too. Its like the writers just crammed everything they could think of into the same film, not giving a damn whether it made any sense. Kahn and Rayden are portrayed as estranged brothers, with Shinnok as their father (no, I'm not kidding). Sonya's famous kiss of death is reduced to her blowing flammable powder onto an already-engulfed Cyrax, while all the ninja costumes look like cheap cosplay attempts. Motaro and Sheeva look worse than B-movie rejects, and bicker like this film's version of The Odd Couple. The animalities from the third video game make an appearance, but the result is cheesy beyond belief with Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turning into warring Godzilla ripoffs. Sonya gets cornered at one point by Ermac, only to have Noob Saibot literally ooze like oil from his chest to reform behind Sonya for a two-against one fight.The only saving grace with this entry are the performances of Robin Shou, Talisa Soto, Sandra Hess, and Lynn Williams, who all do their best while the movie falls apart around them. If you value your sanity, stick with the original film; this one's only worth a $1 rental if you're extremely bored.

Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - Raiden, I am your father! said Shinnok.)One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss.Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation.I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot.

At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did.Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't.Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson.The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability.I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say Yep, that's Baraka, Yep, that's Mileena. The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors.Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision.It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished.Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

His charisma got him through it, and to me he will always be Liu Kang. That Dragon effect at the end was utterly awful though.Talisa Soto-Kitana. She wasn't anything near a revelation in the 1st, but she served her purpose well, while being great eye-candy. Here she just felt their, and I didn't sense any depth or effort into her character. The fan blades were a nice touch though.James Remar-Rayden. He's no Lambert, and the dialog he had was very crummy, but he added his own brand of style to Rayden, and for the most part I dug it. Hated the cheap haircut though.Sandra Hess-Sonya Blade. She is way to bland for her own good. She doesn't possess the presence or the charisma of Bridgette what so ever.Lynn 'Red' Williams-Jax. I got a kick out of him, and he obviously was enjoying himself. He had charisma to spare and was Jax to me. One of the few smart casting choices. They even gave him the bionic arm.Brian Thompson-Shao-Kahn. He felt a little to cheesy for my liking, and wasn't the Kahn I knew from the video games. He tried his best, but it wasn't all his fault. It was more the way the character was written. The flying shoulder block or whatever you call it looked somewhat cool though.Reiner Schöne-Shinnok. He did well in the part, but I'd like to have known more about the character.Musetta Vander-Sindel. Her makeup looked silly, and she overdid it with the laugh, but she did well for the most part.Irina Pantaeva-Jade. She felt rather wooden and cheesy to me, but looked the part.Deron McBee-Motaro and Marjean Holden-Sheeva do well in their parts.Litefoot-Nightwolf. Perfect casting choice here, even if he only had one scene. Chris Conrad-Johnny Cage. Died well, I can say that.John Medlen-Ermac and J.J. Perry-Cyrax and Scorpion. Do well in there limited parts. Scorpion is not a focal point in this movie.Dana Hee-Milena. Didn't do much in her part, she looked good though.Ridley Tsui-Smoke. Made a brief appearance.Keith Cooke-Sub-Zero. Showed up without a mask, but it's not the same one, it was his brother.Dennis Keiffer-Baraka. Amusingly enough. Sly Stallone was wanted for this part. He showed up briefly.Tyrone C. Wiggins-Rain. Too brief.Bottom line. I enjoy it for what it is, and that's a guilty pleasure. It really is a terrible movie, but one I enjoy. If only they didn't cram so many characters with little to do, it could have been a competent film. Kombat fans will likely hate it, others may see it like I do.6/10 "},{"Title":"Friendship....friendship....again?","Date":"5 August 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" This has it all- kickings, monsters, fights, cool people, explodings, excitements, chases, sexy,musics, wow! The first film was OK but this one has come out of right field, blown away the competition, blown the game wide open! I'm a huge fan of the computing game series which this is based on and I was delighted to discover that all my favourite fighters were installed. The first game only had 6 characters and the film only had 4 of these. Here there is a mammoth roster of 86 to play with and watch. I wish this film was a game and I could have picked up my joystick and started throwing some fireballs, hellokens, and babyalities. I wish I could jump into the TV and help Lou, Jimmy,Kong, Rayman and co defeat the Dark Lord Can. I would have defeated them all and then claimed Sonia as my wife. If she didn't like that then whack! I would turn into a dragon and eat her. Fatality! I dreamt once that I married Sonia, but she turned into Sonia from Eastenders. I started crying and the Dr recommended I take some time off work.Me and my wee brother Andy used to pretend we were our favourite characters and fight. I would always be Lou Kang or Scorpio, while Andy preferred being Chun Lee. We made up our own speciality moves. I would hold my smaller leg for 4 seconds before releasing which enabled me to fly across the room in mid air like a rowing machine. Once I put a skipping rope up my sleeve and pretended it was Scorpio's 'Come Hither!' weapon. I would thrust my arm at lightening speed and out would fly the end of the skipping rope, crushing everything in its path, including my Mum's favourite vase. No amount of special powers and blocking moves could stop my mum from a flawless victory. She unleashed some forbidden moves on me with a fury I had never before witnessed as if she was using turbo buttons. I tried fighting back with some back sweeps and apologies but she continued with blinding speed and screams. I was sent to my room and mum threw out my games. She said I was too young to be playing such games and said I could play them when I was older. Looking back I was only 21 and she was probably right. Another time that chump Brendan came round saying he had a game called Rise Of The Robots and that it could kick Mortal Kombat's ass. I wasn't going to take such nonsense so I declared a battle to decide, him fighting as his game and me as mine me. We started throwing slurs at each other after school, at the local quarry. A group of onlookers heard about it and came to watch. This would be the defining battle of our generation and the future would be ruled by the winner. Brendan because he is a fool started yapping at me. Thus follows our conversation Ha ha! Soon your visage will be labelled black and blue by my limbs of glory! Your insolence knows no boundaries. If I was a bigger man I would kick babies, but, however, I, am the biggest man! All your face is belong to us.And then too, your wife!Silence forever, big silly! Not ever or never, ya rapscallion! You may think you are the Number 1, but today I am in the pink. Then challenging today is a good and will winner be one of either me or opponent.Let's go then. Let's go for a fight timeI suck your pathetic action and will blow it back with more for you to deal!Your feet of steel will crumble against my groin of felicityDo not give me a fluster!Sailboat green onion sag onion sagIn this the Seventh month of our 14th year will be your last!Think about my tough. I will only utilise 41.7%This continued several more minutes before someone screamed fight, and I unleashed my secret skipping rope attack. There were gasps of surprise at this, but unfortunately it landed four feet from Brendan. He ran at me and attempted a fly kick but I was quicker and got a good stiff boot to his shin. He landed with a yelp and I followed up with 2 swift ankle blows. I knew I was winning and started to dance on my toes like Bruce. Brendan gave his patented projectile move (a thrown stone) which collided with my face and stunned me. He thought that had finished me off, but it only gave me my patented psycho mode in which I am faster, stronger, and invincible for 2 minutes. What happened next is a blur but onlookers tell me they had nightmares for weeks after. All I remember is as I pummelled him he kept screaming 'Get Me Escape!' but I didn't. Suffice to say, Brendan was a bloody, half-naked mess by the end of it and I was triumphant. Mortal Kombat wins!The plot follows Shadow Kan's revenge after his wizard was defeated in the previous film. He sends his armies to earth to kill all the best warriors. The goodies gang together and fight back. Imagine if this actually happened; all these bad guys coming down to eat us while Arnie, Sly, Dolph, Bruce, Chuck, Donnie, Jet, Jackie, Chow, Jean etc all joined together to kick ass. Someone should make a film like that.Best Scene The end credits showing each character doing their fatality.

They had the depth, they had the cast, they had the music and they had the sets to make us believe that the movies had the magic to tell the story as effectively as a video game like Mortal Kombat could. There was nothing in it that I would say was done wrong and could have been done better. I was forced to give it a ten out of ten for the simple reason that the movie was challenging to make and lived up to all the challenges. But here is a sequel that I really don't know what exactly to say and I decided that I should just give it something less than five. Mortal Kombat 2 retains some of the cast that made Mortal Kombat 1 a good movie but fails to portray them in right light. We do not understand these characters. They do not have anything defining in them which makes you identify with them and understand their lives. You have some lame plot of a Shao Khan who wants to rule the earth and has broken a sacred rule to do so. You have really silly fights. You have a Jax with some weird arms that he himself cannot use. You have a new Sonya Blade who simply is not the ruthless and determined gal we saw in the first part. And Raiden, my God, is his role weird?Overall, the movie appears to have been made for the sake of making it. No attention paid to the plot, not so well choreographed fights. Too many characters and bad fights. They could have gone for limited but more furious fights. The end battle is the worst imaginable. Very 'cartoonish' looking sets and graphics. Overall, the story itself is childish. Mortal Kombat could show a fight without appearing childish and yet not appearing violent. Mortal Kombat 2 fails to keep the balance and most of the fights appear childish. The movie cannot be enjoyed so much. A better plot, limited characters and better fight sequences could have saved the day.

Even the appearance of an upgraded Scorpion wasn't worth the apparent effort. Most of the ninjas were just empty costumes, and the powers shown were so generic that they made Sonja Blade seem exotic.As for the 'plot' - if that's what you can call it - it had potential, but that potential was ripped away some time before filming, apparently. The total disruption of the mythology of the MK universe was almost unbearable even for someone not interested in the MK universe. Elder gods with personal agendas, gods turned mortal to satisfy some undisclosed purpose, cheating against the divine rules with only minimal consequences... Weak.Still, the movie had a few moments that weren't completely bleak - moments that might have been greatly strengthened if the editing hadn't been designed to destroy them.My recommendation - let the kids watch it if it comes on TV.

I thought that more characters and a longer runtime wouldn't have hurt, but I figured that a sequel would make up for that. Hell, the Mortal Kombat games just keep getting better, why wouldn't the movie do the same? Boy was I wrong...The plot is stupid to begin with. If Shao Khan could have entered earth and broke the rules himself with an elder god on his side, why did he bother with the Tournament for ten generations? Wouldn't he just have invaded. That's when earth would have been at it's weakest. Why did Johnny Cage die?That was another dumb move. He never died in the game. Also, sequels annoy me when they take old characters and make them dumb or use different actors. Raiden was wicked cool in the original. He was Christopher Lambert, the original HIGHLANDER!!! Where the hell did they get this guy. I think I saw him in an army movie once. He should stick to that, because he plays a terrible immortal. Especially one as cool as Raiden. Also, the characters that were put into this movie weren't used to their full potential. I'm a bit curious as to why they were chosen. They should have brought back the true stars of the series, Sub Zero and Scorpion. And the mother/daughter subplot was mindless, absolutely mindless. Also, the spirit of the game seems to be absent. In the first one, you really felt like the Island was another world. It had a sort of realism to it that the game captured. This movie was trying to be much darker, but they just came off as wicked cheesy. The dialouge sucks also. What the hell was up with the animality bs? I don't understand why you would have to fight as a dragon when you've already got all those powers. I think I know what Ed Boon was trying to do.

Here are the reasons why The first film just didn't seem like Mortal Kombat, even though it was a good film, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation seems to surpass it in the action, and depiction. Annihilation follows the games a lot more, because they feature more characters that are from the games, more moves that are from the game, and definitely the characters of Scorpion and Sub-Zero have better suits, but I suppose that they had crap suits in the first one because they had bad suits in the first game, I don't know. The first film Sub-Zero's ice ball, or freeze maneuver, was over exaggerated a lot. In the games, it does not take that long for him to produce an ice ball. In Annihilation, he just does it like in the game. Sonya, in here uses her trademark move, the kiss of death, but in this installment, it has a different effect than in the games. The choreography was also very good, I thought so. Lots of people say that the fight scenes were overhauled by cheesiness, but I really don't understand why they say that. The acting is definitely what you would expect in these types of films, good, and imperfect. Sometimes the acting would be overhauled by the cheesy screenplay. The scene where Sub-Zero first makes an appearance is a good example. Sub-Zero says some crap to Liu Kang, I forgot what, something like, You killed my brother in the first tournament, and now you will have to fight again, something like that, I forgot. The screenplay can only be cheesy sometimes, but its not all that bad. Another example of a cheesy screenplay, is Scorpion uttering out the word Suckers! instead of Get over here!. Like I said, the acting isn't bad, its just what you would expect in a typical action/adventure flick. The story seems to remain the same, just with new characters, and new threat, but overall, I don't give a crap about the story. Character costumes, like I mentioned earlier, are very good, but that only applies to characters that have the same ninja outfit as Scorpion and Sub-Zero, because characters like Cyrax, and Smoke, look terrible. It was clear that their chest protectors were made out of plastic, and their masks look terrible as well. I basically described the entire movie, so I'll tell you the things that I really didn't like about the film. Her it goes They took out Bridgett Wilson, she was hotter than the other girls who played as Sonya.

It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the long journey is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

Most of the returning characters from the first movie are replaced by new, even worse actors. I'm really glad that they killed off Johnny Cage within the first couple minutes, as that actor seemed to be the worst of the bunch.

This movie could have had Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson, but even they would have looked terrible having to say some of these pathetically cheesy lines.One thing that I'll give this film is that it has some half decent fight scenes.

The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights.Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie.The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie!

The good thing was that it focused on three main central characters.In MKA, it puts too many characters altogether, some making appearances then getting wiped out with no dramatic effect. Take Sheeva for example who is one of the most intriguing characters in the game - her demise was so laughable and stupid there was really no point putting her in the film. What a waste!I thought Sindel wasn't too bad, but with her bad dialogue, it was quite ridiculous in many ways. She didn't feel much like a fighter, especially with the fight with Kitana at the end - Kitana could have knocked her down in a second - horrible choreography.Why did they make Jade a traitor? I thought she was one of the good characters in the game, not a traitor. And what's more - why didn't they make her character black? She is not Asian! I think they just wanted to bring some chemistry between her and Liu Kang but hey it didn't work!The visual effects seemed more obvious and cheesy than in the first and a lot of the cast are replaced by new actors. James Remar does not make an interesting Raiden nor a worthy one that is worthy of being feared or respected as the Thunder God. I didn't mind the new actress who played Sonja but the original had more toughness and attitude in her performance. The way Sonja was portrayed made her a bit more softer than fierce - Bridgett Wilson just kicked ass all the way.Acting wise, it's pretty flat and it doesn't help with some corny lines. Kitana and Sindel get some of the funniest lines 'My mother's dead....'as soon will be her daughter!' Overall, the film feels like it's going in too many directions, introducing new characters out of nowhere and not really drawing you into this world. Talisa Soto seems to have the same expression on her face most of the time and really fell flat in this one whereas in the original she seems like she was enjoying herself a bit more.Oh and the ending was so cheesy - how they all walk off hand in hand arms around each other. I think they could have made it a bit more...dramatic. I mean the first one's ending was similar but it seemed to have more of a punch.If you can overlook a lot of its faults, you'll have a fairly amusing time with this but in the end you'll be wondering how they managed to make this really uninspiring or suspenseful for a story that is meant to be about saving the world.

The story is average but in places, it is so boring and predictable that watching paint dry seems entertaining. The first movie had the tournament but without the tournament in the sequel, the makers of the movie had to find some way and some reason to make one-on-one combat scenes&#x85;and unfortunately came up with this. Each character goes off on their own path and each fighter just happens to have a bad guy each so they can involve fight scenes. Pretty weak. Most of the acting is quite abysmal. The heroes are below average except for Sandra Hess who was great as Sonya but I can't say the same for the villains.The special effects looked like they were made by a toddler with no effort or thought involved whatsoever. The action sequences were unrealistic and executed quite poorly, it just reminded me of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (actually, Power Rangers had more believable fight sequences than Annihilation and that's no joke). The direction and editing of the movie was poor and the ending wasn't good either. The characters were a laughing stock and I could not care less for any of them&#x85;except maybe for Sonya but not for the rest. All in all, avoid, avoid, AVOID!

The first movie, up until the recent final fantasy 7 movie (which i'd suggest watching) was probably the very best video game movie made, and wasn't a bad piece of cinema. However, now mortal kombat Annihilation comes into play, and there could never be a more appropriate title for it. It really did annihilate the mortal kombat franchise. To be fair, I would normally tell you about some good moments of the movie to even things out and give it justice, but sadly there were none. All the good characters from the first have been replaced or killed, and the result is devastating. Costumes and lines are just plain cheesy (to bad you...will die!) and there are a lot of plot holes (The earth was built in six days, so in two shall it be destroyed, and on the seventh day, mankind will bow down!. What? If you destroy it on the 6th day, how can we bow down on the 7th). The entire movie is just a gigantic waste of time. I would rather watch my grandmother have a seizure while getting eaten by a pack of rabid wolves then look at the case of that movie again. the only relieving point of this movie, is that the music score is OK ( literally the only point of the movie that can possibly be called OK). It's hard to believe there is a movie on the face of this planet that I would rather see in the hands of Uwe Boll then the people who made it, as it would have been an improvement.

Really this film manifest such a bad felling that thrust trough your eyes and then to your brain, and both hurts badly! The first Mortal Kombat (1995) is not the best film in the world, it's actually a pretty crappy film, but decent with some pretty cool and fair stuff, but compared to Annihilation&#x85; it's a freaking brilliant film. So, the story goes right where the first movie ended, which means that is generally based upon Mortal Kombat 2 game, but they also put some characters from Mortal Kombat 3 to make it more cool&#x85; but it does not work. So, Shao Khan, the great emperor of the Outworld and one of the toughest fighter ever, being almost a god-like creature, comes to the earth to stop mortals to enjoy their brief moment of rest and victory&#x85; what a prick. And, so&#x85; what else do you expect?! Our mortal good guys join their forces again to defeat Shao Khan. Otherwise&#x85; we wouldn't have the plot.Let's check out the acting/fighting/stuntman crew Robin Shou returns to reprise the role of Liu Kang, he was pretty decent in the first film, although he can't act worth a sh*t&#x85; this film ultimately buried his career, just that he can end up later in other crap film Street Fighter &#x96; Legend of Chun Li&#x85; poor guy. Raiden is played by&#x85; by&#x85; what a? Who? Where is Christopher Lambert? Yeah&#x85; Lambert choose to do Beowulf (1999) instead, which was also a crappy film! Why, Christopher&#x85; Annihilation and Beowulf are crap films&#x85; but why did you pick the other one. I say this because he was good as Raiden, even with his wooden acting&#x85; but enough of this&#x85; stick to the film, stick to the review&#x85; you see? You see what happens? So, Raiden is played by James Remar, well Remar is not a bad actor&#x85; but the role of Raiden did not suited him, he was so uninterested with his role, he tries to look wise, but he all he does is walking around, staring at some little dot on the wall and deliver the lines without any emotions&#x85; damn&#x85; Oh, we got Sonya Blade here&#x85; played by&#x85; um&#x85; Sandra Hess? Well, to be honest&#x85; Hess was better than Bridgette Willson, she performed her own fights and stunts, being athletic and all, and even more hotter&#x85; but don't expect any acting from her at all. Johnny Cage is here too&#x85; played by&#x85; Chris Conrad? What the? OK&#x85; Now&#x85; the movie didn't even begin properly and they presented different actors who are playing two important characters in the story. Bridgette Willson and Linden Ashby were original actors to play Sonya and Cage, and they did it decently&#x85; but, now&#x85; you just have to, psychologically, get use to the new actors&#x85; that was unbearable. Well, at least they kept Talisa Soto as Kitana&#x85; but&#x85; she was even worse than in the first film. Delivering the lines, without any life in you doesn't make you interesting. Then, we have Shao Khan, played by Brian Thompson. Honestly&#x85; not a bad choice, he is pretty hulking, menacing, he has that deep, booming voice, and he also knows martial arts in real life, but&#x85; he can't act properly. In my opinion, he tried to deliver lines like a classically trained actor, but failed because of his retarded, silly tone. His fight scenes were decent, though. We also have Jax, played by Lynn Red Williams (a former American gladiator), who was used in the film as a comic relief to replace Johnny Cage&#x85; but no luck. Sindel is played by Musetta Vander, which delivers the most silliest lines in the film, combined to terrible acting&#x85; fail guaranteed. We also have Shinnok, played by Reiner Schoene&#x85; now that was the most unusual thing in the film&#x85; Shinnok sounded too German. Well, no wonder, the actor is German, but that was too&#x85; unusual, to silly, here comes Shinnok and I think I expect him to talk in some deep, powerful voice&#x85;  but, remember the DVD, or VHS cover that says Destroy all Expectations, that's the scene&#x85; after 10-15 minutes into the film&#x85; where my expectations were totally annihilated&#x85; for f**k sake&#x85; Then, we have Sheeva, played by Marjean Holden. Marjean looks pretty interesting in that bad suit, but her character was too much. We have Motaro played by Deron McBee, my Lord&#x85; have they ever seen Motaro? He is a lot bigger and more powerful than that&#x85; he was terrible. Irina Pantaeva played Jade. Irina is hot supermodel&#x85; but&#x85; isn't jade a black girl? While Irina is Eskimo? And her acting? Don't ask me&#x85; And finally, we have a brief appearance of Nightwolf&#x85; played by Litefoot, a terrible actor, they took him because he has Indian heritage&#x85; and he did poorly&#x85; although make up and costume department made him to look like Nightwolf as much as they can. And of course&#x85; we have Scorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile (again), Ermac and Rain as the new one and Noob Saibot for short moment also Smoke and Cyrax&#x85; martial artists who played these guys did a pretty good job, although their costumes were horrible. And Scorpion? What a hell, he appears, fights a little bit, than grabs Kitana and yells suckers and then disappears&#x85; what an a-hole. Sub Zero&#x85; well, that's not him&#x85; that was his brother&#x85; in the first film&#x85; well no matter. That's a big ninja clan, full of brothers and sisters&#x85; that's pretty much in the film&#x85;which makes no sense at all, and makes story look more dumb.So&#x85; the entire movie is freakishly bad&#x85; you don't want to have anything with it&#x85; trust me. You can watch it with your friends and laugh your butts off&#x85; "},{"Title":"The first victim of annihilation is quality","Date":"12 July 2011","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10 "},{"Title":"So bad I had to sit through it","Date":"14 June 2011","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" I caught this movie on TV one day and I couldn't believe what I saw. I don't know what was worst The acting was horrible. I am a better actor than this and when the dialog is this lame you know you're watching something bad. Even the fight scenes were not any good. Always the same jumping around and kicking not to mention there were way to many of them. It got very monotonous really fast. Let's not forget the laughable special effects which couldn't even stand up to a nineties video game. I have never played the games or seen the original movie but even if I had that wouldn't make a difference. This movie sucks! It was actually so bad it was kind of fun to watch once but keep this garbage away from me for now.

I sat on the edge of my seat the whole way through, the anticipation was immense as i watched warrior after warrior struggle on endlessly for the championship of mortal combat. First of all the soundtrack is the best music ever, it is so catchy and alive, definitely the best soundtrack I've ever heard ever! The acting is superb in every way possible and the actors were definitely the right choice. The script is very well written and flows well. And finally the special effect were stunning, everything looked so real and alive. This movie will vividly stick out in my mind as a true masterpiece. One of the other highlights in this film is that it is more then 1 genre, for instance it is a romance, action, thriller, horror, comedy, war, sci-fi and fantasy packed into one gigantic adventure, this is the scariest film I've ever seen in my life, it is amazingly gory for its certificate. Mortal Kombat is not just a movie, its a way of life... "}]
