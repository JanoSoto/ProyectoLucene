Yes, I became a bit annoyed the first few viewings when I would hear Jesus' speeches way out of order, or a few other things that really weren't 100 percent on the mark....or it just simply dragged.However, after a long absence and my first look at this on the ultra widescreen (2.751) DVD, I was impressed. For instance, the scene with the Last Supper shows everyone at the table, which is impossible to do in a formatted-to-TV mode. There are other similar panoramic shots that are very impressive. gave me a new appreciate of the work director George Stevens did here. Of course, he was one of the best in his profession so it's no surprise this is nicely filmed.Upon that recent viewing, I was please that none of Jesus' quotes are inaccurate and I have never had a problem with Max Von Sydow's portrayal of Christ. He had a penetrating eyes and spoke his lines with authority. Why he, too, gets bashed by a few people is unfair. He was just fine.It's a sanitized message, nothing that preachy to turn off the unchurched, but I do think it was a bit too slow to go three hours and 20 minutes. In this case, lopping off 15-30 minutes might have helped. It's still worth viewing, no matter what your religious views.

I had suggested in my letter that the original version was undoubtedly his father's artistic vision and thus was the one worthy of preservation for dvd. Stevens, Jr. responded, in part,  . . . the dvd of 'The Greatest Story Even Told' is underway and MGM-UA has found the original negative of the four-hour version of the film.There has been a good deal of confusion about the 'official' version of 'The Greatest Story Ever Told.'  In recent years I became satisfied that the 3 hour and 20 minute version was the one that my father considered his picture. That came as a result of conversations with Toni Vellani, who worked with my father and has since passed on, and others.My father, according to Toni, rushed the film for its first two premieres and immediately, at his own initiative, started trimming it to the 315 version. He was pleased with this cut. . . .There was a later shorter version that my father authorized UA to make in an effort to recoup some money -- and that version which ran under 3 hours is of no value at all.Frankly, I will be interested to see what the additional 40 minutes represents in the long version because, over the years, I've been familiar with the version that runs approximately 315. . . .This generous explanation from Mr. Stevens, Jr. certainly reveals the intracacies of the purely artistic process as balanced with the business aspect.  It also makes one aware that the assumption that the cut version was not the preference or the adequate representation of the director, may be inaccurate.  In any event at this point, the four-hour dvd version of The Greatest Story Ever Told is most eagerly awaited.

And who knew in 1965 that we would get The Last Temptation of Christ and the Passion of the Christ in our future. George Stevens's film is looking pretty good now.No doubt about the presence of a whole lot of movie names helped bring in the bucks. But with one glaring exception you do pay attention to the roles, not who's playing them. Some parts are pretty substantial. Charlton Heston as John the Baptist has the longest amount of screen time other than Von Sydow. Also given a large amount of time is Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate, Dorothy McGuire as the Virgin Mary and Donald Pleasance as the Prince of Darkness.The personification of the Devil is something Mel Gibson borrowed for his film. Personally I think Donald Pleasance is quite a bit better than what Gibson did.Other stars had smaller roles. Sidney Poitier played a silent part as Simon of Cyrene who helped Jesus with his cross on the way to Calvary. You could not have gotten away with an all white cast in a film like this by 1965. A whole group of players from previous Stevens films got some bit parts and more like Van Heflin, Shelley Winters, Sal Mineo, and Ed Wynn. One star Joseph Schildkraut had the rare distinction of playing in both Cecil B. DeMille's silent King of Kings and this film. Schildkraut played Judas for DeMille and is seen as Nicodemus here. This was Schildkraut's last film. An interesting double distinction for a man who came from a prominent Jewish theatrical family.One big glaring error though. Stevens should never have cast John Wayne as the Roman Centurion who supervising the crucifixion. Wayne is seen in passing through out the journey to Calvary, but with no dialog. At the moment of Jesus's death with the drama unfolding it was just wrong to have that recognizable a voice utter, truly that man was the son of God. Instead of concentrating on the story the audience gets distracted and in the theaters the whispers went up with 'ooh, that's John Wayne.'Arizona served as the location for ancient Judea. Unlike DeMille in The Ten Commandments, Stevens concentrated on the beauty of the location as opposed to filling the screen with people. It got filled enough with the story. You might recognize the Grand Canyon as the backdrop for the sermon on the mount scene. Of course Handel's Messiah is almost obligatory for these films and it's done well here.One scene that you will not forget comes at the end of the first act, the raising of Lazarus who is played by Michael Tolan. His sisters, Mary and Martha, are played by Ina Balin and Janet Margolin. They had shown Jesus and the disciples hospitality earlier. When Lazarus is taken ill, Mary and Margaret, go after Jesus to bring him back. It is too late, Lazarus has died and he's in his tomb. Or so everyone thinks. The sparse dialog, the photography, and the background music are so well done at this point the most hard hearted nonbeliever will pause.Of course most of the name players in The Greatest Story Ever Told are no longer with us so the cameos don't mean as much today. It is probably better in that an audience of today can concentrate on the story without even the most minimal interference of recognition. And they can concentrate on the story without either alternate realities as in The Last Temptation of Christ or all the gore and violence of Mel Gibson's epic. Definitely worth a look by today's contemporary audience.

In spite of beautiful cinematography and music, there is something missing of the power of other tellings. With the exception of a couple of scenes, Max von Sydow does not seem quite up to the role, despite clearly being a good actor. This is not necessarily von Sydow's fault, as it takes more than great acting to convince the audience that you are the character. Imagine Ingrid Bergman as Scarlett O'Hara instead of Vivian Leigh or Gregory Peck as Rhett Butler. Max von Sydow has moments of passion and succeeds in occasionally moving you, but somehow seems too much like the actors who play his apostles to distinguish himself from them, a necessary feat for an actor who hopefully is surrounded by twelve other good actors at all times.Max von Sydow's highlights are the raising of Lazarus from the dead and the sequence of his entry into Jerusalem and speech at the temple. In fact, I would say that for those two scenes, he outdoes many of his fellow actors that have donned the robe of Jesus. But two scenes are not enough to carry the movie. In fact, with all my respect to the impressive cast which participated in this movie, Stephens seems to have completely missed the mark when it came to casting a few of the roles Ed Wynn of Mary Poppins fame as the blind man, John Wayne as a Roman centurion, and Shelley Winters as Woman of no name. On the other hand, few actors can portray the almost fanatic mania of John the Baptist, a voice crying in the wilderness, like Charlton Heston. Jose Ferrer also puts in a good performance as Herod Antipas, and Roddy McDowall convincing plays both a smart aleck and a reverent follower. His exchange with Jesus over collecting taxes offers one of the few somewhat humorous moments.It is not a surprise to learn that George Stevens put so much effort into his movie. Like Mel Gibson with The Passion of the Christ, Greatest Story is like a painting, with each stroke carefully put onto the canvas. However, unlike Gibson, whose characters seem right out of 1st Century Judah, there is modern quality to Stephens film. There are, however, more positive aspects to this film than negative. Besides the cinematography and the wise choice of Hendel's beautiful Messiah, other positives are showing Mary Madgelene as traveling with the apostles (there is even a wonderful little scene where Mary annoints Jesus with oil which shows a kind of intimacy between them lacking from other versions of the story).While some commentators have criticized the screenplay, I think it is one of the best. As much as it pains me to say this, I think casting alone made this movie less powerful. Still I recommend that everyone see it at least once.

This epic-length film moves at a stately pace; some may find it boring, but I personally like it very much. Stevens does a superb job with this sensitive material. He cast dozens of famous people, some in cameos and bit parts, but all lending their talents to this film. The costumes have an authentic look, and the landscapes are breathtaking---they are far superior to mere background paintings or sets, and convey a sense of being right there in Palestine two thousand years ago. The music is lovely, well-scored and not jarring. Every role is well-cast, from Charlton Heston as John the Baptist to Telly Sevalas as Pontius Pilate. Best of all were Donald Pleasance as the devil and the tall, lanky Max von Sydow as Christ.The story unfolds like pages turning in a book. Jesus is born, then appears at age thirty to begin his mission. He goes to his cousin John for baptism, then calls men to follow him. Miracles are performed almost in an indirect way Jesus speaks in Sydow's commanding voice and, instead of focusing on Christ, the camera is fixed on the person receiving the miracle. A notable exception is the raising of Lazarus. Christ pleads in anguish for the revival of his friend, not because the prayer is really necessary, but to cry out his sorrow for losing Lazarus. As God made man, Jesus hurt like we did, and this scene demonstrates this. His teachings are given gently but firmly throughout the movie. Some viewers may be put off by Sydow's almost detached mannerisms, but the quiet dignity actually suits the concept of Christ as teacher on his salvific mission. The gentle mien of Jesus also stands in stark contrast to the times when he does strongly react, whether to the death of Lazarus, to finding moneychangers in the Temple of Jerusalem, or during his passion and crucifixion. The moment when Christ's life ends is stunning; the light goes out in Sydow's clear blue eyes just before he drops his head.There are other little gems strewn throughout The Greatest Story Ever Told, moments that shine with unexpected clarity. The calling of Matthew, the betrayal and suicide of Judas, the healing of the crippled young man are just a few examples. The Last Supper is very surprising in its similarity to the way a priest consecrates the bread and wine in a modern-day Mass. The famous actors embrace their roles and seem honored to be part of this great project. The dialogue is beautiful for a reason; American poet Carl Sandburg was in charge of rendering the ancient Bible story into modern wording without sacrificing the meaning or power of the original. Dynamics shift like the ebb and flow of tides, floating on the words as well as the events.Others have done this story, yet this remains my favorite. Unlike the remake of King of Kings(the silent version was way better), it seems authentic in its details---what genius decided to shave Jeffrey Hunter's underarms? And Jesus of Nazareth never quite escapes the shackles of prime-time miniseries/soap opera; its melodramatic and the scene where Mary freaks out is disturbing rather than evoking sympathy from the audience. As for The Passion, it's an awesome attempt to convey just what Jesus endured for our sins, but unsuitable for children or people who are sensitive to excessive violence and gore. So, in conclusion, for Easter viewing, The Greatest Story Ever Told remains my family's favorite version of the life and work of Jesus Christ.

The musical score was draggy or unoriginal, and the loading down of the film with every Hollywood star they could cram into the film just detracted greatly from the film. Von Sydow's Jesus was wooden and one dimensional. In the earlier released King of Kings Jeff Hunter gave you a Christ that was filled with the emotions and compassion of the son of God, while in this version it just wasn't there. Charlton Heston's John the Baptist was one of the few good things about the film, while, as much as I respect John Wayne as a star, his one line cameo was laughable and so unbelievable as to make one cringe. Claude Rains did shine out as Herod the great, while Telly Savalis might as well have been reading lines from Kojack.It is not the worst film of all time.

More blood and ink have been spilled over this one man than any other human being that ever walked this planet, so there really can't be a definitive film on his life that will satisfy everyone.  But during the first half of the 1960s, director George Stevens (A PLACE IN THE SUN; SHANE; GIANT) toiled to at least come close in that regard.  The result was THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.  At a cost of twenty million dollars, it was one of the most expensive films Hollywood had released in that era.  At an original length of four hours and twenty minutes, it was one of the longest movies ever.  It was also critically savaged and was only a modest commercial success, though not an expensive flop like CLEOPATRA had been.Although it doesn't stick to ALL the facts of the Good Book, GREATEST STORY does an exquisite job at depicting Jesus life and persecution, his miracles, his death, and his eventual resurrection.  Utilizing a massive tome of a script that he co-wrote with James Lee Barrett and Carl Sandburg, among others, Stevens filmed much of the film on location in the Glen Canyon region along the Arizona/Utah border, with the Colorado River as a stand-in for the River Jordan (a move for which Stevens was sharply criticized).  Aided by veteran cameraman Loyal Griggs (THE TEN COMMANDMENTS), he also shot scenes in this movie that must rank as being among the most brilliantly filmed ever, including Lazarus' resurrection, and Jesus' being baptized in the River Jordan by John the Baptist.One particular aspect about GREATEST STORY that continues to raise eyebrows and much ire to this day is the fact that Stevens cast much of Hollywood's acting elite in what were essentially walk-ons.  This tactic had been done extensively before (THE LONGEST DAY; HOW THE WEST WAS WON), and would be done countless more times in the ensuing decades.  To me, the flaw in this technique insofar as this movie goes is not the fact that Stevens succumbed to that temptation, but the fact that the roles he placed some of his actors in were ones they probably weren't cut out to play.Given the whole weight of the world being placed on him, Max von Sydow did quite an impressive portrayal of Jesus in this film.  I would have to rank this as one of the single greatest performances in cinematic history; his credibility (even with the Swedish accent) in the role is, to me, unimpeachable.  Stevens also scored by giving Charlton Heston (no stranger to Biblical epics he) the role of John the Baptist, and it still ranks as one of Heston's best.  Telly Savalas, years away from Kojak, makes for a chilling Pontius Pilate.  Claude Rains is a supremely nasty King Herod; and Donald Pleasance, with HALLOWEEN still a decade and a half in his future, makes for a deliciously unpleasant Satan.In other areas, Stevens' all-star casting ranges from sublime (Dorothy McGuire; Roddy McDowall; Sidney Poitier; David McCallum; Jose Ferrer; Victor Buono) to strange (Russell Johnson; Jamie Farr; Sal Mineo; Shelley Winters).  But it is in his casting of John Wayne as a Roman centurion at the Crucifixtion that Stevens went overboard (thus the reason for my giving GREATEST STORY an '8' rather than a '10').  To this day, it's hard not to notice the Duke looking out of place as a Roman, and harder still not to groan at the flat way he utters his line (Truly, this man was the Son of God).Still, despite the slightly questionable casting and the obvious extreme length of the film, Stevens has indeed fashioned as great a film as there has ever been on a story that has fascinated, frustrated, and even torn the world apart for over two thousand years.  How others view it is up for themselves to decide.  I myself think that, though slightly imperfect, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD still lives up to its title.

I am watching some of the old classics of my youth, both to see them again in mint condition and to have a look at all the special features, including the documentaries and commentaries. Presently I'm doing a festival of the great biblical epics of the 50's and 60's. My local video store had THE ROBE, (1953), BEN-HUR (1959), CLEOPATRA, (1963) and THE GREATST STORY EVER TOLD, (1965-let's call it TGSET). I thought I'd write a joint review comparing them. THE ROBE was done at the tail end of the old Hollywood, a studio production whereas these others were all filmed primarily on location with the international casts and crews we often saw making movies in the later era. But THE ROBE has all the Hollywood know-how we've come to expect. Particularly important was the pacing. It's a history lesson and a reverent film but it's also an entertainment. Young Richard Burton, (he was about 28) shows the impressive voice and passionate style that made him a name actor in the next decade, (he was nominated for an Oscar). Jean Simmons is very good and the smaller parts are well cast, particularly Richard Boone as Pontius Pilate, who in once scene leave much more of an impression than Frank Thring or Telly Savalas, who do the same role in BEN-HUR and TGSET, respectively. But BEN-HUR is clearly the pick of the litter. This is true epic, full of glorious action scenes including the justly famous chariot race. But, as directed by William Wyler, it's also a very thoughtful film. Charlton Heston is excellent as the passionate and idealistic hero. Stephen Boyd is my all-time favorite movie villain. He's the one who should have won the supporting actor Oscar, not Hugh Griffith for his Arab businessman. But it's Wyler who carries the day. Noted primarily as a director of actors, (and especially actresses), he was by this stage in his carrier looking for challenges. He'd never directed an epic before. By bringing to the mix his sense for dialog and characterization, eh give this a depth you can't find in something  direct by DeMille, for example, who was more a director of pageants than movies. His use of water as constant symbolism for cleaning the body and spirit is brilliant and memorable. Joseph Mankiewicz was also known for making more intimate films than CLEOPATRA, (which is not quite biblical but close enough). Like Wyler, he brings to the project something a normal director of epics would not have and CLEOPATRA is a much more intimate film than I remembered. Sure there is the absurdly overdone entrance into Rome and the Battle of Actium. But most of the scenes take place in doors and looked like a filmed record of a stage play. Both Burton and Rex Harrison are excellent in their roles and Liz Taylor is fine, (and fine looking), as well, although I agree with suggestions that Sophia Loren would have been a better choice being more obviously Mediterranean. Like Martin Landau and others interviewed, I would like to see some effort to restore, as best as possible, the two missing hours of this film and its presentation in the two parts Mankiewicz intended, perhaps on one of the movie channels. Even in its present form, the film is better than I remembered. TGSET may be the greatest story every told but this is surely not the greatest telling of it. The film is long, s..l..o..w and mournful. It's like sitting through a three hour wake. The only scenes where anybody shows any joy are the resurrection scenes of Lazarus and Christ at the end. One scene is accompanied by the disciples singing the same mournful hymn over and over again. I don't think I would want to hang out with these guys for very long. The scenes in THE ROBE where Burton talks to the people who were touched by their relationship with Jesus and in BEN-HUR where he offers the hero water and where he is given it in return, are much more moving that Max Von Sydow's grim sermons in TGSET. We never see the results of living the way eh suggests. And the miracle of resurrections seems an almost pointless substitute. If Jesus's soul has gone to join his father in Heaven, what difference does it make that his grave no longer holds his physical body?TGSET is filmed not in the Holy Land but in the deserts of Arizona and Utah, (Christ's visit to Utah must have pleased the Mormons.) The place looks totally desolate, such that no one would ever want to live there. Indeed, the area was flooded by a damn project shortly after film was completed. Too bad they weren't doing NOAH'S ARK or the TEN COMMANDMENTS. The actors are totally dwarfed by the surrounding scenery. It makes them and their story look temporary, not everlasting. The eclectic cast with its all-star cameos was considered something of a joke in it's time. At the Last Supper, TV Land viewers can see Illya Kuryakin, Baretta and Klinger! And it's fun to see Ingmar Bergman's knight from `THE SEVENTH SEAL doing scenes with Ed Wynn, Vaudeville's `Perfect Fool'. George Stevens is quoted as saying that someday, people viewing this film will not know who the actors were and will just see the characters. He's right. They all blend in together today. The performances are all very good, except for John Wayne's gargling of `Truly, this man was the Son of God', which, as I recall, produced audible laughter in the theater in 1965 and still seems wildly inappropriate today. I remember feeling that Charlton Heston walked away with the film as John the Baptist and he still does four decades later. The acting isn't the problem with the film. It's the pace and the setting.

It was breathtaking! George Stevens Jr. did an absolutely magnificent job in crafting this outstandingly beautiful, sensitive, and powerful motion picture. This was not just a deeply moving re-telling of the story of Jesus (albeit with a touch of a pro-legend approach). More than that, in its visual sweep, insightful acting of the lead characters (especially of Max Von Sydow as Jesus), and resplendent musical track, this film conveyed a true sense of majesty -- a marked rarity in most film these days.I must concur with one of the other online reviewers here, on a related point I too believe that it was a shame, and an error on the part of Stevens, that various key characters were portrayed all-too-noticeably by some major film/entertainment stars who just seemed to be bizarrely out-of-place in their roles -- such as John Wayne as the Roman Centurion who, never before seen in the film until this moment, looks up at Jesus on the Cross and says Truly, this man was the son of God! (I almost expected Wayne to tag his line with the word Pilgrim); or such as singer Pat Boone, who jarringly appears in the role of a cloaked man who, sitting in Jesus' vacated tomb, says to a searching Roman, Why seek Ye the living among the dead? (Here too, I think that I was not the only one who half-expected Boone to leap to his feet and break out into singing one of his big hits such as Bernardine or Love Letters In The Sand).But those discontinuities aside, I would still say that The Greatest Story Ever Told is an outstanding film that merits very high marks.

The Temple had Grecian (not Hebraic) architecture and supposedly had a well for animal sacrifices.

He undoubtedly knew this would be close to his final film, and he had chosen as broad a subject as possible as an ultimate challenge. His fame, stature, and respect as a producer, director and writer in the film colony was probably very much aware to him, and this great effort called for as large a canvas as was then available.However, what Stevens probably didn't count on was what his widescreen anamorphic 2.71 would look like on the average television monitor of the 2000s.  What was a massively impressive image in theaters of the mid-sixties shrinks down to one that (on, say, a 27-inch monitor) occupies only half of the screen--leaving the other half (top and bottom) blank.Since the majority of the film uses medium- to long-range shots--to capture the carefully staged tableaux and landscape backgrounds--there is an unfortunate compression-look to the whole effect.  One has to often strain to see some faces or to feel emotional involvement in the enactment.The idea of cropping the film to obtain a full screen image probably would have enraged purists (including Stevens'family members and close associates) whose argument would have been to show all of the director's original film image. Thus, this result is a case of the operation being successful, while the patient expires.  The beautiful Arizona and Colorado vistas fail to take away one's breath as one looks at a 50% monitor screen image. Not even the Dolby digital 5.1 sound can compensate for this effect.  The picture's simply too squeezed down to make the kind of impact its restorers were striving for. Until technology comes up with a monitor which can properly accommodate the full parameters of this original, the DVD restored version will continue to suffer.   Were Stevens alive today, he might just be somehow resourceful enough to see that his film were properly presented.  He was a director who was, as he often demonstrated, used to working miracles.DVD extras include very interesting footage on the making of this film, with comments by director, cast and crew members.  Whatever problems there are with this effort, it remains an intriguing and most interesting attempt at what may be an impossible subject.

We follow him and his disciples throughout his travels, and the highlights of his ministry, with many of the beatitudes and parables shown in context. Actions of Roman and Jewish leaders are addressed only to the extent that they were directly involved with Jesus.This movie readily embraces the spiritual issues innate in this story, and presents Jesus's dual nature of humanity and deity. For example, Jesus encounters Satan himself, who appears, first as a tempter of Jesus, and later as a gleeful spectator as Jesus is beaten and finally killed. There are many recognizable actors in the movie, and although it's fun to see this many familiar faces, it almost distracts from the storyline as you find yourself trying to identify an actor as you notice him/her appear in the crowd.Max von Sydow does a splendid job as Jesus. He leads this all-star cast with a powerful yet sensitive Jesus. All lines are delivered with calm restraint yet also authority, and in his very eyes, von Sydow conveys the strength of his character. Most of the film itself is delivered in this strong yet understated way, except for two occasions where the music score accentuates the witness of two of the most famous miracles worked by Jesus.A powerful and faithful depiction of the life of Jesus, recommended for anyone, regardless of their spiritual beliefs.

I also didn't like the way the temple was designed and the very drab costumes for the Pharisees. It looked very depressing and dull. I don't know much about ancient Jewish history, but I think the pharisees of Jesus's time wore more elaborate robes and prayer shawls. The pharisees in TGSET looked as if they are going to a funeral. The musical score at the beginning is very beautiful, but it becomes corny at the end of the 1st tape with the Handels Hallelujah chorus being sung. The crucifixion scene is also very fake looking and drab. Of course John Wayne should have NEVER BEEN CAST AT ALL in this movie. He ruins the whole movie. Charlton Heston did a good part as John the Baptist, but they should have not put that awful wig on him. It made him look silly. I think that the casting crew should have let Chartlon Heston grow his own hair long instead of putting that awful wig on him. I think that TGSET is the worst of the old style Biblical epic movies. King of Kings is much better. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because Charlton Heston and Jose Ferrer were the best actors and made the movie tolerable to watch.

No, it is not. If you want Robocop, this isn't your movie.The slowness of this movie provides thoughtful people ample time to think about the history-shaping words being said, to soak up the beauty of the film itself.Does Stevens attempt to recreate the sense one gets from looking at beautiful religious paintings? Yes.  If you are one of those people who freeze frames beautiful shots, this is your movie.Do big name stars appear in small roles? Yes.  If that bothers you, you will have to *get over* your adolescent annoyance really to see what's happening.The big name stars make a meta statement. Stevens was moved to make this film by his experience of being among the first to document what happened at Dachau.Big name stars, like John Wayne, wanted to appear in even the tiniest of roles, because they sensed that Stevens was doing something special.  If you can appreciate the big name cameos for what they are -- a community coming together to tell a story that matters to them -- they will enhance the movie for you, rather than lessen it.Max von Sydow gives the best performance of Jesus ever committed to film. If he never did anything else, he could die proud because of the truth he embodied in this part.Just the look on von Sydow's face in his first scene -- when he is being baptized by John -- a look that is caring, human, loving, confused, pained, as he begins to realize what his life holds in store for him -- is in itself marvelous, jewel-like in its purity, and unlike anything else I've ever seen an actor be able to do.David McCallum is a complex, agonized Judas. He makes you feel for him. His death, as a sacrifice, is brilliant.Charlton Heston captured the take no prisoners approach of the Biblical John the Baptist.Donald Pleasance is the best Satan ever put on film. He's just an average, sort of nice guy who wants you to eat some food when you are hungry ... that's all. Harmless, really.There are many scenes I would never want to have missed the lilies of the field scene, John baptizing Jesus, Satan tempting Jesus in the wilderness, Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, Jesus calling Matthew.There are many effects that work perfectly for me the handling of sound when Jesus is carrying his cross on the via dolorosa, for example.So, no, *don't* see this movie if you require the speed of an MTV video in your movies.Do see this movie if you want to see how one man, moved by Dachau, put years of his life into the service of a story he thought worth telling in a risky, idiosyncratic way.

The Lazarus sequence, prior to the Intermission, stills pacts a powerful punch. Several years later I 'witnessed' the 'shortened' version of this epic - and am still stunned as to why this was allowed to happen. The flow of the film was destroyed - e.g. the Wisemen appeared 'quickly' and then disappeared for some unexplained reason (even though we know why). How shameful for United Artists to do this. GSET is a magnificent telling of the story of Christ. Stevens created a true masterpiece.

It suffered through an extended and sometimes turbulent gestation.  It's birth was, at best, painful.George Stevens, its director, producer, co-writer, and guiding force, spent the better part of a decade bringing this project to the screen.  Even with all his considerable experience, it seems he was unable to translate his vision into the cinematic experience it deserved.  At times we see flashes of what he must have had in mind.  More often we see a film, for all its' moments of brilliance, stumble into exactly the sort of C.B. DeMille pomposity Stevens was surely trying to avoid. Much has been made of his who's who of Hollywood approach to the casting of smaller roles, which led to a who's that reaction in the theater. However, that approach to casting has been used before and since to positive effect.  So the fault doesn't lie there. The fault lies, it seems, in an embarrassment of riches. Mr. Stevens simply had too much.  Too much money. Too much talent.  Too much time.  Too much control.  And too little willingness, it would seem, to accept input from others. Is the film a total failure?  Of course not.  There is much greatness in The Greatest Story Ever Told.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  The Alfred Newman score, at least the portions Stevens left unadulterated in the film, is magnificent.  Some of the individual performances are compelling. Could it have been better?  Should it have been better?  Absolutely.It has always been my belief that there was a successful movie made, called The Greatest Story Ever Told.  Sadly no one ever saw it. Worst of all is the absolutely dreadful version of this movie  currently on videocassette.  It is nearly an hour shorter than the original road-show presentation, and, while letterboxed, is in the incorrect 2.35x1 scope aspect ratio rather than the correct 2.75x1 ratio the Ultra Panavision-70 cameras filmed in.  In addition, regardless of what the box says, the soundtrack is in Hi-Fi Mono! Ken Darby, composer Alfred Newman's long time associate, wrote a book, entitled Hollywood Holyland, which chronicles his first hand experiences working on this film.  It is a must-read for anyone interested in the cinematic art.

For all the bad press it evidently got in its day, I found the color cinematography dazzling, the compositions wonderful (as we'd expect from the director of Shane and Giant), and the performances ... not too bad at all, for the most part. Many if not most of celebs who did cameos are no longer household names (or faces), so they're less jarring than they must have been in the 60s (the groaning exception, of course, being John Wayne as the Centurion). Von Sydow is fine if a bit stiff, Heston as the Baptist is a bit too stiff, Jose Ferrer is wonderful (did his son Miguel study dad's performance as Herod Antipas for his role in Traffic?), and so are most of the other key parts.If Scorcese's Last Temptation of Christ comes off as less an art film and more as another corny Hollywood biblical epic, Stevens' film comes off less as the latter and more as the former, given that one's expectations are for corn, not art. (Is that clear?) I've said previously that Scorcese's film was basically a ripoff of Pasolini's wonderful Gospel According St Matthew, and I still think that's the case so far as the basic treatment goes, but I now think that visually, as a wide-screen color film, it rips off Stevens.Greatest Story is the first Christ movie (and probably the first biblical epic) where the director obviously understood that the physical setting could be a very important part of the story - the sparse, barren landscape that people could disappear into and come back having seen visions, etc. Scorcese seems to have picked up on this too, but his visual sense isn't a jot on Stevens', for sure.I do agree that the story drags, and the whole thing is probably overlong. I was also disappointed that Stevens does so little with the final temptation and betrayal in the Garden of Gethsemane. I've always felt this is the dramatic climax of the whole story - the final point of no return for Jesus - and oddly, the recent TV miniseries version, with Jeroen Krabbe as a fun modern-dress Satan, is the only one that's really grasped this, I think. Maybe some of this is among the stuff that didn't survive from the 260-minute version?Overall, I'd heartily urge George Stevens Jr., who's done such a good job of preserving his father's legacy, to consider restoring this one and letting us see it on the big screen again. It's a feast.

It was only natural that, in approaching his late period, he sought to expand his already grand horizons and create a towering work.The Greatest Story Ever Told was Steven's choice as a personal challenge.  What could be more formidable that this subject?  Stevens undoubtedly knew that the material was probably impossible to craft into a perfect product before he started.  That was no reason, though, for one of his talent, training and experience to be discouraged.The production occupied many years of Stevens' life, including tremendous production challenges.  He also was faced with the task of not only balancing its costly budget, but also turning in an attractive profit for the studio which supported his efforts.  (To engage in so expensive an exercise and come out in the red would understandably have been a disappointment for all concerned.) Thus, he wisely populated his cast with big-name stars -- those which would bring out the public in substantial numbers and realize adequate box office returns.  Major studio movie making is of course, at this level, big business and I, for one, can see very clearly Stevens' approach in terms of wieghing the ideal with the pragmatic.When the work was finally completed, Stevens did achieve his vision in a legendary film of 260 minutes in duration. That was the work he intended, and that was the version impressively presented at its premiere and early road show performances.  Then along came various decision-makers implementing their own ideas, which resulted in 63 minutes being cut from the work.  How is it possible to evaluate Stevens' work by viewing a 197 minute version?  Clearly that does not represent the vision of this artist.  The one and only way is to view the original in its uncut (and preferably pristine print Cinemascope) version.  As for the casting approach, the production happily did succeed at the box office, with the public supporting the picture in substantal numbers.  Knowing all what was at stake, one can nicely cope with the casting cameos and be appreciative that this supremely challenging subject was graced by the attentions of one of the screen's very fine directors.

Yet on the other hand, I had painful difficulty agreeing with other scenes.For example, Jesus heals a hopelessly bitter cripple in a dark synagogue of course the biblical story is very brief, leaving a lot of room for the imagination to color in details- however, the scene seems to cheapen christ's awesome power and divinity. As Jesus leaves the synagogue, the camera zooms in on a facial expression so quizzical the viewer is left feeling that perhaps even Jesus himself didn't believe the healing was possible either...Although personifying the devil was a very workable technique throughout the entire film, dropping available details about tempting a starving savior to eat bread and omitting christ's excellent response left me disappointed.Another valiant and worthy attempt, but again the novel was better 8) "},{"Title":"King of Kings is a far better film","Date":"14 April 2013","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" Great cinematography that can't be appreciated on the small screen.

The Sermon on the Mount is not shown in it's entirety here, (the Lord's Prayer is shortened) yet other sermons and soliloquies seem to drag on forever. The interior sets seem too small and claustrophobic. There are not enough extras in some of the crowd scenes. The excessive use of cameos is most annoying. Both Victor Bueno and Telly Savalas (Pontius Pilate) are terrible choices and limp their way through their respective roles. Salome's Dance of the 7 Veils is weakly shown and has no mention of John the Baptist's head. Even the casting of Jesus seems wrong. Max Von Sydow seems too dark and brooding. The best performance in the film is by Charlton Heston, as John the Baptist. MIA in this edited version most of Angela Lansbury's part and the feeding of the 5000. Although King of Kings, released four year's earlier, has many flaws and inconsistencies as well, it is a more satisfying version of the story of Christ in so many ways Better acting, better narration, a more joyous Christ, more open sets, better musical score.

'The Passion of the Christ' was very faithful to the story as it outlined in the gospels, however this film is not.This does not mean that this is a bad movie. I thought that it was quite well done, however the sayings of Jesus and the meeting of his disciples did not seem to follow the gospel narratives. The disciples were probably the aspect that stood out the most as the relationships between the disciples differed from that outlined in the gospels. The sayings of Jesus, while not strictly incorrect, seemed to have been rewritten by the screenwriters to make the film flow better, though where Jesus does identify himself with God ('I and the Father are one') in the movie is said in private with his disciples, while in the gospel of John it is proclaimed to a crowd of Jews who where getting ever more angry and Jesus' perceived blasphemy.That does not mean that this was a bad movie. Far from it. Charton Heston played a brilliant John the Baptist, and his interaction with Herod Antipas just highlights his incredible acting ability (from now on I cannot imagine John the Baptist as anybody other than Charlton Heston). Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ, though, didn't stand out all that much to me.This movie seemed to focus much more on the political instability in the region at the time of Christ with the Roman and the Jewish rulers trying to outdo each other, as well as attempting to put an end to what they perceived as popular movements (first with John the Baptist and then with Jesus himself). As mentioned, the interaction between John and Herod was outstanding ('you are more his prisoner than he is a prisoner of you' says Herod's sister and wife). When Jesus enters Jerusalem on the donkey we immediately move to the Jewish council who are threatened by him and determine then and there that he must be arrested (as opposed to the gospels, where Jesus out maneuvers them for a final time, and they decided that he must be put out of the way). The temple scene where he overthrows the money changers tables, and the proceeds to teach the crowds (while the Romans seek to arrest him) is another scene that will remain with me for a while.A great movie, though unfortunately not truly faithful to the narratives, and also some subtle changes in the attitudes of Pilate and Herod, hold back from what could have been a truly great movie.

Not a single drop of blood that I can remember from the cruel crown of thorns. I thought that Jesus was brutally scourged but the only hint of cruelty on the way to his crucifixion was the time he stumbled under the weight of the wooden cross. May be some of the more brutal scenes were cut when the original 4 hour film was edited.Jesus' disciples were drawn from many different trades and professions yet their individual characters were not dwelt upon. There was a similarity between them all. Certainly Judas had his scene and Peter had his moment in the denial scene but I was not moved to any extent. The director seemed too afraid to let go and give us some great drama in these momentous times in history.Scenes that you will probably remember are the resurrection of Lazarus and the Last Supper which were both well done.

So avoiding the snide, I must say that this film has very good and very bad points.Von Sydow is a wonderfully human Christ. The high point of his acting (and of the directing) is the scene of the resurrection of Lazarus, which makes a real drama out of an incident that most such films treat so tritely. You can tell that Jesus himself is scared to death by the implications of what he is about to do, and that Mary and Martha are wondering if he's stark raving crazy to even attempt it. The freaked-out silence of the crowd is awesome. There are several such moments and several such excellent casting choices particularly fine is Herod (Jose Ferrer) ordering the massacre of the innocents He happens to remember the line about Rachel weeping for her children and says Let this be the fulfillment of the prophecy. The soldier who takes the command turns to ice on hearing such inhumanity. And let's see... why does everybody think Heston was a bad choice as John the Baptist?? My god, he was made for the part! As was Sal Mineo as a self-pitying lame man who obviously never even tried to walk till Jesus pointed a finger at him and gave him a dirty look. And Telly Savalas positively exudes Roman arrogance as Pilate---not the wishy-washy bureaucrat of most Christ films, but the cold-blooded imperial thug portrayed in the histories of Josephus. And oh yes Dig the Temptation in the Wilderness scene; it's incomparable.The biggest negative is the gratuitous and distracting use of several superstars in cameo Shelly Winters and Pat Boone, for example, and worst of all John Wayne who totally ruins an otherwise beautiful moment in which the death of Jesus on the Cross is juxtaposed in jump cuts with the suicide of Judas. Thanks to Wayne's inept trully this man is the son of gawd!, a moment which should have us brooding over a fine theological problem (which one of these two is really and truly the scapegoat who's getting the rest of humanity off the hook?), all we can do is laugh at this perfectly ludicrous example of miscasting. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Also stupid some of the scenes that are filmed as set pieces, rather like moving dioramas.

One of these days, I would like to see a Jesus movie in which the three wise men are seen leaning way back in their camels, looking straight up, with one of them saying, Well, the star is directly overhead, so I guess this barn must be the place. But this movie, like all other depictions of the event, simply shows the star about thirty degrees above the horizon, no matter how close the wise men get to the manger.It is surprising that many of the well-known miracles were only mentioned, not depicted visually no scene of Jesus turning water into wine, walking on water, or feeding the multitude with a basket of loaves and fishes. It is not surprising, on the other hand, that we do not see Jesus's prediction that some of the people he is talking to will still be alive when the kingdom of God comes.A lot of sins go unmentioned in this movie. Jesus does not say it is adultery to lust after a woman in your heart, or that it is a sin to get divorced, or that marrying someone who is divorced is adultery. But we do get the scene where the adulteress is saved by Jesus, who defies the mob by saying that the one without sin should cast the first stone. That's what the audience wants to hear, not that lust or divorce are also forms of adultery, but that real adultery itself will be forgiven.As is typical for a movie about Jesus, he never talks about Hell. There is a movie in which Jesus spends a lot of time talking about all the people who are going to Hell, The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), but that is an exception. All the other Jesus movies leave that topic pretty much alone, at least as far as the sermons of Jesus are concerned. In The Greatest Story Ever Told, other people talk about Hell instead. In one scene, there is a religious figure who says that God is going to punish the wicked, but Jesus admonishes him, saying that God is about mercy. Never mind that what the guy was saying was actually similar to what Jesus himself says in the Bible, in this movie, Jesus will have none of it. This is followed shortly by a scene in which John the Baptist tells King Herod that he is going to Hell for committing adultery, which again is consistent with the Biblical Jesus but not the Jesus of this movie. And when Jesus is giving Peter the keys of the kingdom, even the relatively innocuous expression gates of Hell is left out of Jesus's speech.That this movie plays it safe in its treatment of Jesus, avoiding the depiction of anything that might make the audience uncomfortable, is understandable. What is not understandable is the movie's treatment of Judas. Where the Bible is ambiguous (dare I say inconsistent) regarding Judas, so too is the movie. For example, there is some debate as to whether Judas received communion at the Last Supper. Consequently, the movie is ambiguous on this point as well. We see Judas holding the cup near his lips. Then the camera cuts away to Jesus, who makes a brief remark, after which we see Judas still holding he cup, leaving it an open question as to whether he took a sip. Fine. But where the Bible is not ambiguous is on Judas's motive for betraying Jesus. Judas negotiates with the chief of priests to get thirty pieces of silver for delivering Jesus. The motive is money, pure and simple. But in the movie, instead of asking for money, we hear Judas going on about what a wonderful person Jesus is. And then, somewhat later, when he is given the pieces of silver that he did not ask for, he says he didn't want any money, which leaves his betrayal of Jesus completely unmotivated. One almost gets the impression that the people who made this movie did not want to show Judas in a bad light, even though this is the man that Dante did not hesitate to put right next to Satan in the frozen lake at the center of the earth.There is one thing in this movie that should have been kept out, and that is John Wayne. Right at the moment of Jesus's death, we hear the Duke saying, Truly, this man was the son of God, in that unmistakable voice of his, and it is hard to keep from laughing.

Max von Sydow is not at all a convincing Christ (his hairstyle's a disaster to begin with) quite by contrast to Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth. Only in the Lazarus resurrection scene did I feel some of the Heart, the devotion, the passion, that must have been Jesus Christ. To that I can maybe add the scene where Jesus is clearing the temple at Passover. For the rest I could not get beyond the odd hairstyle. Von Sydow's very aristocratic and regal -was Christ an aristocratic character?- but not very divine. The rest of the cast does not work well either, to say the least. On top of that, many a scene feels unnatural and rigid. The film feels anecdotal and lacks true depth. Mr Stevens seemed to have been more preoccupied with the visuals than with screenplay, editing, character depth, casting and directing. At times the film looks like a Renaissance painting or a painting from the Romantic era. That delivers stunning visual joy -especially on my Pioneer Kuro with it's deep blacks- but not if it comes at such a huge cost. In all the piece strikes me as a visual feast but ultimately the film does not convince, especially compared to Zefirelli's Jesus of Nazareth which gets about everything right if you consider Mr Zefirelli's style and the era of his version's making. If you want to enjoy the beautiful cinematography, the colors, the scenery, do watch this film but I suggest you watch Zefirelli's depiction of Christ to get a deeper feeling for the Master, and Gibson's film if you want to grue at all the gore Christ must have gone through at the end of his mission.

The biggest attractives of The Greatest Story Ever Told are 1) a super stellar cast of names like Max von Sydow, Carroll Baker, Donald Pleasence, Charlton Heston, Telly Savalas, John Wayne, Sidney Poitier, Van Heflin, Sal Mineo, Claude Rains (on his last role) and more; 2) the costumes, art-direction, in short, an epic filmed in CinemaScope; 3) a few scenes here and there, nothing so outstanding that we haven't seen in another Biblical films of the same story.In its three hours, George Stevens walks on the same path already showed in countless films but this time presenting Bergmanian actor Max von Sydow as Jesus during all his known moments from preaching love and peace to the crucifixion and resurrection. Perhaps the only thing that really captured my full attention and which I've never sen in the other films about Jesus is His speech about how the rich people cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven; one cannot love God and the money; this scene was incredibly well written. The film is good, has great, noble and valuable intentions but it is too long, a little tiresome at parts, some scenes weren't well planned and well filmed, Alfred Newman's musical score is quite annoying and there's too much music in sequences when it wasn't needed. As for the performances everyone's at the same level, from the leading actor von Sydow (an okay performance considering he has better films) to the cameos from Poitier (who doesn't have lines) and John Wayne (who has one line, and he's filmed at a long distance, you only realize it's him because of the voice). And for some reason in many of my thoughts when I was a little bit off from the film, I kept thinking why Jesus had his hair short? Has anyone noticed this? Jesus is a popular figure in films since 1897, in films that don't even exist anymore, other classics and more controversial pictures, and always be present in our lives and on celluloid, and most of the films I've watched about Him are great, it can't go wrong. I enjoyed Stevens epic but not as much as The Last Temptation of Christ, Godspell or The Passion of Christ. Watchable for those who love epic stories, the classic Hollywood and have patience to sit down for a few hours, which I have.

I have asked myself why it was no sin when Jesus angrily drove the moneychangers from the temple with a whip. The cast is a Who's Who in Hollywood. It is filled with recognizable names, and part of the fun is to pick out the famous people from Charlton Heston as John the Baptist down to David McCallum as Judas.

Perhaps it was more idealized in some portions, but I think it only added to the greatness of the message that was delivered by Christ himself when he lived on Earth. Christ's message was love and forgiveness; charity and forbearance; devotion and commitment. The film had a splendid cast and I very much enjoyed Max Von Sydow's portrayal of Christ.

You simply can't go wrong with Max von Sydow, and his Jesus is a dignified and commanding figure, believable as the Son of God. Too often Jesus comes across as a nice guy who just gets screwed over (to borrow a phrase from South Park's Kyle Koslovsky) or else as some weird hippie guru. The photography is majestic and the period detail quite convincing, even if the film is slow-moving and overloaded with cheesy star cameos (particularly John Wayne as the Roman soldier). Nonetheless, the acting is generally decent, and if you watch closely you'll spot Klinger from 'M*A*S*H) as one of the twelve disciples. As so often in drama it's the evil characters who are most convincingly portrayed Claude Rains as Herod the Great, Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, and of course Donald Pleasance as Satan. And of course Telly Savalas is the definitive screen Pilate a tough guy but not a bad guy, who seems genuinely uncertain what course he should take. George Stevens' direction is sincere and forthright, and this is a traditional, middle-of-the-road Life of Christ that both believers and non-believers can enjoy and profit from.

Perhaps that is because it was presented as a series for British TV. The Brits really know how to do things - take a look at Jesus Christ Super Star if you want to see how that musical should be done.I saw The Greatest Story Ever Told simply because I was watching a marathon of John Wayne movies.......can't believe they showed it simply because he had that dreadfully embarrassing one-liner at the very end. But, I AM glad I just happened upon it; I did not see the film when it was originally released, but would certainly go the theater to see a re-release. However, now I would have to compare it to Jesus of Nazareth, which is as inspiring of the telling of the story could ever be. Of the other comments I've read, only two people mention Nazareth, both of them from Canada (warlock of canada; coy_dogO). I admit my total immersion into Jesus of Nazareth certainly influences any other films of this tale. I even remember one very short version in which James Dean - blond and no beard ! - played the Apostle John. I've also seen many church-versions, whose versions were no doubt funded from their treasuries, no acting what-so-ever involved, but their zeal prominent - but, laughable. Jesus of Nazareth runs for 6 HOURS, never a dull moment, excellent acting from all.Many comments mention all the big stars of Hollywood playing bit-parts in this film - they fail to mention they didn't get paid. Taxable, or the desire to appear in an epic ? Charleton Heston was the only convincing actor in his role - von Sydow? Nah ! Telly Savalas as Pilate - ridiculous. The appearance of Donald Pleasance as Satan was the only actor who also appeared in Nazareth. Wasn't he the first one to scream cruficy him at Jesus' trial in this film?? Many people were in awe of the raising-from-the-dead of Lazarus, but it truly can't compare to that scene from Nazareth.I, Claudius (also a Brit-TV production) does a good job of showing how popular Herod the Great was in Rome - which put him on the throne, in the first place (no one could duplicate Peter Ustinov's Herod the Great). He was NOT Jewish. Christopher Plummer as Herod Antipas was magnificent in Nazareth. Bravo! Michael York for the most brilliant of any John the Baptist-roles ever played.As beautiful as Story was, if one wishes to see an authentic and naturally-played Greatest Story, one must get to e-Bay or some other dealer to buy the DVD. Jesus of Nazareth also has many big stars, but they all were well-cast.....and got paidAs you can surmise, I loved the story of the film, but thought it could have been much more artistically filmed to portray the life of The Greatest Man Whoever Lived.Story was beautifully filmed, as everyone agrees. It doesn't matter to me the desert-scenes were filmed in Arizona, etc. I recommend watching The Greatest Story Ever Told, then take a breather - the next night, maybe? - and revel in Jesus of Nazareth.Christmas 2007 - I saw the full version of The Greatest Story Ever Told tonight, and must admit it revealed some strong acting for von Sydow at the last supper and the very end of the film. Although I am still amazed at the difference in many directors' telling of this story (George Stevens here), I have to admit their efforts were great - and certainly were made greater by the use of wide-screen.

As it stands ,I started wondering about other ancient writings that his title sequence insisted guided the script-as if Carl Sandburg (not sure of spelling) was disowning the production finally.No one can tell who bored whom or made the good Lord boring?Laborious drawings were made when the production was going to take place actually in the Holy land and then there is this incredible decision where everything is taken to a landscape that looked more holy in the director's words. The mesas are bigger than anything Jesus would have known (or appear to be)and if you think he wasn't realistic...he used genuine disabled people in the scenes ...unfortunately his manner was so longwinded and his dissatisfaction marked every take that winter came to what was supposed to be a dusty Palestine set, snow that wasn't Christmas effects had to be removed and Schildkraut died before final scenes whilst it was glaringly obvious and still is, as you see her dresses that one of the Marys had become pregnant.She wasn't Jesus' mother-not that one!Yes the end product does not even show proof of all this perfectionism, in my opinion there is really not one effective characterisation. In places the script is laughable, such as when one of the boy disciples declares that Jesus has a good name and S Matthew starts asking officiously if God has anything to declare .It's a drab mixture of ideas that I'm sure the poet of the title page was ashamed of and probably disowned.If I had to be positive I would say that snap stills of this film have a certain beauty, if you can forget the utter boredom of what people were trying to say as the running elapsed.The Sermon on the Mount as a colour coordinated tableau set in these incredible hills is a painting of sorts-but nothing else works around it.I would not be convinced about the claims of Jesus Christ if I watched this ponderous play even eternally.Even the Herods of this film have been outheroded since to use Hamlet's words in other films,some people like the sinister breezeblock fortress where Claude Rains fumes alongside his son, for me it's as monolithic a mess as the movie to come.So what else?Christ's Mother?

One of Stevens' greatest stars Katharine Hepburn gave an Interview stating George Stevens lost his edge when he got so serious. The Grestest Story Ever Told is very serious!!

As a practicing Catholic, I appreciate it when Hollywood deals with Religious topics. George Stevens rented the entire Desilu Culver studio for interiors and shot the outdoors scenes in the American West. Brilliant production values. John Wayne makes a small cameo, Carroll Baker, and Dorothy McGuire are cast. The overall effect is one of careful attention to detail but lacks the passion of The Greatest Story Ever Told. Possibly meaningful to the back story is that none of Stevens great stars Jean Arthur, Cary Grant,Barbara Stanwyck, Rock Hudson, Katharine Hepburn, Alan Ladd, participated in this movie. Elixabeth Taylor was offered Mary Magdalene but turned it down. Jennifer Jones spent the last 15 years of her career from 1950-1965 trying to get a film of Mary Magdalene made, too bad Stevens did not cast Jennifer Jones who always gave great intense study to her roles!

The director,and the professionals involved seem to have been trying to play at their best,outplayed also as to how to portray something so exceptional that had so many repercussions through the ages and frankly,still mesmerizes. All around played to their advantage,the grandiosity of the locations,the photography,the music score,the quality of acting,the script of short but intense dialogue,even the time given to such heroic epic. But again,there is that something to this movie that it leaves the critic to dissatisfaction,a sense of left down,and many to despair and disbelief.And Im not sure if it was indeed this effect what was intended,as with the Delibes' famous quote An story,must not only bring to entertainment but when done well through,its ultimate purpose should be to unease,disquiet,to unsettle(what any Society misses). Max Von Sydow,(and Im one huge fan of his)did take the character with the ease of someone used since way earlier,to play these roles looming around Death with a smile and fear altogether.Serene and rich,frail and aware of the peculiar physicality of his added to the role.Only some People from those not used to these triptychs pieces of Art would still be receptive to their beauty and mystery.No wonder is that the human aspect of the Christ he is playing to,is abated to the monochrome Lordful one that the public and critic is expecting to see.As the supermenschabove and godly,grandiose cinema.That is why,the miracles are not played to the special effects of cinematic Red seas splitting to amaze the eye,but to bring the intimate effects and convolutions falling inside the surrounding characters,included Jesus' own interacting among with them. To this I have to commend the unforgettable interpretation done by David MacCallum as the critical Judas,but to a higher turn and human rich detail that of Van Heflin,with all his capabilities at the top of the Craft.In his,one can see the older man already over the hill who with his slanting eyes may have seen it all,until then.Jews and Herodians political jockeying around the roman invaders,as well. The climatic scene of Lazarus' resurrection is artfully painted by Stevens,and it comes to point this very well,that aside all that spectacle possible going on,decided to show precisely these two characters side by side,the older average well trodden human somewhat of a skeptical rejuvenating in new facts to belief,and the younger businessman collapsing in rejecting facts for stern assumptions never to overwhelm. If one can not see these scenes and their framing of humanity,acting,stampeding from the screen,petal after petal,one fails to see it because they maybe bring other self rejections of introspection in ourselves as worthy of the divine (or cinematic)Drama.Painted actors and cinema can be more glorious to watch as full Roses,unopened,and in a bunch bound. This Film,indeed may bring the Drama out of this Tragedy,but its focus all along may be in the -less spectacle because its commonality-silent unwrapping of the lives,Life.

I heard thru some outside source that Stevens initially wanted Richard Burton to portray Jesus before offering it to Sweedish screen legend Max Von Sydow. Though Vom Sydow wasn't popular yet in Hollywood or the world before this role, this film brought out the good in him and also in the popular American actors.

James the Less asking Jesus what His name is and upon being told saying, Ah, that's a good name!, with Jesus responding, Thank you! Ed Wynn doddering about Palestine as a blind man and reminding the Messiah about how when He was just a little fella' He was always asking questions. Dull?

Most Bible movies suffer from a certain pictorial stodginess, as if the director were afraid to depart from illustrated Bible models. Stevens is not afraid of arty touches, like the huge close-up of the Infant Christ's hand superimposed against a sun which dissolves into trumpets of the Temple guards. The sequence in which John the Baptist is introduced as a breath of fresh air into a drab and heartless world is for me the finest representation in all cinema of a Christian concept. And the scene when the Holy Family, making a pretty holy picture along with their little donkey, happen upon one of the mass crucifixions you read about in Josephus, is startling and thought-provoking like nothing else in any sword-and-sandal flick. You don't get this kind of depth and breadth of allusion anywhere else. Great music, beautiful scenery, fair cast with Herods and Peter a cut above, notorious all-star problem less of a problem with every passing year.

The Greatest Story Ever Told would be perfect fodder for that show. Among my heckling remarks were Son, when you reign... - ...you'll pour. All the tribes on the earth... - ...she had to come to mine. Hosanna! - Oh, Hosanna, don't you cry for me! We got a new religion and it's gonna set us free! Sorry if I offend religious people, but having been raised without religion, I take none seriously (Bill Maher's documentary Religulous pretty much displays my opinion of organized religion, although I think that Maher could have done better).As for the characters. First off, it makes no sense to cast white people like Max von Sydow and Claude Rains as biblical figures. The stories took place in the Middle East, so they should have all been at least swarthy; Sidney Poitier, Jamie Farr and Michael Ansara (Barbara Eden's then-husband) were the only cast members who looked accurate. Apparently, when someone asked George Stevens why he cast so many top stars - among them Carroll Baker, Pat Boone, Angela Lansbury, Roddy McDowall, Dorothy McGuire and John Wayne - in small roles, Stevens asserted that in later years people wouldn't know who these actors/actresses are and would judge the whole movie on its merits. Well, I know who most of these people are/were. One of the things that I judge is that the movie comes across as a lead weight. And that Charlton Heston turns John the Baptist into a real wise guy, and that it's hard to watch Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate and not think of Savalas's other roles.In my opinion, the important thing to understand about Jesus is that he was basically a revolutionary. Judea was a hierarchical society with the colonizing Romans collaborating with the king and the religious institution, and then along comes this carpenter who starts speaking for the masses. The fact that people wanted to free murderer Barrabas goes to show that in a frenzied-up society, a revolutionary is considered more dangerous than a murderer. I actually didn't learn the story of Jesus until my parents and I went to Paris when I was ten. Going to the museums and seeing the paintings depicting biblical scenes, my mom decided that she'd better explain to me what the story was. For the record, by the age of five, I could identify the people behind the Bugs Bunny cartoons (Mel Blanc, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, etc).Long story short, I don't recommend this movie, unless it's for a film class. Also starring Michael Anderson, Joanna Dunham, Van Heflin, Martin Landau, David McCallum, Donald Pleasance and Shelley Winters.

Producer/director George Stevens deserves credit for a major effort. However, there are significant problems with this long and poorly-paced effort that start with the obvious. I presume the title of the movie is intended to suggest that the life of Jesus is the greatest story ever told. Having said that, it is surely presumptuous for any film maker to entitle his own movie The Greatest Story Ever Told - particularly when it (the actual movie, I mean) turns out not to be.The basic story (from the manger to the cross to the empty tomb) is there, but in what seemed to me to be a rather disjointed fashion. We have a mish-mash of Jesus' ethical teachings scattered throughout the movie with no apparent focus (and, for some reason, a decision to put the words of Paul from 1 Corinthians 13 - and now these three remain, faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love - on to the lips of Jesus.) We have several questionable interpretations - the two most memorable to me being the identification of Lazarus with the rich man who was told by Jesus that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and of Mary Magdalene as the woman caught in adultery whom Jesus saved from a stoning - and there are a number of flights of fancy (the confrontation between Caiaphas and Nicodemus in the Sanhedrin - which I thought was well done - and the Roman massacre of worshippers at the temple prior to Jesus' arrest, neither of which have any historical validity that I know of.)The casting of the movie was somewhat problematic. None of the performances really leapt out at me as extraordinary (except for Donald Pleasance, who I will mention later.) I was not taken with Max Von Sydow's take on Jesus. He certainly seemed earnest, but he portrayed Jesus as an almost other-worldly character, and I thought the result was that Jesus lacked his essential humanity and seemed strangely uninvolved in what was happening around him. Something about Charlton Heston as John the Baptist seemed out of place and I have to confess that I laughed when John Wayne's voice (as the centurion at the foot of the cross) said in that unmistakable Wayne twang, Surely this man was the Son of God! The ending was also problematic to me. The Gospels, of course, end the story of Jesus' life with the risen Jesus offering his disciples the evangelistic Great Commission (Go into all the world and make disciples of all nations.) Here, the risen Jesus leaves his disciples with another ethical teaching about love. Is this decision to de-emphasize the evangelistic thrust of the Christian faith an early example of political correctness?There were things about this movie that I liked. The centre point of the movie (as in the Gospel of John) is the raising of Lazarus by Jesus. It becomes the point at which skepticism turns to conviction. But setting aside the theological value of the event, I liked the way Stevens handled it. The focus was not on Lazarus (in fact we never see the resurrected Lazarus.) Instead the focus is on the reactions of those who saw the event, and the impact is powerful. I also enjoyed the repeated appearances by Donald Pleasance as Satan at appropriate points in the movie, demonstrating that the story of Jesus' life is really the story of a spiritual battle between light and darkness. Pleasance portrays Satan as I think he would be generally gentle and soft-spoken and seemingly rather harmless. An interesting theological issue is raised near the end of the movie when Satan (Pleasance) is among those who whip up the crowd to demand that Pilate have Jesus crucified. Surely a proper understanding of Christian theology would have Satan trying to prevent Jesus from being crucified, since the crucifixion and resurrection were Jesus' ultimate victory.All things considered, though, I was disappointed with this movie. It wasn't bad, but certainly could have been so much better. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Beautiful","Date":"9 October 2002","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  I've not seen the rest of his films, but I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't Max Von Sydow's greatest acting achievement.You believe he is Jesus.

The Greatest Story Ever Told stars Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ of Nazareth (von Sydow) in a feature-film chronicle of Jesus's birth by Mary (McGuire) all the way to his death on the cross & rising from the dead. The film starts with a reading from the Book of John, giving us a rather joyful start to Christ's life, but as the runtime continues, the frequent dullness of this film's events begins to take its toll on viewers. Why? Because this film suffers from utter faithfulness to the Book it's based on, never once showing any sign of creative liberty or inspiration. Unlike 1956's magnificent The Ten Commandments, Greatest Story fails to heighten the tension that would have come in reality for such amazing events and doesn't take any risks. For instance, after Jesus's baptism, he runs into Satan in the mountains and is tempted by a supposedly menacing figure. All of Satan's taunting fails to reveal pure soulless evil in him, even though he is the Devil. Even some better camera-work, lighting, and direction on Stevens's part would have made it seem like a heated argument rather than a dull bickering in the dark. Truly, the lighting often makes it incomprehensible to see who is talking or even where people are. But there are moments when the actors' and score's work alone create some charming scenes, such as Jesus healing a cripple, entering the temple, and dying on the cross. While the camera-work is mediocre in many eventful moments, relying on long unedited shots for comprehension, it truly succeeds on landscape shots, giving the Jordan River and the capital of Jerusalem a true sense of grandeur. Sadly, the film also relies on overly preachy segments for grandeur, especially a couple of overlong scenes of prayer from Jerusalem's men & women. What mainly saves Greatest Story are its main all-star performances. Max von Sydow gives Jesus the spiritual mentality he needs to appear wise and kind to all. Charlton Heston, who starred as Moses in The Ten Commandments, brings back the same authoritative attitude and vigor to steal whatever scene he's in as John the Baptist, elevating interest where it couldn't have existed. Other supporting standouts are David McCallum as Judas Iscariot and Joanna Dunham as Mary Magdalene. The Greatest Story Ever Told doesn't make much impact with its 3-hour runtime like Commandments did; in other words, it's an overly faithful biblical epic for the overly faithful.

An ultimate test of this work is the number of times one can periodically view it, in whole or in part, and whether it continues to offer insights.At a point in his life when his array of popular cinematic successes was behind him, Stevens saw this as an ultimate challenge and opportunity--and it was. The role of Jesus, like Moses, is a somewhat impossible part to play. Stevens' careful choosing of von Syndow illustrates the care with which he cast his feature. Realizing the importance of box office names to help sell his work, Stevens practically cast many recognizable names that had marquee appeal.This isn't a film one can watch once, judge fairly, and dispense with. Like all fine artworks, it's a piece to return to again and again, savoring the beautiful, detailed rendering of this contemplative creation. On all counts, the film holds up beautifully.I feel one must cast aside all the rush and hubub of the modern world, with its hurried pace and superficial formatting, to savor an introspective and scholarly rendering of this biblical tale.

That version at least had developed characters, remarkable imagery, and a strong storyline that was greatly enhanced and deepened by clarified character relationships and a rich historical context. George Stevens did The Greatest Story Ever Told, however, just to be seen doing it. As opposed to the more extrovert Biblical spectacles (think The Robe, The Ten Commandments, and King of Kings, all great or near-great movies) this one focuses less on the pageantry and more on the human drama-- or, at least, that was the plan. But it failed for a number of reasons.1) Movies set in the historical past (and, by the way, the future) are inherently showy because they require showy sets and costumes. In spite of Stevens' intent, it's still a bunch of ancient designs on a super-wide (too wide) screen. 2) The movie is cluttered (as you well know) with tacky cameo appearances ranging from the understandable (Roddy McDowell as an apostle, Sal Mineo as a cripple) to the absurd (Shelley Winters) and the downright obscene (show me John Wayne!) Even this would be understandable, however, if the characters had any sort of depth. The only character who is truly explored to the fullest potential is Jesus. More on this in a minute. 3) Stevens seems to lean far too strongly on his artistic homages. Using DaVinci's staging of the last supper (all on one side of the table!) is forgivable, but the slightly altered version of the Sistine chapel featured at the beginning is a bit much, and he lost me completely when two of the giant miracles (one at the beginning, one at the end) were underscored by the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah, which clashes drastically with Alfred Newman's gloriously powerful (though not very ambitious) score. Newman valiantly wrote his own Hallelujahs to make for a less awkward transition into the Handel music, but it's still jarringly familiar.Max von Sydow delivers one of his truly great performances as Christ-- quiet when necessary but always full of grandeur and solemnity. He outdoes Jeffrey Hunter (King of Kings) every step of the way. And Charlton Heston makes a compelling John the Baptist-- but our connection to the character of John is that of watching and hearing a great orator deliver speeches we've all heard millions of times before. It's like, for instance, Barack Obama delivering the I Have a Dream speech. I'm sure it's a wonderful performance, but it doesn't offer any psychological insight into the man who originated it. It is, in fact, just one man temporarily inhabiting the persona of, never actually evoking, a rare mind. The worst of all in the film's voluminous list of disappointingly flat characterizations is David McCallum's Judas (for which I don't blame McCallum, but Stevens and his co-screenwriter James Lee Barrett). As is often the trap, Judas is given absolutely no discernible motivation for that certain deed of his. When he enacts it, we knew it was coming but we still feel completely and totally blindsided. And shallowly so. How can you feel pity for people who exist only to adhere to a millennia-old story as familiar as your own hometown?The film as it exists today is presented in a 199-minute version with 45 seconds of overture and nearly six minutes of intermission and exit music. It was originally 225 minutes (!). King of Kings runs 171 minutes with 3 minutes of overture and about six minutes of intermission and exit music. They both tell the same story but only King of Kings resembles any sort of dramatically valid presentation. Greatest Story Ever Told fails to achieve in 199 what King of Kings excelled at in 171. Of course, Greatest is still closer to the subject matter-- but only because of its slavish script, stilted dialogue (which uncomfortably fuses Jacobean grandiloquence with contemporary Sunday school jargon) and artistic self-indulgence.

Sydow's Jesus always finishes sentences wherever at all possible with gravelly z's, lending authority but perhaps a little tiresome if you notice.If you were around then going to the silver screen just like I was, seeing Ed Wynn as the cured blind man couldn't help bringing a reminder of him laughing up there on the ceiling with Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins, just a year earlier.With John Wayne in a few choice spots, it's definitely a period piece, but the opening, thoughtful score, and the reminder that the producer and director, George Stevens, had filmed at the liberated Dachau death camp in WWII, make it a thoughtful, poignant and definite worth while.

But for those viewers who are not familiar with classical music, Mr. Newman did NOT write all of the music in this film.Newman even borrowed from himself...just before the intermission around the Lazarus scene, I am sure that Newman quotes from his own score for The Robe (from 1953). The music and choral parts sound so similar to the scene at the cross in The Robe. Then later in the Lazarus scene, the film score brings in parts of the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's oratario The Messiah. Parts of this return at the end,too.The procession of Jesus with the Cross includes selections from the opening section of Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem Mass, albeit it is repeated over and over which does not happen in Verdi's score. And its editing in the film is quite butchered too. What bothers me in the film's credits is that I couldn't see any reference that material was being credited to neither Handel nor Verdi. That would not happen today, but I am surprised in happened in 1965! The producers should have known better to give credit to the composers besides Mr. Newman.I have not seen the restored DVD version, so I don't know if this oversight was rectified in the credits or in the notes. The notes for the soundtrack CD of the score (Varese Saraband) only mentions Handel, not Verdi.------------------------------------------------------------------Speaking of Alfred Newman's score for The Robe, film music fans might also like to know that parts of The Robe score I have also heard in earlier films (David & Bathsheba and The Hunchback of Notre Dame).

It was made in the period when films about Jesus as well as the sword and sandal epics were highly popular. The movies like BARABBAS (1961), KING OF KINGS (1961), SODOM AND GOMORRAH (1962), THE BIBLE (1965) have to be mentioned here because THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD is very similar to the aforementioned movies in many aspects. Therefore, if you liked the 1960s' epics, you will also like this one. Many people have already said much about it so I will discuss only some aspects of the film.CAST Max Von Sydow gives a good performance as Jesus Christ. Although he does not look the Christ of later movies, particularly Robert Powell in Zeffirelli's 1977 movie, his acting is so good and his eyes are so powerful that even a modern viewer easily gets accustomed to his face as Jesus'. Sometimes, however, he has difficulties expressing the human nature of Christ concentrating primarily on His divinity. However, these are minor shortcomings that an average viewer can skip. The idea of this movie is the STORY and therefore, we cannot expect a particularly deep interpretation of Christ's mission and sacrifice. Mary, Jesus' mother, is played by Dorothy McGuire. She is very beautiful in the role but does not resemble the true nature of the Holy Mother of God. She is just present in the story and we see her as mother of Jesus only. Neverthelss, one man is absolutely great in his role and that is Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. He is a mainstay of the biblical epics from the role of Moses to Ben Hur, but his John the Baptist is really worth attention. Strict, straightforward and frank to the very core (consider the conversation with king Herod). Very appealing portrayal! Other remarkable performances include Claude Rains as Herod the Great, Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas and Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate. I also liked Ina Balin as Martha of Bettany. The whole sequence with Lazarus (Micheal Tolan) is really good. That is one of the few films that shows the fact Lazarus was a rich man, he had a villa near Jerusalem, and all his family opened to Christ's Mission.LOCATIONS The problem of the movie, however, is the serious lack of authenticity. Instead of a region expressing the landscape of Palestine, a viewer gets scene by scene filmed in the natural beauties and national parks of the USA, particularly Death Valley National Park and Glen Canyon. This is the only movie that has done nothing to make it at least a bit authentic in case of filming locations. I was disappointed by the Capernaum of the movie (the town by the Sea of Galilee looks entirely different), the reconstruction of Jerusalem with its walls as well as the desert and the Jordan River. Imagine John the Baptist baptizing by the lakes in Utah ... strange! But that is what you get in this movie.CONTENT The story appears to be the main focus of the film, which is indicated by the title itself. The greatest story that has ever been told to humanity is filled with Hollywood style of the 1960s. There are moments that reflect the interpretations of the New Testament by different denominations. Nevertheless, for someone who does not know much about Christ, the movie may serve a useful purpose. It more or less accurately shows the life of Christ, entails his teachings and shows his death and resurrection clearly. Some scenes are very much influenced by our times and modern views on that period 2000 years ago. For example, we get Haendel's oratorio from THE TRIUMPH OF TIME and MESSIAH not only when Jesus rises from the dead but also when Lazarus is brought back to life. But generally speaking, the movie does not create confusion and can be seen by the number of audiences.Some people call Stevens' film the longest story ever told. I wouldn't call it in that way because the director wanted to entail as much as possible, which is worth attention in the life of Christ. The movie is helpful for many viewers, shows Christ in a bit different light (the 1960s) and may be enjoyable to watch not only by the sword and sandal epic fans. But don't expect too much. It is definitely not the best film about Jesus. 6/10!

When I first heard that Stevens was making the story of Christ, I was baffled. My first question was why? It may be the greatest story ever told but it is also the oldest. Is there a single person on this planet who does not know the story? Then when I saw that Stevens was casting every star in the world for the film I was truly incredulous. How could any film with all those stars not collapse just because of the sheer weight of so much star power? Mike Todd succeeded with Around the World in Eighty Days but that film was nothing like Jesus' story and in fact lent itself to so many stars each one of which was perfectly cast and it was fun to look for them as the mammoth production unrolled. But Jesus' story is hardly the kind of vehicle to lend itself to such theatrics and ultimately the ploy simply becomes part of the overall problem with the film. It ends up being just too ponderous in too many ways to be enjoyable. It's way too long and has way too many scenes that just do not make any sense. The script departs from scripture in a most annoying way, for example, when an apostle's coat is stolen and Jesus lectures him on giving everything he owns away.

It tries to make a one-dimensional understanding of Jesus hip by surrounding him with celebrities and making the story into a glam-show, and Oscar routine, full of parlor tricks and the Great American KnowWho.It certainly does not make Jesus three dimensional, nor does it explore anything worthwhile about one of history's most important and dynamic men. It seems to me that those who prefer this version to other more risk-taking portrayals (Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR or the Last Temptation) do so because they are able to look past a total lack of artistic merit in favor of a potato-paste mush of tired and safe one-liners.I recommend Martin Scorcese's rendition of the Kazantzakis novel, The Last Temptation of Christ.
