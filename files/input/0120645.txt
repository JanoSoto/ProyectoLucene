Specifically, like all Disney movies, it has an ability to enchant just about every young child under the age of 12. I saw it while keeping an eye on a group of 9-year-olds, and while I found myself glancing at my watch to see if the film was almost over, the children (boys AND girls, I might add!) were sitting on there seats watching in rapt fascination, wishing that they could BE the Deedles. I had the same experience recently when I watched in on TV with pair of 11-year-olds I was taking care of for the evening...they loved it! So, in short, I'd warn adults away from it, but don't ban it from your house, as it could come in handy if you have some unruly kids around!

The film might have had an audience once, but those were all 11 to 17 year old boys growing up in the 1990's and have since grown up. Just look at the cover of that VHS tape, and you'll immediately know that this is going to be irritating and not the list bit funny. It's as ridiculous and stupid as you can expect from a title like Meet the Deedles.It's about two surf-loving free spirits that reject authority, Phil Deedle (Paul Walker) and his brother Stew Deedle (Steve Van Wormer). After being kicked out of school for what they perceive as being Too Cool, they are sent to a boot camp to be straightened out. Instead, their vehicle takes a wrong turn and they end up In Yellowstone National Park! From there you can see where everything is going to go. They meet the authority figure of the park, they run around him while he screams impotently. If this movie follows formula, they're going to screw up something big, like destroy Old Faithful, but prove to everyone that with surfing and the power of being an awesome slacker with no real responsibilities, you can make everything go right in the end. Tell me when my prediction turns out to be off.Looking back at this movie fills me with shame. I was the target audience for this film when it came out. I was 11 years old in 1998 and you bet if I had seen the film at that time, I would have thought it would have been hilarious! Thankfully, I've grown up. Nowadays I empathize more with the people who want to destroy these fools than the surfers themselves. It's almost funny in an ironic way, like watching a map of the earth as the center of the universe, and a flat earth at that!

Throw in a bear with human characteristic and a witless plot and you have the bases of stupidity. Two moronic surfers are sent to camp after missing class for the umpteenth time. They are mistaken as park rangers, which means that they will spend the remainder of the film trying to conceal their identities and go with the flow. There is a scheme by an old ranger who uses prairie dogs to do his bidding and the rangers are enlisted to deal with the problem. Director Steve Boyum creates a shameful mess that wouldn't hold interest on a half hour slot on prime time television. The production couldn't have been any worse than if it was done by a kindergarten art class. Steve Von Wormer and Paul Walker act pre-school foolish with A.J. Langer as a female ranger who is there to be hit on and have a tomboyish sexual appeal. The fact that she would even consider dating one of these morons reduce this garbage to total fantasy that goes beyond the prairie dog subplot. Dennis Hopper should fire his agent after this. It is disappointing to see an actor of his potential wasting time on garbage such as this. Pointless Bill and Ted clone show that should be thrown to the dogs. In this case, prairie dogs.

Therefore I shall simply add that this has nothing to do with Yellowstone National Park. The filmmakers knew nothing about it but that Old Faithful is there and knew nothing about national parks but that rangers wear uniforms. I watched this to see how goofily unrealistic the geysers and hotsprings would look. Surprise, there aren't any, besides a spout of water in the background (Old Faithful) and a love scene in a hot-tub (the hidden hotspring). Disney couldn't even be bothered to make some plastic scenery! Yes, along with each other Hollywood film, they simply set everything in the studio's grassy fields with California's generic mountains in the background. The park's geology and animal-life are joyfully manipulated by the HEROES as the SOLUTIONS to the villain's evil actions. To the filmmakers, the only difference between commercial tourist attractions and national parks is that national park employees wear ranger uniforms. And these are the same people getting worked up over global warming? For sure. But any film with A J Langer is worth at least 3 stars.

Their wealthy father Elton, informed that the boys will get no more second chances, has to do something. Realizing the boys will someday take over his business, he must see that they are turned into men, so he sends them to a sort of boot camp in Wyoming. A couple of unexpected detours result in the boys ending up unconscious at the entrance to Yellowstone Park, wearing the labelled clothes of Mel and Mo, the park's newest ranger trainees. (Did I mention Mo and Mel are female?) Mel and Mo were hired because of their rodent expertise, because the park has a serious prairie dog problem. This was caused by former head ranger Frank Slater, fired after an incident several years ago and now out for revenge, along with his associates Crabbe and Nemo. Stew and Phil don't bother to correct Capt. Pine, the current head ranger, when he believes they are who the clothes say they are. They see an opportunity to satisfy their father in a way that lets them have a good time. Mel and Mo, meanwhile, are otherwise occupied. The big event coming up, which Slater wants to sabotage, is the billionth birthday of Old Faithful.Another reason the boys want to stay at Yellowstone--Lt. Jesse Ryan, another ranger who is the stepdaughter of Capt. Pine, who declares her off limits. That doesn't stop the boys from trying.I don't understand how Disney could be associated with such garbage. For one thing, there was too much off-color humor for my taste. But I enjoyed this mess overall. There was plenty of slapstick comedy, especially the constant misfortunes of poor Capt. Pine, and Slater's brainless sidekicks. And we were taken on several exciting thrill rides, especially in the sequences immediately preceding the boys' arrival at the park. Another thrilling sequence involved surfboards (In Wyoming? Yes).Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker had their good moments, reminding me a lot of the superior Bill and Ted movies. So did A.J. Langer and Robert Englund. But one doesn't watch movies such as this for good acting. And there wasn't much. I'm surprised a respected actor such as Dennis Hopper would get involved with something like this. He really didn't add that much. John Ashton also didn't make me as happy as he could have. And despite talent he has shown over the years on The Young and the Restless, Eric Braeden fell flat in his brief appearances as the boys' father.As mindless enjoyable entertainment, though, this film succeeded.

A wit if you will. It chronicled the lives of deep, yet shallow-acting characters. They were entertaining to see on screen; the situations they got into even more so. But alas, there is none of this obvious humor in the most heinous rip-off of Bill and Ted to this day, Meet the Deedles.Meet the Deedles was a movie made for one reason, and one reason only To cash in on a once-was film franchise. Bill and Ted's two adventures were time-pieces; a look into the eighties. But one can see why this technique failed in the sequel, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, because by then (1991) audiences had grown weary of eighties teenagers in heinous situations. Film companies should have learned then that while Bill and Ted were once good, and always will be, MORE of the same kind is tiring. They tried a lot of films in the same tradition, but they all flopped. (Bio Dome.)The original is the only thing worth seeing again; not sequels or rip-offs, because their time has passed. But Meet the Deedles ignores this and gives the audience something about ten years too late for its own good. The movie's only true ambition is to create mindless slapstick and generate a series in the tradition of the ``Bill & Ted'' movies. It really does neither. The story involves twin brothers Stew and Phil Deedle (Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker), slackers from Hawaii who find themselves in the middle of a fiendish plot to sabotage Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.One day Stew and Phil are hanging beneath a balloon being towed above the Hawaiian surf, while being pursued by a truant officer on a Jet Ski. When they reach ground, their millionaire father (Eric Braeden) realizes he must put a plan of his own into action Send the two surf-bums to Camp Broken Spirit, a monthlong experience in outdoor living that will turn them into men.   Through a series of truly mind-numbing and brain-tumbling actions, the Twin Deedle Dudes, who may as well be referred to as Bill and Ted, are mistaken for park ranger recruits upon their arrival at camp. They come under the command of Ranger Pine (John Ashton), and stumble onto the solution to a mysterious infestation of prairie dogs. Prairie dogs. My, oh my. Praire dogs. Where do I start? Perhaps I'll tell you why millions of them are scurrying about. It's quite simple, really. Too simple.An evil former ranger named Slater (Dennis Hopper) has trained them to burrow out a cavern around Old Faithful, allowing him to redirect the geyser's boiling waters in the direction of New Faithful, to which he plans to sell tickets. A whole lot of work when he could just use some machinery to re-route the water. But that would be too basic for a film as stupid and mindless as this. No, Slater as to have prairie dogs chew around the geyser. Truly awful.Hopper lives in his underground cavern, along with his sidekick Nemo, played by Robert Englund, Freddy of the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' pictures. At one point he explains how he trained the prairie dogs, and I quote, ``Inject kibble into the dirt, and a-tunneling they would go.'' I never thought I would ever hear Dennis Hopper say such a thing. But he did, and I am forever scarred.   While he schemes, the Deedles fumble and bumble their way through ranger training. None of these scenes are remotely funny, nor hilarious as they should have been.Yet with all this criticism, Meet the Deedles is also kind of fun to watch. It's so lousy that it almost comes off as original. It's worth seeing alone just for Dennis Hopper's crazy line I mentioned above. But I would not recommend you go out and rent the film; rather, wait until it is on TV.I am split between my outlook on Meet the Deedles. It is certainly one of the worst films I have ever seen, but it is not unwatchably bad like other bad children's flicks. I saw a TV-film two years ago named P.U.N.K.S., and while the lousiness of it is much on the same level as Meet the Deedles, its watchability (yes, I made up that word) differs. Meet the Deedles is just awful. P.U.N.K.S. is even worse.Only watch Meet the Deedles if there's nothing on TV. But I don't recommend it to you as a good film, but rather an awful one. See it and witness pure stinkiness on film. Whatever it tried to steal from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is not apparent. Whatever was stolen was not stolen properly. .5/5 stars (half a star).John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Go be gnarly someplace else","Date":"4 December 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" NOTE For the sake of utilizing the abundance of slang words and incomprehensibly stupid jargon I learned from the Disney film Meet the Deedles, I am prepared to review the film in a more informal way than I'm used to.Like, how come every time Disney tries to make one of those live action films it turns out to be totally bogus? From George of the Jungle to Max Keeble's Big Move to The Country Bears to now the totally uncool Meet the Deedles that tries too hard to be hip and in touch with the youth of today. To quote Phil Deedle, it's so diculous it's ridiculous. The oh-so stupid plot revolves around Stu and Phil Deedle (Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker), two California surf bums who are sent to a camp by their totally loaded father who believes he has given them way too much in life and they must give him something back. The camp is located in the bogus state that is Wyoming (and when their plane lands is looks like one of those flight simulator computer games), but when the Deedles land there they realize that the camp had been shut down and the owner is a psycho-dude. They wind up becoming park rangers at the wicked Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming because of mistaken identities and now must find a way to solve the park's prairie dog (p-dog) problem. But would you believe these dudes discover this big park conspiracy involving a geyser that hasn't gone off in years? This all could've been pretty radical, but the approach to the film is just so uncool and lame. Meet the Deedles plays like a dude who has lived in his house for far too many years, rarely leaving his confines, trying to write and illustrate a film about teenagers when he hasn't spoken to one in years. The film feels like somebody's image of traditional teenagers rather than actual teenagers. This is the kind of film that makes people hate teens and give them a poor view. And if you're gonna hate them, at least hate them for what they really do and not what you think they do.I always complain about the bogus films aimed at the demographic of kids and Meet the Deedles fits right in that demographic. The kind of film that is so lame and stupid it does nobody any good, unless you find shortened attention spans and a hunger for more simplistic films a good thing. This film exercises its right to be stupid and idiotic with no conceivable reward. It reminds me of that no phase tykes go into around age four or five, where they say no to everything and feel like rebelling for the sake of rebelling. The Deedles seem to have never escaped that phase. Society seemed to want their sentences structured and their thoughts to make sense, but they just weren't gonna listen.The film was directed by ex-stuntdude Steve Boyum and written by that same guy Jim Herzfeld, who wrote Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. I don't know what to tell this guy but stop introducing us to totally lame people.Meet the Deedles was made during that totally lame time in Disney's history when they thought every kid in America was into surfing, so they made, like, a ton of stupid movies centered around surfing. Boys got this travesty along with the Disney Channel movie Johnny Tsunami and girls got the network's original movie Rip Girls. I question the relevance and the purpose of the latter films' existence, but I hold optimism for them if I ever seek them out solely because they seem to be in English.Movies are supposed to be enjoyed. Meet the Deedles is a movie to be endured. And that's just not gnarly, man. An apology to the surfer community and the filmmakers of Bill and Ted is in order.Starring Steve Van Wormer, Paul Walker, Robert Englund, Dennis Hopper, A. J. Langer, John Ashton, and M.C. Gainey.

The circus animals were the best actors there! And what a bad commercial for Yellowstone national park. They should sue the producers of this movie. Who said yes to this project in the first place? They must have known this movie didn't sell... Do yourself a favour. Buy all copies of this movie and recycle it. It doesn't belong anywhere.

At no point was I remotely interested in anything that was happening.  It's a real shame that Dennis Hopper appeared in such a horrible movie.  There is no reason for this movie to have been made.  The plot was incoherent and uninteresting, while the characters were undeveloped and dull.  It is the only film I've ever considered turning off in the middle.  This movie isn't worth the time it takes to go to the video store and look at it on the shelf.

I'm not going to waste my time commenting on such a travesty, so I'll sum it up in two words this sucks.Disney deserved this one to bomb, it blows me away that they managed to spend so much money making it. Completely incompetent, humorless filmmaking, actually surprising considering the source.  And I didn't think Dennis Hopper could do worse than Space Truckers... well I was sure wrong.

But somehow it all falls into place and makes this one of the funniest films I've seen in quite some time.It stars Paul Walker of Fast and the Furious, fame, basically running around doing silly things, as a make-up-less Freddy Kruger tries to stop him.Watch it.

So, the movie didn't have the best plot...so, it was kinda lame at times...that's true. But I mean, Paul Walker's amazing, PERIOD, whether he's in a stupid movie or not. So, if you like him AT ALL, don't hesitate to see it. Besides, I'm sure you'll find yourself laughin at times, even if you don't wanna admit it.

I kept wanting it to end after about 1/2 way through it. It starts off pretty good, but then, it really fails. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you like stupid movies like this. I maybe smiled one or twice, but all around, this wasn't very funny.Waste of Time. 1.5/5  "},{"Title":"Paul Walker!","Date":"13 July 2005","Score":"6 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" I was a kid when I first saw it, but when it was on TV a couple years ago I realized how confusing it was because they're twins and you think both of them are equally hot, but Stew has the best hair, but Phil is better because the ranger girl wants to go out to the forest to eat worms (like the gross white maggot kinds!), but Phil put gummy worms out instead so he doesn't have to kiss a girl with worm-breath.That was the nicest thing ever!It's pretty wild how Phil Deedle grew up to become Paul Walker and the other guy was in Bubble Boy or something. Paul Walker is pretty hot and you can tell he's smart cuz he helped figure out about the P-Dogs. Petey the P-Dog was cute, but not the same way Paul Walker is!

Some are just lame (the recent 'Star Wars' movies), others are so bad they're actually good ('Xanadu'), and there's that rare abomination that's just too horrid for words. Folks, this is 'Meet the Deedles'. This movie isn't even worth a lengthy review, except that it truly must be seen to believe. I sat through it ONCE when it was on TV, never again.Oh it made me laugh all right, but not in the way it was supposed to. I just couldn't believe this movie was actually MADE. Let me put it to you this way Take the most horrible thing that's ever happened to you, and keep on multiplying it by a thousand. 'Meet the Deedles' is even worse than that....This movie just plain terrified me. It's not even worth renting, unless you just love self torture.

Seriously. I was watching it and about every 5 minutes Paul Walker would say something that would make my head feel like I was about to have an aneurysm. Do not watch this if you have any congenital heart defects. Or you will die. Or have diarrhea. Paul Walker is such a bad actor. Did you see that movie with Steve Zahn and that semi-truck? That semi-truck was the best actor in that movie and if he had been in this movie he would have been the best actor in this movie too. Only watch this movie if you have an IQ under 60. If you watch this movie with an IQ over 60, you will watch the credits with an IQ under 60. I can't do math anymore. "},{"Title":"P U !
