[{"Title":"Enormously entertaining b-grade sci fi thriller with an awesome body count!","Date":"8 May 2003","Score":"57 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Horror","Review":"  'The Hidden' is one of those movies you might easily pass by on first glance, assuming it's just your standard 1980s b-grade trash. The thing is it's FANTASTIC 1980s b-grade trash! This is one of the most entertaining sci fi thrillers you'll ever see, and lovers of cinematic violence will be thrilled by its body count, which is one of the highest you'll see outside a Hong Kong action movie. Michael Nouri ('Flashdance'... yeah, I know) is a cop tailing an average guy who has seemingly snapped and turned into a homicidal maniac. He is teamed with a kooky FBI agent ('Blue Velvet's Kyle MacLachlan) who knows a lot more than he lets on. Very quickly Kyle goes all 'Starman' on us, and Nouri soon realizes that he's actually on the trail of an extraterrestrial psycho who is taking over people's bodies so he can go on a rampage of murder, car theft, fatty foods and heavy metal music! So okay, this isn't the most cerebral movie in the world but I defy anybody not to have a ball watching it! The supporting cast includes Claudia Christian ('Babylon 5') as a foxy looking stripper, Clu Gulager ('The Killers') as Nouri's superior, and even a blink and you'll miss it cameo from future tough guy legend Danny Trejo ('From Dusk Til Dawn',etc.) as a convict. 'The Hidden' is a non-stop action ride, and the cheesiest 1980s fun this side of 'Maniac Cop'. Highly recommended.

Exactly what the name implies. It's like searching for a diamond in a pile of coal. There are a lot of stupid, inane sci-fi action pics out there with some boring spin on the alien possession story, but this movie has something that those lack. Compelling characters. What, you say? A character study in sci-fi? Well, yes and no. It is as far away from a after-school TV drama, but the characters do have depth and they aren't cookie board cut-outs. Kyle MacLachlan, before his dark days of showgirls, and Michael Nouri(Flashdance) star in this buddy-cop film, on the track of a killing-spree that seems to change with different humans. This film is a taught, well acted story. Sometimes creepy, sometimes genuinely funny. The score, although definitively 80s, complements the film with subtle overtones that enhance the viewing experience. A very good film that has a fair amount of blood and gore, but does not revolve around those genre staples. Overall, it's a safe bet for a good time. Watch it with someone you love.

It's a fast- paced account of normal people taking turns being inhabited by an alien being and suddenly turning into out-of-control killing machines. It guess it kind of sounds dumb, but seeing it is better than describing it. The characters in here are wild.Kyle MacLachlan plays his normal mid-80s strange character, a la Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, etc. Here, he is the FBI agent....or is he?On the first viewing I found Michael Nouri's role as too abrasive, taking away from some of the fun of viewing this, but, in future viewings he was more tolerable. What also helps this film is a little bit of humor thrown in here and there. It will probably wind up as a cult classic.

It's the sort of film that gives low budget science fiction a good name, one that effortlessly combines a sharp view of society together with the brisk pace of 'The Terminator' (1984)At one level, 'The Hidden' is a film about acquisition, by implication digging at the American Dream. The aliens acquire human bodies, much as humans might go shopping, casually discarding one form for another when it is worn out or no longer wanted. The possessed Jonathan P. Miller sees a ghetto blaster on display, takes it after clubbing the salesman to death. A little later on, after viewing the Ferrari just sold to a arms and antique dealer, he states glibly 'I want that car'. Its new owner has just mused 'Do I trade in my Mercedes or just hang on to it?' (his white suit ironically anticipating imminent mortality.) Later, in his final incarnation as Senator Holt,like a child who has made its mind up, the alien can announce just as decidedly and without any sense of irony 'I want to be President'. Power in American politics can be 'bought' just as easily as a cassette player, its accession just an impulsive decision by the strong. Apart from the scheming necessary to exchange bodies, what is most disturbing about this invasion is its relative guilelessness, how the alien 'Sees something. He takes it.' Other SF films might offer up a plan to be defeated; 'The Hidden' replaces galactic conquest with ghastly cupidity. Kyle MacLachlan makes an excellent Lloyd Gallagher, a weird 'FBI' presence instantly suggesting that of Agent Dale Cooper, whom he was to play 3 years later. MacLachlan had previously only appeared in two other Lynch productions  'Dune' (1984) and, more notably, 'Blue Velvet' (1986). Sholder was quick to take advantage of MacLachlan's quirkiness and androgynous appearance, ideal for a part in which ambivalence and social disorientation are essential. There's a faint echo too of 'The Man Who Fell to Earth' (1976) in this character separated from his loved ones, a lonely survivor on Earth. The title of 'The Hidden' refers most obviously to the invader lurking within humans, only emerging to swop bodies. But there's something else, equally hard to see, and only gradually expressed the emotional link which binds kind and kin. The recognition of these ties is one of the film's most rewarding aspects. Beck's home and family life are both a new, and a familiar, experience to Gallagher. His question 'Your little girl. She is very special to you?' is both na√Øve and affirmative, a means to assign the value of such relationships in a way initially quite lost on Beck. 'Gallagher's melancholia predominates during his visit to the Detective's home (despite the humorous nature of his indigestion). His sense of loss, which overshadows so much of his mood is only finally resolved in the last scene, as 'Beck' is welcomed back to life by his daughter.Men, a woman, even a dog, are all possessed by the alien before it ends up as the Senator. Both the bespectacled de Vries ('that Jack - kinda quiet. What'd he do? Rob a bank?') and the sedentary Miller are ostensible squares, mild-mannered citizens whose ensuing transgressions are completely out of character. Even the police Lieutenant, one of the alien's last victims, apparently lives alone with his dog. Their violent actions are faintly ludicrous, even to the point of raising nervous laughter. When Miller smashes the radio playing 'I believe in sunshine', after glaring at it with alien incredulity for a long moments, it invariably raises a chuckle in the audience, as does his belching in the diner. Far more of a frisson is created by the take-over of the stripper. Her already aggressive on-stage sexuality, and existing control over the patrons has been supplemented by something far more dangerous. To a (largely male?) audience, this is female empowerment brought home with a vengeance, her cool return of the gaze unnerving.Sholder's uneven career contains at least one other good film. 1201 (1993) is an effective and amusing variation on the 'Groundhog Day' theme co-starring Martin Landau. Others are best passed over in silence. It may well be that and 'The Hidden' will remain his best work, as they still play well and remains fresh on repeated viewings. A sequel to the present film followed, by a different director, but it was not in the same league.

The picture zips along, whether with speedy car chases or interesting suspense, keeping the audience on their toes. We can credit director Sholder for keeping things exciting but I also suspect this was one those scripts that wasn't tampered with much (which is as it should be for most scripts, but isn't in Hollywood). For sheer level of entertainment as a sci-fi thriller, this approaches Terminator (84) - the one to beat. Some of the premise is similar, featuring an unstoppable menace. You're always guaranteed an adrenaline rush with scenes of cops firing their weapons repeatedly at someone who just won't fall down; they may slow him or it down, perhaps stagger it, but in the end they need something more than just bullets.This pic represents a fortunate confluence of personnel and events. The two lead actors, MacLachlin & Nouri, had just reached their respective peaks in their careers and both were at the top of their game (both careers went into downswing afterward but it can't be blamed on this film). In fact, I'd venture that this film contains both their best roles. Nouri is the strong-willed earth-man cop and MacLachlan takes full advantage of his unusual persona to play an alien visitor (sort of like Jeff Bridges in Starman/1984, but Bridges had to try harder). The supporting cast are all great too, with many having to play two versions of themselves. Who can forget Christian as an exotic dancer suddenly gone gun-crazy? There's a lot of inherent humor in such scenes. The best and most memorable must be the one with Boyett acquiring a Ferrari in his own alien style. Just unforgettable.Unfortunately, there was a forgettable and quite awful sequel several years later. But this remains one of the most unique, vivid alien visitor/invader films of the eighties and nineties.

It seems that some strange alien entity is invading the bodies of otherwise mild-mannered civilians, taking over their minds and wrecking all out war on society. This extra-terrestrial monster likes fast cars, heavy metal music, and destructive acts of terrorism just for the fun of it, a premise that seems like retread, but was quite fresh during this era of slam-bang action flicks. Audiences will be amused at the sights of normal looking people rampaging about on the unsuspecting public of America. Boyish looking Kyle Maclachlan is another good alien inhabiting the body of an F.B.I. agent who teams up with cop, Michael Nouri to destroy the evil E.T before it can jump from body to body and wipe out the inferior human race. This is exactly the kind of film that defined the science fiction/action genre during the 1980s, with just the right amount of comic relief to keep things on an even spread. Jack Sholder directs with a keen sense of humor and pacing, and the cast lives it up playing tough but believable characters. Some of the material seems quite vague at times, such as Maclachlan's connection with Nouri's daughter that is never explained, and its short on logic, but who needs total coherence in an action flick such as this. It never stops short of giving the audience what it came for.

Five kills in the first killing scene - camera shows it took place on fifth street. There's an elevator scene in which the floor selected indicates the latest current count. Some are pretty subtle, you have to notice the time on the clock or maybe a hospital room number or something like that, but look for a number to appear after each killing or series of killings, and you'll find it.

Directed by B-movie maverick Jack Sholder, it combines elements from many a distant film genres - science fiction, horror, the buddy movie and '30s-style film-noir, fused together with some sly social satire on Ronald Reagan-era American excess and consumerism - and what we get is one weird hybrid of camp and B-movie sci-fi greatness.That is not to that this film is anywhere near bad. It is actually quite good, even with an utterly preposterous script that may make this one of the most uniquely original sci-fi films to come out of the late '80s.The film's plot concerns the hunt for a killer in Los Angeles. This killer has a taste for fast cars, loud music, and violence. Tom Beck (Michael Nouri) is the L.A. homicide detective put on the case. Matters are complicated when a mysterious FBI man named Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) shows up and assigns himself to the case, and he soon informs Beck that this killer is not what he seems to be on the outside. (In fact, there's A LOT more to this killer than what he seems to be on the outside.)It seems that on the inside, this killer is actually an alien parasite that has embarked on what could best be described as an intergalactic crime spree. (How it got here and where it came from is never explicitly stated in the film.) This alien, a nasty, slippery-slither slug-type thing that looks like what you might find swimming around in the Toxic Avenger's toxic cesspool, has the ability to assume the physical identity of its host. And on a host-hopping crime spree through Los Angeless, said alien plays (and preys) on American tastes with a wicked streak.I have to say again that The Hidden is one of the most uniquely original sci-fi films to come out of the '80s. Even if the film is prone to genre conventions (buddy cop movie conventions), it doesn't lose itself in those conventions. In fact, it uses the buddy cop genre to turn itself on its head somewhat it turns out that Gallagher is not what he seems to be on the outside either, and that he is in fact an intergalactic policeman/bounty hunter looking to stop this nasty alien invader dead in its tracks.There are also plenty of cool-looking special effects that suffice this film's low budget. The most astonishing of which is the alien invader itself, and the disgusting ways it's able to move from host to host. (You have to give it to the filmmakers that any visiting alien invader would get swept up in the materialistic excess and violence of 1987. Said visitor could easily mistake that this is the way humans live and when an outsider begins doing it, we have no way to deal with the problem - this is where that sly social satire comes in.) There's also some cool intergalactic weaponry, and plenty of scenes of explosive violence to remind us that this is pure '80s excess of the highest degree.The Hidden has amassed a pretty big cult following in the time since its release all the way back in 1987. I seriously hope that this is one genre classic that doesn't get the big Hollywood remake treatment any time soon.8/10 "},{"Title":"Suspense; with a twist!!!","Date":"20 February 2004","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Horror","Review":"  I REALLY liked this movie.

Everyone who's ever made some stupid, crappy, sci-fi action flick filled with lame characters, lifeless dialog and a plot that would insult the intelligence of a labradoodle should watch this film and be ashamed.Tom Beck (Michael Nouri) is a Los Angeles detective confronted with an unusual crime spree. A seemingly law abiding citizen has committed a rash of robberies and murders. After one final bank robbery and a high speed chase, Beck and the other cops blast the suspect with shotguns and blow up his car. But as he lies dying in the hospital, the suspect just sits up as though nothing is wrong. He goes over to the man in the next bed, props open his mouth, and a disgusting black creature crawls out of the suspect and into the other man. The suspect collapses dead and the other man sits up and despite serious illness, walks out of the hospital and starts his own crime spree. Beck teams up with an oddly serene FBI agent named Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) and discovers that the murdering criminal he's chasing is an alien that possesses other creatures to take whatever he wants and kill anyone who gets in his way.This is a very good piece of entertainment. Most of the 1980s power rock music in it hasn't aged well but other than that, there's very little wrong and a lot right with it.To begin with, it's a genuinely clever idea. Alien who comes to Earth to make trouble is an old standby, but explaining why he's here and what he does by casting him as a simple criminal motivated by base desires is really clever. It grounds the sci-fi aspects of the story in something real and also elevates the cop vs. crook action story elements and takes them in a new direction.The writing lives up to the potential of that concept. It creates a lean, fast moving story and logically moves from point to point with an absolute minimum of exposition. Too many movies are filled with characters telling you what's going on in the story. Like all really good films, The Hidden shows you what's going on. You can see what the characters are like by how the behave, not what they say. And it doesn't explicitly explain everything that happens in the story. It gives you just enough information and allows the audience to figure stuff out for themselves. The writing also gives the characters enough to do besides serving the plot to flesh them out as real people, without being obvious about it.The acting in The Hidden is also quite noteworthy. Michael Nouri plays the heroic cop to a tee without lapsing into self-aware parody or trying to make the guy smarter or tougher than a real cop would be. The audience also knows a lot more about what's going on than Tom Beck does and Nouri handles that challenge perfectly. It's awful easy for a character to come off as stupid when the story allows the audience to be a step or two ahead of him, but Nouri keeps you engaged with Beck and concerned about him even though you know things he hasn't figured out. The Hidden also features one of the great performances of Kyle MacLachlan's career. I'm not sure anyone's ever played alien impersonating a human quite this well, behaving just differently enough to be noticeable but still letting relatable and understandable emotions come through. William Boyett also deserves praise as he spends the most time on screen portraying the evil alien in a human body. Again, he manages to be just enough off from a normal person to be noticeable without being over the top. He's also charged with telling us things about the alien through his actions instead of words and he pulls it off.Another noteworthy part of The Hidden is its level of restraint. Yes, there are bloody shootings, explosions, strippers with shotguns, hideously burned corpses and disgusting alien slugs but this isn't a movie that's trying to shock you. It's not about going over the top or assaulting you with craziness and disturbing imagery. It has a certain subtlety to it, which is not something you often find in sci-fi action flicks. Though, the fact it's probably the only R rated movie in history to have a scene in a strip club where the stripper never takes off her shirt is taking that whole subtlety thing too far.The Hidden proves that a film about an alien slug who loves fast cars, loud music and goes on a killing spree in Los Angeles can be just as smart and as good as any other movie. It doesn't use the fact that it's science-fiction as an excuse to suck.

If you expect that The Hidden will be boring, bad acting will ruin it, Jack Sholder (Director) doesn't know how to make movies, then it shows that your predicament will definitely be wrong and that's (of course) by a mile. Kyle Maclachlan plays the (SPOILER!!!) quite Altairan who is on Earth to eradicate a fellow alien that takes over human bodies and unleashes evil with it. Michael Nouri is quite the opposite, he is confident in the way he talks, moves, argues, and he surely doesn't back down from a fight. The action in this film never gets depleted because chasing an alien who unleashes hell has to result in a major catastrophe and there will definitely be action in it. The scene which looked fake was probably when the Lieutenant shot the rocket launcher making the flames look really fake. An old Danny Trejo is in this but makes a cameo role, a very small role indeed. Car lovers will see some old-fashioned Ferrari's and an alien who wants one of them but doesn't know how.After an alien in an human body causes havoc in America, FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher and police officer Tom Beck team up to kill the trespasser and stop people from being controlled. As the film progresses you find out a lot of things about your two officers and one of them is not what we think. The story is really great because you can watch the last thirty minutes of the movie and still understand the full story.I really liked the story in this film and it's one of those rare stories that captivate me. The acting is not bad either and the alien looks very cool, nothing like we imagined. Horror is my favorite genre and many people say that this is scary but it is clearly not. How can blowing up stuff be scary? I am really surprised that only five thousand people voted for the film because there should have been more votes for this likable masterpiece. The humorous scene in this movie is when (SPOILER!!!) the dog knocks out the fat guy by bumping his head against the refrigerator. Hilarious! Any film critic or movie lover will like this film since it is already a cult favorite among many viewers.

Viewers will also be impressed with the amount of bloodletting, the enjoyable special effects, and the extremely high body count. The car chase is proof of this, and the filmmakers also decide to throw political correctness right out the window in terms of casualties. MacLachlan and Nouri get a good odd couple chemistry going, with the cagey Lloyd, obviously knowing more than anyone right from the get go, driving Beck right up the wall. Among the supporting cast, we have foxy Claudia Christian as a stripper, Clarence Felder (A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child) and Clu Gulager (The Return of the Living Dead) as Beck's superiors, Ed O'Ross (Red Heat), Richard Brooks ('Law and Order'), and Larry Cedar (Twilight Zone The Movie, Dreamscape) as Beck's colleagues, Chris Mulkey (Ghost in the Machine) as bank robber Jack DeVries, William Boyett (When a Stranger Calls '79, Bloody Birthday) as ailing Jonathan Miller, and in smaller parts the likes of Lin Shaye, James Luisi, Duane Davis, Joseph Whipp, Jack McGee, Ted White, Branscombe Richmond, and Danny Trejo in one of his frequent pre-stardom jailbird parts. (Hey, hippie! What kind of dude are you?) Never, ever boring and always amusing, The Hidden rockets along with one entertaining sequence after another. And in addition to everything else, this is a movie with real heart that doesn't lose sight of its characters' emotions. It's clearly a fan favourite, which is entirely understandable as it's one movie that deserves a loyal following. It even got itself a(n apparently quite inferior) sequel seven years later. It's a career highlight for all involved, and holds up quite well on repeat viewings. Eight out of 10.

But in essence the basic plot is slightly skewed toward horror rather than sci-fi.Speaking of plot, the opening scene is a violent bank robbery, followed by a high speed car chase that even includes the car running through the pane of glass held by two guys, and a shootout which ends with the action movie staple, the car that explodes when shot (even though the cops were seemingly aiming at the perp). Despite the clich√© it actually isn't a bad scene.We are then introduced to the lawman Tom Beck who says that the bad guy went on a two week crime spree and is apparently about to die from the wounds from both gunshots and the explosion. He is then introduced to Lloyd Gallagher, an FBI man played by Kyle McLachlan who nonetheless needs to meet the criminal straight away.As you probably haven't heard about the film I'll try to minimise the description, but it is obvious early on that the criminal is being hosted by an alien being, who is able to transfer from one human to the next, as long as the new body is basically dead (not a positive sign if his host body is desperate to move!) Actually the coolest part of the film is the transfer process, though it is not pretty.The host seems to be the ultimate consumer, while he is in possession of the body he lives by the mantra drive it like you stole it, he eats what he wants, steals what he needs and for most of the flick conveniently carries his own dodgy 80‚Ä≤s soundtrack with him, the only recognisable song being from Aussie outfit Hunters and Collectors.Even though after about 30 minutes you have a fair handle on how this will end this Alien/Terminator rip-off adds enough to entertain, with a fair bit of action peppered with a little sci-fi and a teaspoon of horror.Equally entertaining is the pick that 80‚Ä≤s bit part guy, I saw actors from King Pin, Red Heat and The Last Boy Scout and I'm sure there are many others.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10. Not a bad 80‚Ä≤s B movie.

As dated as a lot of flicks from that era were, many of them have the all-important re-watchability factor. While many are fun to re-watch just to make fun of them, there are a lot that I think still hold up because of elements that will always be important to films plot, dialogue, and character. THE HIDDEN is one of them on such film. A modern B sci-fi action flick, it is hardly forgettable and actually has a lot of truth in it. THE HIDDEN is in the vein of 50s sci-fi like THE THING or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS that have now attained cult status. THE HIDDEN is the 80s version of those films and I think it's one of the best of its kind ever. THE HIDDEN starts off with a bang, literally, as a fast-driving criminal Jack DeVries (played by Chris Mulkey, who solidly sets the tone for the rest of the film) crashes into a bank, robbing it, then ends up in a police standoff. He is killed and the cops find out that he had no prior criminal record and was a mild-mannered insurance salesman before he went nuts. The next lunatic is a businessman Jonathan Miller (wonderfully done by William Boyett) who acts just like DeVries did driving fast, playing loud music and committing criminal acts for no apparent reason.Enter FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan in a brilliantly realized portrayal) who is on the trail of DeVries and Miller, telling the cops that they were accomplices. The lead cop investigating this strange series of events is Tom Beck (stalwart, solid performance by Michael Nouri). Gallagher and Beck team up to track down Miller, who Gallagher says killed his wife, child, and his partner. Turns out that there is really only one killer, an alien that moves from body to body, first DeVries, and after he is killed, then Miller, and Gallagher is an alien, too, looking to stop it. Miller has a heart ailment and the alien can't survive inside an unhealthy human host, so it leaves Miller and enters the body of a stripper Brenda (played by the seductive and sultry Claudia Christian). The scene where Gallagher finally confronts the alien (in the body of Brenda) is exciting, tense, and pulse-pounding. Gallagher kills Brenda, but reveals to Beck that he is an alien and the alien killer is still out there somewhere and must be stopped.Branding Gallagher a lunatic, Beck locks him up. The killer had left Brenda's body and entered the body of a dog belonging to Gallagher's superior Lt. Masterson (played by Clarence Felder). The alien inhabits Masterson and then goes after Gallagher in the jail, a truly memorable, exciting scene. Now Beck believes him and they set out to stop the alien! It's amazing how this movie slipped through the cracks of 1980s action flicks. It's close to as good as some of the best of the 80s (TERMINATOR, ROBOCOP, DIE HARD, LETHAL WEAPON) and has elements of all those films, but does not feel like a ripoff at all. What's really stunning is how believable all the actors (Mulkey, Boyett, Christian, Felder) are at playing the same alien character. They all make you believe it is one alien. In addition to the cast mentioned, Clu Gulager as Lt. Flynn (Gallagher's other superior) and Katherine Gannon as Barbara Beck (Beck's wife) are fine as well. The pacing is perfect, the dialogue solid, effective, and memorable and the action is well-directed and exciting. THE HIDDEN is a classic!

Besides the plot and the great action scenes, what really elevates it above the typical B movie is the humor and the quality of the acting...Typically, this genre piece would've starred Chuck Norris and Dolph Lundgren or something along those lines, but instead, we get McLachlan and Nouri, and they infuse a reality into the scenes that your typical monotone actor can't dream of. Even minor characters have good moments... Plus, I have a theory that any movie with Ferarris and hot girls is a masterpiece, and this movie didn't do any thing to shake my faith in this theory.

I went into seeing this thinking I would find some second-rate sci-fi film from the 1980s with second-rate special effects and second-rate acting, and a script that some one found as he/she stirred up the bottom of the tired, trite, and over-used scripts in Hollywood. Buy, was I wrong this film rocks - really. Kyle Mclachlan plays an FBI man going to a large Californian city(OK, I forgot!) to find a man who was responsible for killing the ones he loves. There he pairs up with Michael Nouri, a good cop with a nice family, and the two work together trying to find this killer who likes loud rock music, can be shot multiple times with little effect, and changes bodies when the host is about to die. You see the killer is from an alien world and uses human form to disguise itself. Trouble is this alien is selfish and self-centered, and what it wants when it wants it is its only concern. It steals cars, takes a boom-box, money from a bank, and so on. This is a layered sci-fi film that is both intelligent and explosive with regard to action and story. I really thought the movie was quite fascinating. MacLachlan and Nouri bring credibility to their roles Nouri as somewhat confident and normal, MacLachlan subtly strange in that way he can only do. The string of actors playing the alien all did fine jobs and this really is a treat for the unexpected or even predispositioned critical mindset.

Lots of kills, hot women, and a rather good body stealing plot which is a rarity for me to like as I usually do not care for the body invasion type movies. This one though does everything right considering it must have had a rather low budget and what not. A cop and an agent with a mystery team up to track down a killer alien that loves to swap out bodies and take new ones for a spin by killing and breaking the law. This alien brings the pain and after being shot repeatedly or when the body it is currently using gets to damaged it simply switches out to another host so it can continue the mayhem. The cops try to track it down, but it always finds a way out of trouble. The movie runs at a good pace and is rather exciting to watch, the budget shows at times as this film looks like it was made by one of those movie companies that does not exist anymore, still it has way more than enough to keep one entertained. You will recognize a couple of the stars as the lead guy was in a few movies in his day, the other movie role I know him from is Dune. With this movie though you will get your share of shooting and stuff and it is well worth a look see, unlike the sequel which in fact should remain hidden for no one to chance upon again.

So with that thought i went and found it, watched it and...wow. This is one of the best action/sci-fi movies that i saw. Opening of the movie with random guy shooting people in bank and then getting into intense police chase while running over everything and everyone on his way blew me off my feet. I didn't expect that kind of violence and action scenes will be the first thing to start the movie. For the rest of 90 minutes it had it all; action, violence, suspense, humor, bits of drama, plot being changed from alien wanting to have fun to alien wanting to be president... After i finished watching it, i knew that this has become one my favorites. But what bugged me is how almost nobody from my friends and colleagues knew about this movie. Looking up about it on internet, i was surprised to see how originally it was almost unnoticed during its theatrical run. But what was nice to see is all the fans that it got over the years. Reading many good online reviews about this movie has only helped to make me love it even more. Although i personally don't think that every single movie that i or anybody else loves to death deserved better, The Hidden really did deserved a lot more. It's awesome, 100% fun movie that never gets boring. Come on, you have alien who likes heavy metal rock and ferrari's, you have another alien trying to stop him, and in between two of them a hardcore cop who can't figure out what the hell is going on in his city. About the actors; everyone do their job right. There isn't single one that does it half good or quite bad. I really enjoyed buddy cop chemistry that Gallagher and Beck had, and much of it is because of the actors Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Nouri. As for other known faces, it's was nice to have Ed O'Ross (Red Heat) and Clu Galager (Return Of The Living Dead) in supportive, but important roles. Script is well written and it has good,and quite often very funny dialogue. Plot is very interesting and with the way it's happening through the movie, you could say that it's realistic and another thing that helps with that is some of the reactions of characters on certain parts. Action scenes are top notch. Nothing blockbuster-spectacular, but still entertaining and quite surprising in places. Plenty of car chases and shootouts for action fans, that's for sure. Special effects; As far as blood and gore goes, just fine. But one thing that should be mentioned is great and creepy effect early in the movie where alien goes from one body into another. Not only that it looks cool, but it looks real,specially for the time when movie was made, and it's not created by CGI at all. Movies today should really have more of these practical special effects. Score - Solid. Creepy, tense, and when needed, even sad in places. Soundtrack - Awesomeness to the bone. From opening car chase/carnage till ending credits, pure 80's. My fave songs are Weapons Of Love and Hidden by The Truth, Still In Hollywood, Haunted Head and Over Your Shoulder by Concrete Blonde, On Your Feet and Go Down Fighting by Shock Paris. You can't love this movie without mentioning On Your Feet that plays during opening pursuit. I love that song ever since i first saw The Hidden. Few times when i was playing GTA i would play this song in the background while running from cops or running over everything in my way just like alien in the movie. What more to say but great, fun and very underrated movie that thankfully has its fans, and it's good to see that it is still mentioned amongst some movie lovers here and there even today. Something that i wanted to mention; I watched The Hidden as a double feature two times. First time i watched it with Wes Craven's Shocker, and second time with Dolph Lundgren movie I Come In Peace (1992).

This movie easily holds its own against other Sci-Fi flicks because the acting is really, really good.MacLachlan's performance really seems to get better every time I see the movie. Nouri's acting gets better with age as well primarily because it provides a great contrast to MacLachlan.Its been a couple of years (at least) since I last saw this movie and I really enjoyed seeing it again.

The opening hook car chase is phenomenally filmed. It is comprised of a bank robber trying to flee from the pursuing LAPD only to end up face to face with a road block of cops with 12 gauge shotguns. There is a first person POV shot as the car comes over the rise and we see the massive wall of cops and their roadblock......I loved that.Jack Sholder does a lot of 1st person POV cuts in his films. Anyhow, this film was produced during the heyday of NEW LINE CINEMA's breakout from it's small studio in the mid 1980's. They made a slew of genre sci-fi, action, and horror films, (ie. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) and eventually, went on to bigger and better things. (ie. DUMB AND DUMBER etc. etc.) This film was one of those films produced. THE HIDDEN, was imitated on tv shows and in later films profusely (ie. I COME IN PEACE). Imitation, it has been said is the best forms of flattery. This is a film that was ingenious, yet, still didn't take itself too seriously. It had a dark, sly, humor to it, and even managed to mock a few action movie plot conventions and lines. The acting was good and the producers and writer gave us characters that weren't bland. The plot is simple a alien police officer pursues a evil alien entity to this planet that can assume different human hosts...wreak havoc in the host body and then discard the body and find a new host.  There are lots of car chases and gun fights and MICHAEL NOURI, just loves to use his hands when he says his lines, but all in all this is a FINE film. This is one I love to watch again, and again. Of note is the fact, that it was written by legendary LA screenwriter, JIM KOUF under the pen name BOB HUNT. Only when the film was re-released, on video in a collectors edition back in 1996, did he have his real name restored to the credits. It is unclear why he did this.

This may be called a B-movie (which it may be, but only because of quite cheap effects), but it surely is better than some first grade movies. What you get with this movie is a solid sci-fi/mystery/suspense/action movie with enough body count for those who care about it. What you also get is solid acting, a cop buddy story which is not too much stereotypically, a strange but likable MacLachlan character and for those who grow up in the 80ties, a d√©j√† vu not only with MacLachlan, but also with Nouri and Claudia Christian, which most will best know from B5.The best thing about this movie in my view is the fact, that the real story, the reason for the chase and especially the true face of MacLachlan's character are revealed very subtle, just so much that you notice that there could be something weird but not so much that it becomes too obvious. It's not a blatant uncovering of the real, underlying motives, which gives a touch of mystery in all the action, too.So, The Hidden gets seven out of ten from me; this makes it clearly above average in a ten star rating where you have to give one star so that 5 and 6 are the average (little below/little above). I would give eight stars if the ending (the kill of the bas add) wouldn't be a little weak and the effects would be better. But seven is okay and everybody with an inclination for such type of movies can easily watch this movie, he/she won't regret it.

This is a great sci-fi/horror picture.  It gets off to a great start with a stockbroker robbing a bank, taking off in a black Ferrari and leading the cops on a great chase.  Said stockbroker is shot by police after crashing through a roadblock and whilst in the intensive care unit, a black slug creature slithers out of his body and possesses the body of another patient.  This patient then goes out on a crime spree, just like the stockbroker had done.  Around this time, mysterious FBI agent Kyle MacLachlan teams up with local cop Michael Nouri to try and track down the killer.  There is more to MacLachlan than meets the eye as well.  It's certainly not every day you meet an evil alien hooked on rock music, sports cars and sex (but world domination is on it's agenda as well) and that's one thing that makes this movie so fun.  It's got great music, two great car chases and great performances from MacLachlan and Nouri.

There are no pretentious marks here or anything meaningful about it, as it knows what is and plays it accordingly with the absurd material to deliver jam-packed action and morbidly witty humour. This hybrid Sci-fi / cop film follows the same-old-same-old trend of buddy flicks of the 80s, but adding its own unique spin to the recipe of an alien invasion that the authorities must face. This inter-galactic concept resulted in many copies (Dark Angel 90, Peacemaker 90 and Split Second 92) and then followed by an insignificant sequel The Hidden II (1993). By far this is the best.At heart its appealingly passionate b-grade fun, but delivered with an aggressive punch that kicks you in the guts and clocks up healthy dose mayhem and startling jolts. Like mentioned the body count is high (!) and its relentlessly violent. The campy material is quite simple, despite its vague motivation and emotional input. The oddly sappy ending was rather disappointing. It manages to cook up spontaneous surprises and add onto the bigger picture surrounding the situation. Soaring in the rigid script is a large dose of wit and black humour that certainly raises a smirk. The technical production is high quality. A blisteringly hip rock soundtrack amongst the forebodingly yo-yo-like electronic music score makes a huge dent in the rapid mood. Frenetic camera-work stays on the move. Kevin Yagher's grotesque body hopping creature design looks top-notch and the make-up was equally up to scratch.The performances are very fitting with the style of the film. The crunching chemistry between Michael Nouri and Kyle MacLachlan click very well and the underfoot banter amongst them rolls off successfully. Nouri as the dry, no-bull cop Beck, is superb and MacLachlan kills it as the strangely space-out FBI agent Gallagher.

I hate that film with a passion. However, Sholder worked with New Line and Bob Shaye on two other occasions and those films were actually good and he showed promise as a director. The first film was 1982's Alone in the Dark. The second was The Hidden. In The Hidden, Kyle MacLachlan stars as an F.B.I. agent (we think) on the trail of an otherworldly criminal. Said criminal is a nasty, little creature who hops from one body to another to stay one step ahead of his pursuer (Claudia Christian, Ed O'Ross, and Chris Mulkey play three of these bodies). He also loves heavy metal and fast cars. My kind of alien. MacLachlan's character enlists Detective Tom Beck (Michael Nouri) to help him track down the galactic menace. What follows is a damn entertaining ride of science fiction, action, and horror. This is a relatively low budget feature, but you can't tell that by looking at the screen. There are explosions, car crashes (Ferrari's no less), superb creature effects, and an excellent cast. Along with everyone I've mentioned, The Hidden also features Clu Gulager, Richard Brooks, Larry Cedar, Lin Shaye, and even pop-up appearances by Branscombe Richmond and Danny Trejo. The Hidden has become a cult classic for many good reasons, even more than I've listed here. So I can happily recommend this Jack Sholder feature. However, stay FAR away from the sequel.

This is an action/science fiction mash up from the 80's, starring Lynch alumni Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Nouri and B-movie diva Claudia Christian. This sounds like the perfect cast for a Tarantino movie, just add Sizemore or Michael Madsen. Danny Trejo (who makes a cameo here) will be the common link. It is definitely a hidden gem for those that know about it.I can remember watching this movie on Cinemax in the middle of the week, around the early afternoon. It was always in the 330 - 400 PM slot. It is not overly ambitious, yet the end product has infinite replayability. The soundtrack is a combination of stock 80's music (which sounds cheesy, catchy and quite indicative of the period) and some synthetic alien sounds. I can compare this movie to Alien Nation, I Come in Peace, Dead Heat, Total Recall, the Running Man, the 6th Day, My Best Friend is a Vampire (another catchy 80's soundtrack) and even the Peacemaker (which strangely enough has a similar plot, just a different type of alien). The main elements throughout all of them is the buddy cop/tag team concept, occurring in unusual situations (for example, with aliens, postmortem, clones,etc). They are a somewhat of a guilty pleasure, but still not as guilty as after you have downed 3 double shots of Southern Comfort, before watching this movie (my new rating system). While the shots are not necessary for the pain or enjoyment of movie, it does pass the time.This is classic good guy, bad guy. There are cops and crooks. The twist is that it's a revenge/duty story about aliens (another world and not just across the border) in L.A. These aliens, like fast cars (Porsches and Ferraris), loud music, women and money. Who doesn't?, you're thinking. It's the 80's, when sealing the deal involved a drink and a snort. The concept of taking by force is not lost on the aliens. The plot is based in the detective procedure, in which a lot of gunfire appears to be a requirement. The progression of the plot is relatively brief, albeit logical (if not a bit visor-vision) and entertaining.I would attempt to figure out if there is any social commentary hidden in there, but who am I kidding. Thats why you were watching this movie on Cinemax, Tuesday afternoon, right after that nap on the coach. You aren't looking to relish in the human condition by empathically connecting to some talk show host. You want to be woken up by the sheer visual bloodlust and auditory force of the movie. Thankfully this movie has enough of that or rather enough gas to get you there comfortably and as quick as possible. The views are passable. It is perfect on lazy Saturday/Sunday afternoons as well. *Use with caution, as the results have a risk of dependency.

The hard bitten experienced local homicide detective is teamed up by his boss with the new-in-town FBI agent. First off, surely the cops wouldn't straight away have checked the FBI agent's credentials and discovered that in fact he was thought to have been burned up in a fire.The detective is asked to help with a particular murder suspect - which he promptly does, informing the FBI agent that the guy is in hospital and expected to die, which duly happens. You would think this would have been the end of the matter, but for some reason the detective then allows himself to continue to be used as a sidekick seemingly without good reason on a variety of other enquiries, starting with looking for a seriously ill guy who has suddenly gone missing from hospital. A quirky and interesting case yes, but hardly a priority for immediate homicide detective attention surely?But even when the body count is rapidly piling up, the detective seems to just accept that he isn't going to get any sensible answers about what is going on out of the FBI guy. Remember, this is a successful and experienced homicide detective we are talking about, surely he would be very experienced at questioning people effectively and would not allow himself to be fobbed off or his questions to just be evaded in this way.It isn't until quite late in the film and after going to about half a dozen murder scenes, and nearly getting killed himself, that he really tries to get to grips with things. 2. The ultimate weapon proves to be a flamethrower. The moment this was on screen in the police station early on in the film, being paraded for no good plot reason, I wondered when this was going to make an meaningful appearance in the film, and so it does near the end of the film. The good guy is under heavy fire but gets into position, gets out his flamethrower from a bag he is carrying and torches the bad guy. You would think the good guy wouldn't have been able to use the flamethrower long before someone exploded the thrower's gas tanks with a bullet, but conveniently everyone stops firing at the good guy while he uses his flame thrower. It has also to be asked, if the flamethrower was going to turn out to be this ultimate weapon, why oh why didn't the alien good guy think to use it earlier instead of trying to engage the bad guy throughout the film with a pistol which had as about as much effect as a pea shooter?Oh, and highly creepy ending too. The detective dies of bullet wounds in hospital, so the alien inside the FBI agent decides to jump bodies and then we see him at the end of the film trying to get the detective's daughter to accept that he really is okay as her dad, or something like that.That's creepy enough but goodness knows what the detective's wife will think when she finds out that her husband has had a total personality change; yet alone her horror and revulsion if she ever discovers that while her husband's body is still walking around, in fact he is dead and she is living and presumably sleeping with a stranger who also happens to be an alien and is controlling the functions of the dead body.

A sci-fi/cop flick hybrid, The Hidden is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. Nourri and MacLachlan are outstanding as the two cops. Nourri is a courageous, street tough do-gooder who is completely bewildered by the mild mannered F.B.I agent he finds himself teamed with.All of the clich√©s are in place but the straight forward embrace of the roles by the two principles and the excellent effort of the supporting cast leaves one with no motive to even begin to scoff. Timing is impeccable so that the notes of humor, suspense and moral message never sound jarringly off key or leave one to smirk when it is uncalled for or roll ones eyes in cynicism. The viewer is drawn into the bubble of suspended disbelief and held there throughout the fast pace of the film. This flick holds up remarkably well both in terms of plot and special effects (which are kept to a minimum as far as the sci-fi theme, full tilt, however, from the car chase, shoot-em-up cop side of the story)despite its ripe old age of 18 years.No plot summary is possible, there are too many twists and surprises that cannot be given away. However, when you're ready for some old school sci-fi escapism look on the classic rack for The Hidden, you will not be disappointed.

Basically, a police detective played by Michael Nouri, along with a supporting cast played by Richard Brooks, Ed O'Ross and B movie veteran Clu Galager, are at wit's end with an epidemic of violence. Seemingly normal citizens are going beserk and shooting up the city. Adding to Nouri's headache is a mysterious FBI agent (played by Twin Peaks star Kyle McLachlin) who seems to know more about the crime spree and its cause than he is letting on.The film features great car chases, exciting gun battles and even a surprise ending. It's not a spoiler to say that the hidden is actually an alien parasite that invades the body of its hosts. The parasite craves power, altering the pleasure sections of the brain and removing annoying things like morality and common sense. When the body is too damaged to continue, it simply leaps to another body.The film is actually an allegory on crime in America, especially drug use where seemingly normal people use drugs like cocaine to get high or use guns to feel powerful. Then, they literally change overnight and begin to do things they've never done before in order to maintain the high or feeling of power. All the victims in the film represent the hapless members of society who have to deal with these jackasses. Nouri and friends represent the police who do everything they can to stop the problem, but still find it's not enough.Overall, the film can be hard to follow. The sound on the tapes can be a little hard to hear at times, but just seeing Claudia Christian of Babylon 5 as a possessed stripper will make you overlook this flaw. She's dynamite, especially in the scene where she gets hot and heavy with a polyester-wearing pimp wannabe, who definitely doesn't die with a smile on his face.Oh, and beware. The Hidden was such a surprise hit that the producers unwisely made a sequel. Avoid it at all costs. Even with the surprise ending, this film doesn't need a sequel.

Same alien-cops-and-robbers-on-earth theme but the protagonist host is a young boy and the setting is a remote Pacific island.  Much more suspense and intrigue and originality (no alien weapons!) in the 'original' story. Think about it - how does a boy and his gelatinous host smoke out the bad guy? The processes of deduction, reasoning, and elimination are interesting.The movie is fun and is, in some ways, a commentary on U.S. culture in the late 20th century.  My guess is that a movie based on the original story could be a bigger hit than The Hidden.

The alien loves violence, crime, and apparently, cheesy 80's Power Metal. What a guy! But there's a catch! The alien hides inside the bodies of people--so you never know who he's gonna be! To make things fun, the ever-placid Kyle MacLachlan plays the other alien--the one hunting the criminal alien. He's teamed up with a street-tough cop who spends a lot of time thinking that the FBI agent-alien (MacLachlan) is merely some sort of lunatic. Here's the breakdownThe Good--Good acting and an interesting story, even if it was made to bring in the big bucks--violence, fast cars, cheesy Metal--these are just some of the clich√©'s of the 80's--and the movie is chock full of them.--Fairly realistic in it's execution, it's believable despite the cheesiness. The cop, Michael Nouri, behaves like one would expect.--MacLachlan and Michael Nouri make a good team--Nouri is the perfect counter for MacLachlan's generally stale demeanour--This is the only way I've ever seen this guy in movies!--Rampant gun violence!Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--The atmosphere is somewhat weak--almost the entire movie takes place in daylight.--Aside from the constant screeching Power Metal, the rest of the music is alright.--Car chases--love 'em or hate 'em--here they are--but at least with cool cars.--Decent cinematography.--Pretty good special effects when we see them.The Bad--I personally would've loved to see the alien a little more. But it's hidden, so nuts to that.--Some dialogue.The Ugly--When we see what the good-guy alien looks like. Oooo! A creature made of light particles!!Memorable Scene--The film's nice climax.Acting 8/10 , Story 8/10 , Atmosphere 5/10 , Cinematography 6/10 , Character Development 8/10 , Special Effects/Make-up 7/10 , Nudity/Sexuality 1/10 , Violence/Gore 8/10 (lots of violence) , Sets/Backgrounds 7/10 , Dialogue 8/10 , Music 7/10 , Writing 8/10 , Direction 8/10 , Cheesiness 3/10 , Crappiness 0/10 Overall 8/10 Well, there you have it.

Quite how this film has been out for nearly nineteen years without me even hearing of it is a mystery; but I've seen it now and I sure am glad that I did! The film starts as it means to go on, with an explosive bank robbery, followed by an entertaining and boisterous car chase! In the vein of The Terminator, The Hidden doesn't waste time on building it's characters too much or even explaining the plot - we just get what we're given, meaning that the film can focus all of it's attention on creating entertainment value - which, it's safe to say, it does rather well. The plot is reminiscent of several previous Sci-Fi films, but it doesn't matter because entertainment is the name of the game. We follow an extra terrestrial parasite, which jumps from body to body after the one it's currently occupying becomes too decrepit. The alien has a penchant for money, woman and fast cars; which soon catches the attention of the local police department. Tom Beck is put on the case, with FBI member Lloyd Gallagher in tow to help him out.The name on the cast list that stands out the most belongs to David Lynch's favourite muse, Kyle MacLachlan. MacLachlan is perfectly cast for his role in this movie, presenting just the right amount of weirdness for the audience to suspect that there might something more about his character. Michael Nouri joins him, and does well starring opposite him; and the only other name I recognised on the cast list belongs to Clu Gulager. The Hidden isn't the sort of movie that will affirm your life, make you think or reinforce anyone's argument that movies about more than entertainment; but it is exciting, it's lots of fun; and there's certainly nothing wrong with that! The plot isn't genius, but it plays out well and the special effects are rather nice also. Jack Sholder, director of the second Nightmare on Elm Street film and cult eighties hit 'Alone in the Dark' does an excellent job in the direction department, which the film owes much of its success to, and the music is right on cue, helping to enforce the fact that this is very much eighties trash. Overall, I liked this movie a lot and won't hesitate to recommend it!

Entertaining Sci-Fi horror.","Date":"21 July 2005","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Horror","Review":" The Hidden starts with black & white footage from a banks security camera as Jack DeVries (Chris Mulky) enters the bank, pulls a shotgun out & robs it. He makes his escape in a black Ferrari but Los Angeles finest are hot on his tail as they speed through the streets, eventually DeVries is brought to a halt when the cops shoot his Ferrari up. DeVries gets out of the car & is repeatedly shot, the Ferrari blows up. Lieutenant John Masterson (Clarence Felder) receives a visit from FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) who is looking for a suspect & requires a partner for a few days, Masterson gives him Detective Tom Beck (Micheal Nouri) who tells him that he recognises his suspect as Jack DeVries & he is lying in a hospital bed badly injured & will not make it through the night. Meanwhile at the hospital DeVries happens to have an alien inside him that can switch bodies, a patient named Jonathan Miller (William Boyett) in the next bed will do. The alien switches bodies & starts yet another crime spree, he steals another Ferrari, beats a shopkeeper to death, kills some-more people & most seriously plays loud music in a restaurant on his radio annoying everyone in there. All of this criminal activity filters back to Beck who is now told by Gallagher that their suspect is Miller. The alien continues to jump form body to body to evade detection, it becomes aware that an important Senator named Holt (John McCnn) who maybe the next President is in town & the alien likes the idea of being President of the United States...Directed by Jack Sholder I thought The Hidden was a decent film. The script by Jim Kouf moves along at a nice pace & never becomes boring or dull as it mixes various genres including Sci-Fi, horror & action. The aliens origins & motivations are left unclear & the taking over the Senator to become the next President sub plot feels like an afterthought that isn't really developed or used until the end but as the characters say in the film itself the alien commits these acts of violence 'because he likes it' & I guess because he can, when you think about it no other explanation is needed I suppose. The Ferrari car chase at the start is cool but the Ferrari never sustains any damage as it keeps hitting other cars, pedestrians & roadside objects but in the next wide shot the Ferrari is almost brand new again, there are some glaring continuity flaws & errors in this sequence. The Hidden also suffers from the usual 80's action clich√© where everyone is killed by the baddie except the two heroes whom it can't seem to shoot unlike everyone else for some reason. There are a few gunfights, the alien only makes two appearances & there isn't any explicit gore in The Hidden. I thought the ending was a bit sickly & overly happy, it felt like something out of a Disney film! I would have liked to have seen more of the stripper Brenda (Claudia Christian) who looked great in a mini-skirt & thigh high boots as she posed with big guns & engaged in firefights. Technically The Hidden is good with nice production values even if some of the optical effects look a bit crap compared to todays CGI & I thought the acting was pretty good as well especially Nouri as the likable Beck. Overall I thought The Hidden was a good solid, entertaining film that was an enjoyable way to spend 90 odd minutes but seemed a little silly at times & the plot was a bit sparse when all said & done. Definitely worth a watch though.

This late 80's sci-fi action thriller jumpstarts with a bang, the opening car chase is an absolute blast, ranking among the best I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, the movie slows down considerably afterward, with lots of plot exposition that leads nowhere.  To have an intriguing premise build up with virtually no thorough explanation for the situation is frustratingly unsatisfying.At least the second half picks up in the pacing, delivering another car chase (decent, but nowhere as exciting as the opening) and giving us three consecutive shootouts.  The highlight of these action scenes is definitely the hotel gun battle, a tense and pulse-pounding setpiece.  Machlachlan and Nouri both deliver good performances, making some of the more dialogue-heavy scenes watchable and even sometimes enjoyable.

For a thriller, there's not much in the tension factor, almost no suspense, and you have to wait for an hour to get a decent shootout.  This is the sort of low-budget sci-fi disaster that makes you wonder how this was even released in theaters in the first place.  The Hidden reeks of straight-to-video quality, and it's not even trashy enough to be entertaining on an it's-so-bad-it's-good level.Crimes begin to occur all around the city of Los Angeles.  Well-respected citizens are robbing banks, stealing ferraris, and killing innocent civilians mercilessly.  After the death of one such man after a foiled robbery, Detective Tom Beck (Michael Nouri) believes they have their killer. But FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle Machlachlan) knows better.  These citizens aren't really killers.  It's caused by an intergalactic space slug that likes heavy metal music and cars (no kidding).  The ensuing showdown is rather slimy.For the first hour, there's very little to penetrate through the dull pace. The murder investigations are simply routine, and a lot of the dialogue is excruciatingly lame.  For this first hour, the only action scene is a car chase in the beginning, which is probably the best thing the film has to offer.The second half is more riveting, but it's surprising to see how many bad choices director Jack Sholder makes.  First, by making Gallagher an alien, it disappoints because it would have been interesting if the FBI did know of the existence of extraterrestrials.  Another mistake is simply not explaining anything.  There's no discussion on what the alien is made of, or how old it is, or how it got to Earth.  Anybody looking for intelligent material should skip this and just watch another episode of The X-Files.Granted, this isn't meant to be thought-provoking cinema but it could have been far better.  There are three shootouts in the film, but each is just too short to be satisfying and there's not enough excitement to fill in for the sluggish scenes.The acting isn't much better than anything else.  Credit, however, should go to Kyle Machlachlan for trying hard, and he does come off better than everybody else.  Michael Nouri is boring as the standard issue cop.  My goodness, this must be one of the least interesting cops I've ever seen portrayed on film.Though acting and a lot of little elements (including a terrible musical score) are substantial flaws, most of the fault should lie squarely on the shoulders of, well, Jack Sholder and writer Jim Kouf.  Sholder's direction is uninspired and routine, and Kouf's script cares more for incoherence than anything else.  This is a partnership that is best forgotten. "}]
