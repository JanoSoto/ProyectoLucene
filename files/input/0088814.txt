For one thing, it's not a G-rated musical.  In fact, it was the first-ever Disney feature to receive a PG rating.  The story comes from the works of Lloyd Alexander, in the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien.  In it, Taran, a young pig-keeper must protect Henwen, a prophetic pig who can divine the whereabouts of a powerful weapon known as the Black Cauldron.  The demonic Horned King is after this bastion of black magic to create an invincible army of the undead.  This movie boasts impressive art shot in 70mm widescreen format, art which includes the contributions of a young Tim Burton.  Sadly, this feature did poorly in theaters, possibly being too frightening, or going over the heads of Disney's usual target audience.  Just the same, The Black Cauldron deserves a good look!

Does it stack up to such films as Return To Oz and The Dark Crystal? Well, although not as complex as the aformentioned, this film is not without its charm.The story of Taran, the pig-keeper's journey from gawky boy to gawky boy-hero apparently works better as told through the course of five books, and indeed it is the plot that feels put together, with a lot cut out of it for it's slim 120 running time.  Also suffering because of the short time is any character development, or a reason why the charcter of Dallben (an old minstrel) are in the film at all. However, this film still has a lot going for it.The film has a wonderful pacing to it with some fantastic action scenes. It is adventurous and fun. An engaing film for any fantasy fan. What really makes the film though is it's terrifying and dastardly villain, The Horned King. He is basically a Skeletor knock off with absolutely no sense of humor. He looks like he stepped right out of an Iron Maden album cover, and that is a monumental good thing. The true threat felt by the presence of this decidedly un-Disney character keeps the tension of the film high.It is this contrast, between the unconventionally ghoulish villans (definatly enspirered by Bakshi's animated adaptation of Lord of the Rings) and the stock Disney characters makes the audience care more-so for the cutesy characters than usual. This is especially true for the cutsey character of Gurgi, who is much more tollerable than almost all other Disney sidekicks and especially more tollerable than a certain J*r J*r B*nks that we have all been over exposed to lately.So I would recommend The Black Cauldron, it's a fun and well animated adventure film. Compleatly scary and strange for Disney to make, but still very very good for other reasons nonetheless.

But,  there were some bad things as well.  Taran wasn't really a character at  all.  Every important thing that happened to him was by luck or accident.   And at the end of the story he's right back where he started.  Also, the  plot was little more than a succession of action sequences, with little  sense holding it together.  The heroes simply fell out of one situation  into the next, perhaps the result of squeezing two full-length novels into  one movie.  And don't get me started on the ending.

To me, The Chronicles of Preydain rank alongside Tolkien's Middle Earth and Lewis' Narnia as one of the greatest fantasy worlds of all time.  Based deeply in Welsh legend and Mythology (many elements come directly from The Mabinogion, almost the bible of Welsh mythology) Preydain is easily one of the deepest, and most developed worlds out there.  So, needless to say, when I heard that Disney had a film in the pipeline, I got very excited.  Then I saw it...I can't say that I hated it.  More that I was disappointed.  This wasn't the Preydain I knew.  It was more a fairy tale kingdom than celtic Wales.  And what did they do with the characters?  Gurgi a cute fuzzy monster?  Elonwy turned into a typical damsel in distress?  And where were Coll, or Gwydon?  I'm sorry, but I didn't know these people.  The characters were all different?  And what about the rich sense of legend?  The books had been based deeply on mythology, but the movie took the first two books, sprinkled bits and pieces of them into a script, and added a ton of fairy tale and fantasy cliches.I've always wondered what it is with Disney writers that makes them feel it necessary to screw around with anything and everything (witness the amount of creative license taken with Pocahantas or Mulan.)  I'm sorry, but you don't have to have cute characters or happy endings on everything.  But Disney's writers think that you must.  And in this case, it cheapened the ending of the film.  One of the major plot points of The Black Cauldron is that the cauldron can only be destroyed by a living person sacrificing themselves by throwing themselves into it.  This was kept in the film.  Yet, when Disney did it, they still copped out to the happy ending by having the three Enchantresses, Ordu, Orwen, and Oregch bring him back to life...  Jeeze!It went on from there.  The absence of the true villan of the Preydain chronicles, Arawn, the lord of the dead, the turning of the fair folk (who in celtic mythology were more akin to elves and dwarves) into stock, albeit grouchy, faries....  The list goes on...  Disney ruined one of my favorite stories, and I can't ever forget that.  Even my love for Disney masterpieces like Beauty and the Beast or 101 Dalmations is tarnished by what they did to some of my favorite books of my youth...

I owned the Gurgi and Hen Wen plushes, got excited by the preview on the Pinocchio video, etc.,etc.After seeing the movie, I remember being entertained (maybe not enthralled) by the film and was saddened by Gurgi's sacrifice at the end.Years passed.

And people seemed to have forgotten Black Cauldron in the wake of Little Mermaid and her successors.I must admit that I became somewhat obsessed with finding out why Disney thought of the film so poorly and why everyone gave me blank stares when I mentioned it. To say the least, I longed for a video release of the film.A year or two ago, I got my wish, and now that I'm older and wiser I'm able to make a better judgement of the film. Is it Disney's worst film ever? Absolutely not. Black Cauldron is probably the finest animated film of the 1980's (Little Mermaid not withstanding). It IS a scary film for young kids (hence the PG rating) but I think audiences today are able to deal with that more than they were back in 1985 (just look at Dinosaur, Road to El Dorado, and the upcoming Titan AE which are all rated PG). The story may not be up to Disney standards, but for a film of its genre (i.e fantasy) it has a very compelling and understandable story. The animation has its highs and lows. But this film was made by a large number of people over a long period of time, so it is inevitable that there should be some fluctuation in quality.Lastly, I too have read Lloyd Alexander's books, and I too adore them. No, Disney's film does not even begin to compare to the books, but what movie does?On its own terms, Black Cauldron stands as a remarkable achievement in animation, and a film for those people who don't just think cartoons are babysitters for kids.

The company's feature films were attracting smaller and smaller audiences, and no real creative force had emerged since Walt Disney's death in 1966. By the mid- to late-70s, it was clear that new ideas needed to be tried. The phenomenal success of Star Wars appeared to offer a sure-fire way to box-office success sci-fi/fantasy movies. At the same time, Disney Studio's full-length animated features continued their descent from the heights scaled in 1959's Sleeping Beauty, at first downscaling the subject matter, then progressing to less and less impressive animation, and finally combining the first two trends with boring storytelling (see The Fox and the Hound - 1981).It was in this context that pre-production began on The Black Cauldron in the late 1970s. From an artistic standpoint, its goals were two-fold. First, the film was to recapture the lead in animation quality that Disney had traditionally held, while the second goal was to incorporate the advances in animation and subject matter made in the 1970s (i.e., playing catch up). Some early decisions were good the source material was top-notch. Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain are fantastic works of fantasy for the young adult - I loved them as a middle-schooler in the mid-80s, and the choice to film the story in 70mm widescreen harkened back to the glory days of Sleeping Beauty. Unfortunately, not much else worked. The studio's writers did a terrible job of condensing the first two books of Alexander's series, and we end up caring little for the characters that emerge, or for the plot as it unfolds. Also, the movie's tone is uneven. Overall, the work is very dark and un-Disney, which would've been fine had it been executed better. Further, the grimness of the plot doesn't mesh with occasionally clumsy and earthy attempts at humor, and the character animation fluctuates between sober naturalism and exaggerated, cartoonish mannerisms (stretching ears, gaping mouths, etc.) Still, some of the shots are stunning and rank among the best in the history of hand-drawn animation (e.g., multiplaned exterior shot of the Horned King's castle, beautiful backgrounds within the same, Hen-Wen's capture by the Horned King's creatures). The result of this mish-mash was a box-office flop ($25 million to make, $5 million in ticket sales upon its 1985 release).In short, see this film for its often-impressive animation and intermittent charm. Be sure to get the newly-available widescreen version on DVD. Bemoan the end of the era of stunning hand-drawn animation (Disney has closed up its shop; Home on the Range was its penultimate hand-drawn feature). Don't expect a classic, but appreciate the vision of its artistry - even if the final product didn't quite mesh satisfactorily. The Black Cauldron is a noble failure.

Despite a lot of grating elements, I ended up liking it overall.The movie starts off on the wrong foot. The voices come across as recorded at low fidelity, and when combined with the sometimes hard-to-understand British accents, can be somewhat off-putting. Issues with voice and script become even more pronounced with characters such as Gurgi and his Gollum-esquire speech patterns. Indeed, the second time I watched the DVD I threw the English subtitles on, and not just for Gurgi.Other problems with voicing include an exceedingly dull lead actor for Taran (he simply can't emote), and an overly chirpy female lead for Eilonwy.Most other elements of the film proved passable if predictable in the Disney mold of plot, hero design, sidekicks, etc. Where it branches out for the better is in avoiding any and all musical interludes and along the way offering some scenarios and graphic effects that are more mature than most other Disney animated feature films (though later in the '90s the likes of The Lion King, Hunchback, and Tarzan would also tangle with mature themes).Animation is also spectacularly mixed in quality, an odd distinction among Disney films but a distinction nonetheless. Usually solid, there are high points such as external shots of a dark castle or a visceral chase sequence. There are also low points such as unnatural shifts in hair color that overemphasize different environments, or obvious spots where animation was rushed (a rock slide sequence).Yet for all these lows and highs, as an animation fan I ended up siding with the high points. Many sequences are inviting to re-watch, even if the entirety of the movie may not be. For all the talk of failure that continues to surround this movie, one can see in the film itself elements of a more mature Disney that could have been extremely promising with a more seasoned batch of animators and a world less hostile to PG animated fare.

Along the way, he acquires a traveling company that includes a beautiful princess, a bumbling minstrel and a cute creature named Gurgi.The film has it all. The voice work is first rate with a cast including Nigel Hawthorne, John Byner, Phil Fondacaro, Arthur Malet, and Freddie Jones who all turn in good performances. Special mention needs to go to the narrator John Huston who's wondrous voice sets up the story quite well.The animation is lush, the effects are impressive and a real sense of adventure is aroused. My only complaint would probably be the pace which is a little sluggish and the standard happy ending does seem a little forced in.But those mere cracks are not enough to damage or destroy what is ultimately one of Disney's best.

Based off material that was in the talks for decades, it was a property that was whispered about around the Disney studios for quite a few years before its conception (Ollie Johnston was an especially great fan of The Chonicles of Prydain). When Disney finally put the rights to use, they pumped oodles of cash into what they hoped would be the harbinger of a new age of Disney animation, one of darker, more mature storytelling. Not a single Nine Old Men put an ounce of work into this (okay...so Milt Kahl did some preliminary character designs...) and it seemed to be the consumation of the arrival of the new guard of Disney animators.What went wrong? Well the studio made the disastrous choice of handing off sections of the film to individual teams without giving them any interaction between each other, leading to some odd continuity and a total lack of a compelling throughline. Secondly, ambitions for a darker film were rather bipolar, leading to some odd inclusions like graphic gore and partial nudity and unfortunate omissions like a number of fascinating Tim Burton designs which were jettisoned for being too twisted. It doesn't help that the animation looks floaty and bland, some of the weakest in any Disney film up to then, and that heavy cuts under Michael Eisner removed said gore and nudity, only adding to the disconnected nature of this film. They made a few interesting choices, like reviving multi-planing (a very good idea) and using widescreen for the first time since Sleeping Beauty, but these don't make up for all the other blunders made by this film.The story is quite typical of Tolkien-inspired fantasy. An evil Sauron figure has returned to seek a magical item that will restore his power and send his armies across the land to conquer everything in existence. That item is a pig. I know, John Huston says he's seeking a cauldron, but he's actually trying to steal a magic pig from this film's Frodo Baggins, Taran, in order to find it. The one pig to rule them all. I'm not sure if that was in the book, and it's probably handled better in the book, but that's just a goofy sounding concept. Of course, our hero Taran, who's such a wimp that he's easily dispatched by the local goat (I know, that's what character development's for, right? right) loses the pig and has to go rescue him from the Horned King (who looks suspiciously like a demon from Night on Bald Mountain). Taran rescues the pig, but gets himself captured. With the help of a few fellow prisoners and a magic sword, he escapes, and it then becomes a quest to seek the Cauldron before the Horned King finds it.As animation, this is even more of a dark pit than The Fox and the Hound, which had a few real standout moments. There are no moments of excellence here, just floaty, weightless motion and an over-reliance on reaction shots that just looks awkward. Characters are thrown off-model in strange ways, and very little of the performances ring true. The backgrounds do have a nice atmosphere to them, but are also pretty smudgy. Design wise, very little stands out here, and I can't help but wish they'd incorporated things like Tim Burton's idea for flying hand monsters (not ripping off J.R. Tolkien enough?). The color design looks hollow and lacks any sort of warmth or emotion, as if drab colors were what was hip in the eighties (not that I blame them for thinking such). Lamentably, the best animation is Hendel Butoy and Andreas Deja's for Gurgie, a hapless character that they nevertheless lend some much needed life to. Otherwise, I can only point to The Secret of NIMH, made for less than half the money, and sigh at how the biggest animation studio in the world could have made a film that looked one-tenth as good. Not that Bluth hasn't made the mistake of failing to smell a bad concept, but even he must have gotten bad vibes from what Disney was about to do.One has to wonder how a studio with so much riding on this film could have gotten it so wrong. The failure very nearly drove Disney into folding its animation company, and so many potentially lucrative animators were driven into better careers elsewhere. It's a shame, but, thankfully, Disney did hold on to make a few more films. What's more, their very next project would be honest-to-god decent. It's a shame we didn't see a solid genre picture from this studio, though. We can only look at the disastrous final product and wonder what could have been. "},{"Title":"BLAH!

As the first animated Disney film to receive a PG rating, it was the turning point for Disney's way of film-making.Although such films as The Little Mermaid and Aladdin held up the traditional Disney musical flavor, the film introduced the fearless heroine. Although Eilonwy is just a supporting character, she is adventurous and outspoken. Furthermore, it referred to the silent victory of the hero. Taran did indeed triumph, but he didn't receive some lavish prize afterward, he just returned to the home he had wanted to get away from. Finally, it introduced the adult aspect of the Disney film raw emotion and power. It was highlighted greatly in films released after that, especially in 1996's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, where the adult aspect became apparent.The Black Cauldron is a must for all those who wish to see another side of Disney.

But I'd find out, learn more and see why years later, after reading about the history/back-story behind it.So after it finally first had a VHS release over a decade later as part of the Masterpiece Collection series, I continued showing interest and curiosity in it, bought a copy (except in my case, it was the edition that was part of the Gold Collection) and saw what I just had to see. Having gotten to view it for myself at last, I enjoyed it, although I never read the original books in the Prydain Chronicles series (nor did I know this was even another, full-on, Disney adaptation at the time). And despite what some nay-sayers here may have typed about it, I believe in and can take it for what it is, regardless of whatever changes are made and differences there are from the books, because it wouldn't really be much of an adaptation nor could one truly call it that if it followed the original source as it is, that's how I look at and think of it except for maybe depending on what was changed, and to what degree.Anyway, I like how it stood out from most other, Disney animated films that were the norm at the time and it was groundbreaking in a sense, but at the cost of being a win-lose situation On the one hand, it attracted some teen audiences as it was intended. But on the other hand, this decisive move caused it to tank at the box office, due to its somewhat controversial nature of the dark and violent content, which drove away parents and the very young/little kids, since that wasn't what they were expecting. That explained it all to me a lot and cleared things up for me as to the mystery behind the delay of its release on home media . Since I'm sure others have covered what it's about, I'll just say that one of my favorite parts is with the Fair Folk, who I love. It's no wonder The Black Cauldron has hardly ever been brought up by the studio/company and why it's one of the least referenced. It had more violent and graphic parts that didn't make the final cut. However, even though it was toned down somewhat, that apparently still wasn't enough nor satisfying for some. Having typed that, I'd recommend this for children as well as older viewers, solely if the parents believe that the youngsters are valiant and mature enough to handle those moments. There's nothing tedious or boring about TBC, as it's an action-packed fantasy/adventure/medieval times flick that should keep any of y'all on the edge of your seats.

While I admit to enjoying a fluffy light princess movie, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.THE BLACK CAULDRON was quite dark, and obviously not meant for children. The first scene alone was enough to give anyone the creeps, and would probably scare a child out of their mind.The main character is, to put it gently, somewhat of a wimp. This is a nice diversion from the regular 'have no fear' royal prince that most Disney movies feature. It also had a princess who actually helped *do* something, unlike many Disney movies where the prince does all the work and the princess sits and looks pretty.The villain, however, is what made this a truly unique Disney film. He was scary. I honestly got very creeped out upon first seeing him. Unlike many villains from Disney movies, he had no humorous qualities, no stupidity. He was just creepy and evil. If I were a child, he would give me nightmares.Of course it had the typical humorous sidekick on both the villain side and good side (what Disney movie doesn't have one?) and the happy ending.I can't say that I have ever read the books, and I am sure that had I read them, I might have been somewhat disappointed in the film. But as it is, I found it very enjoyable, albeit somewhat scary.

(I'm not too fond of movies like Lion King or Little Mermaid, well until the Toy Story series, but that's another story.)  I first heard of the Black Cauldron when my younger brother got this on a book and tape, and I found that I loved the story so much, I memorized the book and sometimes snagged it.  When I heard it was coming out on video, I got really excited.The Black Cauldron does have a deliciously dark theme to it, which makes it so much better than a normal Disney light and happy film, and the cast of characters is much better than usual.  I especially like the Horned King, with his weird, Grim-Weeper sort of look.  The story is of Taran, a young pigkeeper, who dreams of being Prydain's finest warrior.  His pig, Hen Wen, has an ability to create visions, which is probably where the trouble starts.The Horned King learns of Hen Wen's ability, and longs to use her to find the Black Cauldron.  The Black Cauldron is an evil weapon made when a wicked king so cruel and so evil that no prison could hold him, was thrown alive into a crucible of molten iron.  The Black Cauldron can enable any man the power to rule the world--or destroy it.  Go figure.  No wonder it's so sought after.I love the animation.  I espescially love most of the scenes that show the Horned King's castle.  They look so real, that you can't help believing it really exists.  (Well, you probably know better, but hey.)  And the scenes were the Horned King is working the Cauldron's magic is always worth a view.  I also like many of the lines, like the Horned King's sarcasm. (My, such a brave and handsome crew a pigboy, a scullery maid, and a broken down minstrel.)  One other bonus is none of those annoying, stupid songs that Disney has invented over the past ten years (With the exception of Nightmare Before Christmas, which had some pretty cool hits.)This movie is definately one of Disney's finest.  Disney needs to do more films like this.  I've heard that Tim Burton has helped animate this. I'm not really surprised.  The movie has a touch of that Nightmare air to it, from the gothic scenes to the characters, which are just a tiny bit twisted.  There is this one scene at the end where the Horned King actually looks a lot like Jack Skellington. (The Horned King is looking over a balcony, and for one brief second, you'll see the connection between the two characters.) I give this a perfect 10/10.

It is a beautiful film to look at with its dark fantasy world, appealing character designs, good score and lush backgrounds that remind me of the detailed backgrounds for Sleeping Beauty. And that is about all the good I can say about this film, which is a dreadfully boring narrative mess.The plot has little direction to begin with. There is no focus or clear goal to propel the story forward. None of the characters are interesting. Taran might be the weakest of Disney's animated leading men, having virtually no personality traits other than his cockiness and desire to be a great warrior. Love interest Princess Eilonwy is the same. Fflewddur is mildly entertaining comic relief, but aside from that he serves little purpose and could have been cut from the film with no consequence. Gurgi is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the Star Wars prequels. There are pathetic attempts at character development, but Taran and Gurgi's arcs are so weak that they leave little impact. The Horned King could have been an awesome villain, but he barely DOES anything, leaving most of his work to the ever annoying Creeper, who manages to liposuction all the coolness from the Horned King's scenes.I doubt I'll be watching this again anytime soon. It's looks are nice, but the story and characters are not emotionally resonant enough to make the whole product memorable. It's sad, because I love it when Disney delves into dark territory.

Two things to say First, this would have been a Don Bluth Studios production, nobody would have never shouted at it. The Black Cauldron do not follow the Disney philosophy at all and we almost all agree on that point. This movie is dark on its overall at a point that we can barely think it is targeting a very young audience. Dark movies were certainly a trend in the 80's, The Dark Crystal or Legend are very good examples of how this ambiance was present and used into the movie industry at that period of time.Second, the movie is not bad at all! Try to see it from a different perspective. Animation is just a piece of art and at first glance we can easily guess this is a Disney. Characters are nicely drawn, the princess is very cute, Taran is a teenager full of energy and willing to do well....the villain is freaking frightening, probably the most scary Disney villain of all times! But it is true something is weak in this movie  the plot and roles of some of the characters. What is the one of Helowny for example? Apart bringing the required cute female presence in the story what does she add? Giving advice or supporting Taran in his quest? More drama would have been created if she was the one to jump into the Cauldron! Taran and Helowny both feel attraction for each other...the movie is dark enough to let the cute princess die bringing the dramatization level a notch up (and bring her back to life for the happy ending). Just an idea but this makes more sense to me than Gurki sacrifice.There are also a lot of discontinuity in the animation reflecting production issues this movie ran into (team changes). I have the feeling sometimes that pieces of the storyboard have been stitched together without a proper transition.On the overall we feel something is missing in the story to be convincing but we can't judge it like a total garbage. This is a classic animation movie which used also new features for an outstanding result on the screen at that time!It is a controverted one for sure but still a classic to have in your Disney collection!

It does not come as a surprise that the Disney Corporation would attempt such a film as 'The Black Cauldron. But the film also comes at a time of transition in the company. Months before the release, Michael Eisner and Jeffery Katzenburg joined the top brass, and the film was a training ground for a new generation of Disney animator like Tim Burton. The film itself has a grand epic feel, something that was very out of place in most Disney product of the time. But it was not completely different from other previous Disneyfied films. While it was based on the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, the film carries some trademark Disneyisms. Cute cuddly sidekicks still abound in this feature---Gurgi and the cute clairvoyent pig. But it was far more risky than many of the previous products that the company had offered its public. And while the film became an embarrassment to the company (which is totally unfounded as it was quite good), the film can be seen as a very important point of departure for Disney.

Knowing the story behind the film would lead me to believe that Disney's biggest mistake was condensing the plot line to an extent were it lost heart and depth, it unfolds too quickly so that character relationships aren't properly developed (especially between the Princess and Taran), I also felt no connection to the protagonist. There was no rich sense of legend or mythology just an oracle pig and a floating ball, cheap, ineffective efforts. The 'Horned King' also didn't live up to the usual terrifying standards of a Disney Villain, using a skull-faced, cloaked figure is a far too obvious move, other more successful figures such as Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty, evokes fear through her malevolent aura, and ability to charm others as opposed to the blatant attempt in this film to create an evil character by giving them the face of a skull, the most stereotypical imagery of fear and death. I understand that this kind of animation was ground breaking at its time but I feel that this film was merely Disney testing the water, a blemish in a collection of timeless classics, completely lacking the fluidity of animations such as The Little Mermaid or Aristocats. This is the Disney that should never have been released, from the psychic pig to the irritating voice of the Princess and emotionless voice of Taran (the two did not blend), it does not possess the quality and depth of a Disney. This film had so much potential, they had a great story and could have created a dark, twisted tale that audiences connected with as much as the books, looking now at the success of the Lord Of The Rings movies, it just shows how badly Disney missed the mark in this poor attempt to reach out to teenage fantasy fanatics.

This may have been the first animated Disney film to be rated PG as well, which may have kept people away. The PG rating may have been given for a small blood being shown on the mouth of our hero or the very scary zombie-like Horn King who has to rate up there as one of the truly scary villains in the Disney films.

An enchanted pig that is able to see the future is also much wanted by the Horn King in order to find out where the Black Cauldron is. What makes this movie good is the story, the animation, the music, and the overall presentation. I also like that it didn't follow other Disney films and became it's own entity.

However, even as books intended for a young audience, they contain a great deal of darkness, sadness and themes that older people will appreciate as well.They would make exceptional movies. However, Disney's lame attempt to condense the first two books into one movie (and completely ignore the last three), was doomed.The Black Cauldron can only appeal to a very small audience people who are both not fans of Disney movies and people who are unfamiliar with the book series. This film is far too dark and violent for most parents to want to rent it for their 5 year old, yet it is considerably too Disneyfied to appeal to anyone familiar with the original stories. The story is changed, contorted, strained, shook out and then hung up to dry to the point that Lloyd Alexander fans will be wondering what they are watching. Too many important characters have been bastardized or omitted entirely and the story is virtually re-written.What Disney attempted to do here was appeal to two different groups. They wanted a movie that people could take their kids to (which is why mush of the actual violence is toned down). Instead, they have alienated everyone. Probably why they were loath to release it in the first place.This could have been done wonderfully (As Lord of the Rings is currently being done), whether as live action or animated.

It's the classic monomyth, or Hero's Journey, which follows the young farmhand Taran on his quest to defeat the evil Horned King and destroy the Black Cauldron. Despite having a classic structure and reasonable premise, the story fails to click with the audience because it simply moves too fast. A key aspect of Taran's character, for example, is that he resents his life as a pig boy and dreams of becoming a gallant knight. However, too little time is given to this dream for the audience to really sympathize with this aspect of the character. As a result, when Taran is forced to give up his magic sword (representing his dream of knighthood) for the good of the land, the potentially poignant moment falls flat.Similarly, the progression of Gurgi's character comes across as unnatural. He is supposedly a cowardly character, who fails to help his only true friends in the earlier acts, but eventually finds the strength to make the ultimate sacrifice. All well and good, but the whole series of events unravels too quickly to feel organic. Taran meets Gurgi, five minutes later Taran is leaving and Gurgi is too afraid to help his friend. Five minutes is not enough time for that relationship to solidify, especially because Taran hates Gurgi initially. Moreover, Gurgi's internal conflict with his cowardice is not given enough screen time to progress naturally.Even the pacing of the dialog is too fast. Characters practically talk over each other, in a hurry to hit the myriad of plot points between the opening narration and the closing credits, 80 minutes later. Even pausing for a beat between lines to show characters reacting to each other would have done miracles.All in all, this movie just had too much inertia. From the onset, characters are swept along by the unrelenting pace of the story, and never have an opportunity to build real relationships with each other or grow through introspection. It would have been a much better movie had they extended it beyond it's 80 minute constraint, using any extra time to add lulls to constant action.

The movie also fails to adequately imagine character interactions and circumstance We're left to wonder why The Horned King would kidnap Eilonwy and then give her free reign of the castle, where Flewder Flam came from and why does he belong in the story, and even why does Gurgi care enough to climb into the Cauldron knowing it will kill him? Strictly as a movie, The Black Cauldron does not work as well as we expect from Disney, and would benefit from being a bit longer and better thought out.If you have read the books by Lloyd Alexander, you will be even more disappointed. Alexander's characters all had language patterns that defined them, Disney almost completely omits these, with only a brief nod to munchings and crunchings. Disney also eliminated the moral guideposts of the story.In the books, the destruction of the cauldron hinges on redemption we know Elidar to be strong and talented, but driven by ambition that has turned him to evil action. When he fights his way to the cauldron and climbs in, his sacrifice forms an appropriate counter to the evil he has done. In the movie, Gurgi takes the role of Elidar, climbing into the cauldron to destroy its power. This act becomes a pathetic act of self-destruction. In Gurgi's own words, Gurgi has no friends; Gurgi will do it. There is no battle to reach the cauldron, and there is no redemption in his action.This is just one example of how the movie's attempt to condense and simplify abandons the drama that makes the books powerful. Readers of the Chronicles of Prydain will likely find many more. They will also find a gaping hole where characters are missing or only partially formed Dallben has none of his mystery and power (apparently abandoned when Disney removed his beard), and gaping holes form in the story where we expect Achren, Arawn, Gwydeon, Coll, Smoit, the Huntsmen, and Adeon. Disney has used the story of Prydain as a crutch to prop up a crippled story line, rather than as the foundation of a magnificent new tower of fantasy.

The movie is actually based on The Book of Three and The Black Caldron. But too much is changed and it sort of drags. I would like to see a better company do a much needed live action version like Narnia or Lord of the Rings. Perhaps Disney should have only stapled their name to it like they did Narnia. I understand you can't always fit a whole book in a movie exactly to its original version, but trying to tackle two of these books in one movie was a bad idea, even though they're about as short as A Series of Unfortunate Events. The Prydain Chronicles is a really wonderful series, someone should really think of taking that project on.

While shopping in the stores, I bought a book about Disney animation. Included in it was some rough concept art for THE BLACK CAULDRON. I remember hoping that the movie would be released, soon. Being 14 at the time, I thought of Disney movies as pretty much lame kiddie movies, but this looked pretty cool.Fast forward a decade, to me as a graduating senior from college. I remember hearing that the movie was in theaters, then POOF!, gone. Never to be heard of again, or so we thought.In the early 1990's a wife of a friend of mine was a manager at a local Disney Store, and I asked her when BLACK CAULDRON might be available on VHS. She rolled her eyes up in her head, and said, 'Pretty much, never!'. Apparently a lot of folks asked that same question, and she told me that BC, is the movie that Disney chooses to forget. Then, a few years later, we all went to one of the theme parks at Disney and were looking in a store that sold movie posters for their `great' movies. In the huge stack of `Little Mermaid' and `Aladdin' posters was one for BLACK CAULDRON. My friend's wife seemed amazed at finding it, and she said that `Disney must be considering re-releasing the movie if this poster is here'. And surprise, in 1998, we found it on the shelves of our local video store.My wife and I decided to preview it before we let our young daughters see it. And man, am I glad we did. Truly NOT a movie for the under 7 or so set. Dark, deep, and troubled, is the best way to describe BC. I do like more `mature' animation, but this seemed a mish mash of past Disney style, fantasy art, and a move in a new direction of animation.The other disappointing part of the 1998 release was, that it's in Full Screen format. What a let down as the movie is one of only two, I believe, 70 MM format animated Disney movies. SLEEPING BEAUTY, being the other, and that WAS available in VHS wide screen format. The print that was used to make the tape, also appeared to be very poor, and it appeared to have been edited, as one or two scene transitions didn't seem smooth.I may rent the DVD, and give it another try, but as previous posters have stated, it's not for everyone. And definitely NOT for the wee ones, who are best suited for `LITTLE MERMAID'.

This is totally not their style and it is sad how they never use this any more. I do realise, however, that this movie was made during the Dark Period where movies (especially animations) were based a lot on fantasy, serious, and were rather dark. Such movies can include The Last Unicorn, The Lord of the Rings ('78 version), Watership Down, and many others. These movies weren't your typical children's happy tales; they had no horrible unfunny singing (the only singing they had was good!), no stupid side-kicks, no love of first sight and getting happily married at the end, and no wimpy-pointless plots. These films were made with bitter-sweet endings that were made to help us learn more and recognise more things in life, they had powerful messages some of them. The Black Cauldron has no singing. This movie is quite evil at parts and has dark scenes. The characters are rather serious and the story progresses well. To-day this animation would be considered old animation but I like this style better! Too many things have been computerised these days. The old style which was very detailed with many shades was my favourite. The colours seem to come out better and add more affect this way. Overall I give this movie a 9.5/10.

Despite having some dull moments, the acting is top notch (especially John Hurt's Horned King), the horror scares, and there is enough action (including a shockingly crude joke that left my mouth wide open) to enjoy it as much as Lloyd Alexander's series. In fact, on Rotten Tomatoes it has a higher rating than Robin Hood or a few of Disney's early-mid 2000s films (55%), which I guess can be agreed with seeing how many critics didn't appreciate the new format, though its execution is not something to be glossed over.

The film has never had the publicity of others in the Disney stable, taking a long time to reach home video and DVD release. It would seem to have been a ruinously expensive box office flop, and investigations into the background reveal board-level personality clashes and fractious internal politics. I don't know about you, but that sounds intriguing to me.The film has problems, certainly. It is generally agreed to be considerably darker in tone than almost any other Disney film, and rather darker then studio execs were comfortable with. What first struck me, though, was not the tonal darkness but physical darkness. Throughout the early part, it was irritatingly difficult to even see what was happening on screen, even with brightness and contrast turned up to maximum. Thereafter, too, there is an odd discrepancy between the sumptuous, subtly shaded, almost canvas painting style backgrounds, and the simplistic design of the foreground characters, all thick lines and blocks of colour.There is a comparison to be drawn between The Black Cauldron and The Sword in the Stone. Apart from the medieavalish period setting, there is a distinct similarity in character design, and indeed the art style of the film in general. Thematically, though, it has far less in common with Disney in general than it does with Brian Froud's faerie illustrations and Lord of the Rings. In terms of the latter, some of the similarities are a bit too close to comfort. We have a Sauron-clone with Nazgul-clones, other incompetent lackeys (less unique, but still something in common) and a Gollum-clone. Admittedly, it could be that these were inserted by Disney based on Tolkien's popularity, and even if they are in Lloyd Alexander's source text, The Chronicles of Prydain, he would not be the first or the last to copy the seminal master of fantasy fiction.The writing has other problems. I found it short on the honed wit that brightens Disney pieces both before and since. Some bemoan the American committee style of writing, claiming that it leads to a certain soullessness, but at least a room full of brains can be counted on to deliver the zingers. Also, the main character Taran has very little about him to incline me to root for him. He is not strong, which is fairly standard, but neither is he clever, or brave, or even witty. His only real virtue seems to be luck, and even this abandons him at times in the narrative. This is especially a problem given how long he spends alone before companions are introduced.At least when other characters appear, they include a strong female character. Or do they? Certainly, Princess Eilonwy has personality, and a more engaging screen presence than Taran, but for the most part she seems content to tag along behind, and be a bit sassy. Still, that's a step up from Sleeping Beauty.So why 6 out of 10 and not lower? Two factors Elmer Bernstein's excellent, strident orchestral score - exactly what one would expect from a cinematic legend of his pedigree - and the ending. I will try not to spoil it, but I found the deviation from the hero saves the day convention very refreshing. The virtues displayed in obtaining victory are not the sort to be usually found in this kind of film. That papered over a lot of cracks for me.In some ways, I was a little disappointed that it was not more repellent, or otherwise inappropriate, which would have been an entertainment in itself. I suppose that will have to wait until I can seek out and watch 'Song of the South'...

And even Disney films of the time are no exception. Their art style is muted, using heavy shadows, stark contrasts and swaying away from the cartoony colours. Their story lines are rather adult and depressing. Well, in comparison at least. And the crowning achievement of this is none other than The Black Cauldron, the most peculiar of the Disney canon films.At the time Disney Animation Studios were not doing so well. In fact the company was seriously considering closing them down and focusing solely on theme parks and merchandise. This movie was originally meant to change that course, but it almost ended up being the sole thing to ruin the whole studio. It wanted to take Disney to a whole different direction, picking as its source material a dark fantasy novel and staying very faithful to its tone, earning the PG rating.And yes, before you ask, the pig is in the book as well. Disney didn't add that to give the movie a mascot. Gurgi is in the book as well. I'm never reading that book, no matter how much you'd pay me.So what went wrong? Well, what didn't. The Black Cauldron is a mess. It was a major flop upon its release, and I can definitely see why. It has since garnered a cult following, but the fact still remains that it simply isn't a Disney film. Families went in expecting a typical Disney experience with fairytale stories, kid friendly messages and all around merriment. Instead they were treated to a medieval fantasy story leaning heavily towards dark and horror.But, that could be forgiven. I actually somewhat like the idea in principle. Great heroics, one scary villain, myths and legends, sword and sorcery, all done by one of the greatest animation studios on Earth. What's not to like? How about the fact that the main character is an unlikable, lazy jerk, the side characters have no, you know, character, the plot wanders around worse than a drunken minstrel, the end twist is unimaginably disappointing, the MacGuffin pig is ludicrous, the villain while certainly scary has no charisma or presence beyond looking like the devil and as a whole I'm simply not feeling the epicness. It's clear Disney had never done anything like this, and had no idea how to adapt to a different kind of storytelling tone. A dark fantasy story differs greatly from fairy tales, though they both certainly utilize the same character tropes and source materials. But whereas fairy tales are about morals and simple lessons about good and evil, dark fantasy is more about the struggle against eternal darkness, the meaning of hope in the midst of despair and about guts and glory. I don't get that from The Black Cauldron.The movie has its upsides, definitely. It looks great, the villain is certainly the scariest Disney has ever done and about one third of the story is actually pretty captivating. But it has flaws, many many flaws. Not my personal favourite, but you should still check it out to see if it speaks to you.

Instead, it is based on a novel by Lloyd Alexander, a story about pig-keeper Taran who attempts to find his future-foretelling pig so that the evil Horned King would not capture and use her to pinpoint the whereabouts of the Black Cauldron. The Horned King plans to use the Black Cauldron to spread untold evil and power.The film has splendid hand-drawn animation and a catchy music score. Also, the plot has steady pacing to it with some adventurous and exciting action scenes, and the villainous Horned King is also one of the more scarier-looking Disney villains out there. However, I thought much of the characters lacked any development or chemistry, particular that of Taran. He wants to experience more in his life than just settling as a pig-keeper, but his purpose and goals were not fully developed throughout the rest of the film. He also didn't have any chemistry with the heroine, Princess Eilonwy, whose purpose in the movie was also very vague. She along with the wide range of characters including the flying trolls didn't contribute much to the plot; it was as if they were just placed in the movie for window dressing.But again, there are quite a few actions scenes that made the film at least somewhat exciting, and the sacrificing elements, lack of comedy, and dramatic characters made this a pretty dark and un-conventional Disney film.

Not that the film should be mentioned in the same breath as the studio's calling cards, of course. It's short, shallow and more than a little murky, with a distinct lack of Disney charm, but it still has a lot going for it. The animation, for instance, is superb - a great blend of photo-reference and vivid exaggeration that looks and feels like a Don Bluth classic (though Bluth himself, having departed six years prior, was uninvolved with the production). It also enjoys a much more loyal fantasy tone than many of Disney's efforts, sharing many themes (and maybe a few characters) with the then-neglected Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Based on The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, this Disney animated fantasy attempted to adapt the first two books of the series (The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron) and make a grand film. The film has an infamous production history, as pre-production started as far back as 1971. The newly recruited Disney artists who were working on Robin Hood and The Rescuers (including Don Bluth) were hoping that this film would eventually become a Disney film that Walt would have never dreamed of, an epic fantasy. Unfortunately, the executives were very play it safe at the time, so the project was put on hold. Finally, in 1980, full production began on the project and it was aiming to be a very dark fantasy film aimed at teenagers. At the time, anything with the Disney name on it was avoided by teens and adults, and thus Disney hid their names on the theatrical posters for PG-rated films like Tron, Tex and Something Wicked this Way Comes.The resulting film is a mess, but it's not a horrible film. In fact, the ambition alone makes it worth watching. Seeing Disney at least try to do a dark fantasy film is a miracle. The first problem is the muddled storyline. The film takes many liberties with the books and takes various sections of the first two books and tries to make a plot out of them to fit an 80-minute film.The story, in the land of Prydain is a Black Cauldron. Whoever gets the Cauldron can rule the world or destroy it. A young boy named Taran on the farm of Caer Dallben dreams of being a warrior and getting respect, rather than being an assistant pig keeper. What the young boy doesn't know is that the pig, Hen Wen, is psychic and can read visions. She knows the location of The Black Cauldron. Unfortunately, a terrifying warlord known as The Horned King knows about the pig and is searching for the cauldron. The Horned King plans to resurrect an army of dead soldiers and destroy everything in the land of Prydain. The enchanter Taran is working for, Dallben, tells Taran to take Hen Wen and hide her in a hidden cottage in the forest. Taran begins his journey into the forest with the pig, but he daydreams of becoming a warrior. The pig runs off and is captured by The Horned King's flying beasts, the Gwythaints. Taran goes into The Horned King's castle to rescue Hen Wen. All goes wrong, Hen Wen escapes and Taran is locked in the dungeon. There he meets Princess Eilonwy (stolen by the Horned King) and an old bard named Fflewddur Fflam. Together, with the small creature Gurgi, the team go on a quest to get The Black Cauldron before The Horned King finds it.While the plot sounds alright, the way its executed is a mess. The first half is great, but once Taran meets Eilonwy and Fflewddur, all seems to get muddled. All leads up to a very exciting climax. On the bright side, it has some very good animation and impressive background artwork (Although some may disagree). It is also the first Disney animated film to use computer generated imagery (not The Great Mouse Detective).One big flaw is the editing, but don't blame the makers of this film, blame Jeffrey Katzenberg. He saw the completed film and being inexperienced and thinking that you can edit animated films, he edited out a lot of violent scenes that would've gotten the film a PG-13 or R rating. That was Disney's intention, to make a film for mature audiences and not having it being called just for kids. Katzenberg made the film an even bigger mess. Hopefully some day we can see the uncut version.Unfortunately, the film did not do very well. It grossed $21 million against a record $25 million budget. Because of this, Disney did not theatrically re-release the film in the U.S. (There was a re-release in Europe in 1990 under the title Taran and the Magic Cauldron).Why did it flop? Maybe because the film's dark content? Maybe because the film received mixed reviews? Or maybe it was because the film lacked heart? Anyway, they finally released it on home video in 1998 after fans asked for it and it sold $100 million in video sales, so it has a bit of a following.It's definitely worth a watch. You may love it or you may hate it. Not a bad film, it just could've been something grand, something to save animation from the state it was in at the time. But the good animation, the exciting action sequences and the score by Elmer Bernstein make up for the flaws.8.8 out of 10.

In Beauty and the Beast it wasn't Gaston i was afraid of or the beast but that machine her father had. In The Little Mermaid it wasn't Ursula but those 'unfortunate soul' things. In Snow White it wasn't the witch it was the trees. The same applied for all of these Disney films except the Black Cauldron.The villain is what makes this film. From the moment the film opens you see this terrifying black pot with this deep dark voice over which is then contrasted with the introduction of Taren, the central character and his pig, Hen.It turns out the horned king is searching for the black cauldron which will give him the power to raise an army from the dead and to find the black cauldron the king will come looking for Hen, a pig with strange divining powers so Taren (who dreams of adventure and the like) must take Hen to the cottage on the other side of the wood and keep her hidden there.On the way however Hen is stolen by some terrifying flying dragon monster things and Taren had to follow them to the horned kings castle and get hen back.The Horned King is as frightening as for once he should be and voiced by the immensely talented John Hurt. He is the most affective animated villain ever on screen and i say that with confidence. However to lighten the mood a little he is accompanied by a delightful but much abused little green goblin who is great fun as well as sweet and quite charming even if he is a little mischievous.Also along the way Taren comes across a sweet but strong minded princess, a highly dishonest but charming bard and the most irritating character ever put on screen. I can't remember his name but it's irritating. He is the one thing i am afraid the brings down the entire film in Disney's lame attempt to introduce comedy into the mix.The film closes with a dramatic and thrilling climax and does not disappoint. It was a welcome relief and change from every other Disney movie and a great success as far as i'm concerned. you might not like it but i always will.the Animation is poor and so is the script but the story and the characters shine though and will remain one of my favourite cartoons of all time whatever anyone else says about it.

But they did. The Black Cauldron is quite possibly, the worst film to come from the house of mouse. It's aggressively un-Disney, but unfortunately, that works against this shockingly awful fantasy film. The Black Cauldron is a story about a young boy named Taran who wants to be more than a pig-keeper. His wish comes true, though, when it turns out that his pig, Hen-Ren can predict the future and create visions. Taran is told by his master Dallben to go into hiding with Hen-Ren, in order to protect the location of the mystical Black Cauldron from the Horned King. On the way, Taran meets a young princess named Elionwy, an old musician named Fflewddur, and a cowardly ewok-like creature named Gurgi. I knew this film was doomed as soon as I learned the pig was psychic. The characters, unfortunately, are neither memorable, nor likable. Taran is always drowning himself in his sorrows, Elionwy is an obvious stereotype, Gurgi fails to evoke laughter, and The Horned King's tiny assistant is easily the most annoying cartoon character ever depicted. Had I not seen the Disney logo preceding the film, I would never have guessed The Black Cauldron was a Disney film. It's surprisingly dark, and there isn't much humor. In fact, the few times there are attempts at humor, they usually fall flat. I don't recall ever laughing during The Black Cauldron. Another typically uncharacteristic thing about The Black Cauldron, was how dull it is. I never found myself thrilled, but I was constantly bored. The Black Cauldron just cannot excite the audience in the slightest. Regardless, Elmer Bernstein provides a very good score, even if it takes a bit to warm up. But The Black Cauldron is, at least, a visual treat. Many effects are simply stunning. The animation is wonderful, especially for a film of it's age. It's just a shame that there wasn't a decent movie to accompany the visuals. Disney is usually reliable when it comes to their animated films, so it was certainly shocking to see a Disney film this bad. It's too dull, the characters are annoying, and the logic of the film is constantly changing. Outside of the lovely visuals (and an occasionally lively score), there isn't much to recommend in The Black Cauldron.

In the 1980's, there was a glut of films aimed for child audiences that were not patronizing, like Twice Upon a Time, Rock & Rule and Pogo for President, and Cauldron sought to do the same thing. Black Cauldron is a strange, paranoid film that's definitely unnerving at times. An almost unrecognizable John Hurt voices the Horned King, easily one of the greatest cinematic villains ever. I am familiar with the Chronicles of Prydain, and while some major characters don't appear, those that do stick closely to what Lloyd Alexander originally intended for them.As a stand-alone film, it's very entertaining and re-watchable.

Having become quite a fan of Disney's work over the past few years (never was much of a fan as a kid; go fig), I was anxious to see why they had never released this on video before.Now I know.This film, from the limited research I have done on the subject, apparently nearly sank the animation department at Disney, it did so badly at the box office.  It's no wonder. The shoddy storyline, unlikeable characters, and dated animation make it a wonder how it ever saw the light of day at all. The animation looked as if it could have just as easily been done in 1955 as 1985!  My 9-year-old niece was bored out of her mind.  So was I.  There was very little frightening about it that was actually supposed to be, and I have to agree with the quote I heard from someone that it was the first animated Disney feature to be completely without heart.This movie is good for one thing, however  if you're really interested, watch this, then watch The Little Mermaid (again, I'm sure), and marvel at the fact that those two movies were made only a couple of years apart (Little Mermaid was apparently already in the production pipeline when Black Cauldron was released; otherwise, we might never have seen it!).  Not only would I not recommend this movie for children, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone other than those into animation history, Disney history, or intense boredom.

The first time I saw this a few years ago I enjoyed it more than after watching it again now. Now I am a few years older, which might have partially influenced that.The film was a Disney attempt in doing something different, perhaps such a radical change for its time that people weren't prepared, resulting in a spectacular failure at the box office and critically. If this movie had been made today, it probably would have been more appreciated. Time was kinder to it and attracted some loyal fans, but it still is one of the lesser known and appreciated animated Disney movies.Apparently this movie took 7 years to be made. A very long time, even for an animated film. It pioneered computer-generated imagery on Disney animated movies and also had the honor of being the first animated Disney effort to be rated as PG because of its extreme darkness and violence.'The Black Cauldron' isn't such a bad movie, however it is not for everybody (including Disney's purists). And it's not one I would recommend for children because it isn't entirely appropriate for them. It is extremely dark and there is plenty of disturbing and scary content on this. The Horned King, for example, is the most sinister-looking Disney villain ever. He is an undead skeleton with demonic horns and eyes that glow red when he gets mad. And his voice is creepy. The Horned King can make more sensitive or nervous children wet their pants of fright. His appearance is repulsive.The Horned King's servant Creeper is gross and his henchmen are just as nauseating. They also have got 2 ferocious dragon-like creatures and the most vicious dogs ever (together with DeSoto and Roscoe from 'Oliver & Company').Horrible and disturbing things are seen in this film, including an army of skeletons coming to life. Things like this could make kids have horrible nightmares.The 3 witches are not only hideous but also irritating and grotesque.On the positive side, there are a few interesting characters. Princess Eilonwy and Gurgi were the best characters. Princess Eilonwy is very charming and very pretty and elegant and she's also got a pretty smile and a friendly personality. Gurgi, whatever that thing is, is cute and at the same hilarious and charming. His voice is so funny and cute and I like his manner of speech filled with rhymed pairs of words, especially crunchings and munchings. Although a fraidy cat during great part of the movie, he eventually becomes a hero.Taran is cool, but sometimes he overacts, such as one scene in particular which he is unfair towards Princess Eilonwy. Taran has a lot in common with Wart from 'The Sword in the Stone' both are similar-looking and both spend their days daydreaming, anxious to become great warriors. Taran doesn't like to be an assistant pig keeper.Hen Wen is a cute little pig. Fflewddur Fflam isn't a very appealing character. He is an exaggerated broken down minstrel, so much that, whenever he lies, one of his harp's strings breaks. He is boring.The little fairies are likable. Doli was my favorite of the fairies thanks to his strong personality and short temper which made him so funny.Surprisingly, this film has no songs except for one by Fflewddur Fflam. Aside that, there is only some instrumental soundtrack.The film's got some amazing special effects. Besides, the drawing style (or artwork, whatever) is somewhat different in comparison to traditional Disney films of the time, almost Don Bluth-like style.6 is my final vote. Although, considering all the bad things I mentioned, I'd even give it a lower rating.

I was about, I would have to say, maybe 8 years old when I first saw it. And I liked it a lot. It was a thrilling adventure. Now, I was not scared of it, but it does have moments that could be frightening to little kids. But that goes for a lot of Disney films. They all have an element of horror in them. It was not until 9th grade when I learned that it was a book, and it was not until I was in my teenage years that I started to read The Chronicles of Prydain. Now I think that the film version of The Black Cauldron is only sub-par. And here is whyThis version is just the first two books, The Book of Three and The Black Cauldron rolled into one movie, with The Book of Three dominating the story of The Black Cauldron. In the film, Taran is an Assistant Pig-Keeper, but in the stories, he does not start out an Assistant Pig-Keeper. He starts off by making horseshoes. There is a character who is Taran's mentor named Dallben in the film version. But in the books, there are two characters, Dallben and Coll. What they did was have the characters of Dallben and Coll meshed as one. Dallben is an old enchanter. One might equate him to Gandalf or Merlin because of his wisdom and his appearance. Coll is the one with the bald crown. The Princess Eilonwy is an interesting character as well. In the books, she is a chatterbox. In the film, they cut the chatter down. But they keep her independent mind in the film, which is a good thing. Also, her bauble floats in the film. But it does not in the books, it only lights up at her command. The bard, Fflewddur Fflam, is not at all like he is in the books. In the film, they portray him as an old man, but in the books, he is quite young, and has spiky yellow hair. Gurgi is pretty much the same as he is in the books, except Taran meets him when Gurgi tries to strangle him. There are a ton of important characters left out of this film, and I was not pleased with that. One other part of the film that I did not care for was how they introduced the Fair Folk. They have them as fairies, but they are not like that at all. They are dwarfs, well, some of them are. Doli, the one who helps the companions to the place where the Black Cauldron resides, is not elderly. He is young as well. And the witches that live in the Marshes of Morva, Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch, hardly match their descriptions in the stories. And the magic sword that Taran takes from the Horned King's castle, which is known as Dynrwyn, can only be handled by someone of noble worth, and Taran does not prove himself of that in The Book of Three, nor in The Black Cauldron, which only mentions Dyrnwyn once. The Horned King, now this was disappointing. In the film, they present him as an old emperor, but he is not like that at all. He is a warlord, and a young strong one at that. He does not speak at all in the stories, and he works for a higher power known as Arawn, Death-Lord of Annuvin, which they roll both Annuvin and Spiral Castle, the castle that the Horned King inhabits in the film, into one country. There is a character who works for the Horned King in the film called Creeper, which the makers of the cartoon created. Creeper does not exist in the books. There are tons of other changes made, but I will not list them, simply because although I do not care for The Black Cauldron, I do not want to spoil it for you. So, I say this to you because if you read the books, then you might be disappointed by the film. But if you have not read them, or if you have and you will appreciate it anyway, then feel free to see it.

This movie ended up epitomising how dull the Disney movies had supposedly become by becoming a spectacular flop.That said it's a generally good movie. It's story is told very well despite the rather slow pacing and the artwork and animation is spectacular in some points such as the high energy dragon chase scene when Hen Wen is captured and the heavily edited Cauldron born sequence. One special note is that its very different from the other Disney movies as it is quite dark and has absolutely no songs. The musical score by Elmer Bernstein serves its purpose very well and frankly I'm surprised there was no Oscar nomination.The film is very ambitious and in trying to be dark, powerful and epic it sometimes fails. It also doesn't help that the final battle between Taran and The Horned King is very anti-climatic. The Cauldron Born scene is also too abrupt, its delightfully chilling but the army isn't given anything to do though this I blame more on Jeffery Katzenberg and him deleting the very graphic content from much of this scene as well as around 10 minutes of the whole film. Another problem is poorly written dialogue.The biggest problem here is that it's based on The chronicles of Prydain book series, these complex books can't be worked into 80 minutes, even though it only covers the first 2 books there's a lot of things which are left out The first problem is that many important characters from the books including Ellydir, Gwydion, Achren etc are left out of the movie as are explanations for items like the magic sword and Eilonwy's bauble.The characters that remain are also an issue. Taran is well animated but his personality and character are undermined by some hokey dialogue, Eilonwy is also well drawn and has far more personality but unfortunately she's wasted on this film as she isn't given anything to do. The Horned King is easily by design the most terrifying villain to come from the Disney Studio. This is what Sleeping Beauty's Maleficant should have been like, while she had no motivation The Horned King wants to be an overpowered god through unleashing an army of murderous skeletons that only obey him. He infuses fear into every screen appearance but again like Eilonwy it's a shame that he doesn't get to pick up a weapon and fight for himself rather than sitting in that chair. The comic side of the film works a bit better although I will say that while Flewddur has personality and does entertain he doesn't add anything to the story. Creeper (the Horned King's imp) also entertains whilst Gurgi while not overly funny is one of Disney's most endearing comic sidekicks.So overall it's not the garbage that many, including the people working at Disney have taken it for and its not the epic masterpiece that it could have been but its a good movie nonetheless. It's highly entertaining and holds it's dark tone better than the later dark Disney's (Hunchback & Atlantis). It's a shame it was a box office failure and it would be better for the film if Disney finally re insert the deleted footage. heck it would probably invoke more interest in the film if people saw the poster for a Disney cartoon with an R-rating on it.Critical grade 7/10, Personal enjoyment 9/10 "},{"Title":"Not the best, not the worst","Date":"20 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" Plot in a nutshell Taran is an assistant pig keeper for the old wizard Dallben in the land of Prydain who dreams of being a great heroic leader of men.

Basically centuries ago in the land of Prydain, young man Taran (Grant Bardsley) one day dreams of becoming a great warrior, his enchanter master Dallben (Freddie Jones) tells him the secret of why he is assistant pig keeper, Hen Wen is an oracular pig, and holds the secret to the location of the Black Cauldron, which has the power to restore life to the dead, undead souls of course. The boy is forced to go on a journey to save Hen Wen when the pig is kidnapped by the evil skeletal lord The Horned King (John Hurt), who plans to use the power of the Black Cauldron to raise a large army of unstoppable undead slaves and soldiers to take over the world, and the fearsome lord has many minions to stop any intruders who try to get into the castle. Taran is joined in his quest by furry creature companion Gurgi (John Byner) who is small and pestering but reliable, comical middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne) who tries to help with his poetry and harp playing occasionally, and of course the beautiful Princess Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan) who is his age and stubborn but has bravery. Taran finds a magical sword that helps him fight off the enemies, they encounter the small fairy-like beings called the Fair Folk who help them to locate where the Black Cauldron is, they find the cauldron in the clutches of three witches, Orddu (Eda Reiss Merin), Orgoch (Billie Hayes) and Orwen (Adele Malis-Morey) who will only trade it for the magical sword. They reveal before disappearing that the cauldron is indestructible, and the only way to break it's power it is if someone was to climb into it, but this will also kill whoever does it, none of the companions are willing to do this, so the young man feels hopeless and that the mission may have all been for nothing, and then the nasty soldiers interrupt. They seize the Black Cauldron and The Horned King uses it to raise his army who pour out into the world, the friends are released by Gurgi who jumps into the cauldron himself before Taran can do, the spell of the cauldron is broken and the army collapses, the cauldron goes out of control and eventually consumes and destroys the castle. In the end the three witches take back the now useless cauldron, Fflewddur convinces them to prove their abilities and allow a trade, the cauldron to revive Gurgi, they hand back the magical sword and Gurgi is alive and well, the young man, Eilonwy and the bard journey home together, and Dallben praises Taran as a hero. Also starring Arthur Malet as King Eidilleg, John Byner as Doli and John Huston as Narrator. The mostly British voice cast is well chosen, Bardsley as the young hero, Jones as an enchanter, Hawthorne as an eccentric entertainer, Hurt as a dark villain, Huston giving his narration, and especially Byner who sounds very similar to The Lord of the Ring's Sméagol but is really lovable. You could argue that this cartoon film is like any standard story full of swords and sorcery, and you can tell the animation is perhaps not the same high quality as previous and of course later pictures, but there is no denying that it is a really enjoyable tale for all ages, a fun animated adventure.

This is another of those deviations, but without the same final effect.Something was lost in this translation, as it lacks much of the same old Disney feeling we've come to expect. It was prevalent throughout the atmosphere, story, and execution, but what struck me most of all was the lousy and often cheap-looking animation. The animation found herein was more what one might expect to find in a Disney animated sequel in that the backgrounds were haphazardly done, the principals were cheaply done, and the effects bore no concern or care in their design or presentation.The story, however is still quite compelling, while the elements of the story are darker than usual Disney fare. This was far darker than most Disney animated features, and may not be suitable for younger children, as the atmosphere is rather dark and foreboding.All this said, because of the story itself, this is not only in my collection, it stands as one of my Disney favorites.

Wouldn't he have been better as a deranged, power-hungry human in a creepy costume (which, as I've recently learned, is exactly what he was in the source book) than as some kind of unexplained skeleton-being? Gurgi is not only annoying and difficult to understand, but he seems entirely out of place in the ancient setting.

The Black Cauldron is nowhere near vintage Disney, but it's not without certain merits. For one thing, the animation is mighty impressive and marked the beginning of dazzling technological advances in Disney's animated features. Also, the voice-overs are excellent (with John Hurt a particular stand-out, bringing real menace to The Horned King). However, the problem here is that the decidedly uninspired storytelling severely lets down the film.The story follows a young pig keeper as he tries to protect a magical pig from the forces of darkness. The pig has the power to tell the future when its face is dipped in a pool of water, and an evil Horned King seeks the creature in order to use its magical skill to locate a long-lost black cauldron. If the black cauldron ever falls into the hands of the Horned King, then he will become all-powerful and rule the land.You don't have to know much about the fantasy genre to realise that this is a thinly disguised retread of The Lord of the Rings. For the black cauldron, read the one true ring. For the Horned King, read Sauron, the dark lord. Indeed, it's no exaggeration to suggest that this film is a sort of Lord of the Rings substitute for those with only 80 minutes to spare. While the film is just about enjoyable enough (especially for kids) it doesn't aspire to the high quality of previous Disney classics. It also might seem mildly entertaining whilst on, but it fades out of the memory all too quickly afterwards. See The Black Cauldron if you're a Disney completist, but if you're looking for real quality stick with some of the old classics, like Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp.

So, I immediately bought it, without having viewed it prior to purchasing it. BIG MISTAKE! I took it home and my husband, myself and our 2 year old son sat down to watch it. I never finished it, although my husband did, and I sold it online 3 days later. Not one of us liked it. At first it seemed like a Sword in the Stone kind of movie, which is a movie I like. But then, about 15 minutes into it, I (23 years old) started to get a little freaked out and scared by it. Not terrified, just uneasy. The main villian, whose name I do not remember (something I do NOT feel guilty about) is a scary, skeleton like creature. His lair (which seemed to be very simular to Maleficent's lair from Sleeping Beauty, another movie I like) was a dark, awful place. Within 45 minutes, my 2 year old and I were in his bedroom reading books that I hoped would get him to forget about the movie he had just seen. It was not easy considering he was still crying, but at least no longer holding on to me for dear life. To be honest, I could relate to my son, as I had felt like shielding my eyes for the short time I was watching the movie. This was NOT a kids movie. Now I understand why I had never heard of it before, and why Disney does not advertise about it a lot. It does NOT fit Disney's good movie mold. I give this movie a 0 out of 10 and a recommendation to all viewers not to waste your time or money on this movie, especially if you have small children. Disney has so many good movies out there, and I hope people will remember that and do not judge Disney based solely on the viewing of this one, awful film.

The protagonist confronts the villain too early in the film to lend their conflict gravity. The villain's demise is ultimately unsatisfying and the film's resolution seems rushed. It is fair to say that the protagonist does go through a change in his view of the world, particularly what it means to be a hero, which lends the film merit. The tone mixes light-hearted Disney humor with the darker tones of the sword and sorcery genre popular in the 1980s. The film is ultimately interesting, in large part due to the animation and mature themes imbued in the plot. I loved that Disney, prior to the Eisner era, was willing to explore a dark sword and sorcery fantasy concept in its animation. This movie is no fairy tale, like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. I doubt Walt would have green lit such a grim project, which has more in common with Lord of the Rings than Dopey and Grumpy. A few reviewers have complained that The Black Cauldron does not look or feel like a typical Disney animated movie; that's why I enjoy it!The cartoon is based on a book for older children and preteens written in the 1960s, which in turn was inspired by Welsh mythology. The aura of high fantasy pervades the animation, which lends it an element of coolness that no doubt would appeal to older viewers than is the case for Disney animated films. The characters' facial appearances have the look typical of 1960s to mid-1980s Disney cartoon movies, so expect that. The Horned King and Creeper look pretty cool; while not particularly vile when compared to the likes of the Wicked Queen in Snow White or Stromboli in Pinocchio, the Horned King is one the scariest-looking Disney villains designed. His skull-face and antlered cloak evoke a sense of the sinister supernatural not present in much of the Disney fare. His army of undead soldiers, the Cauldron Born, are especially creepy--again, preteens who feel too old for cute mice and who want an introduction to high fantasy may be drawn by the ghoulish villains. This film also has a bit more realistic violence than most Disney cartoons, which may also attract older kids the protagonist's cheek actually *bleeds* after a dragon attack, which is uncharacteristic for a Disney character! Granted, the plot and themes are pretty sloppy compared to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring films, but for any kid who wants a more mature fantasy-themed Disney movie may enjoy what The Black Cauldron has to offer. This film came out when high fantasy was en vogue, and films like The Dark Crystal, Conan the Barbarian and Willow were popular. Sadly, this movie was a flop, and marked a dead end for Disney's attempts to animate dark high fantasy cartoons for an older audience. I sometimes think of what could have been Disney might have released a slew of animated features based on adult fantasy novels, like Wheel of Time or Herbert's Dune; hell, they may have ended up producing the first R rated Disney animated film, perhaps an adaptation of Game of Thrones. Sadly, this film's ill-fated production precluded that possibility, and it would not be until The Lion King and the Pixar movies that Disney would market its cartoons to children and adults simultaneously. While not a classic, The Black Cauldron is worth a watch. Watch it to experience a truly unique Disney venture its first foray into high fantasy. "}{"Title":"Dark and Violent.

Guarded by witches. Discovered by a boy. Stolen by a king. Whoever owns it will rule the world. Or destroy it. The Black Cauldron was a well-attempted film full of excellent potential. Unfortunately, this film was a bomb, and it was disappointing to watch. The movie took seven years to make, that's a long time, even for animation. I can see every dollar was put into every frame, and I can tell that they believed money was not a problem. Disney certainly had the money, but they surely didn't want to throw it all away. The success was very little, and it wasn't that it was horrible horribly, it was a little too dark and it just missed something.This was Disney's first animated PG movie, okay, it was violent, but not much more frightening than other Disney films in my opinion. The Great Mouse Detective was just as creepy and Beauty and the Beast was just a scary. But that's of little importance because they were much better films. The thing about The Black Cauldron is that it was shown to be dark and scary, but I think they could've have given the Horned King (John Hurt) a better portrayal evil.I enjoyed the characters, mostly. Disney has always had its little annoying side characters to bring the comic relief, but as far as Gurgi&#133; Taran (Grant Bardsley) is a young man who dreams of one day becoming a great warrior. All he has learned is to be the best pig keeper assistant, what a sad life. Taran lives his with uncle Dallben (Freddie Jones) at a little farm along with their precious piggy, named Hen Wen. Hen Wen is a special pig for he has powers to see the future. Ounce the Horned King of the dead discovers of Hen Wen's powers he immediately summons his soldiers from the underworld to capture the bacon. The Horned King desires the dark Black Cauldron that can conjure an army of infinite numbers. Taran gets to fulfill his life long dream, to be sent on a grand expedition full of danger and a promise to keep the pig away from evils hands. Daydreaming, Taran inevitable loses Hen Wen and is in fear of breaking his promise. He calls out for him, but instead of a pig he finds a, ummm, something named Gurgi (John Byner). Gurgi is a very annoying furry creature that plays the best friend act on Taran to get his juicy apple. He gets the apple, but loses his new best friend.Hen Wen was captured and brought to the dark whereabouts of the Horned King. Taran sneaks in to get his pig, but ends up captured and thrown into the dungeon. I would like to point out that the attitude of the Horned King was unrealistic. They call him the definition of evil and the master of sin, yet he shows signs of kindness of sparing Taran's life to be locked up instead, and will only strangle his little troll sidekick for failure. For a Disney film this is acceptable, but I just don't like exaggerating a character. Anyway, when Taran is locked up he meets a young princess, named Eilonwy (Susan Sheridan), who has been captured before him because it was thought that her strange floating ball of light could tell the future. Pointlessly to say, I like the young teenage relationship, while their hormones is blooming and discovering attractiveness to the opposite sex. So they both argue time to time, but they like each other overall.One thing I didn't understand was the significance of the magical sword of the long dead king that Taran finds. An ancient sword with magic to cut through metal, and it fights with a mind of its own. I would have thought that it would have more of a purpose to the plot other than it making Taran feel like a warrior, and a bargain trade for the cauldron. He really loved that sword, and felt invincible wielding it.I'll leave the story at that, and let you decide the rest. The Black Cauldron was impressive for its looks, but disappointing for most everything else. The only characters that I cared for were Taran and Eilonwy, and the Horned King was pretty cool. Everybody else was just annoying and pointless. I've pointed out Gurgi, and there's Fflewddur Fflam (Nigel Hawthorne), weird name I know, who tags along with his very expressionist harp. I could see the film going on without these two characters, though on the other hand without having Gurgi&#133; Though there is one thing that I find highly interesting, and that's all the sh*t this movie went through. Just count the dollars and the days this movie had in the process. It was expensive and it took several years to accomplish. However, the numbers were low for the movies prophet and it took more than a decade to come to video. Fascinating really, and despite this film being rated PG it went through some major editing. The new chairman of Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg, had ordered the filmmakers to redo and edit the more intense and dark themes that would draw away a family audience.

This movie is SO boring I could barely get through it. This is the first and only Disney movie that is genuinely boring. The script is dull, the animation lacks any style or originality, the characters remain clichéd and undeveloped throughout, and the story is so plodding I was on the verge of fast forwarding... (And that's saying a lot, because I'm into animation in a big way.) Easily Disney's worst film, and it has nothing to do with the grave content- This could be pastel and singsong and it would still be totally awful- The script is totally devoid of anything meaningful or interesting. If you want a GOOD animated movie that is serious fantasy, get The Secret of NIMH. The Black Cauldron? Quite possibly the only Disney film that should have stayed in the Vault. My score 3 out of 10.

Like 'Oliver and Company' (which is better but not quite as underrated as this one despite my original claim of Oliver being the most overlooked Disney film from the 80s), I also thought that it was originally released in the 90s but due to its obscurity, it was in fact released in 1985 and it was a box office failure. Unfortunately I didn't get to see 'The Black Cauldron' until I was 20 when I rented the DVD from my now-defunct local Blockbuster and I really quite enjoyed it then. Today I watched this for the first time in nearly seven years on Amazon Prime Instant Video and sadly I found my second viewing more underwhelming than my first viewing.The film's weak points include its somewhat slow pacing, the similarities between Dallben and Fflewddur Flam, the frog jumping from the cleavage of one of the witches being a bit too adult for this film, the dragons looking similar to Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' in dragon form, the darker scenes lacking in detail, Eilownwy's line Use the sword and Taran using it being similar to something out of a Star Wars film and, as the Nostalgia Critic said in his Disneycember review for this film, the more powerful/dramatic parts of Elmer Bernstein's score sounding similar to that from 'Ghostbusters,' which came out the year before this film did. As another reviewer has said, I also found the demise of the Horned King very dark albeit its impressive scanimation effects.On a more positive note, the strongest points of this film include its engaging if somewhat complicated story, the animation being smooth with effective lighting and cel-shading in parts in spite of its sketchy, linear look, the backgrounds being intricately detailed, some funny moments, parts of Bernstein's score sounding different from that in 'Ghostbusters' by making them sound medieval, more upbeat and majestic and most of the characters being diverse. Taran is talkative yet heroic, Eilonwy is one of Disney's most underrated princesses although helpful and gentle, the Horned King is sinister and reminds me of Skeletor from He-Man while Gurgi, Hen-Wen and the Fairfolk (small fairy-like creatures) are cute. I also found the small green goblin character comical and he made me consider him an early basis of Pain and Panic from 'Hercules.' Although I would like to have had the characters to speak in Welsh accents, their voice acting was full of clarity, especially from Grant Bardsley as Taran and Susan Sheridan (also the voice of Moomin in the 1990 2D-animated adaptation of Tove Jansson's books and Noddy from my childhood favourite stop-motion show 'Noddy's Adventures in Toyland') as Eilonwy. All in all, this may be the weakest feature-length Disney film I have reviewed to date here on IMDb but it was worth watching for its special effects, story and range of characters. 7.5/10.

The characters are introduced but not explored, not like a typical Disney film. Its hard enough remembering their poorly created names let alone feel anything for them.The poorly conceived villain wants to wipe out all the living in his land.Usually this would be an admirable goal for your typical maniac villain but in this case it is laughable all but a handful of the living in this land are already under his control (either in his dungeon or they are his soldiers).The only things that aren't are an old guy (named whatever) who lives with a boy (the hero) and a prophetic piglet (Hen-Wen) and their pitiful farmyard animals. So basically the evil king is going to raise an army of the undead to wipe out a small farm oh and how could I forget the only other living thing that is the nauseating cuddly but cleptomaniac dog looking doowacky. The clepto dies, and in the final scene, his cuddly-wuddly body is returned to our hero and you think for just a moment this film might rescue itself if they live the thief dead, but no, they bring him back to life and remembering this means I am going to reduce the vote from 3 to 2 out of 10. The one good thing that I hope came from this film is Disney learned a few lessons in story-writing (which I thought that would have had down by the mid-80s).

(Yes, I enjoy 80s culture.)  Fantasy films like this run on four theme elements good, evil, design and differentiations.  The fifth element is trickier, the public reception to the constructed universe.Spoilers exist...The first and second run on stereotypes--the page warrior, the virginal princess, the Dark Lord.  The Villian design is from 'Heavy Metal'-style TV cartoons.  The witches are French stereotypes how else do you explain the red hair, appetite for frogs, and power scheming?  The minstrel is the play-within element, the actor playing the actor.  Gurgi is the Jew/Russian stand-in.  Disney's images come from past work--'Fantasia', 'Beauty', 'Dalmatians'.  Interestingly, Disney tries to make everything appear normal in our distinct Western configuration while Scott wanted 'Legend' to be hyperreal and hyperbole--just look at Darkness.  By comparison, the Horned King is Emperor Palpatine, plain.'Conan' shifted our interpretation of the first element, 'Legend' mastered the third and 'Dragonslayer' emphasized the fourth (the most daring so far).  The biggest differentiations here come in lesser details.  The dragons, the skeletons, and the atmosphere we've seen before, but to lesser effect.  I noticed in 'Mulan' how Disney kept from showing war-dead, lest they spoil the happy mood they spent years perfecting.  According to IMDb trivia, Katzenberg censored this upon release, probably wrecking the more mature content.  He then decided to make his own version with 'Shrek' after defecting.  Meanwhile, Peter Jackson decided that since he has $300 million to blow, he wants everything.  So he turns elves and orcs into Aryans (either physically or philosophically) and all Gollum's mannerisms stem from Gurgi.  Some things don't change...Overall, this is not as complex as 'Wizards'.  Not as visual as 'Legend'.  Not as world-weary as 'Dragonslayer' (which had no comic relief).  We didn't want this foreign theme in our pop culture ideas--mostly sentimental--of what Disney movies are supposed to be (the same fate befell the 'Oz' sequel) so this has historical significance in charting Disney's retreat to Phase III formula.Bernstein copies his 'Ghostbusters' compilation for the score.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material "},{"Title":"Disney rewrite of The Lord of the Rings","Date":"4 April 2005","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" So many striking similarities between Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Black CauldronA magical item, the black cauldron/the ring, granting excessive power.

"},{"Title":"Is this Disney's worst animated feature?","Date":"27 September 1999","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  I think not, but a strong case can be made.  SOMETHING sets it apart, and it's this it's not so much a Disney feature as a Saturday morning cartoon, part of the same world as He Man and the Masters of the Universe, with more than a passing resemblance to other backlot fantasies of the 1980s - I refer not to minor masterpieces like `Ladyhawk' or expensive fiascos like `Willow', but to things with titles like `Syzgar Sword of Destiny'.It's SO echt-80s fantasy that it almost works.  It's good to see Disney wandering over some new ground and bringing back the occasional luridly dark and lushly cheesy image.  In a fitful way they grabbed the unfamiliar genre and milked it for all it was worth.Unfortunately it's not worth very much.  You know the drill a hero from out in the sticks sets out on arbitrary Dungeons-and-Dragons type quest to recover the magic whatever it may be in order to defeat one of Sauron's distant cousins.  The hero here is Taran, and the quest ...  Well, there's this cauldron that can turn corpses into loyal undead servants, and a villain called the Horn King who is after the cauldron, and a magical pig - Taran's pig - who alone can tell the Horned King where the cauldron is.  If the Horned King finds the cauldron he will take over the world and make everyone into an undead slave.  The solution, clearly, is to kill the pig.  But Taran doesn't and moreover, he is willing at one point to let the Horned King know where the cauldron is in exchange for the pig's life.  This is surely carrying sentiment too far.  This is a deeply confused quest and it's usually unclear just what Taran hopes to achieve.Characters are weak the Horned King is a kind of rococo Skeletor, about as menacing as the average action figure; his henchmen are the kind that shout, `Catch them, you fools'; Taran is as shallow is a rain puddle; and the characters he picks up along the way follow him about like flies, with as much reason.  (It's not all Disney's fault the author of the books also had a tendency to substitute mannerism for character.)  And the dialogue is so baldly utilitarian it might have been better if the characters hadn't been allowed to speak at all.  I wonder why this is.  I'm sure if one scoured the five books one could have found at least 80 minutes' worth of decent speech, somewhere.All this is bad; but what makes it heartbreaking is the poor animation.  (It was a real shock reading the credits, because I recognised ALL the names.  Everyone involved has done much better work since.)  Many of the flaws are the kind you'd expect to see of a Saturday morning Gurgi suddenly growing an extra coat of skin whenever someone grabs him by the neck; Taran and Eilonwy running as if they want NOT to get away, away from pursuers who are giving chase as if to avoid catching up; weighty rocks made of chalk and geese with wings of rubber.  I can't capture the low quality by citing instances.  The animation is just not up to scratch, and some characters - such as Taran, who is on screen virtually all the time - NEVER move convincingly.In short a bad movie.  But I must admit I sort of enjoyed it, in a way I didn't enjoy, say, `Oliver and Company' (which IS Disney's worst animated feature).  I can't think of many objective grounds of recommendation.  One thing worth mentioning is Disney animation's only extended cleavage gag.  While it's not in the least erotic I'll bet the animator enjoyed himself.

The characters are not at all following like other Disney characters, with the whole pig boy who wants to become a hero who acts scared really and the princess I found most annoying with her flying ball and that old guy is the same way too. Disney can't think of anything new at all. "}]
