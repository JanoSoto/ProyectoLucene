[{"Title":"One of the few black comedies that work. The filmmakers take advantage of the funny material. *** (out of four)","Date":"7 May 2001","Score":"45 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French	According to Harald Zwart, the director of One Night at McCool's, this film is a dark comedy about the power of women over men, and how a group of people can all perceive different realities. It's the same story told from three different points of view, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened, which nobody really knows. 	One Night at McCool's marks the feature film directorial debut of Zwart, an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. We have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists that tendency. He captures a specific humorous truth in One Night at McCool's, from an inventive, complex screenplay by the late Stan Seidel, even if it is often somewhat perplexing. 	One Night At McCool's features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of American Beauty, but in others, it is a world apart. 	It all started one night at McCool's explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman), arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, as an individual treats her unkindly. He stands up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant The sex and the violence, all in one night &#150; it's a little much. But who could turn a jewel like Jewel away.	Jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household. For Randy, she lights a few fires, both positive and negative, the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways.  It is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles-even the costuming of Jewel is relative to the man telling the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage. Randy is unsure what to make of her, an awakening to his otherwise boring, road to nowhere life. The most intriguing element of this movie is Jewel herself, however,  deliciously played by the always delightful Liv Tyler (Armageddon). She is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. Her motives are all too simple, not truthfully diabolical or evil; she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. 	The film has a lot of fun with its material. From the enthusiastically entertaining cast, to its violently hilarious showdown, One Night at McCool's takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas. What makes the movie even funnier is how the three men's points of view differ. The actors have a lot of fun with their characters, too. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Reiser fits his kinky, squirmy part quite well; Douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances; Dillon gives his character arrogant personality, even though Randy is a lackluster nobody; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit. She reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in American Beauty.	One Night at McCool's is the first film to come from Michael Douglas' new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine, and sexy production. Along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure, but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story. The movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic. This is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; i.e., the black comedy. Many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical. One Night at McCool's is one of the few that actually work.

If the answer is yes watch One night at McCool's and the secret finally reveals. Luckily it's not the only reason to see this film. One night at McCool's is surprisingly effective, successful and entertaining mixture of tongue-in-a-cheek crime film and wild comedy. Liv Tyler is divine, Matt Dillon's performance amusing and Paul Reiser and John Goodman are just as fantastic as always when they're really giving their best. Michael Douglas' supporting role is also one of the funniest details of the film and let's not forget Andrew Dice Clay's fabulous appearance as Utah. If you love good, black crime comedies like Guy Ritchie's films Lock, stock and two smoking barrels and Snatch or if you just worship Liv Tyler this nicely written, well-made and cleverly acted little treat can certainly be worth of your time.

Its form is more sophisticated than what I expected, and its randomness was superb.  The thoughts behind the movie (mysogeny, sadism, stupid men) are are infantile.  That's what I have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women, but it loathes men.  It doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men, really.  It seems that way because of the form, but the ending says it all.  Nobody cares.The form has the first 2/3 of the movie told in flashback by three characters Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the mysogenistic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid, holier-than-thou cop.  The story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities.  Reiser's BBQ fantasy is a great touch.  In the end, we never really know the truth, and nothing is what it seems.  Dillon was never that innocent, etc. Actually, the rest of the movie is funny too.  From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly-obviousness of Tyler's manipulations, the movie seems to have an energy all its own.  Everything is just out of the blue, and nothing seems to make sense.  Do we really care if it does?  No.  It is also a very dark comedy, but has a shallow presentation.  Think Nurse Betty, or Jawbreaker.  Very candy coated outside, dark chewy inside.  If you like your movies random, dark, or just purely mean, see this movie.  This one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool's.8/10 "},{"Title":"What do people have against this film?","Date":"5 December 2001","Score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I have to say I am surprised at the response of people on this website to this film. So much so I felt I should say something about it.Ok, this film certainly isn't Ben-Hur or The Searchers, its not a profound and streaming epic, but for what it is I can think of none better.It is a very funny and almost bizarre film. It is original, the cast act their hearts out and it is very rewarding to watch, the direction is unique, almost perky, there are no plot twists you can guess well in advance - there are no real plot twists. There are developments but they are not meant to catch you off guard. The behaviour of the main males is entirely beleivable and Liv Tyler's blatant sexuality is purposeful - if she didn't come across as a woman who a man would do anything for the plot would be null and void. As it is - even the most vocal Liv Tyler haters will be won over by her performance.Each of the male unfortunates are so hilarious in their sheer devotion to Tyler, Goodman as the cop whose wife died years before and who sees in Tyler something he hasn't felt in years. Reiser as a hot shot lawyer who wants to have felt something before he dies is completely hilarious in his Tyler fetish. And Matt Dillon as the slightly dim initial boyfriend manages to acheive gormlessness perfectly. Whether these are all instances of excellent casting or not, who cares. I laughed throughout this film. Admittedly not every line has you bent over in stitches and some of th emore obvious jokes seem designed for fans of the Farrelly Brothers type, but there is an overall atmosphere of farce to the film that you can't help but feel glad you aren't involved.To summarise what I am rambling on about - basically this film is not going to go down in history as one of the all time greats - but it does have cult potential. It is highly original, brilliantly acted and it is completely aware of what it is mocking - beautiful women getting what they want and the sad fact that men couldn't care what they are forced to do as long as there is a stunning female waiting for them at the end.Personally I think anyone who feels strongly against this film can speak to me abou tit because I would be interested to find out why. Very very good. And I hope it does become a cult hit because it certainly deserves something after the way it has been slated.

The three main characters each met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men go through the same situations, but when they tell of them to other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. That is a very good concept, probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The acting is equally good, not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. The comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it.

It helps to first check your brains at the door or at the side of the couch. But, much to your surprise, the movie is a winner. It's a delightful film about four whacky characters that are so driven by their out-of-control basic instincts that you have to follow their trail and laugh along at them. And most of their instincts revolve around sex. Liv Tyler, playing the irresistible Jewell, delivers with little left to your imagination. In one of the sexiest performances I've seen on film in years, Liv keeps all men hot and aroused, both on and off the screen. Paul Reiser and John Goodman had some hysterical moments as two guys who are willing to give up everything for the woman of their dreams. And Matt Dillon did a fine job as the loser who had nothing going for him, but got sucked into the sex and violent world of the only woman who would give him the time of day. There was an unusual, for him, performance by Michael Douglas, as the con man and recipient of the long narrative tale told by Matt Dillon. It seemed that Michael was there to oversee the film, allowing the rest of the fine cast to do their thing and get the accolades. He played it very low key, which was perfect for a guy who's not known as a comedic actor. So get yourselves ready for a very funny, light, and fast-paced sex romp. It'll be one enjoyable night.

It probably doesn't help matters much that I'm one of the few men (?) that doesn't think Liv Tyler is all that hot.  Seeing as her sexuality is the main point of the plot, I had a hard time believing that all these guys would fall for her so easily.  I'm not sure if she is just a terrible actress or was purposefully acting bad in order to develop her conning character. The lame and overdone sex scenes must have been done to placate the teenage boys that Liv may have drawn to the theaters. Matt Damon and John Goodman's characters are excellent, however, and provided quite a few laughs in their roles.  The retelling of the same set of events through different viewpoints is always interesting and several comical retellings were what saved this movie from being a total wash.

Yeah it's hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty (giving an radiantly picture-perfect performance), as she simply has tongues wagging. 'One Night at McCool's' is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old-fashion shades tied in to its familiar, but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she's milking it to her advantage. When you see Tyler, no wonder why they are infatuated and would do anything&#x85; that's anything to see 'her' happy and living 'her' dreams. Just like Tyler, there's something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who's great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the hired assassin with cool-ease, but a questionable hairdo) really having a good time with their roles. The consuming plot opens up with the main three characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she's having on them to lead to an insane climax. There's an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl). Howard Zwart's direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script's quick-fire gags and frenetically fun, if complicated situations. One of the best under-the-radar comedies in the last decade, which will have you under Tyler's thumb.

(One Night at McCool's) is one interesting crime comedy. I loved how all the story is told by different viewpoints, having some meanings to say as well, unlike the absurdity of (Pulp Fiction), and more close to the wisdom of (Citizen Kane) and (Rashômon) yet wittier.It says a lot about how woman defines the men's facts and perspectives. Look at the intellectual structure of the whole thing  there is who sees woman as just a body, a lovemaking machine, an equal to the human desire (the lawyer), or an angel, an image of purity, an equal to the human eminence (the police officer), and then the lead/the husband who's in the middle, seeing her as body and soul.Further. Because the first 2 characters went to extremes in their faith, the movie punishes them at the end. They, also, were less smart to grasp the truth that the lead (Matt Dillon) grasped, and (Michael Douglas)'s character dominates. And when the last with the heroine get along eventually, feeling the harmony together, it's more than bitter sneer at the crazy violence of our world, where these 2 killers deserve to be its masters indeed. Simply here&#x85;the faithlessness wins since it's a crazy world (good shootout at the end to embody that by the way). As you see, love doesn't live here anymore. Instead you'd have cheating, stealing and killing. So, agree or not, you have to admire the movie's question, or originally its wish to ask  Do we live an evil world? Or is woman an evil world herself ? To answer rightly see first how all the movie's men were, in a way or another, victims for the heroine. Except the one who was as evil as her, or his evil completes hers !I hate to be this movie's writer. While he shows different viewpoint towards the woman, all in love with her, he himself sees her as deceiver illusion. And whenever there is a solid truth inside of her, then it's one winning evil, as if she's the most beautiful incarnation of the devil ! The acting is flawless, with cast I really don't love most of it unless here. Enough to say that I'm not a (Liv Tyler) fan, but what a halo she has this time, pushing you to believe her every minute. For me it's the best of her yet. As for the pace, it is thrilling. And really, what a wit.It's rare to have a meaningful crime comedy while being so comic. It's rare to have a movie makes the sophisticated plot so attractive and lovable. And it's rare to make the black comedy that colorful. So I loved it, it amuses me on many levels, despite its point of view towards women, otherwise, it's a movie about the weakness and the stupidity of men !

I must say it was actually pretty good. The film is completely ludicrous in plot but it is a comedy.

I am a big Liv Tyler fan after Lord of the Rings becuase she is so attrcative and depsite what critics say she actually can act. I know perhaps films like Armeggeddon are not the best to judge critical response because everyone in that film got criticised for their performances. Anyway, while this film is entertaining it has now real memorable moments of comedy that don't involve Liv half naked and hosing herself or something. I thought that the performances in particular Dillon, Goodman and Michael Douglas were all great and also a narrow show stealer, from the other men, Paul Reiser is hilarious you can't help but laugh out loud as he is running around in bondage gear, oh wait that could go down as a memorable moment.

I got used to it fairly quickly and found myself enjoying the story MORE because it was unfolding from the three different viewpoints. So do yourself a favor and go see this one.

Neither will you be disappointed if you actually want to see a genuinely funny outtake on the power gorgeous women have over men.Liv Tyler stars as Jewel Valentine, a lady with a porn star name, porn star looks, and&#133; well a porn star appetite for doing that thing with as many guys as she can. One Night At McCool's tells us the story of three men's obsessions for her. Matt Dillon is Randy, a penniless bar tender who she moves in with. John Goodman is Detective Dehling, a law enforcement officer who thinks Randy isn't good for her, and Paul Reiser is Carl, Randy's lawyer cousin who has also shared carnal knowledge with Ms. Valentine.Told in a flashback format, Randy has hired Mr. Burmeister (Douglas) to kill Jewel and put an end to his misery. Harold Zwart's directing is spot on with the glossy almost playboy-esque panning and the three male leads each fulfil their roles as flawed, female-obsessed nobodies. Michael Douglas's clever cameo is intelligent and clever too.Liv Tyler is the pick of the all-star cast though; her sultry performance oozes sex appeal and provides the chemistry with the male leads that is needed to add credibility to the story.There are few laugh out loud moments, but it is the throwaway lines that make the film. John Goodman's overweight cop describes his fascination with Jewel by admitting `I could barely eat&#133; well nothing deep fried anyway!' The Village People moment towards the end is hilarious too.And hey, if that's not enough for you then there's always Liv Tyler with a whip!7/10 "},{"Title":"Reba AND Dice?","Date":"18 April 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I've got to be honest, I was taken a bit off guard when I saw that Andrew Dice Clay and Reba McEntire both had considerable roles in the same movie.

This is one of the few films I return to over and over again whenever I want to laugh. There aren't many films that can continue to make you laugh after multiple viewings, so I can't help but give One Night at McCools high praise.What makes the script so clever is that it is the same story told from three different perspectives (i.e., by three different characters), and each character's bias in telling the story is clearly evident without going over the top. The filmmaker did an excellent job overall with continuity, which is crucial for a film like this, since many scenes had to be filmed multiple times, from each character's perspective. For example, Matt Dillon's character, Randy, was a pretty decent guy from his own perspective, but behaved like a human obscenity from Detective Dehling's point of view. To make those scenes work there must be continuity in blocking, dialogue, etc., and the filmmaker nailed it for the most part.Unfortunately, this style of film-making requires the viewer to think a little bit, and I believe that is the source of so many mediocre reviews.Casting is perfect Matt Dillon is the gullible nice guy who loses everything he has to a woman, without the formality of a marriage and divorce. Paul Reiser is a pretentious, self-absorbed attorney with a penchant for bondage. John Goodman plays a good cop who is instantly saved from grief over his wife's death by a delusion. And of course, Liv Tyler just oozes sensuality as the femme fatale of the story.The supporting cast of Michael Douglas, Andrew Dice Clay, Richard Jenkins and Reba McEntire are excellent in their respective roles--especially Andrew Dice Clay's portrayal of two characters with similarly mean temperaments.Some of the one-liners in this film easily rank with comedy genius that made Monty Python and the Holy Grail, A Fish Called Wanda, and Mystery Men into highly quotable films. Paul Reiser in particular, who I generally can't stand to watch for very long, finds a role that fits his style perfectly here.I also felt that the cinematography and lighting were fabulous. Just look at the lighting inside the crowded bar, or inside the church. I notice how well this was done more and more with each subsequent viewing, but when you first watch the film it merely enhances the storytelling. So the filmmakers deserve a lot of credit there.The bottom line is that most people will definitely find this film well worth watching, and many will probably add it to their favorites list. So I highly recommend watching One Night at McCools to see what it does for you.

The fact that people are sooo subjective when it comes to discussing love, is just put on screen very nicely. The second thing I liked was Liv Tyler. She's got that charm, that would really make men go for her. Especially if they are blinded by love. Everyone, from soft lawyers, to assassins. I really think that Douglas is in a way the brightest, but in the same way the most stupid of them. Not only does he hear how good that girl can fool around with men, but he still ignores that fact,  and even tries to make her want him...though, I believe she would've gone out with him anyway.The rest of the actors are really well for their roles...The plot is, as I said before indirectly, pretty nice, but...but I fear this was not really what I would've wanted to see in a good comedy. I don't consider that crime and sex must always be contained in a good comedy...and if they are, let them be well in their place. I do not consider it was all so good for this movie,  but still things haven't gone really bad.Maybe the thing I really didn't like is that the action is somewhat idiotic at the beginning with Utah, but anyway, the idea of blinding love is really becoming a boring thing.After I draw the line, and add up the plus and minus points, I think the movie is just average.

Not just smile, but bust a gut, wipe tears out of my eyes, clutch my side, think I'm going to stop breathing, roar with laughter.  Frighteningly enough I realized it had been months.  Ever since There's Something About Mary, directors and writers have equated super gross-out with funny.  However, the recent spate of disastrous comedies -  Tomcats and Freddie Got Fingered instantly come to mind- have hopefully shown just how wrong this thinking is.   Does anyone in Hollywood remember how to make a good comedy?   I'm still undecided.Jewel is the kind of woman that every man wishes for tall, gorgeous, aggressive and a demon in the sack.  Unfortunately as the saying goes, if something seems too good to be true&#133;  Jewel's charms are backed up by a penchant for philandering, double cross and murder.  After one night at a back street dive of a bar, three unlucky men - a bartender, a lawyer and a police officer - learn what it's like to have there prayers and worst nightmares come true when they're caught up in her whirlwind.One Night at McCool's plays like the Japanese classic Rashomon -different people recount their experiences of the same event and we're never quite sure which one to believe.  This movie marks the breakout performance of Liv Tyler both literally and figuratively - as Jewel she is practically spilling out of her clothing, and abandons her innocent persona delivering one of the best vixen performances in recent memory.  She is positively wicked.   Matt Dillon is enjoyable as the pitiable sop who, although his life is destroyed by her conniving, can't seem to let her go.  Paul Reiser manages not to be too annoying as a sleazy lawyer, while John Goodman, who seems to be wheezing through his lines, is quite distracting.  Michael Douglas' turn as a slimy coifed contract killer with an agenda all his own is quite amusing and you want to take a shower every time he is onscreen.  Andrew Dice Clay (remember him?) and Reba McEntire round out the cast with decent performances.Aside from the aforementioned movie reference, One Night at McCool's borrows liberally from such classic films as   Coolhand Luke and Falling Down. While I enjoyed these and other manipulations, the movie spends a little too much time trying to be clever and consequently suffers from several noticeable lulls.  What I found most disappointing however was the surprise ending that many people have commented on - although I did laugh at it, the effect would have been much greater if it had not been  revealed in the trailers (on the off chance you have not seen them, I will say no more)!!  I laughed nonetheless. McCool's succeeds largely because it is subtle, well acted and most importantly, funny.

First of all because of Liv Tyler. She looks very hot in all these tiny little dresses and I can't believe there is any man who can't keep his eyes of the picture when she fills the screen. I also liked it that the story is told from different perspectives. Each of the three leading males (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser, John Goodman) tells their story of how they met Jewel (Liv Tyler), which leads to opposite retellings of certain situations, which is sometimes very funny. And the last scene with Paul Reiser is hilarious. By far the biggest laugh of the movie.Perhaps the story isn't very credible and perhaps the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, but who cares? They are funny. OK, the film isn't very realistic, but heck... it's a comedy and comedies are often funny because of the exaggeration of the situations and/or characters.

No one had a midwestern accent, there were no gigantic flowering trees, no weird weather, no one complaining about allergies, no gays, jews or black people, not one street with a French name that everyone mispronounces, no one drank Budweiser, they didn't shop at Dierbergs or Schnucks, no traffic jams, no highway construction, no angry references to Hwy 70, no angry black people. There wasn't even a shot of the gateway Arch or the Mississippi so I'd at least know I was supposed to be in St. Louis. The only thing the film got sort of right was the dorky Highway patrol uniforms, but even that was awful. The only really sign was the Mark McGwire poster, but he just sort of transcends St. Louis with the 70 home runs and all. The only part that even remotely looked like St. Louis was where Paul Reiser lived which looked a lot like the new suburban neighborhoods that are all over St. Louis county, but the lawyer's house? C'mon, you wouldn't build a house like that in St. Louis unless you wanted to replace your windows every two years from taking a king-size beating during hail storms in the spring and fall.About half way through this film it dawned on me that these people weren't trying to make a comedy, they were trying to make film noir. What could have been a delightful comedy or a dark and twisted film noir becomes neither. Just a crappy film with wasted talent, bad directing, bad casting and uneccessary violence. The violent ending came completely from left field and the way Paul Reiser is offed screams Chuck Jones. The violence isn't funny enough to be a comedy, and the comedy is too goofy for it to be considered film noir.Let's say an A-list director with some good sense was handed this script and saw the noir-ish potential here. They would have cast someone like Brad Pitt or even Edward Norton in Dillon's role, Douglas would have taken Goodman's character, Jack Nicholas would have taken Douglas', Paul Reiser can keep his role and Liv Tyler ... well, she's basically playing a role any pretty actress in Hollywood could have handled, but let's go with Halle Berry ... she needs some work and she could pull off the vamp/girl-next-door thing quite well. The mawkish and cartoonish aspects could be filtered out, more character development thrown in, a little more introspection and better dialog and a better staged ending would make this a movie worth watching - if this is supposed to be film noir.Now if they wanted this to be a comedy, the should have gotten rid of the stupid blood bath ending, which came completely from left field and replace it with something more light and funny. I mean, killing off half of your principal characters, especially the most funny one and the nicest one, kind of kill the mood, so to speak and leave the viewer who was expecting a comedy feeling cheated.So someone needs to take their booty back to film school on this one. It COULD have been a good movie, but it just wasn't. "},{"Title":"Randy, I think not having a job is starting to get to you. No, it's not having any money that's starting to get to me! <Jewel>","Date":"1 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  SPOILERS - I rented this DVD based on the excellent cast and what seemed like an interesting story. The writer and director made what they considered a comedy, but it is laced with enough needlessly foul language and gratuitous shootings that it dragged my vote down to a 4 of 10, and I would not recommend it to anyone. This is Jewel's (Liv Tyler) story, about how all she wants is to settle down and have a home that is decorated just the way she envisions. She starts out with one boyfriend (Andrew Clay)who she shoots during his attempted robbery of McCool's, so she can be with Randy(Matt Dillon). The title One Night At McCool's is a reference to that night which directly or indirectly also dragged into her life John Goodman and Paul Reiser. Michael Douglas plays a hit man who never quite gets to do his job.Jewel has this magical quality which mesmerizes almost any guy who makes eye contact with her. The climax of the film comes when all 3 guys, plus the hit man, plus the dead boyfriend's twin brother, end up converging on Randy's house. There is a very bloody, in slow motion, shootout which results in one good guy and one bad guy getting killed. Jewel rides off with the hit man, Oh, you have a house... right after a dumpster falls on Reiser after he escapes the bloodbath in the house. The comedic story of Jewel and her effect on the various guys could have been done well, and entertainingly, with little or no explicit violence and without all the explicit foul language.  Unfortunately these amateur writers and directors don't understand that the viewing audience have higher standards. They also insulted a large fraction of their audience with the scene where the priest throws aside the hosts to use a sacred chalice to drink wine. That is not comedy.I do want to point out that Reba McEntire did a fine job as the shrink. She now has her own TV show, and is a natural actor.

Basicly this movie says that women are treacherous and manipulative to get what they want and men are either stupid, easily blinded, or basic scum. Close to the truth, really is the truth for many people (many not all). Any way this is another example of nothing original and nothing spectacular. Just another movie in this year of the bad movie. The acting was at best average (i've seen better from pretty much every one in the movie), the way it was done has been done before (and much better i might add), and the basic story was decent at best.

"},{"Title":"It's a little dumb, but worth renting.","Date":"4 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" One Night at McCool's is an edge of seat thrill ride. This is a movie not to be missed. The story is told from three different points of view. Liv Tyler (Armageddon) breaks out of her shell (and her dress) and put on an outrageous performance as Jewel, the object of everyone's desire. She'll do just about anything and anyone to get what she wants. She's attractive, she's alluring, and she will make your life a living Hell if she doesn't get what she wants. Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary, Wild Things) does a good job portraying a bar tender whose life gets turned upside down when one night he meets up with Liv Tyler. When her former boyfriend, Utah, played by Andrew Dice Clay attacks her, he comes to the rescue, well sort of. When Liv and Matt are done doing the deed for the first time, Utah forces him to go back to bar where Liv gives him what for. Paul Reiser (TV's MAD ABOUT YOU) plays Matt's dumb-founded cousin, who really doesn't serve a purpose in the movie. Reiser is just like Benjamin Brat in Miss Congeniality and the good he does in the movie is taking hits. He may be a fine actor, but he serves no real purpose in the movie. Reiser's obsession with leather in this movie is freaky but completely unnecessary. Although Reiser delivers a weak performance, John Goodman's character (Blues Brothers 2000) delivers an outstanding performance to more than make up for Reiser. I have to admit I had mixed feelings when I heard John Goodman was in the film. I wasn't a big fan of such movies as Blues Brothers 2000, however he was good on TV's Roseanne and I liked him in some other movies he's done. Watching a John Goodman movie is like playing Russian Roulette, you either win big or lose it all. However, this is a movie not to be missed. John Goodman plays a detective investigating the murder of Utah. When he saw Liv, he fell in love with her. He continues to fall in love and obsesses about her. John Goodman's performance is one of his best. Michael Douglas is the hit man that Dillon hires to kill Tyler after a falling out with Taylor. He acts in and produces the film, and although he has a small role in the film Douglas delivers an outstanding performance as a well-to-do hit man. The story itself is a little far fetched. It was a little slow in some of the scenes (most of the scenes with Reiser) but in all a pretty good movie. Out of 10, I would give it a 6.75. It was well plotted and had a good cast. Liv Tyler is wonderful as the sexy girl next door. If you liked this movie some recommendations for movies to see would be There's Something About Mary, What Planet Are You From, and Wild Things.

The girl, Jewel, who turns out to be enormously attractive, comes along with him to his home, whereupon they make love to each other. A little later Randy finds out that the 'rape' in the car was a trick to rob him. Jewel, however, finally chooses for Randy when she kills her 'partner'. Afterwards the two become a couple, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't do any seducing anymore... If I am being rational, I have to admit that this is a dumb movie, with an inveracious plot and a lot of coincidences. But 'One night at McCool's' is one of those movies in which these weaknesses can't stop you from enjoying it. In my opinion a comedy is successful when it makes you laugh and keeps you amused from the beginning until the end. That's why I can say that this is a great comedy, because it kept me on the edge of my seat for the full 93 minutes and I sometimes couldn't stop laughing. Plus, 'McCool's' contains one of the sexiest chicks I have ever seen in a movie Liv Tyler, who plays 'femme fatale' Jewel. Therefore the fact that the entire supporting cast is instantly seduced by her is one of the few parts of the plot that are NOT inveracious. Paul Reiser and John Goodman are incredibly funny as Randy's lawyer and the police investigator who can't get their eyes (and hands) off Jewel, just like me. Don't miss the funny reference to 'Falling Down', which also starred Michael Douglas.8/10  "},{"Title":"Much better than I expected!","Date":"5 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I went to see One Night at McCool's expecting the usual dumb tripe that passes for comedy these days.

In the vain of movies such as &#145;There's something about Mary' and &#145;Austin Powers', comes this hilarious comedy about a Woman who changes the lives of three men. I have not laughed so hard like that in alongtime. As current man on the singles list, I am keeping a watchful eye out for a girl to date. I hope I don't run into someone like Jewel, because I am sure I could not handle her!She is one hot lady. And after just one night at McCool's, she is the only three unsuspecting men can think about. There's the bartender who was working that night. The lawyer who stayed past closing time. Then there is the cop who showed up to investigate the crime scene. Did we forget to mention the crime? Three men all lusting after one sexy woman &#150; it's going to be nothing but trouble after this night at McCool's.This is one of the funniest and smartest movies I have seen in alongtime. The script this movie had was incredible. I enjoyed how all three stories are first told to the audience, then are brought together in a climatic ending. It had an original feel to it, with I'm sure many little touched add in on set. The director of One Night At McCool's was Norwegian Harald  Zwart, who must have very funny sense of humour and imaginative mind, because I really enjoyed what he did with this film. But the standout part of this movie was the cast that it contained. The star of the show was Hollywood beau Liv Tyler. She suited the role of &#145;Jewel' perfectly. I love how in almost every scene Jewel hypnotize the men that are lusting after her. It was a big part of this movie, as it is an important part of the movie. I am glad that Liv Tyler got the nod to play jewel, as she plays one woman who is basically many women and did that just right.Yet this film contained some very famous male actors including Hollywood legend Michael Douglas. His role, while it was not the biggest or the most important to this film, it had a big impact on me. His onscreen presence is big for me. By the way, his hairstyle for this movie is &#145;unforgettable'. Then you have the very unlucky Randy, played by veteran actor Matt Dillon. His role in this is not so unlike that in There's something about  Mary. He was great as Randy. I found that he plays the unlucky sucker pretty well. His other standout movies include Wild Things and There's something about Mary, where he is hilarious once again. Yet the other guys thrown into this weird love triangle are also very good. Paul Reiser, from the TV show &#145;Mad About You', was Randy's cousin, Carl, who witnesses all the events between Randy and Jewel. Paul was a funny addition to the cast, with the finale to the film, a cracker. John Goodman, is a comedy genius, with his big frame and chubby face, he is a likable character in almost any sort of film. His role in McCool's is no exception. It is funny how we see him retreat to a priest to get help for his infatuation over Jewel. Goodman is a veteran of the big and small screen, with his great success in the TV hit Roseanne and in movies like The Flintstones, Blues Brothers, and  the 2000 hit movie `Coyote Ugly'.  This film has many funny scenes, with the main stars always seemingly being involved in something that could get them in big trouble, or bring them great &#145;love'! The scene where Jewel firsts meets Randy is very funny, as you are unsure of what both parties are getting into, also the scene where Carl invites Randy and Jewel over for a BBQ is also amusing. Throw in a silly but well thought Village people dance mix at the end makes this very appealing to comedy fans anywhere. To wrap up on One night at McCool's, I want to say that this film shows how silly men act when there is a woman in their life. I am struggling in that area of my life right now, but I do not want to go through what these men had to endure, as it is a real death wish what Jewel puts them through. This film also makes weary of not trusting the first person I see or who sees me, because that is one of the worst ways of being hurt, which I know what is like. Men and women are so alike, they are like the metaphor of a book, that what is on the inside is not always like the outside. Be sure who you have feelings for is the right person, both for there sake and yours!Rating 5 Stars or 10/10    	  "},{"Title":"Unique and funny","Date":"3 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"     Each guy Liv Tyler meets loses their head over her, not, of course, without some small encouragement from Liv.

He shows off his immense, underrated comic talent as well.  Good to see him on screen after all these years in hiding.  John Goodman is...well...John Goodman!  He's the man!  I think Goodman's another underrated actor (he should've gotten nominated for his role in The Big Lebowski), and never ceases to please.I liked the whole look and style of the film.  It helps accentuate the ironic tone.  That is especially demonstrated in the climax, where we have a shoot-out with YMCA in the soundtrack.  I thought that was a very nice, original touch.  I liked Joan Osbourne's song Love is Alive, and her music video is featured in the DVD edition.But overall, it's a superficial film with not much below the surface.  I still felt the writing was a bit slight.  All the male characters are portrayed as perverts, and a lot of their dialogue consists of lines like That is some high-class p**sy.  I wasn't offended by the film's depiction of men; I just felt the sexual references got repetitive and dull at times. And the writer didn't seem too ambitious, settling for predictable irony. We have a shrink who doesn't appreciate what her obnoxious patient has to say, a priest (Richard Jenkins) who wants to find out about one's sexual fantasies.

Visually different with unique hairstyle, Jewel personality and clothes for each point of view.--Center it on a sexual personality that by itself charms, draws the viewers into the role as one of the confessors. Balance the telling of the story with the happening itself in such a way that it is clear that there is a battle between versions. The game is which one of the listener's (not the teller's) versions the viewer chooses. One will win (Douglas) and as surrogate for us, will get the prize.--Make it highly visual, expertly edited noir comedy that end on the noir (or else it has no noir at all).--Fill it up with comedic actors as the three manipulated men, and allow them to be as funny as they want.But they blew it, as Hollywood always does because of the evolution toward the bland that gets laid on any director that is not powerful enough to push back. So we get--The three visual identities are merged into one. (Check the DVD extras to see the original notions of the blond, black and redhaired Livs.) A mistake.--Liv has a lovely face and she knows how to mug seductively. But the role requires a physical actress. She has neither the instrument nor the talent for this. A mistake.--They took out the battle among the three listeners for the narrator's attention. Another mistake.--They reshot the ending because test audiences were leaving without smiles. (Again, see the DVD.)

Great film making or not, the film knows how to push most of the right buttons and quote the right classic models for a good naughty time, and most viewers will have such a good time before the story's energy runs out in the last 20 minutes, that they won't really care.Matt Dillon turns in a fine performance (and not just his from eyebrows and abs - though they get their usual workout) as the put-upon bartender who gets drawn into the increasingly outrageous chain of events by the beauteous (and predictably amoral) Liv Tyler as bodies - dead and otherwise - start to pile up. The main story thread is told for most of the film in flashback as Dillon, at a low point in his life, recruits aid from an oddly cast Michael Douglas. Paul Reiser is his cousin, in the midst of a severe midlife crisis and explaining his story to his new therapist, Reba McEntire (turning in another delightful set of reactions) and John Goodman is the policeman - and one true innocent in the story - also drawn into the web of events by lost love and seeking council from his all too interested parish priest, Richard Jenkins.Inocence and midlife frustration are not rewarded in a film like this (stick around for the punchline joke life plays on Reiser at the end - it's a drop-dead killer!), but for the Saturday night crowd who wants a happy ending, Dillon gets one Moliere would have been proud of, and in this case, even the modern version of a Tartuffe may get to ride happily off into the sunset.A solid supporting cast TV viewers will smile at (Andrea Bendewald, a chilly blonde source of laughs in so many shows, is particularly good in the small role of Reiser's wife) keeps things rolling and occasionally adds just by the baggage they bring. Completing the mix is a surprisingly satisfying double role tossed to Andrew Dice Clay (nearly unrecognizable in each) as the friend who starts and finishes the whole chain of events.The McGuffin here is house hunger, and those who love ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S should seek out Harold Prince's twisted black comedy fairy tale, SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE where Michael York has the same weakness. It might make a great double feature.

I didn't have high expectations for it due to never hearing about it, but I was actually somewhat surprised, somewhat.It's basically a dry comedy in which Liv Tyler's character, Jewel, has this obsession with someday owning what is in her mind, the perfect house, although she has no job or any means of buying one herself.  Throughout the entire movie every man that runs into her falls at her feet, and as you can guess, she never hesitates to take advantage.  It is extremely similar to Penelope Cruz's character, Isabella, in Woman On Top in the way that she has this special womanly thing about her that drives all men wildly in love with her, except Isabella never used the men like Jewel does.Some of the male characters in the movie are played by Matt Dillion, her main squeeze in the movie, Paul Reiser, Michael Douglass, and John Goodman.  Despite this strong showing of actors though, this movie has really nothing to do with them, but everything to do with Jewel.  One thing I will say though is that even if you don't want to see this movie, I would recommend it based only on the fact that you have to see Paul Reiser's character!  For the life of me I will never forget that leather, studded, sex slave outfit he wore!  He played a freak!  I'm talking whips and chains and dog collars and so forth.  Just seeing him, the guy from Mad About You, wanting to be spanked by Jewel is enough to make anyone laugh their butts off!  I still can't believe he did that role.  All in all though, it was an O.K. movie.  It had its moments, but it really got tiresome after awhile.  I mean watching every guy in this movie continually keep falling for Jewel as she just kept blatantly using them on her obsessive compulsive quest to own her own home got old.  It wasn't the worst movie, but it definitely will never be a classic.  I gave it a generous 7.

One Night at McCool's is a comedy that makes good use of a non-linear story structure, yet it too rests all its weight on it.  It's sad, too, since much more fun could have been derived from its quirky characters.One Night at McCool's story revolves around Liv Tyler, who enchants three men she meets after a night at the bar of the title. There's Matt Dillon who stars as a lonely guy in need of a motherly type of girlfriend,Paul Reiser as a self-proclaimed gift to women, and John Goodman, as a widowed, religious cop looking for a new wife.  The story is structured around their retelling of their encounters with Tyler, who is of course, incapable of doing wrong in their eyes.  It's funny to see each character project their own twisted view on what went on, and then see another character retell the same scene in a completely different way.What isn't funny, however, is to see the film desperately trying to interweave these points of view while forgetting about characters and dialogue.  While the characters are all easy to laugh at,  there really isn't a main character to keep narrative focused, since they all commit a deplorable act that makes the stories they are recounting all questionable. True, it's fun not to know who's giving the closest rendition of the truth, but to have not one redeemable character makes it hard to care about what happens to them.Paul Reiser gets the most laughs out of any of the other main actors, but it's Michael Douglas' small role as a retro, overgrown-hair, bingo-playing hitman, chewing up scenery and that generates the most laughs and steals every scene.  Had One Night at McCool's focused on its characters more than attempting to seem clever with its plot device, it would have been side-splitting rather than simply amusing.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Body count, 5; film, 8; Liv, 10+.","Date":"21 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" In one episode of Duckman, our hero has somehow become the head of a movie studio and tries to persuade one attractive Hollywood star after another to star in a film called (Insert Female Stars Name Here) In Her Underwear - Meg Ryan, Uma Thurman and Liv Tyler. Well, One Night At McCool's does have Liv Tyler in her underwear as well as in numerous revealing moments throughout - but while I've always liked Steven Tyler's seriously foxy daughter, she is but one of the many pleasures this black comedy has to offer. You also have Michael Douglas, John Goodman, Paul Reiser, Reba McEntire (proving again that she can actually act, Madonna please note) and even Matt Dillon delivering the goods. You have a script by Stan Seidel - who died before the film's release, and to whom it's dedicated - that manages to weave together the three narrative voices coherently (most of the film is told in flashback 1) by Dillon, to a hilariously be-wigged Douglas; 2) by Reiser, to psychiatrist McEntire; and 3) by Goodman, to a slightly lapsed man of the cloth) while keeping the pace throughout.You have direction by Harald Zwart that, in association with Liv, pulls off a movie that's both funny and sexy (see anything with Jenny McCarthy if you don't think that's hard to manage) - we're simultaneously turned on by the minx's actions and laughing at the characters' reactions. You have a tale that wouldn't have worked if you didn't really believe that all the major male characters wouldn't find her appealing (which was a major problem with Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul, where everyone was far more overtly in lust with Mary Mrs. Bartel Woronov, who was hardly babe-worthy even then). You have lots of little pleasures en route, good use of music - in addition to another fine score by Marc Shaiman, the Village People's YMCA is heard to startling effect in the climax - and a plot that, though at times playing like a high-class sex farce, never turns predictable.One Night at McCool's is infinitely better than the last film about a scheming nymphomaniac featuring Michael Douglas, because unlike Basic Instinct you wind up warming to the characters; who would expect a film containing brief S&M, an attempted rape and several corpses to be heartwarming? Two bonuses John Goodman giving hope to larger men everywhere by bedding Liv Tyler, and Andrew Dice Clay (billed under his real name) being funny. Who would have thought it?

There's Randy (Matt Dillon) a docile bartender who dreams of stardom whilst still living in his mother's old run down house, his cousin Carl (Paul Reiser) a disillusioned lawyer with a fetish for S&M and a cocky arrogance that even Muhammad Ali would be ashamed of and Dehling (John Goodman) a lonely widowed detective who believes that he's on a mission from God. Each man meets the irresistible Jewel on one very hectic night at McCools, the two-bit bar where Randy works, and soon each of the three is convinced that he is the only one for her.  Part femme fatale, part desperately insecure Jewel has a dream all of her own and she'll do anything to fulfil it, even if that means playing along with each mans warped fantasy.  All three men are missing something in their lives and Jewel fulfils that for them.  For Randy she's domestic bliss, for Carl she's sex on tap and for Detective Dehling she's innocence incarnate. Before long she moves in with one man, regularly whips another's leather clad body and encourages the third to forget all about his dead wife and job.  That alone would make for a pretty good movie, but throw into the mix four dead bodies, cat burglary, the Village People, bingo, an assassin, a midget lawyer, a DVD Player and numerous tips in the finer points of DIY and you've got one of the funniest films you'll see this year. One Night at McCools is positively hilarious.  The direction is both inventive and innovative with Zwart cleverly manipulating a number of cinematic techniques and special fx to achieve a unique look and feel to his movie.  The script is often painfully sharp and all the cast are on top form.  In particular, Liv Tyler is absolutely brilliant in her role and is the key to the films success.  She effortlessly switches from Madonna to Whore leaving the three men and the audience confused as to who the real Jewel is.  Matt Dillon is as reliable as ever and both Goodman and Reiser do more than enough to warrant their pay cheques.  But it's Douglas who steals the limelight, and most of the best lines, as the wig wearing, bingo playing, aging hitman Mr Burmeister who Randy reluctantly hires to put an end to all his problems.   If this is a prime example of the sort of film that Michael Douglas plans to produce with his new company then it looks like we're all in for a treat. One Night at McCools is probably the best comedy since American Pie, but if you're of a more serious disposition then you'd best heed the words of Randy `The sex and the violence, all in one night - it's a little too much.'  Brilliant.

He meets up with this woman named Jewel who convinces him to, surprisingly, have sex with him.  Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed.  Randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for Jewel.  She, being the mascot of stupidity, uses every one of these guys to get what she wants, involving a DVD player.

To be honest, I think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges.  Which I think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid.  When I watch a movie, I want a plot.  I want characters.  I don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have.  Something should happen in a movie, for goodness' sake.

Her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches, to me.I am amazed, simply AMAZED that people would work so hard to make something so stupid.  The music is absolutely crappy (having YMCA play while John Goodman's character is being killed doesn't really fit), the characters are totally unlikeable, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man, and to top it off, it doesn't even fit into any genre.

It pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime. The premise is about a gold digging woman, named Jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder, so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires. You know, this wouldn't be a bad strategy, if she chased after rich guys. This film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew Dice Clay. Please. That major flaw in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker (and that's unintentional). Watching it, it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere. One Night at McCool's just could not decide what direction it wanted to take, so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera, and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how the sex is with Jewel. It seems like Matt doesn't know, neither do the viewers. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool's also wants to be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety, nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks. What the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way.

The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles--both psychos.

You have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily.  Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, It's the script, stupid.  This is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through.  They're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.Is it an unmitigated disaster?  Not entirely.  There are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the efforts of the actors.  I probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking, Eh.  It was okay.

The movie opens with him confessing all his problems to a calm, gambling person called Burmeister, played by Michael Douglas. Randy meets a beautiful woman - Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who puts him into a lot of trouble, involving a murder and plenty of robberies.One Night at McCool's has that typical comedy style, quickly unfolding the story, mixing it with characters who act unnatural, but after all, you still laugh at times, gaining respect for all those good actors, seeking for some genre variety.Matt Dillon's comic performance is quite successful. I never thought he could be funny again after There's Something About Mary, but it turned out he could. He recreates his character with a lot of enthusiasm. As a matter of fact, he might very well be considered the highlight of the movie. There are a couple of hilarious scenes with him. The way he utters his lines is great. There is that moment when a thief enters Randy's place and forces him to hand over the car keys and Dillon's character responds I don't have a car. The reaction of the thief, and the whole moment of spoiling the little seriousness is just hilarious.The plot is more of a self-parody than witty and creative. Paul Reiser, for example, plays the most eccentric character in the whole movie. He is Randy's cousin. His character is given present day story all the way from the third act. Before that, there is a spread segment of him, having a hilarious dialog with a shrink. Reiser is very funny in this one. A good cast decision.Aside from all those positive things, One Night at McCool's is far from being a flawless comedy. The second act is rather boring and unfunny. Sex jokes repeat one after another in different context. I definitely hated the John Goodman's character - a cop who falls for Jewel and threatens Randy with jail as being the prime suspect for a murder. Michael Douglas, another surprising cast choice for such film, also doesn't fit in the whole story. His character has very few lines until the third act, which is ridiculous for an actor of such magnitude.One Night at McCool's is great entertainment, but be sure you're not watching it for the cast. Dillon and Reiser are very fresh, but Douglas and Goodman are offensively unfunny. If you think you've never seen them in bad roles, avoid this flick. If you need a good laugh, One Night at McCool's is the right choice.

That was fourteen years ago, fourteen years later the movie star plays a confidante to Matt Dillon as an aging hitman with one bad haircut. The film is very offbeat in the sense that the humor catches you off guard. It's exceptional though because the writing is pretty humorous. John Goodman, virtually good in anything he does puts his character to good use as an individual who is manipulated too easily. Paul Reiser is given another signature role as the kind of sleaze you love to like because he's badly charming as a total moron.

One Night at McCool's is a comedy that isn't funny. I mean, it hardly ever comes close to funny. Watching this movie must be like what it was to see Lenny Bruce in his later years, ranting and raving on stage while the audience waited for jokes that never came.This story is about three hopeless shmoes and the staggeringly beautiful woman who ruins their lives. Randy (Matt Dillon) is a bartender who's just minding his own business when Jewel (Liv Tyler) walks into his life. She's got the heart of adding machine inside the body of Helen of Troy and quickly leads Randy down the path of deceit, unemployment, burglary and murder. The burglary and murder bring police detective Dehling (John Goodman) into the story and he's almost struck dumb at the sight of Jewel. This hulk of a man turns into an adolescent in the helpless throes of puppy love, one willing to do anything to protect Jewel, even from herself.A duo of male prey isn't enough for Jewel. She also snares Randy's cousin Carl (Paul Reiser) in her web. Carl is a lawyer and, honestly, the only reason the character is in the story is to facilitate a handful of sight gags. While Randy and Dehling play active parts in Jewel's personal and criminal schemes, Carl is an uninvolved bystander. He could be edited out of the film without changing anything about the plot. Paul Reiser largely redeems this superfluous role by making a concerted effort at humor. He tries to be funny and sometimes succeeds. The rest of the cast doesn't even try, except for the former Andrew Dice Clay (Andrew Silverstein in this movie). The Diceman has a few minutes on screen where his overacting might be confused with comedy.One Night at McCool's largely unfolds in flashback. Randy tells his story to a bingo-playing hit-man (Michael Douglas). Carl spills his guts to his therapist (Reba McEntire). Dehling relates his tale of woe to his priest (Richard Jenkins). These filmmakers play around with having the perspective of each character slightly alter the story they tell. For example, there's a thread of self-serving delusion running through Carl's flashbacks and Dehling's attraction to Jewel leads him to present Randy in a much more negative light. This Rashomon approach is only played around with, though, and never leads to anything.Aside from being determinedly unfunny, the most striking thing about this movie is how unbelievably attractive Liv Tyler is every single minute she's on screen. From her gorgeous red hair to her colt-like legs and everything in between, Jewel is the epitome of the woman who can make men do things for her. One Night at McCool's isn't actually good, but it's still almost worth renting just to gawk at Tyler's smokin' hotness. And while it's not easy to notice as she makes all the blood rush out of your brain, Tyler also turns in a nice performance as a sort of living, sociopathic Barbie who wants to have that perfect Malibu Dream House more than anything in the world.As irresistible as Tyler is here, I would recommend One Night at McCool's if there were at least a meager amount of laughs to be had, but all the amusement of this movie has been squeezed out like toothpaste out of a tube. Such a low level of entertainment combined with Tyler remaining clothed at all times results in film that can easily be skipped.

Ironically enough, both characters are played by Liv Tyler and were films at least released in the same year although The Lord of the Rings was filmed much earlier &#150; in a nutshell, One Night at McCool's is the idea that these faceless males do what the character tells them to do only to be on the receiving end of something they didn't want and didn't expect.One Night at McCool's is a film that tires to be smarter than it actually is. Its essence of noir and the way it thinks it cleverly tells the story of three males whose stories interlock and are told through a flashback technique is really just a smokescreen for what's really underneath. The film centres around the extremely aptly named Jewel Valentine since Jewel's her first name and everybody's after her and Valentine was the martyred saint that became associated with love so she's really called 'everyone's after her love'. The film's title could also do with a facelift as it too could be called 'Let's just do everything Jewell tells us to.' One Night at McCool's is not brilliant film-making but more-so, it's a terrible case of women being identified as objects who seduce stupid men through a series of actions easy sex, revealing costumes, feigning romantic interest and just being whatever sexual fantasy they want them to be &#150; these are the actions of a prostitute or a call girl more than anything else and the way in which the dumb males fall into the trap does not make for good, entertaining or even fun viewing.I will not criticise the film for trying something new to get its basic ideas across. The three men who fall foul of her are Randy (Dillon), Detective Dehling (Goodman) and Carl Harding (Reiser); all three of which are very different sorts of men a young and outgoing kid, an experienced police man and a lawyer who's the kind of guy who'd probably tell his wife he's going to mainland Europe for a couple of business conferences over the course of a few days when really he's spending the weekend in Amsterdam making use of the 'facilities'. Each character is well acted by an array of talent and each character is of different background and has seemingly different attitudes and outlooks on life, giving us a choice of one to map onto. Apart from anything else, the characters are put across in such a way that makes us care what happens to them in a way; Randy especially since it is Jewel's actions that cause him to hit rock bottom and I, at least, felt very bad for him when the occurrence happens.The film deserves its criticisms when it comes to little things like having the priest not really interested in the tragic story the detective is giving until the part including the sex pops up; that as well as its tendency to drag at certain times since its revolving around the same thing over and over that being the seduction of one of the three male characters by Jewel &#150; at one point, the film centres around Jewel and Randy living together and just consists of her filling the house up with new furniture which goes on for about fifteen minutes. If the film does have a high point, it's the closing shootout in which a random character shows up armed to the teeth demanding to know who killed his brother from earlier on in the film &#150; I am not ashamed to admit the scene had me laughing rather hard but just because of the absurdity of the soundtrack and action.That may have been One Night at McCool's high point, but it didn't build and build to get there; it just rather shot up to its peak there and then and that made me think &#150; it only happened because of an event from the first twenty minutes that the guy was even there. One Night at McCool's is uneven and bizarre but good fun for one viewing &#150; it's not like you'd want spend two nights at McCool's after this, is it? "},{"Title":"Boring!","Date":"11 April 2010","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" My first intention of watching this film was because it starred John Goodman, who is fantastic in this film, Michael Douglas, who was the bomb in The Game, Matt Dillon, who is tedious in this movie, and Liv Tyler, whose Lord of the Rings trilogy was her only watchable role. The cast is quite impressive, too bad that the director isn't. Harald Zwart? Who the f*ck is he? I am certain that his directing career is down the toilet and One night at McCool's is the evidence surrounding his gay directing career. The story is slow and boring and never is quite able to pick up, doesn't even try. I love movies where someone is telling a story but in this film it is crap. There are a couple of good jokes in this film but none of them are laugh out loud funny. This film is nothing more than a comedy/drama that revolves around a theme which is highly used in movies nowadays Sex. Can there ever be a decent film that is not about sex? I don't think so! They tried to make Liv Tyler hot but, obviously, there was no success, in my professional opinion. Her acting is dumb and stupid which makes her a weak sex symbol in this yawning, shitty, film. Michael Douglas is terrific in this film considering that his parts were short. His charm is mainly t work here. Paul Reiser plays a sex-crazed maniac who has his eyes on the new hottie in town, Jewel (Liv Tyler), and he mainly brings comedy into the (Quote) The Smartest and Funniest comedy of the Year. Richard Schickel, Time. Apart from completely disagreeing with him, he should definitely go see a psychiatrist or a nurse in a mental asylum, e.g. Nurse Ratchet should put him back into his senses. John Goodman is another good one....that is an actor, of course... to watch out for but in this movie he plays a serious cop who is under the suspicion that Randy (Matt Dillon) is treating Jewel very badly, and with that in mind he tries to reach out for her as well. Matt Dillon is El Terrible in this shitty picture. When you are supposed to develop sympathy for him for him because the witch Jewel stole his life, I did quite the opposite. The dialogue is bad/funny because...because...Oh, I'll just show you why. E.G.Randy You like water?Jewel Yeah I love it. It's my secondmost favorite thing in the world.Randy Really? And What's your first most?Jewel Fu*cking.That line proved the shitty but funny dialog found in this film. It is too funny to even think about it.Randy is a down-on-his-luck bartender whose life is turned upside down after working hard one night at the local bar McCool's when he encounters Jewel, a seductive woman and save her from a man who was raping her. After being seduced by Jewel, The man who was raping her is her jealous boyfriend, Utah and Jewel have set up Randy so they can rob him. After Jewel kills Utah, Jewel and Randy become a couple and Jewel takes over Randy's home. But Jewel begins to encourage Randy to rob other people's houses so she can turn Randy's house into the perfect home. Carl, Randy's cocky cousin finds himself being driven crazy by Jewel and Detective Dehling, investigating the robberies and Utah's death finds himself falling in love with Jewel.Some you will hate this film while some would go crazy over it. It cannot compete with the other comedy films out there but it is good in its own genre worst comedies ever. If you want something that will really make you laugh, try out these films How to lose friends and alienate people, Grandma's Boy, Superbad, Knocked Up, Rush hour trilogy, Fanboys, Snatch, and Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back (Basically get anything that has Kevin Smiths name over it. Hell, even epic movies is better than this.

The three narrators in this film are the three men in the life of the central female character, a sultry femme fatale named Jewel. All three narrators have a confessor-figure to whom they can unburden themselves. The first, a rather dim barman named Randy, tells his story to a casual acquaintance named Burmeister, who just happens to be a hit man. The film's title is taken from the bar where Randy works. (I wonder of the scriptwriter was aware of the British slang meaning of the word randy when naming the character). The second narrator is Carl, a married lawyer who unburdens himself to his female psychiatrist, and the third is a guilt-ridden, widowed Catholic cop named Detective Dehling, who has a confessor in the literal sense in the shape of his priest.The film is essentially a black comedy. Jewel comes into Randy's life when he rescues her from what appears to be an attempted rape by her abusive boyfriend Utah. After she shoots Utah dead, she becomes his girlfriend, but he faces competition for her in the shape of Carl (who also happens to be his cousin) and Officer Dehling, the policeman investigating the crime. Jewel (an appropriate name in view of her materialistic nature) is a low-rent material girl; some women in her position would demand diamonds or furs, but Jewel would sell her soul for a second-hand DVD player. Perhaps DVD players were not quite as ten-a-penny six years ago as they are today, but even so this indicates that Jewel prices herself rather more cheaply than would most femmes fatales blessed with the looks of Liv Tyler. Most of the plot derives from Jewel's attempts to play her three lovers off against one another in her search for material goods.The best acting performances come from John Goodman and, surprisingly, from Michael Douglas as Burmeister. I say surprisingly because Douglas (here wearing a slicked-back hairstyle which put me in mind of his father Kirk ) is not normally an actor one would associate with comedy, but he was clearly trying to extend his range, and to some extend succeeding. Goodman's Dehling seems to be the embodiment of that old Protestant stereotype that every Catholic is tormented by sexual guilt; he manages to reconcile his lust for Jewel with his religious convictions by convincing himself that God has sent her to him as a substitute for his dead wife.Liv Tyler, however, never quite convinces. Although she is very attractive, there was always an air of sweetness and innocence about her, which meant that she was never able to put across the mixture of carnality and venality which characterises Jewel. My main problem with the film, however, was that I was never able to sympathise with any of the characters, either on an emotional or an intellectual level. All three principal male characters were not only stupid but also unsympathetic- Randy is stupid and gullible, Carl stupid and lecherous and Dehling stupid and hypocritical- which meant that I never really cared what happened to any of them. Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right; such a film needs to be sparklingly witty throughout in order to overcome any objections to its lapses in taste, and sparkling wit is not something much in evidence here. One Night at McCool's is occasionally amusing, but in a film like this occasionally is not enough. 5/10 "},{"Title":"An overacted and unfunny mess.","Date":"30 May 2010","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" One Night is as boring as it is witless and will most certainly be greeted by the average viewer with a long extended face palm throughout its entire duration. Not that I suspect that people will have that much patience with it. I certainly didn't.What else is there to say really? Everything this movie aims at just garners the opposite. The situations are painful instead of funny, the characters are dull and annoying instead of quirky and the story as a whole is merely a stockpile of random stupidities thought up by someone with zero imagination and no sense of humor. A must miss for sure. "}{"Title":"Hollywood does it again","Date":"1 May 2001","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Before I took a job as a reviewer, I never went to films like this, and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the soul of the Hollywood film lies a deeply woman-hating spirit that thrives on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or revile. Or is this just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? Here we have yet another seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman turned lethal weapon. The kind that cautions us that beneath every pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild-eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within 50 miles a living hell.This month's specimen is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include having her own little house, a backyard fountain, and a mondo home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the dim-bulb bartender she picks up at McCool's one night intending to rob, is less materially oriented. The kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet plunger, he prefers to hunker down in his dead mother's house with few creature comforts save his snowglobe collection.In that same low-rent bar, the Devil in the Red Dress also bumps into Randy's cousin, Carl (the highly amusing Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis. When things go south within hours, enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men sustain big, bad crushes on the leopard-clad progeny of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell-crushes that make them do things that common sense would normally contraindicate. Like get involved in the first place.Multiple points of view and flashbacks patch together the front-page news about how easy it is to fall victim to one's libido, especially if you're male. As each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant, his desire to possess The Jewel colors the `truth' of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a reasonably amusing way. But it's amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter.MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and music-video director Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments, including one about a car wash, soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate. It's also the debut project from the production company owned by Michael Douglas, who's found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo parlor.Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this one, though given the one-dimensionality of their overdone film noir-type characters, you can't really fault them. Several minor roles drag out unexpected guests--Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as both the hoodlum Utah and his even-scarier brother. (Finally, an outlet for all that aggression.)This film unwittingly speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women--or men and their mommies. But ultimately you'd probably find more lasting psychological truths in a Bugs Bunny episode. I will say that it's better, funnier, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the misogynism scale?  "}]
