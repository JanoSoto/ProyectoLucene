I suppose that if I composed such a list of guilty pleasures, this one would be one of them . . . but upon reflection, it's really a lot better than that. Fifteen year-old science prodigy Mitch (Gabe Jarret) is recruited by ambitious college professor Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton, in yet another of his patented roles as a loathsome character) to work on the professor's prize laser project, not knowing that Hathaway is really developing a government weapon. Along the way, Mitch is mentored by Chris (Val Kilmer), another prodigy a few years his senior who teaches Mitch how to loosen up.This could have degenerated into nothing more than just another teen revenge comedy, but there's so much more the dialogue is laced with sharp wit; there are some lovely scenes that have nothing to do with the story yet are carefully set up, almost as blackouts (e.g., Mitch goes to a lecture at which a few students have left tape recorders instead of attending; later, at another lecture there are more tape recorders than students; and, in a final scene, one large tape recorder gives the lecture to a room populated by nothing but other small recorders!); and throw-away scenes that make you want to stop and back up the story to watch again (e.g., Chris off-handedly cutting a slice off a bar of dry ice to make a slug for the coffee machine). It's also one of the few movies to boast the presence of the memorable Michelle Meyrink -- as Jordan, the girl-nerd who made being smart and female (and still quite sexy) something to emulate. And there's Tears for Fears' great song, Everybody Wants to Rule the World providing the perfect coda as the closing credits begin to roll . . . . Yes really now, what's there to be embarrassed about?

A new arrival to the campus, Mitch, is a brilliant 15 year-old whom Val takes under his wing and tries to get to loosen up and have a good time.There are probably some important themes and ideas to analyze within this movie, but for me it's just an old-school personal favorite that I've seen about 100 times.  Great 80's music soundtrack and funny performances.  William Atherton is perfect as the self-important, snobby professor, and another highlight is Robert Prescott, who plays his butt-kissing, nerdy assistant Kent.A movie that asks the question, isn't life experience just as important for education, as classrooms and books?  A very funny, fine film that is up there with Animal House in my opinion.

Kilmer proves adept at excellent comic timing, and he is given a motherlode of razor-sharp one-liners to fire off in every scene (I speculate that writer Pat Proft enjoyed watching The Marx Brothers in his formative years).  Chief drawback of this film is the hammy, sneering villain played by Atherton -- as the old saying goes, just give him a mustache to twirl.  But if you happened to see the film as a young person, the above-mentioned won't get in the way of your fond memories.  I sure know that every time I see that slow-motion romp through the popcorn and hear Tears for Fears' Everybody Wants to Rule the World, ramp up on the soundtrack, my cynicism just melts away.

At their worst, 80s movies become dated more quickly than films from nearly any other period in film history. At their best, 80s movies reflect the cultural undertones of an exciting time where humor and optimism were rampant in films despite the specter of cold war, the advent of AIDS and a rocky economy.Real Genius takes the happy, go-lucky optimism of the 80s and superimposes it on the grim topics of military research, cold war espionage and assassination. The movie is set in a west-coast college (see Caltech, Berkeley, Stanford) and makes full use of the hyper-intelligent, eccentric dialog you might expect in elite California academia. The sound track from Thomas Newman (Less than Zero, American Beauty and many others) is technically complex and involving and fits the movie perfectly. At times, the movie suffers from the usual poor depiction of science (see lame computer applications and some bad blue screen work on aircraft) and unbelievable scenarios (see water slide in lecture hall and ice sledding in dormitory). Despite these forgivable breaches, the Neal Israel's unique dialog is truly brilliant, the situational comedy is eccentric, and the humor is uplifting. Val Kilmer is outstanding in his portrayal of Chris Knight and I lament his departure from this odd and extremely intelligent form of comedy (See Top Secret) - Though Kilmer has been involved with better movies since, I don't think he has ever been more genuinely entertaining.I think this movie is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys science, comedy and the 80s genre, or for anyone who is planning on attending a technology school on the West coast. This movie may not depict reality, but it communicates a hopeful spirit we could all use more of in today's world of harsh reality.

Any film that features a memorable moment like Deborah Foreman's articulation of her standards for a male companion, a memorable character like Michelle Meyrink's hyper-kinetic Jordon, and the memorable sight of a house exploding from the force of a giant Jiffy Pop container can never be forgotten.And who doesn't feel good just watching the neighborhood kids play in a mountain of popcorn to the sound of Tears For Fears' Everybody Wants To Rule The World.Although Real Genius has not totally escaped the ravages of the past 20 years, it has held up reasonably well. Now it can even be appreciated as a sort of time capsule, demonstrating rather strikingly the complete computerization of the applied sciences that has occurred during the relatively short time period since its 1985 release. Other than Kent's incidental use of an early computer in his dorm room and a mostly decorative monitor in the lab, these now essential machines are absent from this techno film. Amazing! Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. "}{"Title":"Don't eat that. Eating that can cause very large breasts.

Jack Black's light manic energy is the perfect doppelganger to William Atherton's dark malevolent sleaze. Also, there was the young cast that, aside from Val Kilmer, virtually never acted again. It gave me the feel of catching lightning in a bottle.You actually get two movies here. The coming of age story of Mitch, and the comeuppance for Hathaway. The movie takes its time getting to these points, with lots of vignettes along the way, but that only makes the payoff sweeter because we know these people by the end of the flick. The resolution feels right. The science also feels right. Despite some reliance on movie science syndrome, where the Eureka! moment instantly produces a working result, the portrayal and terminology is accurate enough to keep me from wincing. No small feat. Throw in the soundtrack, and it all works.Check out this movie. Be patient with it (I meant what I said about the pace), and you will be rewarded.

The Vietnam War and a draft lottery number of 5 intervened so I wound up joining the Navy and actually working on WMDs as I hunted the Great Steel Whales. I must have seen this film 50 times over the years and it's always funny and fresh each time.Contrary to the opinions of many, The plot IS based on the true story of a Caltech grad student who invented the X-ray laser for eye surgery; only to have Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Labs try to turn it into a space-based particle beam weapon for Reagan's Star Wars project. Many of the incidents depicted are taken directly from the hijinks Caltech students engage in during the annual Ditch Day celebrations.I won't rehash the plot since so many have already done so on these pages. Suffice to say that a great, funny, literate script, journeyman direction by Martha Coolidge and believable performances by Jarret, Kilmer, Atherton, Meyrink, et all put this film a cut above virtually all the other 80's school and nerd comedies. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was due to the somewhat cheesy special effects of the B1-B bomber used in the weapon's test.Ironically enough, I lived in Pasadena in the late 90's/early 00's and drove past Caltech every day on my way home from work. There I would periodically see busloads of Chinese tourists from the People's Republic taking each other's pictures in front of the Caltech administration building.

You can be smart and fun at the same time. You can be witty and someone socially desirable all at once. Getting good grades doesn't necessarily sentence you to a life as a social pariah. Most of the characters we meet in Real Genius are not actually nerds. The Kent character would be an exception. But Real Genius is a fun and reasonably intelligent comedy with exceptionally smart people as its heroes. And unlike the protagonists in Revenge of the Nerds, they aren't people you'd necessarily make fun of. But you can certainly laugh at them.Real Genius is the story of a handful of whiz kids at mythical Pacific Tech University who are unwittingly being used to develop a deadly weapon for the CIA. It turns out their smarmy professor (William Atherton) is using a government grant to refurbish his home while his students relentlessly spend all of their waking moments in a lab developing a laser beam which can eradicate a human target from space. Gabe Jarret is a 15 yr old new to the team who finds himself roomed with Val Kilmer; a genius who has long ago decided not to take school so seriously. Jarret only wants to work on the laser and live up to the expectations of his parents and the faculty. Kilmer wants to teach the kid how to have some fun. And all the while this dangerous weapon is being created in their lab. Finally, after several plot complications, the weapon is complete. But it takes a former whiz kid living in the steam tunnels beneath the dorm to point out that this laser can really only have one use. Feeling betrayed, the students gang up on their professor and use his weapon to teach him a lesson. Real Genius is not a particularly plausible film in terms of its plot, but it succeeds at its most basic goal. In other words, its funny. Kilmer has never been better, spouting smug one-liners that would make Chevy Chase or Bill Murray smile. Atherton always got to play the creep back in the 1980s, and as usual he does it quite well. Gabe Jarret never did much else, but he's as good as he needs to be as the new stud who can hardly believe he's doing what he's doing at age 15. The film has dated fairly well. It has a good soundtrack, good special f/x for the laser, and good cast with several memorable performances. There are some unnecessary elements, such as the mixer with student beauticians, and perhaps Jarret's relationship with the hyper girl down the hall was tacked on. But overall its still a winner after so many years. Worth a rental if you don't own it already. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound "},{"Title":"Can you be too intelligent?","Date":"3 April 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" We know how funny actor Val Kilmer could be after his debut performance in the comedy spoof Top Secret, and the filmmakers here took that chance by giving the fresh faced actor one of central roles where he would truly make light work of his flamboyantly off-the-wall character. It's Kilmer's show&#x85; and boy does he take control! Working off a bright and snappy script, Kilmer is let loose and brings much needed zip and a real quirkiness to his magnificently inspired performance. With Real Genius it was one of those films that passed me by, but when I noticed it I was expecting your basic ho-hum teen comedy, but while it might have the token characters and usual situations it actually had a fresh and clever spin to it all. Sure the chaotic and scatty slapstick/screwball humour might not always come off, but it never outstays its welcome by getting on with things as it was constantly thinking on its feet. When its spot on (either with it radical dialogues or visual gags --- as there's plenty of the latter), it's quite good.It even has a message to boot; no matter how hard you work, there's always time to take a break and enjoy life's many experiences&#x85; or maybe be careful if you're super smart as the military might just abuse that gift. Yes, the plot follows that of Mitch Taylor a 15 year old whiz kid that joins a school of fellow scientific prodigies. There he meets Chris Knight, who likes to have a good time than be caught studying. However unknowingly to them their professor is exploiting them in an attempt to create a laser weapon for the military.A technically slick presentation by director Martha Coolidge who showers the air with punchy 80s tunes and gets a bunch of capable performances from the cast. William Atherton is picture-perfect as the smug professor and Gabriel Jarret brings the right quality to his naïve character Mitch.

There are so many small moments of small genius in this script and the sound track fits perfectly. I rate this one an 8 out of ten and say don't feel the least bit guilty about enjoying this one. There are a sea of less good popular comedies out there and this one is head and shoulders above the rest.

All at once, Real Genius attempts to be a high school type movie, with its obvious parties, crude humor and wacky behaviors. All at once it wants to be a drama about reality, politics &#150; the Reagan administration, and about science, at its core.The film surrounds extreme nerds &#150; or more accurately, young students recruited into a life of scientific slavery, for the villainous professor who seeks to devise a weapon of mass destruction. The hilarity of the film stems from the eccentricities of the students and the method they devise to foil his plot while passing their classes.Sadly, there has never really been a follow-up to the college drama. The truth is that the college experience is by far too diverse to have real similarities, and so Real Genius stands alone, incorporating action and drama, suspense and comedy.This film may very well be the first computer and tech driven action film. The intensive use of computers and circuits to drive plot was never really used before &#150; it had no place before the late 80's, when the promise of computer technology was not yet seen.Val Kilmer plays the head genius, who has turned into a wild character through his years under the oppressive tutelage of his head professor. His Bill-and-Ted type idiosyncrasies are planned, predictable after around five minutes but are a satisfying opposite of his best friend who is just fresh out of high school.Let's just say you shouldn't miss this movie.It's a moral imperative RATING 9/10 "},{"Title":"This is a classic; Excellent script, great acting.

And it is. But it's a great 80s teen sex comedy, with zingy dialogue and an engaging plot, and an early glimmer of Val Kilmer's brilliance. Sure, Kilmer's a rat-faced megalomaniac. But he's a talented rat-faced megalomaniac and in Real Genius he proves to be a worthy successor to such 70s comic anti-heroes as Elliott Gould and Jack Nicholson. Plus, his comic patter is as good as Groucho Marx ripostes like I'm one of the 10 best minds in the country, and some day I hope to be two of them and can I name my first child after you? I think Dips**t Knight has a nice ring to it could have come from the mouth of the Maestro himself.But Real Genius is not a Val Kilmer star vehicle. (Kilmer never became much of a star, after all.) At its heart, it's a pretty thought-provoking movie Real Genius is about the exploitation of intellect. All the science whizzes depicted in the film are potential Robert Oppenheims, and the movie is about the moral choices they make in response to the demands of the military-industrial complex opposition (Val Kilmer's Chris and his sidekick, Mitch), accommodation (Professor Hathaway and Chris' arch-nemesis Kent) or retreat (hermit Laszlo Hollyfeld). Sound heavy? Okay, it's heavy, but if you don't want to think about it you can let yourself get distracted by the screwball plot (government infiltrates MIT-style genius college and hilarity results), the touches of sweet romance (you'll adore Jordan Cochran, the hyperactive chick down the hall) and the fun juvenile antics (boob jokes galore!). Plus, it's nice to see intellectuals treated sympathetically in an American film -- we tend to prefer our eggheads sexless (see Jeff Goldblum in The Fly) or schizophrenic (see Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind). In Real Genius they're not just geniuses, they're, well, real.

However, I've shown it to several friends that have either found it too unusual to be funny (the story itself is not your typical teen event, although it was good original material coming out the 80s) or they were surprisingly confused by it (why, I don't know).Real Genius is something of an 80s science fiction movie. Boy genius, Mitch (Gabe Jarrett) is new to specialized school with a science and math curriculum for the unmatched teen brain (these teenagers are high school-aged, studying advanced theories of quantum physics and such). Mitch is the level-headed new kid, slightly naive and far too uptight. He has the honor of being the school's youngest admitted freshman (at 15), aside from Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), his slacker roommate who learned long ago that you can't go through life with your nose in the books all the time. As the exact opposite of Mitch, he tries to get the poor guy to loosen up and have some fun. When you're smart, people can use you, says Chris. Needless to say, Chris and his friends have put their smarts to good use (his buddy, Ick, develops an ice that they cover the hallway with for indoor ice skating). Chris, being the laid back fellow, is the funniest character in the movie.And the bain of dean Hatthaway, the uptight teacher who doesn't want Chris influencing Mitch because Mitch is being put to work on Hatthaway's special project, the development of a pretty intense laser (for the purposes of which are central to the plot), which people funding Hatthaway (the military) keep breathing down his neck to complete. As such, Hatthaway doesn't want any distractions, and even threatens to fail Chris for interfering with any potential progress on the project. Mitch and Chris get in a fair shake of trouble, thanks to their obnoxious trio of rival classmates, lead by king loser Kent (Robert Prescott) who will stop at nothing to be Hatthaway's pet, including stealing away Chris's promised job following education. Chris and Mitch and the rest of their friends (hyperkinetic Jordan, Mitch's girlfriend played by Michelle Merynick; Ick; and the boiler room recluse, Laslo Holyfeld played by John Gries), have their fun getting revenge with both Hatthaway and Kent's loser gang. In the meantime, however, they've got bigger problems with the laser. What would anyone want with a laser so powerful that it can blow a hole through walls and trees and signs on into the next town? You have to watch to find out.The movie, for me, is a load of laughs and the characters are charming. Aside from the star of the movie, Val Kilmer, I particularly like Merynick as the hyperkinetic blabbermouth, Jordan. The soundtrack, too, is good, with several good montage sequences. If you enjoy this movie, I recommend watching other Martha Coolige titles. This is comedy typical of her style and one of a few 80s teen movies that she directed. Michelle Merynick (Jordan) worked with her in earlier films Valley Girl in 1983 and The Joy of Sex (a decent National Lampoon stupid humor comedy with Cameron Dye)in 1984. Or, you might try the mildly funny undercover high school caper, Plain Clothes. This one, aside from Valley Girl, may be her best in teen selections (she did direct other things, most notably the Neil Simon comedy Lost in Yonkers). If you love 80s movies, this one should appeal to you. And if you've seen Valley Girl and liked it, definitely try this one out.

A great comedy with a conscience, that is the pithiest way to delineate this to you. This is Kilmer's movie, one of his early ones that shot him to fame. Mitch, a science prodigy, but still quite immature, is given a scholarship to a prestigious science university, thanks to the overbearing Dr. Hathaway, trust me, he makes the movie. Anybody who went through college had a professor just like him, to Chris' credit, he messes with him the whole movie. The comedy works because of the two great villains Kent, the loathsome, Yuppie wannabe, sycophant toady to Dr. Hathaway and the latter, who has a slight God complex. Unbeknownst to Chris and Mitch, Hathaway's high energy laser is to be used to vaporize third world dictators. Hathaway has some CIA types harassing him to hurry up which he gladly rolls downhill on-top of the two students. Kent, a bespectacled, brown-nosing creep, goes out of his way to make Mitch's life as horrible as possible. This sets up my favorite scene where they disassemble his status symbol, a yellow Porsche, and put it in his room,Kent, you know you're not supposed to park that there.Jordan is a brilliant young woman infatuated with Mitch but too shy to say a word. This is great chemistry between the two young eccentrics that adds an endearing quality to the story. Kilmer is so great here, with excellent dialog, I was thinking of Socrates who said, I drank what? When the two fail to meet Hathaway's timetable he gets nasty. The movie features great scenes of the pressure of college who will forget the kid standing up, freaking out and running out of the study hall. Everybody calmly goes back to work, with one guy wordlessly taking his place. It is not your typical coming of age 80's comedy because of the realization, on the part of the group, of what they just made for Hathaway. The last guy who made something like that lives in the basement, entering contests and never speaking. He is the one who interrupts their partying, upon success of the laser, to let them know what the laser will be used for. Here is where the critics attacked the movie; yes, it is quite a piece of legerdemain that strains credulity but, come on, this is a comedy not The Andromeda Strain. I own the movie for its witty sarcastic banter, most of it out of Kilmer's mouth. I love when the hot woman walks by, as he is studying on the ground, and he starts getting hysterical look at what he is missing!Yes, detractors, you will endure 80's music like Bryan Adams, but, on the whole, Kilmer and Atherton make this a classic. Atherton made Die Hard as the most ethically challenged journalist on the planet. Here, he oozes contempt for everyone. Watch for the student who says he is giving himself shock treatments, Hathaway responds,Up the voltage. My header he speaks to workers, on his new house, covered with sweat on a hot summer's day. Kent follows him around informing on everyone, doing his laundry and trying to make up for his lack of brains with some serious butt kissing. Another realistic feature for fellow college students; who doesn't remember this guy? Yes, the happy resolution has the probability of Scarlet Johansson calling me for a date, but, if you focus on the witty dialog and great villains, you will adore seeing them get just what they deserve, it was all worth it. Yes, devout Christians, the movie is guaranteed to offend you, as the two put a speaker / mike in Kent's tooth and start having him think Jesus is watching him. This made quite an impact in the 80's but has disappeared from view. Many younger people, under 40, may have missed this.

It wanted you to really love all of its characters and made some of them as goofy as possible.But really the only character that truly works out and becomes a greatly fun and memorable one is the Val Kilmer character. But this in itself is still enough to make the movie a real fun and entertaining one to watch! It makes it once more obvious what a waste it is that Val Kilmer never really broke through as a comedy actor and didn't do more movies like this during his career. Most people now days only known and recognize him for his serious movie roles. In this movie he looked almost as outrageous as he does now days and that is saying a lot! Val Kilmer his look has changed very drastically over the last couple of years and with change I mean his pretty extreme sudden weight gain, while he was once a true Hollywood heartthrob.The sort of 'childish' '80's teenage comedy approach is what makes the movie actually charming and in a way also irresistible to watch. It provides the movie with plenty of crazy situations, as well as some serious teenage issues, that still appeal and apply to teenagers this present day. This is also really what makes these genre movies from the '80's such timeless ones and are also really the reason why some of them are still being so popular to watch now days. I would exactly classify this movie as one of the classics- or best examples for its genre but it's definitely worth giving a go.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Val Kilmer is a real genius","Date":"3 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" Today I was rumaging threw my movie collection and came across Real Genius and thought it would be the next perfect movie to review. Real genius is a saterical comedy staring Val Kilmer.Another movie I cought on HBO one Saturday morning that quickly became one of my favorites.Real Genius is about a 16 year old kid named Mitch (Gabe Jarret) which the only other movie I saw him in was Apollo 13. Mitch gets accepted to one of the best colleges in the country and is recruited to create a super lazer with the help of his dorm roommate one of the top brains and all around goofballs Chris (Val Kilmer) though they have no idea what it will be used for.While this is going on Mitch sees a man who's been living in their closet named Lazlo (Jonathan Gries who also played Napoleon Dynamites meat throwing uncle) Lazlo tells them that they might have just made a lazer that could be used for the military and they set up a plan to stop it.Does their plan work? you'll just have to see the movie to find out With a great cast and great 80's music from the likes of Tears for Fears,Bryan Adams and Don Henley this is definitely a movie to check out at least once although you wont wanna see it just once but I may just be saying that since I consider this my favorite movie.Since I really see nothing wrong with this movie i'll rate it five lazer beams out of five "},{"Title":"One of My All Time Favorites","Date":"31 May 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" I remember seeing this movie many years ago and really enjoying it.

This film made me laugh, and gave me hope. I know it sounds corny, but something about the story and characters inspired me. At the time, I was white trash through and through, living in a shitty town with little prospects. I had intelligence, but I was surrounded by a lot of despair. (Of course, this maybe how many remember being 15 years old )When I watched this film, I saw myself as the perfect combination of Chris & Mitch. I can't say I had their IQs, but compared to the folks I was surrounded by, I certainly considered myself a real genius. At least in the sense I wanted to escape my surroundings through school and trying to educate myself (hence the trips to the library). Others simply tried medicating themselves. I saw school and being around people trying to better themselves as the alternative. The people in the movie (aside from Chris) were certainly not the social animals Chris was. However, he bridged the gap for them and allowed them to push their hedonistic limits in a safe and character building way. Something I thought was quite noble.The film really resonated with me, and still does. It's brilliantly funny, great characters, and wonderful plot. After 20 years, it still holds up surprisingly (minus some 80's score). I can't say how much I love this movie. What's really weird, is one of the Asian characters in the film (Yuji Okumoto) lives in Seattle, and I go to his bar all the time. He had 2 lines in the whole movie, but it's funny to see him in the movie then at the karaoke bar later.

Certainly too many times to count.To this day I'm still at a loss why I still consider this movie--full of silly jokes, some inventive pranks modeled after the real CalTech undergraduate dormies, and a rather pedestrian plotline--one of my all-time favorites.It's probably a pinch of nostalgia (not that I was ever in contention to be a science genius OR get into CalTech) coupled with a strange desire to be just like the wild, creative genius types who could hack a free phone call like in War Games (also one of my nostalgia classics) or get a free soda by inserting a sliver of frozen nitrogen into the machine.Kilmer certainly carries this movie, although Dr. Hathaway (William Atherton) is really quite excellent as his broom-up-his-rear foil and there's a strong balance of believable, non-stereotyped nerds (unlike the over-the-top stereotypes in Revenge of the Nerds) who play their parts as naturally as the nerdy kids we went to college with.  This movie permits those of us who had the bizarre inclination to be like those same nerds a bit of vicarious fun imagining a life--and a time--we never had or could have had.  I honestly think I had a bit of a crush on Jordan for years. Yeesh, I MUST be a nerd.This is definitely a movie that will appeal to a limited range of sensibilities.  As luck would have it, it appeals enormously to my own. It's at stages silly, serious, stupid, funny, ridiculous (nerdy college kids breaking into a military compound AND hacking a B1-B's computer system? Uh huh), and uplifting.

Mitch ends up being roommates with the smartest guy on campus, Chris Knight, played superbly by Val Kilmer (Batman Forever, Heat, and The Doors). Chris Knight is a very humorous person who likes to have fun a lot. Chris is working on developing a laser for Dr. Hathaway and works with Mitch on the project. They don't know that Dr. Hathaway has plans for the laser, that he is working with the C.I.A.. Mitch has to deal with a jerk named Kent Torokvei, who is Dr. Hathaway's sort of lap dog, played by Robert Prescott (Bachelor Party and Spaceballs) who is a little weird in some ways. Mitch does meet a real nice girl named Jordan, played by Michelle Meyrink (Revenge Of The Nerds, The Outsiders, and Howard The Duck). Mitch sees a guy come in and out of the closet cause there is a secret passage way to the boiler room, which Mitch does discover later on, he is Lazlo Hollyfeld, played by Jonathan Gries (The Pretender). Lazlo was the real big genius back in the 1970's, smarter than Chris and Mitch put together, Laslo cracked under pressure, that is why he lives in the steam tunnels underneath the dorm. Chris Knight tries to help Mitch relax and have some fun, but Mitch wants to keep working. Chris tells Mitch that he does not have to push himself too much, or otherwise Mitch might end up the same way as Lazlo. Chris and Mitch know how to get even with Kent, who humiliated Mitch in the cafeteria, and Jerry Hathaway when they find out about what the laser is going to be used for, after Chris solves the power problem.This movie shows people that being smart is nothing to be ashamed of and be creative. I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.The supporting cast that are great in this movie are Ed Lauter (Revenge Of The Nerds II, True Romance, and Youngblood) as C.I.A. man David Decker, Louis Giambalvo (The Dead Pool and Bad Dreams) as the C.I.A. guy Maj. Carnagle, who Dr. Hathaway has to deal with. Deborah Foreman (Valley Girl and My Chauffeur) as Susan Decker, the daughter of David Decker. Yuji Okumoto (The Karate Kid Part II) as Fenton, one of the other geniuses. Patti D'Arbanville (Time After Time and New York Undercover) as Sherry Nugil.

Today's humor can in no way be compared to what was seen as humor more than 20 years ago. While in today's movies, all you get is a lot of toilet humor and weak references to sex, teenage comedies in the eighties were very naive (at least by today's standards). Take for instance this Real Genius and compare it to a movie like Freddy Got Fingered with Tom Greene. The differences between the two are immense.Real Genius is about two brilliant teenagers who lead a team of young geniuses, developing a laser for what they believe is a class project. But instead of using their intellect for working on their project all the time, they rather like to use it for fun and performing practical jokes on each other. Only from time to time they work on their project, but they are able to finish it in time and they hand it over to their teacher. But what they didn't know is that the teacher has sold their invention, a high power laser, to the military who wants to use it to eliminate individual enemies. When the geniuses find out the truth, they will do anything to prevent the use of this weapon and will use all their intellect to get even...Overall the acting in this movie is OK. The young Val Kilmer and Gabriel Jarret are enjoyable to watch and the other actors did a good job too. But as I already said, the story in this movie is rather naive by today's standards and that's also the reason why I believe that this movie will be loved most by the 'older' audience. With older I don't mean people in their seventies or eighties, but people in their late twenties and early thirties, with other words people who were young in the eighties. Teenagers will probably not be too keen on it. Personally I find it all OK, but certainly not excellent.
