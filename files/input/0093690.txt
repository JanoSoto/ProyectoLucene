Shelley expands a bit on her famous Diane Chambers character from Cheers. And Bette Midler is simply Bette Midler and that's good enough for me.These two naturally don't hit it off, but when Coyote turns up as the victim of a bomb blast, both Midler and Long show up to say they're next of kin. Upon examination of the lower extremity of the burned cadaver which is all that's left, the two of them come to the same conclusion it's definitely not Coyote.Long and Midler just want to find this guy and get an explanation for his behavior and to find out who he really prefers. But there's a lot more to Coyote as the two of them on a merry chase that takes them to the New Mexico desert find out.Besides those already mentioned look for good performances from John Schuck as the rather rigid thinking CIA man and George Carlin as a droll and philosophical Indian.You can't say there aren't any more good women's roles being written when you see Long and Midler in Outrageous Fortune.

Examples When Bette says Gee, you thought I was going to go in and pee on him. verses edited version Gee, you thought I was going to go in and spit on him. Then the tobacco shop scene Bette says How about a blow job and then the edited version How about a party. Also several scenes cut from the edited version Bette with Peter Coyote having sex in a chair, seen from behind the chair. The scene at the police station where Bette tells the cop needle dick, pencil dick, ect. when she is trying to make him get the picture.

Shelley Long is a woman who has spent years studying for a stage acting career. As pointed out in another review on this thread, her character her is like Diane Chambers in CHEERS, except that Long is not lording her superior education over everyone. She does make one exception. She is trying to get into a course led by one of the great actors of this generation (Robert Prosky, in a clever role - he uses several accents), who is a Russian stage star - a Stanislavsky type. Prosky is quite selective about who comes in. He chooses Long because of her impressive resume. But he also allows in Bette Midler, who is ... well a hooker.Bette wants to better herself, and she'd like to be an actress. But she doesn't have the background or the money (Long has to borrow it from her parents). She gets in (it is more than hinted she sold some of her wares to Prosky). He looks amused as he decides to include her in the course.He is an intensive acting genius, and we see him demonstrate how to be realistic in many details (such as dying on stage). He is also insisting that they all take good notes, but leave their notebooks with him to be returned the following week. A hard taskmaster, he probably does know much about acting.In the meantime both Long and Midler meet Peter Coyote, and he is dating both without knowing of each other's connection. This is good, as Long and Midler dislike each other (Long looking down on this pretentious hooker, Midler hating this overbearing overachiever). Then, one day, Long is accompanying Coyote out for dinner. He enters a shop, and it suddenly explodes. Long (in deep mourning) goes to the morgue. Shortly Midler shows up, and after a brief screaming fit between them, they discover that the corpse simply can't be Coyote - it's lacking a certain piece of evidence that it is.Midler and Long decide to join forces to find out what happened to Coyote. They can't find any assistance from the police (who have an open and shut accidental death). But soon they are being pursued by Federal agents led by John Schuck. They manage to shake him off, and slowly follow the few clues they find to realize they have to cross the country to follow their lover...and to force him to choose between them.Eventually they do find Coyote, only to find another less pleasant side to him. And they find that half the world seems to be pursuing them as well.The film has great moments in it, such as Long using Prosky's training to fool some people, and Long and Midler playing Eastern Europeans trying to board a plane (the right plane) at an airport. Then there is George Carlin, who plays an American Indian with the attitudes of...well George Carlin, God bless him. The film is also interesting as Long and Midler, once their cooperation grows and they find what Coyote is like, discover that they really like each other more than they thought. Look at several scenes after the middle of the film where the ladies start helping each other with grooming tips. I suggest that this film, with THELMA AND LOUIS, finally cemented the idea that a buddy film did not need two men to be the buddies. And both films showed that such lady buddy films could be great entertainment.

They set out on an oddyssey across several states and end up fighting for their lives when he shows us he's not only a spy but somewhat psychotic! There's a great, if contrived, climax set atop skinny vertical rocks that are about 10 feet apart and 100 feet off the ground.

In any other situation, Bette Midler and Shelley Long might not have been able to stand each other, but here, they are instant theater rivals who have one thing in common (Peter Coyote) and after discovering the truth about him, band together to find him with many surprises along the way.You saw Ninja Vixens?, Midler asks when she encounters a clerk who instantly recognizes her after she storms in to use their phone. Also present is Long, an uptight actress who longs to take a class from a prestigious Russian acting teacher, and once Midler learns about the class, she longs to take it too. Coyote is believed to have been killed in an explosion and Midler and Long both instantly recognize that a certain body part on the corpse doesn't match up with what they particularly appreciated about him. So it's off to adventure, as they team together, and their bond makes them become closer with lots of gags on the way.Long and Midler are a seemingly odd team as they begin their adventure, and Long shows the rough and tough Midler that her acting training can make her just as tough, especially when they impersonate police officers. Later, they encounter Florence Stanley (as a cynical airline clerk) who rewards them for their ingenuity by providing them information almost immediately after bad-mouthing a customer who tried to bribe her into letting him take overweight luggage on board.This takes them from the rough streets of New York City to Mexico where they learn a few more things about the man they loved and Long gets to prove once again she just ain't some namby-pamby drama queen. The film grabs your attention from the beginning and never lets go. Laughs come fast and furious and the stars prove that they have what it takes to keep your interest. Robert Protsky, John Schuck and Jerry Zaks also have amusing supporting roles, and you will cheer on Long as her seven years of ballet pay off for her in a climactic sequence.

The film has obvious similarities to Hiller's earlier hit Silver Streak, and is a clear forerunner to his See No Evil Hear No Evil. In fact, the concept of ordinary characters being caught up in international intrigue found considerable favour during the '70s and '80s &#x96; besides the three Arthur Hiller films already mentioned, there's also the likes of Hanky Panky, The Man With One Red Shoe, High Anxiety and Jumpin' Jack Flash (to name but a few).Sandy Brozinsky (Bette Midler) and Lauren Ames (Shelley Long) are members of a New York acting class. They are as opposite as can be &#x96; Sandy loud, vulgar and brash; Lauren bookish, tender and sweet. Without knowing it they are both in love with the same man, Michael Sanders (Peter Coyote). When he is seemingly killed in a mysterious explosion, the two distraught lovers discover the truth about each other&#x85; and later, when asked to identify his remains, they realise that the body in the morgue is not the Michael Sanders they've shared a bed with for the past few weeks. Thrown together by chance, Sandy and Lauren embark on a cross country odyssey to track down their mystery man. Soon they are up to their necks in international espionage as it becomes clear they are not the only ones searching for Michael Sanders &#x96; indeed, the CIA and the KGB want him just as much as they do! The film is put together very slickly, with a fast-moving plot and plenty of snappy one-liners. At this point in her career, Midler was on a hot streak in a series of smash-hit comedies (Down And Out In Beverly Hills and Ruthless People being two of the biggest). Her character here is either flat-out hilarious or horribly annoying, depending on your taste in humour. Long plays it straighter and comes across very likably as the sweeter of the two hoodwinked lovers. Once the plot twists unravel themself, the film loses steam and in its final quarter becomes a disappointingly routine chase movie like any other. But up to that point, Outrageous Fortune is a lot of fun, a feminist variation of all those buddy-buddy flicks so typical of movies from the era. It has energy, vulgarity and attitude - much like its two female protagonists &#x96; and if you're looking for an entertainingly easy way to kill 100 minutes, you could do a lot worse.

Put some funny stuff in the beginning but wind up with an exciting thriller at the end.  The comedy isn't anything to get excited about, unless all your favorite comedies fit the above formula.  I can't stand seeing a movie where I see the joke coming from a mile away, and this was the case in this movie.  There weren't any jokes you have to think about, movie/book references, or non-sequiters.  Just stuff like Shelly Long being unable to say penis, some cross-dressing, and other boring fish out of water jokes.  The movie only shines with the dialogue between Midler and Long early in the movie.  I'm sure there are a lot of people who like this sort of movie, but if you're a fan of Monty Python, the Simpsons, the Coen Brothers  or any other real comedy I'd stay far away.  4/10.

Here she plays a brassy loud mouth opposite Shelly Long's more snooty and posh character. Both acting wannabees who attend the same drama class run by a strict Russian acting coach.Both are having an affair with a school teacher (Peter Coyote) who later dies in an explosion and in the morgue the mismatched couple meet and realise that they both have been sleeping with the same man and shockingly he is not dead as the corpse here is not as well endowed as Coyote was.The rest of the film is a caper as they are chased by some mysterious men, the dead schoolteacher is alive somewhere, has something to hide and not quiet the person they thought he was.The rest of the film is a caper film as they go looking for Coyote and ends up in the New Mexico desert with George Carlin as a faux native American.The film has aged and although what might had looked fun and entertaining in the late 1980s, it looks rather kitsch now and the plotting is loose and rather silly. Even the direction looks bad in places, such as the airport chase sequence and you have Robert Prosky turning up twice as different looking people but it certainly did not fool me.Some of the stunt double work looks poorly executed and the rock jumping scene at the end is over the top. Still Midler and Long make a good pair and push this silly film along.

When they discover they both have the same boyfriend, they set out to find him, with just about everyone in pursuit of them.  Basic comedy starts off good, but gets silly and uninteresting as the movie progresses.  Midler and Long have decent chemistry, but it is not enough to make this film a real success.2 out of 5 "},{"Title":"A terrible, cheaply made movie that makes me sick!","Date":"22 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Who were the idiots at Disney that green lit this one! Bette Midler got an golden globe nomination for this film, thats a joke. The golden globes give out nominations like candy(she's been nominated for 8), her performance was a joke in the film. Bette Midler should be ashamed of making money off this film. Shelly has made herself the butt of many jokes in Hollywood, so lets not discuss her part in this film. The sloppy writing, ugly photography(the type that would make Jean Renoir cry), and poor direction by Arthur carpool Hiller make it grueling to sit through. They should ban this film; its up there with Spiceworld and Startrek five. I'm glad to see that Bette Midler is a joke in Hollywood, her career is falling and she is no longer on the list. The next thing she'll do is an indie film to try to jump start her career. She'll need some luck with that. Bette Midler was nominated for two academy awards , both for bad films and bad performances. People in the 70's raved about her performance in The Rose, I don't consider is good acting when you're coked up and on pot everyday on the set. For the Boys? More like Bring a Gun to Shoot Yourself With When the Movie's Over. "}]
