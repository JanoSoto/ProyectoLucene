[{"Title":"Not just a silly slasher film","Date":"7 March 2005","Score":"64 out of 89 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an F letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an A.It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme.Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was self-aware. Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm reading too much into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something more adult.Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film. So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.

It looked mediocre, I must admit, and even though I had that in mind, I was also expecting it to be fun and entertaining nonetheless, at least. When I actually watched Valentine, I was amazed at how great the story line actually was for a slasher flick, and even though it has problems as any other slasher does, it is really entertaining and fun from beginning to end, which is all I need from a slasher to be satisfied.It pains me to see that it has a low rating, because it was not that horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully, or at least to the best of their ability with the characters and screenplay that they were given, and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning, even if many don't think so, or were already put off at that point. Some scenes were a little unbelievable and/or poor, and I confess at a few minor parts it got just a bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and actually suspenseful, the first time around at least. It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through, as do most slasher movies, and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills. Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer or rating. Especially not the trailer or rating, please. . .

Unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks, this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking.  For those out there that hated Scream, there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie (even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here).  This is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror.  You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of 90's films and the stalking-slasher madness of an 80's flick.  I guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for.  This is definitely a move in the right direction.Denise Richards stands out here as a fun character.  You can tell she liked her role, and that makes her stand out.  I loved her in this movie.

It certainly isn't as good as those movies that I have listed about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first Friday the 13th film. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made My Bloody Valentine, which I hated alot. Valentine is a better film than that one, but it's not saying much. The plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up, then they're picked off one-by-one. The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. But is it him? Or could it be somebody else? Valentine has an attractive cast which includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they've got, but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice. There are some scary moments throughout, however. ** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Some People Have It All Wrong!","Date":"12 January 2003","Score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  First off, let me start by saying, this movie isn't Award Winning Material, but it is a good slasher flick. Second let me say, i can't even believe they got that good of a cast to appear in this! The cast is young and incredibly talented. I dont understand how some people feel that the actors suck at acting. Those who did suck, gave it there all and passed. And for those of you who are talking about Denise, well i just wanna say that at least she's gotten somewhere! Her acting is fine, and she's doing good for herself. Now onto what everyone (Or almost everyone) has been talking about which they are wrong.                                  SpOiLeRs                        (Dont read if you havent seen it)Ok, first for those of you saying Dorothy is the Killer, the nose bleeds occured later in life! Your wrong! The Killer is Adam Carr/Jeremy Melton. Ok, heres why i KNOW i am right. First off, the editors of this film cut a lot of scenes out of this movie. Not that the MPAA wanted them to, but because they felt they had to to leave a mystery behind. One of the scenes cut was that of Adam Carr attacking Dorothy upstairs in her bedroom, Adam knocks her out and, takes off the Cherub costume and slips Dorothy into it. Thus leaving Dorothy in the Killers costume, framing her. Now when Kate is walking up the stairs, ready to fire. The Killer comes flying at her. Dorothy did NOT run at Kate. Since Dorothy had been knocked out, she was pushed by Adam. So when they both fall to the ground, it dazes Kate and begins to shake up Dorothy, suddenly Dorothy rises up from the ground, not even a second later she is hit with at least five shots to the chest. By Adam. This giving Dorothy No time to talk, No time to gesture Kate, and No time to take the mask off. So Adam framed Dorothy, just like Dorothy framed him at the dance in 6th grade! It's all simple after a while. I admit not getting it the first time around, but when i watched it again. I got it. Now at the end when Adam's nose begins to bleed, this points to Adam being Jeremy. Adam saved Kate, because in 6th grade Kate was nice to Adam/Jeremy.Now talks of a sequel have been floating around. I would like to see a sequel come out of this movie, but like other movies that dont do well, the sequel will probably go Direct-To-Video. But i'll still buy it anyway. HOPEFULLY we will be seeing a sequel sometime in the future DTV or Not, i want a sequel!

It was so well-made, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, etc! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely horrifying and creepy (Paige's death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the entire cast did a great job, especially the three leads David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met, and got autographs from, during the filming of this movie - VERY nice people!), and Marley Shelton.I am very sick of people calling this movie another Scream clone. This movie is, in no way, a Scream clone. In fact, this film runs rings around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Scream was also NOT the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. Excuse me, but it looks like Scream was also a clone too (ahem..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also featured masked killers).  I also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet, cupid face doing all of these horrible things. Another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! The ending gives me chills every time I see it!!!!!  So, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch Valentine again and give it another chance!PS- Keep an eye out for my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...

And here is why","Date":"11 September 2008","Score":"12 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. I classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks, after his Urban Legends. Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come to see this point of view of Humanism Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted. Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. The second iconic element is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets My favourite is Jessica Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date, never able to met with. Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables. Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer. Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed. Finally, Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer, David Boreanaz.The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at Dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes. Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know. Hard Rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In this Case its true. For me at least. But, I see a lot of reviews of this movie that bash it and dog it. The fact that it came out right on the line of when gore movies became popular is probably why people didn't like it. The movie wasn't filled with in your face gore the gore was more like a Friday the 13th. The Killer was very Michael Myersish, which is what I loved about it. The kills as i said where very Friday the 13th. while we are trying to figure out who the killer is the whole movie, That was very Prom Night. Now for my review. The Movie was Very vibrant with colors and at the same time was cold and dark and would send chills up your spin when you would see The Cherub in the shadows. The opening sequence was great I felt like he wasn't in a hurry to kill his victim but was very patient reminded me so much of The Shape from Halloween. The movie builds up suspense like most 80's horror but it also has the campy charm as well. So sad that we will never see a sequel How ever I intend on making a fan film sequel.

For the most part Valentine eschews the name cast, intrusive pop songs, and in-jokes. It is also less prudish than its 90s predecessors, which in cutting back on the graphic violence seemed almost apologetic for being of this genre and missed the whole point of their existence.

Some may say comparing this film to Halloween is a disservice to that brilliant movie, but I was thoroughly entertained by Valentine and think that most people will be. For fans of wonderfully visual films like The Cell and Seven, as I am, it will be even better of an experience. Horror films are not the place for those looking for psychological tension. The current breed of these films are cold, dark and nihilistic, and this is definitely one of the best of those. Look at the amazing way Blanks captures the killer in the film's first scene, with swinging lamps and dark corridors, the slash of his knife pounding into corpses with deafening thuds. Or his Cupid's arrows ripping into one of his victims. For those looking for a thinking movie, look elsewhere.

People start dying, a detective tries to solve the mystery, and the girls start having differences between them. The main idea, despite simple, is not bad. But the script is actually dull and ridiculous. And the acting, as you can imagine with that casting, is painfully poor. The monster of this movie, is a character about which we know nothing. This means there are no fascinating psychic features in his personality neither strange behaviors, an interesting lifestyle, strong and weird motivations, not even curious aesthetic aspects. He is a standard man wearing a ridiculous Cupid mask, without breaks, grime or anything to make it sordid. Among the girls there are no attractive psychic profiles or intimate conflicts either. And, of course, there are some extremely soft erotic moments (no nudity neither sex involved) around Denise Richards' character (her neck is the wildest thing you'll see and that's why this Review's Title), completely gratuitous and disconnected with the plot. The killing scenes are pathetic. Victims behave stupidly like Carmen Electra's character in Scarie Movie. The killer has no sinister behavior. And the act of killing itself is often physically absurd and visually not depicted. To sum up, there is nothing terrifying, sinister or even dark in this movie. It's basically a dumb horror flick for kids to watch a Sunday at 9pm with mom and dad at the living room. Of course, shooting, sound design, cinematography, editing, wardrobe and locations are not interesting, sharp or expressive either. By the way, it is absurd that this film got Certificate 16 at the USA. It's one of thousands of examples proving that the MPAA must seriously revise their labeling criteria.

We first see a Valentine's Day dance held in the high school in 1988. Jeremy Melton is a loner, some might even say a geek. He asks five girls his age for a dance. Most of them turn him down rudely EXCEPT for Dorothy. They get caught making out by some bullies and those bullies humiliate him in front of the whole school. Fast forward thirteen years - the girls are all grown up and are (for the most part) successful women. Pretty soon they, and others, start getting picked off by a mysterious serial killer who stalks them wearing a cupid mask. Could that boy they bullied and make fun of be the killer all grown up, or is the culprit someone new? Perhaps one of the girls' boyfriends?I really enjoyed 'Valentine' when I first saw it years ago. Is it a pretty sophisticated horror film. It's got a beautiful cast, gorgeous location shot, clearly a decent sized budget.. and it's actually scary! There is something unsettling about the killers' mask. It's a cupid mask, but from afar it sort of resembles Michael Myers' mask from the Halloween films. It was really creepy and some of the stalking scenes were just as creepy. The killer goes after his victims in a college campus, a small apartment, a mansion - all the location spots work in this movie. Lots of tense moments when he appears. There isn't a ton of blood, so the gore-hounds might be disappointed. I thought it was a decent amount. It didn't add or take away from the story.Some very good acting in this as well, especially by Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Denise Richards. I loved Jessica Cauffiel in this as the quirky Lily, but her role was sort of small and she was underused much like Katherine Heigl. I thought Valentine (for the year it was made in) was a cut above most slasher/horror flicks. It isn't just some silly average horror movie, it's got class and a certain kind of edge that separates it from others made around this time. The ending, without giving anything away, is also pretty terrifying in my opinion... Good movie all around.

They're cheap, nasty, ugly, vulgar, despicable, misogynistic exploitation pics that appeal to the basest, most primitive instinct of our collective id. That's not to say I don't enjoy them, but I have no illusions about their ultimate worth. When you do see a slasher movie that has any artistic merit whatsoever, it's easy to exaggerate its quality and see it as something more than what it is (i.e., House of Wax.) Seen in this perspective Valentine is actually one of the better examples of the genre I've seen, one of the few American slasher movies to approach the level of visual and stylistic sophistication found in the best Italian giallo. Director Jamie Banks is not yet on a par with Argento or Bava, but here he has crafted an atmospheric, entertaining thriller full of beautiful women, fiendish murders, and a truly inspired final gotcha. The script is full of tongue-in-cheek humor that kept me laughing out loud, but never sunk into the kind of self-referential, trendy hipster attitude that mars so many horror films made for Generation Y (i.e., Scream and its sequels). In the eighties most victims in horror flicks were anonymous starlets who never appeared in anything else, but since Drew Barrymore was butchered in Scream it has been increasingly common to cast familiar faces in the victim role. This film delivered spectacularly in that respect, with three truly beautiful women--Katherine Heigl, Jessica Caulfield, and Denise Richards (who received star billing!) meeting increasingly gruesome and inventive deaths. Ms. Richards' hot tub scene alone is worth the price of admission. It's become a cliché for the masked killer of beautiful women to turn out to be a chick herself, but Jessica Capshaw was believable as Dorothy. Marley Shelton, with her fetching girl next door wholesomeness (I loved her in sugar and spice) makes for an appealing last girl, and David Boreanaz was amusingly repellent as her alcoholic boy friend, at times resembling nothing so much as a junior varsity caricature of Jack Nicholson in The Shining. I give Valentine seven chainsaws--not as good as Blood and Black Lace but better than House of Wax.

But I saw Denise Richards on an old episode of Saved By the Bell and her performance was horrendous. But that's when I remembered that I really enjoyed her in this movie.It's as if she really took an acting class and didn't just rely on her looks, which I didn't find that amazing until I saw her in this movie with trimmed eyebrows. She was the strongest part about this movie. I thought it was her for a majority of the movie even though she didn't have a clear motive. She was just so strong and feisty. I thought it was her finest performance yet and watching it again four years later, I still agree.She didn't play the stereotypical slut. She was labeled that and every summary will tell you she was but she brought something completely different to her character. She may have gotten with a lot of guys, but she was definitely still classy about it. She avoided stereotypes.Marley Shelton on the other hand was a waste of space. Well not horrible, but her character was the sweet girl so that's who she played. Totally stereotype and a total trap of the character. She never would have survived this in real life. She's a wuss and I didn't care about her at all, because she was the main character and she was nice to the bad guy when he was a little boy whatever.OK, so, the girls all have great interactions with each other and it seems like they have been friends for a long time. Kate Capshaw is still fat, so I don't know why she kept saying I used to. David Boreanaz was also bad looking so I think he should have played Kate Capshaws boyfriend, the very sexy Cambell. Cambell, played by something Cosgrove should have been the leading guy because he was a lot more pleasing to look at.Also, I think it would have been a more interesting movie if Jeremy was actually not the killer cuz everyone is right, its been done!!! If Paige, Denise Richards, was actually the killer for some weird, twisted, CLEVER!, reason...I think the movie would have a lot more satisfying for me.So watch it for Denise Richards spectacular performance, and few scenes that make you jump, but if you are a horror movie buff, you'll be like it wasn't horrible. Denise saves the day, I hope I see more work like this.

Secondly, I am a huge horror movie fan.  I honestly feel only horror movie buffs can give good reviews as we know the material.  My opinion is honest, and not based on a dislike for the genre. Now on with my comments. Why did I love this movie?  First off, it's a holiday horror movie. I was reared on them in the late 80's with the VHS boom.  I especially love the Valentine theme.  Secondly, we are offered a cast of young adults as opposed to teens.  As a 20 something I can totally relate to the character's difficulties in the dating world. This helped define our characters.  It would have been easy to let the girls fall into the usual stereotypes of the pretty one, the smart one and sexy one etc.  By showcasing the difficulties of dating in an adult world, the cliched horror characters became people as opposed to cardboard cut outs.  Thirdly, you have to agree that the acting is great.  A good scary movie idea can be ruined by bad acting. Valentine is populated with a fresh, young, and attractive cast who can act.  This gives the movie an edge that many of its lower budget competitors could only pray at having.  For this and so much more I honestly love this movie.As for things I did not like?  Well there isn't much, but that annoying rhyming neighbor was as annoying as nails on a chalk board.  I think the movie could have done without him.  Even his murder was stupid.  Other then that I was pleased with the movie. Now what is the best aspect of this movie?  IT BROKE THE SCARY MOVIE CLICHE STARTED BY SCREAM!!!!  How many of you missed it?  Well here's the cliche.  From SCREAM (1996) on, so many horror movies ended with a killer telling the final girl or the would be survivors why they did the killings, and that they were going to frame so and so.  We saw this most notably in all the Scream movies, in both of the Urban Legend Films, and Do You Wanna Know A Secret.  Valentine seems to have confused people.  Many people left the theater thinking Dorothy was the killer, but she was not.  Adam was the killer.  He did what every killer in the fore mentioned movies set out to do.  He killed those who wronged them, and then he framed Dorothy for the murders.  This is evidenced by the blood dripping from Adams nose in the movie's closing scene. I love Valentine for so many reasons, and after you read my comments I am hoping you will like it just a little more.  Go on and vote for it. Give it your honest vote.  Mine was an 8.

People don't go to this movie to be enlightened, they go to have fun.  Its a really fun movie once you get over your initial pretentions...i suspect that this movie will find a following once on video by fans of such silliness as Tourist trap, friday the 13th or even prom night (p.s. this plot is remarkably similar to Terror Train, but handled better).Number 2, unlike every single horror that has come out in the last five years this one refuses to constantly compare itself to a similar horror movie.  Unlike scream, nobody says, hey this reminds me of terror train, or anything else, which is refeshingly different.Number 3, a careful, true horror fan will notice the influence of directors other than craven or carpenter.....notably Dario Argento.  Two scenes in particular the maggot filled chocolates, and the glass door death scene. I was thrilled to see someone paying homage to a different director for once.Number 4, and this sums it all up  If you don't expect much, you'll have fun, so go see this movie, you'll probably miss your chance after a few weeks to see this on the big screen surrounded by silly teenagers who jump at every scare.

Kate has a boyfriend that she likes, Adam Carr (David Boreanaz), but the guy has a drinking problem and Kate does not feel safe with him. Page is a shallow and promiscuous young woman and Dorothy is very insecure and has many complexes because she was a fat teenager. They believe that an old school student from their high school, who was abused by other students in a Valentine party, is responsible for the menaces. Although not being a great movie, there are many positive points in the screenplay of `Valentine'. First of all, a beautiful cast Marley Shelton and Denise Richards are delicious, Katherine Heigl, Jessica Cauffiel and Jessica Capshaw are very pretty women, and David Boreanaz is a handsome man. The murderers are very original and tense, specially the first one in the morgue; the locations, highlighting the video art gallery, are fancy. One negative point is the beginning of the movie, which is plagiarized from `Carrie'. But the greatest flaw in the screenplay is the lack of motives for the serial killer. There is no clue or hint showing why the killer commits such murders. Anyway, after the pros and cons, I believe that the viewers who like Jason, Freddy Krueger or Leatherface will have a good time with this Cherubim-masked killer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil) ` O Dia do Terror'  (`The Day of the Terror')  "},{"Title":"Started with a sixth grade party.

It's not that good of a movie.","Date":"16 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" No Bones about it. Only an Angel could sit through this film. David Boreanaz's Valentine is one of those contemporary Slasher films that is riding off the coattails of 1996's Scream success. Rather than trying to be like its own movie, it follow a lot of the previous film clichés to the point that the film rarely stands out. If 1978's Halloween is a good example on how to make a holiday themed horror flick; Valentine is the worst. The film is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, settling and plot are very different from the film. The book is pretty awful source material, but at less if the movie follow more of it, the film wouldn't be as bad as it is, now. One of the film's biggest mistakes, is the way, they try to make it, suspenseful. The movie tries really hard to make you ask, who done it, but clearly can't pull it off. The killer, Jeremy Melton, is killing people because at junior high school prom. It was there, he was cruelly shot down by some really over the top valley girls. If that wasn't enough, he was then bully by their boy/friends. Instead, of going on a school shooting, the next day, the killers waits 13 years later on Valentine Day for some unexplained reason to get revenge on the girls. Honestly, I don't know why he waited so long. He clearly got over it and by this time, can get any woman, he wants. The movie doesn't really explain, what trigger him to kill them after waiting for so long, but hey, we wouldn't have a movie, could we. Another thing, why didn't he even bother trying to kill the real people that treat him badly. You know, the boys that strip him down and beat him? It's such disproportionate retribution. One thing, the movie does too much in the beginning is gives way too much information about who the killer is. Without spoiling it, It's pretty obvious who it is. Honestly, who in the hell would believe the killer is a girl, when you see that Jeremy Melton in the beginning? If he had a sex-change, he clearly wouldn't be any of the girls that dissed off the guy in the first place. So, by making one of the victim, a suspense of the murders, doesn't make any sense, movie. Then the movie has the nerves to give other list of red herring suspects that isn't even close to believable that they were the killer. If you thought, they were, they get axed off, anyways, so you can tell who it is, by the end. At less, make the fake out guys, seem like their death was needed because they were the bullies that hurt Jeremy, but no. They were just random dudes at the wrong place, wrong time. You really got nobody to root for as all the victims character are god-awful clichés horror stereotypes. The girls grown up to be even sluttier. Denise Richards as Paige Prescott fit the role, well, but isn't really giving anything new. She is just an awful typecast actress. Oh, and there's no nudity, in case you were curious. The women deaths throughout the film are bit an ironic foreshadowing. You would think the killer would be a little bit clever with the deaths. While, the kills are remotely alike, and he does use some really innovative weapons. It's nothing, we haven't saw before. Mid, while the killer is able to do a lot of unrealistic things like change clothes in seconds during attack scenes, and pulled off being at two places at once. While the concept of the masked killer is far from original, the cherub mask is a cool, creepy look. It could had been better. Director Jamie Blank really could had done, something about the pacing in this film. It's so damn slow. The movie put so much time on minor character's character development, that the main characters have very few of them. The soundtrack is pretty OK, but I don't think it add anything to the story. I don't find any of the main characters listening to Disturbed or Rob Zombie on their down time. The soundtrack compilation was even lampooned in a sketch by Saturday Night Live because how 'out of place' it was in the film. The movie even steal a Halloween style score in the beginning, but never truly use well. I thought it would add more a creepy feel to the film, rather sounding like a bad written heavy metal fan horror mystery film. I wouldn't say, it's the worst horror movie of all time, but don't expect to come in, hoping anything to stand out. It's just your typical slasher film. The original 1981's My Bloody Valentine, another Valentine's Day-themed slasher flick is a little bit better if you want something rather than a rom-com for Valentine Day.

Good ol' late 90's Slasher/Thriller. My main problem with such films is that they are tagged/labeled as Horror. Having a killer in a film, even this kind of stalking creepy killer, doesn't make a movie Horror. There are many films that resemble Valentine in many aspects and features that weren't labeled as Horror, so why? Because it had blood in it? Just my opinion.Valentine, as I said, one of the better Slasher/Thriller films of the new millennium. It has all the makings of suspense and on edge sensation. I personally found the dialogues to be superb, absolutely my favorite part of the film, especially the letter from hell style Valentine cards and Gary's discussion with Kate. Respect to all 4 screenwriters (and of course to Tom Savage, writer of the novel). Also, great soundtrack! Really enjoyed the music.As for acting, it was also good, especially Denise Richards who really aced the role of the flirty-slutty member of the group (none of the actresses lacked good looks, and still Richards really manages to stick out). Nice work also by David Angel Boreanaz who really managed to get into the role of the guilt-ridden slightly neurotic boyfriend with the drinking problem, although his drunk act wasn't all that convincing.As for the story - nothing special about it, basic Slasher type revenge tale. It appeared that I hadn't really understood the ending before I read about it in the message boards here, but it was also good. Could have used a better, smarter and slightly more obvious twist to it, a good twist is what makes a good slasher great.All in all, Valentine is definitely a worth while film that I'm glad I got to watch, even 11 years after it's release.

Its stylish and beautiful camera-work as well as sets and locations, creative and brutal death scenes, superb soundtrack, intense chase scenes, a mysterious plot and a quite cheesy finale are all points that can make the film a giallo movie, but an American one and has slightly lesser investigations of the murderer going on. For those who do not know what what a giallo film is, I recommend you watching Italian thrillers like Deep Red, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage or Tenebre and you will know what I mean. A giallo film does not need to be as scary as Halloween or Friday the 13th but instead stylish and mysterious, so does Valentine.

Though, it's pitiful that it wasn't made as spoof. Because despite having a good formation for a script, especially the ending's surprise, some matters made the parody, any parody, sure more watchable in comparison.The movie suffers from a die-hard TV-ish condition. The image is away from being a bit dazzling or even cinematic. No factors said that we're watching anything else the movie of the week. While we're supposed to be in a thrilling horror, there was a state of stagnancy and indolence around; which pushes you to ask who was the real slasher of the movie ?! (Denise Richards), the first name on the poster, is a major turn off. I came to believe that being her is an enough reason to be killed. I loved the moment of killing her since it meant not seeing her again. Her dull presence and awful acting ruined big part of standing the viewing !Then, the vocal cat fight between (Dorothy) and her young stepmother led to nothing, since not the stepmother or the father ended up as murdered or ever appeared again ! How (Dorothy) thought that her boyfriend left the villa near the end ? His clothes were left, being killed in his bathrobe, so he's a nudist ?! And by the way the killer's mask seemed a bit laughable, as if it was modeled after actor (Frederick Koehler)'s baby face !I find it strange why (Scream &#x96; 1996) made that horror boom, for the slasher subgenre in specific, at the middle of the 1990s. True (Scream) isn't a great movie in my book, but there must be causes for its box office success, many sequels and likes. Aside from presenting a well formula for a thriller/horror/teen movie for Hollywood to feed on, I think it met a strong sense of being unsecured for the teens of the time, and a case of distrust among the people in totally materialistic world where love is missed; notice how the first victim (played by Katherine Heigl) Leaves a disgusting possible lover to work &#x96; more satisfied &#x96; among corpses, (Dorothy)'s father cares about his new wife more than his daughter, (Dorothy)'s love isn't trustable; loving her money not her, every girl in the movie suspects her lover, the end is about trusting the wrong lover, and originally the killer is someone had nobody to love or to trust either.(Valentine) as a horror parody ignored some potential irony. And as only a horror it bores; due to not much of scary moments, no artistic dealing and predicting the formula easily. Comparing it to (Scream) proves missing the cinematic heat; namely craft and better talents. So it managed to be a slasher movie's weak copy, following the known-by-heart steps yet poorly. That's why the voluptuous beauty of (Jessica Capshaw) is the whole show here, and nothing else it ! Slasher movies are like porn without sex. Namely cheap and empty.

After receiving a series of threatening valentines, the girls & their current beaus, are being picked off by the madman who hides his face behind a cupids mask, after a while the girls do figure out it's him thats doing the killings, but their problem is where is he? & what does he look like after all these years? especially since he changed his looks. As the body count mounts, the girls better find out who & where he is, or wind up being spending their valentines day being buried six feet under. Ah yes VALENTINE, a film I have been trying to see for quiet a few years now, but due to me reviewing other films, I completely forgot about it until just recently, when my local video store had nothing that seemed to interest me, as I was about to leave this one popped out at me, so I decided to rent it & see what it was like. Prior to seeing the film, I heard mostly mixed reviews, some said they enjoyed the film greatly, others said it was a turd, as for me, I found it not all that bad, far from anything spectacular, but good & really isn't the disaster most made the film out to be. What I liked about the movie is that the film boasts some good acting & I thought the story was interesting. Director JAMIE BLANKS has a good visual eye & his direction is well suited for the material. The film also has a few suspenseful moments & the cast was attractive, all that out of the way though, VALENTINE also messes up by trying to be something that it's not, & by that I mean trying to aim higher than something than that of the horror genre & as a result, I feel that's the main thing that makes the film seem half baked. The film tries to hide it's gory intentions under the title of psychological thriller using it as a get out of jail free card, as a result, the film hasn't got much to offer slasher fans & those who aren't a fan of the genre aren't likely to take to much of a shine to it either, but really is anyone really surprised by any of this? especially for a slasher film released by a major studio, where the word Horror is a dirty word to say within high brow Hollywood? The gore is almost non existent, with a few light smears of blood here & there, there is no requisite nudity, despite the attractive cast & despite that's what a lot of fans of the genre expect, the kills are equally as lame & the director blows it with his weak ending which while clever, is a real let down considering the amount of momentum the film has in getting to that place. However it seems the worst death of all didn't happen on screen but rather in real life, as no one it seems could stop the bruising reception the film received by fans & critics at the time of it's release, all of whom pretty much called it trivial & boring & worse, the film came at the very end of the SCREAM era slasher craze & as a result, didn't fare well at the box office either & killed the seemingly promising career of young Blanks as a mainstream director. Fans of the SCREAM films & non demanding horror buffs may like it, others looking for more, may want to leave this valentine unopened. **1/2 stars "},{"Title":"Possibly the worst thing David Boreanaz is in","Date":"25 November 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Come On this movie is ridiculous.

A lesson I hope to teach people like this (if there are any) DON'T GET BEATEN UP BY SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE JUST A KID.The twist gave me my overall rating (which it would've been a 5) David Boreanaz being the killer when a few minutes earlier he shoots someone repeatedly wearing the exact clothes he was wearing he pulls off the mask and it's one of their friends would be better because the killer was in her house and somehow managed to get passed workers there.Back to earlier in the movie Denise Richards' character annoyed the ####ing crap outta me the only character out of the women there who were even close to descent was Marley Shelton's character and that's not saying much.How come in all these slasher type movies the killer dresses the same as other slasher killers they always wear black and a mask I can't see anyone wanting to wear.Before we get to the good points in this movie If you want a good David Boreanaz Movie I suggest The Crow Wicked Prayer Or If you want a TV show thats better try the Buffyverse ones...If you want another good Denise Richards Movie (Don't Laugh) I suggest Drop Dead Gorgeous (That film has still got me puzzled as to why I like it).The Good points are that it teaches guys how not to act on a date, it is at least better than the typical slasher movie, it also has a good cast especially being that it has my all-time favorite actor in it, I also think that besides the bad points this movie is entertaining & at one point I did laugh at a jokeAdam Carr I'm sorry that I couldn't make it to the art show.Kate Davies Don't worry, you didn't miss much.

Three of the girls grew up to become Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Denise Richards (Paige) and Marley Shelton. The other girl grew up to be that annoying girl from the Urban Legends sequel Final Cut. And the girl who grew up to be Marley Shelton (from hereon to be referred to as Kate) is dating the guy who used to be a crime fighting TV Vampire and is now a crime fighting TV FBI Agent David Boreanaz (who's plays recovering alcoholic and journalist Adam). Anyway the girls and people around them start to get picked off one by one, causing Denise Richards to make out with a guy, pour hot wax on his nether regions and then put on a bikini so she can get drilled and then electrocuted in a hot tub. There is a rather unsurprising twist in the tale however, which nevertheless has a nice reveal.The acting what do you want? It's a horror film. No one in this is terrible. Denise Richards and Jessica Capshaw are both eminently hateable, while Shelton is sweet and innocent. Boreanaz, who doesn't have many scenes, is probably the stand out, bringing some much needed sympathy as well as testosterone to a film chock full of horrible female characters. Everyone plays it straight, which was what this film needed.The script fine given the mission statement. You'll be cheering the deaths of most of the characters and rooting for the killer to keep right on with what he's doing, as long as he doesn't touch Kate.Overall this was a fun little movie with some good kills and a nice reveal of the see-through twist ending. Nowhere near as bad as it's made out to be, though one of the kills is pretty grisly.

There's no real upsetting gore and no nudity. The movie tried just a bit too hard to be 'hip', with its cool soundtrack and all... Even though some scenes were pretty dull, I mildly enjoyed it because the actual slasher scenes were good and suspenseful. The acting was tolerable, except for a few of the (attractive) ladies (that Asian 'mail-order-bride-from-hell' overacted badly). I also had a few (intended) laughs, mainly with the 30 seconds audition-part for Marley Shelton's suitable boyfriend. And Detective Vaughn insinuating the sexual tension between him and Denise Richards cranked me up too. The ending of Valentine, when the identity of the killer is revealed in particular, goes really over the top too much. You just can't help but laugh with it, wondering if they actually meant that final twist seriously. Nevertheless, there are much worse slashers out there, and also a lot of better ones.

The school nerd asks four separate girls to dance with him, all reject him (though the blonde girl lets him down as nice as possible) then he asks their chubby friend who accepts. When spied on by the jocks (scumbags they are, they see exactly what's going on), the fat girl lies that the nerd attacked her and he is set on by the jocks, dragged into the dance floor and beaten up, and later taken away to reform school, only to disappear off the map completely.Fast forward 13 years and the girls are still friends, looking for a boyfriend with Valentine's day coming up. The only exception to this is Kate, though she has problems with her current boyfriend who has emotional and mental difficulties in their relationship. Shortly after, the girls start getting death threats in the form of valentines day cards. Each one then starts getting horribly murdered (cleverly in relation to the rejections they gave Melton) by a killer in a cupid mask, who's nose bleeds like Melton's did when he got angry at the dance. In fact, the killer is actually the one I ended up sympathising with, considering that he's been wronged, and his murder tactics are nothing short of inspired. However, that kind of cancels out the idea that we're watching a horror film, because I didn't sympathise with the characters much at all, and didn't feel scared for a moment.In the film, almost all the men seem to be awful lechers and creeps in some way or another, though the women possess unfortunate foibles of backstabbing and bitchiness themselves so perhaps the writer was trying to bring across a misanthropic message about people generally being idiots and that Valentine's Day is awful. If this is the case, then I love what they were trying to pull off and wanted to treat it as an unintentionally hilarious misanthrope comedy. In all honesty, they should have shown it as a misanthropic black romantic comedy especially since Kate and her boyfriend seem to be the nicest people in the movie. Alternatively, the message might be that ladies, you can't trust men, in which case, the movie is total unoriginal rubbish anyway.However, the worst thing about this movie was the terrible ending, where when we discover that in the twist that Kate's boyfriend is actually the killer and we hear Kate scream at the end, it was the final finger to the naively hopeful audience. I hate films where everyone dies in the end. I hated it in a certain Nicholas Cage film that I won't mention here, and I hated it here, because it ruins the whole point of the entire story. It would've been just hilariously/enjoyably bad if they had him ride off into the sunset with her or something (especially as a black romantic comedy), but instead they threw it all away. In general, avoid. You're not missing anything.

Looking back, Urban Legend was actually one of the better efforts that shamelessly jumped on the Scream bandwagon, good enough to garner a sequel and it showed that the director knew how to build tension and had an eye for neat photography.  For his follow up he put a popular and capable cast together, including Denise Richards and David Boreanaz, going back to the roots of the slasher genre's influences to terrorize an annual day of celebration. His choice - rather obviously - was St. Valentine's day, the same holiday that was (pick) axed in 1981 by director George Milhalka and his gas masked bogeyman - Harry Walden. Upon release My Bloody Valentine was rather ignored, but over the years it has gained a cult following for its foreboding location and the prospect that maybe one day fans will be able to see a full uncut copy that is supposed to be exquisitely packed with gore. Banks' Valentine isn't any kind of remake; in fact the only things that this has in common with its predecessor is the date for which the slaughter takes place and a few references. But I kind of hoped that they might both share the same endearing sense of fun too&#133;It starts with a pre-teen valentine disco set in 1988.  A bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with. First he approaches Shelly (later played by Katherine Heigl) who embarrassingly rebuffs him. His charm doesn't seem to work with Lilly (Jessica Cauffer), Paige (Denise Richards) or Kate (Marley Shelton) either; they all send him packing quite arrogantly. His luck changes when Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw) actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand. They are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies. In order to save her own self from persecution, Dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge. They cover him in red goo (Carrie?), strip him and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up. Hmmm, could that be the sort of thing to turn someone in to a violent mass murderer? Well of course&#133; Fast forward ten years and the girls are now women.  No one is sure what happened to Jeremy (the bullied brat from earlier) as he disappeared after that dance. It's close to Valentines Day and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives. They soon realise to take them seriously when Shelly is found with her throat sliced. Before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving Kate and her boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz) to work out that she's next on the psycho's list&#133;     Firstly, this certainly looks the business. The healthy production values have been put to good use and the photography is excellent in places. The director also gains credit for the thought he puts into some of the shots. A dead girl falling over a banister and landing in an open bin, the scene in the art display was also smartly located, although perhaps he didn't make as good use of it as he could have. Most of the cast are exceptionally beautiful (Charlie Sheen's missus takes some beating) and they're better actors than most slasher alumni that usually plague similar themed efforts. But if ever the phrase &#145;looks aren't everything' could be applied specifically to a movie, and then this is that film. Basically, what we have here is pleasing eye candy without anything solid to back it up. Think of Jennifer Lopez and you'll know what I mean. Ok, take your mind off J-Lo now so we can get back to the film&#133; are you ready? Good. The murders are practically gore-less (perhaps an attempt to gain the most lenient rating possible?), which may have worked for Halloween because John Carpenter used precision to make sure that each killing was extremely suspenseful, but Jamie Banks hasn't bothered to include either. The first chase sequence was tight and brilliantly crafted, but the rest simply felt rushed and unplanned. The assassin does indeed look creepy in a cherub mask and the blood trickling from his nose after he dispatches each victim was a neat little touch. Nevertheless, there aren't enough of those pleasing elements to add up to a satisfying whole and mostly Valentine is as hollow as an Easter egg.Perhaps this could have worked as a mystery if you were lucky enough to see it at the cinema, although Warner Bros manage to ruin it for you on video by giving away the killer's identity on the back cover.   Another problem with Valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it's almost impossibility for them to win over the audience. In the beginning they're shown as mockers to any child that's unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain. This discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date, simply because they're not up to their high standards. How can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive? In a typical slasher movie, the &#145;final girl' is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards, like Laurie Strode. These characters have no such power, leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway!Jamie Banks has proved that he has the potential to become a fair helmer, however I would consider this to be his first feature failure. It certainly didn't help that the cover description ruined the mystery for me, but even so, there's still little to recommend here. It's a shame that he couldn't have made more of the talented cast and competent budget, but in the end, Valentine just feels empty. A couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones. Cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart&#133;    "},{"Title":"Same old, same old...","Date":"10 February 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  ***Possible Spoiler*** This is MTV slasher nr 1000 something and it's just like the rest.

A few murder scenes that seem stolen from a Friday the 13th movie that never made it to the screens made this movie just a littleeeeeeee entertaining sometimes. Besides that, Valentine is a tumult of cliches, wasted ideas and errors.The movie has a Detective that seems to be about to become an important character in the story. But he never does that. He does nothing to find the killer. He just disappears from the story faster than Sandra Bullock did in the Vanishing (okay, maybe he had the right idea). But he doesn't leave before doing something a little perverted (like putting his hand on a woman's lap) to make us believe he might be the killer. But it didn't work. It wasn't convincing enough. Denise Richards proves once again that she can't act. And the outcome of this story is as messy as the rest of the film. People are disappearing, and those that aren't dead yet are worried enough to call the police, but then they attend a party, as if nothing was happening. And when they are alone at that party (yes, they are alone even if that can be dangerous), they start to die. Should we jump to the conclusion that everyone in this film is so obsessed with having fun that they are willing to set their problems aside, put their lives at stake?The killer has a motive. But his motive is related to something that happened when he was a teenager. Why didn't the writers of this film make him murder someone who hit him when he was in kindergarten? The creators of this atrocity wanted a movie about a serial killer who goes on a rampage during Valentine Day because Halloween, New Year, Friday the 13th are already taken, and the producers of those films made a lot of money, so the producers of this film expected that another holiday killer would be another money-maker as well. Perhaps we need someone with a stupid reason to murder people on Independence Day, and I am not talking about marauding aliens with windows 95 here. My advice? Avoid this film.

It looks like the mascot to some high school football team, and ever after that's all it is.The music was perhaps the best aspect, though a significant step down from Davis' other works including Matrix (which I did not like), JPIII, Anti-Trust, and his best score, House on Haunted Hill (99).  How does it fair against slasher classic scores such as Herrmann's Psycho and Carpenter's Halloween?  Simple.  It doesn't.  Likewise, how does the film stand up to classics?  It doesn't.Enter your typical slasher jumps in logic - retarded actions people do that get themselves killed like the opening scene in the morgue.  What viewer does not see what's coming before it hits?  Jumps in logic that only happen - only would be considered - in a movie because the writers thought it would be cool. Exaggerate reality for the sake of effect?  Yeah, sure, go for it. But when a character's life is stake, make them do utterly retarded acts of virtual suicide (even by slasher standards)?  No.Let all the characters die - none of them arose above F13 standards. Their relationships to one another were as artificial as they come.  But hey, it goes along with the plot that feels itself necessary to spell out all major plots and relationships.  Why not freeze frame and superimpose text saying, `She's mad at her friends'?  There's no need to ask questions about Valentine, because the film assumes, you the viewer, are mentally defiant and feels the need to ask all the questions for you.  Absolutely no subtlety, which is what kills what could've been an effective, controversial, and thought provoking ending.  Instead we get an over-explained misfire that's so jumbled and clumsy it defeats itself.The premise . . . eh, might have had potential.  Some sequences did have lots of potential and a few came through.  The characters should have been scrapped in the first draft.  Average slasher at best.

I will say this though; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school.  You know, the ones with Batman exclaiming You're a super crime-fighting valentine!Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream.  The villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable.  The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!  The score is more overbearing than Norman Bates' mother.The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous.  Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one.  This stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school.  With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom.  Melton seems like the obvious suspect.  Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years Melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome.  So (insert terrified gasp here) everyone is a suspect!Here's problem one.  In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz.  Nerds don't turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds.  He's not a terrible actor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards (the bustiest  actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene.  Note to self  always bring a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party.  Just because it's February doesn't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip.The slasher in Valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a Cherub's mask.  Here's problem number two.  The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons.  Plain and simple, it's not.  Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face, including his eyes and ears, can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables.  Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands.  Not only is the movie bad, it isn't even sure who the killer is; the final twist is more Huh? than Hah!  When you're not scratching your head you're yawning, then groaning, then searching for the nearest exit.  Do not watch this movie.  Even if you're alone on Valentine's Day, find something, ANYTHING, else to do.  You'll be glad you did.

Who is doing it? The geeky boy they were mean to in Jr. High school? The girls mysterious boyfriends? Ancient-looking David Boreanz(or was he one of their boyfriends? I don't remember.) I really didn't care that much, but to give the stupid thing credit, I think the ending surprised me a slight bit. The rest was something to be desired. Bimbos. Generic lines. I remember Denise Richards calling out something in her not-very-enthousiastic voice when she was trying to be all seductive in a hot tub.

Blanks creates some very elaborate and creative death scenes Katherine Heigl has her throat slashed while hiding in a bodybag, Jessica Cauffiel is blasted with arrows and falls down a stairwell, Denise Richards is electrocuted in a hot tub with a drill, plus many more. Needless to say (though I'll say it anyway) very cool death scenes, while not going OTT with the gore.Good killer. The mask is a bit stupid, but sort of lulls you into a false sense of security- it's a childish, cherub face, but behind the mask is a psycho capable of supreme acts of violence.The acting is good (not Oscar material, but what do you expect- it's a horror movie!) Kate, Shelly and Adam are really the only characters with any redeeming qualities.There's good suspense, particularly from Don Davis' musical score. The cherub mask gets more sinister as the movie goes on.Good stuff overall, with a very refreshing ending. Recommended. 9/10.

They all get morbid valentines day cards. First, Shelly dies by getting her throat slit. Then Lily is murdered in a cool death scene. Who could Jeremy be now? Is it  Adam Carr (David Boreanaz)? Is it Dororthy's boyfriend Campbell? Or is Jeremy not changing his name and they have no idea what he could look like? You will find out at Dorothy's Valentine's Day party where more bodies begin to drop, and where we find out who is in the cupid mask.This slasher brings back the 80's and totally changes the rules of the Scream generation. Like for example, it is not set in a small town, but in a big city. Also, the characters are not teenagers, they are in their 20's. The gore is also good, especially Paige's (Denise Richards) death. If there was nudity this would be a perfect 80's like slasher. I am hoping they make a sequel to this.

They are so unbelievably formulaic. And if Valentine had been released a year or so earlier, I'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summers, and Urban Legends.Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. Lots of T&A on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.The thing I can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its?'. The thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered. Usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway (eg. main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog). Everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect', but they are more 'Red Herrings' than suspects. As we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way. The issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. Will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?This still didn't make Valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still doesn't count for much. To anybody thinking of making another film along these lines, please don't. Originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.

I kept saying after the conclusion of the movie, Well, maybe it was Jeremy. No, maybe the killer wasn't the same person as the one at the dance. So many elements in the movie contradicted each other. For example, (SPOILER) one girl Dorothy tells her boyfriend to go somewhere and he gets killed. Dorothy's archrival, an ex of her boyfriend, yells at her and gets killed shortly thereafter. So, I suspected her the rest of the movie. But, she received a weird Valentine, too, so how could she have sent it to herself? That would be pointless to show. Then, there's this useless scene where the cop hits on Paige (Denise Richards' character). What's up with that? Was he meant to be thought of as a suspect by viewers? They say that Jeremy might have gotten plastic surgery, so we're inclined to believe that the killer is one of the girl's boyfriends or dates. Then, we see Dorothy complaining that she was the least popular of all the friends and that she resents them all (all the more I think she's the killer). Then, it comes to the unmasking and we see someone we don't want to believe is the killer, but the person they unmask in the end of the movie wasn't the actual killer but someone wearing the same mask as the killer (That's what I'm guessing. I'm not sure). The real killer (I assume this person was) is shown in the end having a nose bleed, like the masked character always had each time he killed someone. But, then there is not enough evidence that the real killer is Jeremy. You know the person with the nosebleed did the killings, but they don't successfully connect them to the kid. They say his parents died in a fire after he went to the mental institution, but then they don't ever say whether or not Jeremy started the fire. The dialogue and plot were so vague, it's easy to assume that it could have been some other person who was in the girls' lives and just happened to be a psycho killer. You don't hear much about the killer's past life, only that the person is someone in the girls' personal lives in the present. The killer does make statements that indicate insecurity but doesn't say enough to indicate that he/she is Jeremy. It was just a mess.

"},{"Title":"What an awful mess.","Date":"30 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies, including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie, and as much as I hate to be redundant, the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion.(spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone, and then THEY start to get killed. The problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason, for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated, he is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that, and more importantly, he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and Jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure, I thought for a while that he might very well be the killer, but that's not the point. We know from early on that he is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, he appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him.On the positive side, the killer's true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another rip-off. Early in the film, when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel, he makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who, with all due respect, looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyer's is that Michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the end, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal), but then we see Adam's nose start to bleed as he holds Kate, his often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that he's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, and even I wasn't scared), and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die.

Over the years, I've had a love-hate relationship with teen-slasher films, especially those who came out after the incredible success of Scream. I like the Scream movies, and I found I Know What You Did Last Summer very entertaining, but apart from them (and Final Destination), the likes of The Faculty, Urban Legend and all those others, did not go too well with me. Frankly, I consider them inane rubbish. After having read promising reviews of Cherry Falls, I was deeply disappointed the abysmal feature itself, and considered there to be no hope the teen-slasher genre. Still, I went to see Valentine.Directed by Jamie Blanks of Urban Legend fame, there was very little about Valentine that gave the impression of an above-average thriller, and yet it is. What helps is that the material is taken seriously, there are no pop-culture references, in-jokes or post-modernism that has plagued most of recent teen-films. This film is a welcome return to the more genuine, old-fashioned films of the eighties, sometimes even reminiscent of Dario Argento, the master that Blanks is undoubtedly a fan of. Again, the film scores points for avoiding political-correctness; the victims are mostly women and, surprisingly, they're all white. The killer, wearing a cherub-mask that is at first silly, but becomes rather scary as the film goes on, never runs but ultimately catches his victims (in the grand tradition created by the original Mummy film) and proceeds in mutilating them in macabre ways, be it with a bow and arrow, electric screwdriver or a steam-iron, this killer is always interesting if only for the sake of knowing what instrument he'll use next!But what about the women he kills? The actresses in this movie are actresses whose names you will probably never know or never remember, but I was actually so impressed by a couple of them that I did learn their names... But then again, I didn't like them all. As hard as I try, I cannot seem to find anything good about Denise Richard's most recent performances. She was awful in The World is Not Enough and she's awful in this! While she was perfect for the sexy-sultry vixen of Wild Things, she's just not good at all in this movie. There are moments when she's adequate, but most of the time the dialogue that comes from her mouth seems forced, unreal and pretentious. The other actresses fare much better. Marley Shelton makes a fine protagonist while the two Jessicas, Capshaw and Cauffiel, are easily the stars of the group. Both are very natural and give good performances. Katherine Heigl is in the movie for such a short time that it's really not worth mentioning her, but she was also good in her part. The real problem, performance-wise, comes from the terrible miscasting of David Boreanaz. He's just painful to watch sometimes, too stiff and too wooden - and he's playing a character that's supposed to be much younger than he is!Jamie Blanks directs the film with some style, though never going over-the-top in his visuals. The film has a cool, toned-down look and feel to it and is cold and steely. I really liked the visual aspect of the film. The killer wears a cherub mask and he uses a bow in one scene, another scene has one of the victims' puddle of blood looking remarkably like a heart, and the list goes on. Still, despite what sound like a rave review from me, I found a number of flaws with the film. The killer's original appearance is so sudden, and the sight of the mask may cause some audiences to laugh. Many of the victims are secondary characters that add nothing at all to the plot other than a number to add to the body-count. As a result, we don't really care about many of the characters that are killed, and the suspense Blanks tries to conjure fails.However, if it weren't for one thing then all of the things above would be meaningless and not worthy talking about. This thing is suspense, and Valentine has loads of it. I was so surprised to feel the suspense in this film as I had not felt something like it for a while, and certainly not in a film of this genre. So, all in all, it must be said that this movie works! Forget the stupid plotting, forget the crappy dialogue, turn off your brain and go with the show and you might find yourself enjoying it immensely. I did, and I'm not going to apologize for it.7.5/10  "},{"Title":"I loved this film, esp.

But Valentine doesn't even measure up to the campy fun of those bad flicks - it's just plain bad.Valentine (released to coincide with Valentine's Day) has literally nothing to do with the holiday.  We begin with a Carrie-rip off, in which a 6th grade boy is ridiculed at a school dance when he is accused of assaulting (ridiculous in its own right) a girl.  Bullies then pour red punch (substituted for pig's blood) on him in slow-motion.  Skip ahead to the students' college years, where girls who rejected him find themselves being stalked and murdered.So the movie lumbers on with poorly written dialogue, one-dimensional characters, ridiculous plot points, and lazy writing.  For example, after a few of the girls are killed, the remaining girls decide throw a party rather than opting to be cautious.  With such a dumbed-down plot, at least a few decent death scenes can be expected; the movie instead eschews this and we are given poor, bloodless scenes of implied killings yes, Valentine even fails to provide gore.An exercise in uninspired filmmaking, lazy scripting, wooden acting, and bloodless death, Valentine is surely one of the worst recent additions to the thoroughly excavated and empty teen horror genre, failing on every possible level of horror.

My expectations have dropped so low that I found myself enjoying this unspectacular, unstylish, not overly imaginative horror flick. (I also didn't hate Dracula 2000, more signs of my current delusional state).For one thing, I thought the killer was pretty cool. He had a swell cherub mask (designed by the guys at KNB effects), a Candyman-esque trench coat and a neat gimmick Whenever he killed someone, he got a nosebleed. If McFarlane Toys made a Movie Maniac figure of this guy, I'd probably buy it.There's not much gore, but there are some good kills and I liked the killer's goofy valentines (Roses are red, Violets are blue, They'll need dental records to identify you). I also enjoyed the maggots-in-the-chocolates scene to the utmost. The female cast members are all pretty enough, but they're all forgettable, except for the beautiful Katherine Heigel (from Bride of Chucky) who doesn't get enough screen time. On the other hand, the utterly annoying Denise Richards gets far too much screen time.But this movie refuses to be anything other than average. There are no standout scenes. In most classic horror movies there are certain sequences that are always remembered, like the fountain of blood scene in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Even Scream had Drew Barrymore's opening death scene. Valentine just has the standard stalk-n-slash scenes. A scene involving a hot tub and a power drill started off good but petered out before getting cool. Most current horror flicks don't have the horror style of really good horror flicks- Look at any of the classics- stuff like Hellraiser, The Exorcist, The Thing, Halloween, even Final Destination-  from beginning to end, you always know you're watching a horror movie. But with current flicks like Valentine, Urban Legends, or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the death scenes alternate with scenes that could've been taken from Dawson's Creek or She's All That.Anyway, when this comes out on video it's worth a viewing. It's better than Cherry Falls or Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2 as far as recent dumb horror movies go, although not as terrifying as the blood-curdling roller coaster ride that was The Little Vampire.

I enjoyed other revenge films such as Terror Train and 976-EVIL, that I was sure I was going to love this one.

Case in point Valentine. I was quite thrilled to hear the delightfully morbid (although somewhat obvious) Valentine's Day by Marilyn Manson during an otherwise excruciatingly boring party scene.There was something interesting going on in the film's look, stylistically slick and in gratuitous homage to Dario Argento. Unfortunately, Valentine is cursed with your basic interchangeable revenge plot. Kid is spurned, kid grows up, kills the lovely ones who spurned him. Or (yawn) is it (yawn) really (yawwwn) him??? After a perfunctory Scream-esquire introduction where a female med student on a seemingly deserted college campus is butchered...in the morgue, no less...the attention shifts to four emotionally void bitches (except for one who's kinda sweet inside) who are low on character and high on sex appeal (if you happen to be a praying mantis, that is).The girls are stalked and murdered between what seems like oceans of yawn-inducing dialogue, until we have the obligatory Scream-esquire party scene where all of our characters are gathered together so that we may cut to the chase, so to speak. Doesn't anyone just rent a remote cabin at Camp Crystal Lake for this kind of thing?Gratuitous lapses in logic abound, and below you will find my favorites- the first victim in the film is preparing for an autopsy on a corpse. She's lured out of the operating theater by a strange noise, and when she returns, the killer has cleverly disguised himself as the naked, sheet-covered corpse on which she was going to work. The killer (SURPRISE!) leaps at her from the table, at which point she turns around to cower, and he vanishes...only to reappear seconds later fully clothed and wearing a mask. Uh...OK. Are all of these people quick-change artists?- one particularly boring sequence takes place in an apparently cavernous apartment, where an apparently unfathomably rich artist has constructed an unbelievably boring maze of video monitors. Although the party is teeming with guests, nobody happens to be in the maze when our beloved killer appears to dispatch another victim. Not only does he seem to know the exact layout of the maze and how to change it to trap his quarry, but he fires several arrows into her body, causing her to stagger backwards through a hidden emergency exit and into a stairwell, where she tumbles over the balcony and falls about seven stories down the stairwell into a waiting dumpster, which closes on impact. It's an admittedly bravura murder, but incredibly dumb, too (I didn't even mention the fact that he managed to walk into a crowded party wearing a mask and carrying a bow and arrow, unnoticed). Oh and by the way...the victim is not even missed, because she was (get this) on her way from the party to the airport to go on a business trip! HAR!!!- near the climax of the film, the detective in charge of the case races to the big Valentine's Day party, convinced the killer is there and can be apprehended. Unfortunately, he doesn't bother to call for backup, and...whoops! His beheaded corpse means help is nowhere in sight for our imperiled heroine. Oh brother. And while I'm at it...since when can you actually hear someone's voice mail picking up a call just by holding their cell phone?I could go on, but...I think the point has been made. The movie is very obviously padded, inserting obvious red herrings such as a confusing scene where Paige allows herself to be lured into an upstairs bedroom with the promise of sex, and when sex is offered she reacts with stunned revulsion, taking up five minutes of screen time to enact her revenge on the poor guy. There is a totally unnecessary character who shows up to be tossed through an Argento-esque glass shower door, one of the film's most inspired moments. The violence in this movie is intense; there are some horrific throat-gougings and even a face being burned with a hot iron. None of it looks or seems the least bit real, and strangely, none of it has much impact. This movie made me feel like an unshockable veteran of a bloody war.But no matter. Valentine's box-office success is apparently so secure that there is already a sequel in the works, which provides a clue as to why the world must be coming to an end. And hey...if they made a sequel to I Know What You Did Last Summer, then ANYTHING is possible. Let's hope the filmmakers or the actors don't bank too much on Part 3.

Marley Shelton is pretty good as the lead, Denise Richards adds another glam-bitch role to her resume, David Boreanaz is also good as the boyfriend (i.e. main suspect) Jessica Cauffiel did a great job as the funny one (but it was sort of the same kind of character she played in UL2) I wish she had more screen time along with Katherine Heigl. She was an excellent opening victim.As for the ending **************MAJOR SPOILER ALERT********** Why don't you people didn't realize that the girl who was in costume wasn't the killer? The real killer, the guy who bleeds at the end, stuffed her in the costume, threw her at Marley Shelton and they both fell down the stairs. Then the second she sat up, he shot her. You see it was her fault that all that happened to him when he was younger so he not only killed her, he set her up to take the fall for the murders. A big ole revenge thing.********End Spoilers********All in all, it is a slick, implausible, but enjoyable flick that is just fun to watch. Also, they could've never made the book into a decent movie.

It's exactly what one would expect from a slasher movie nowadays, never deviating from the '90s horror formula for a single moment of running time.  In terms of quality, it's basically worse than Scream 3 but not as awful as Urban Legend Final Cut; i.e., it's bad, but watchable.  Some of the imagery is refreshingly effective, particularly in the maggot scene, but the movie has way too many unimportant supporting characters and too many long stretches where nothing interesting happens.  It's nearly impossible to keep track of all the male characters, and they only contribute boring, pointless scenes.  Watch out for the police investigator, though--the guy's such a terrible actor you'll be laughing uncontrollably whenever he shows up.Enjoy this movie if you can.  It's worth renting or watching it on HBO if you like these films, but if you dislike postmodern slasher movies in general then you should stay far away.

I would say the alone, the movie was decent, but compared to the book that it was supposedly based upon, it was the most horrible adaptation I have ever seen.  The only thing taken from the book was a bunch of girls, a geek, and the title, other than that, everything else was changed....even the names which made no sense to me. There are some differences that I would like to point out between the movie and the book.....first off the names, the guy's name was Victor Dimorte which meant Victory Over Death and the incident that forever traumatizes him happened in College and most of present day takes place when everyone is in their mid thirties.  Another thing, there were only four girls that were killed once a year on Valentine's Day, and they had not been in touch with each other for quite some time.  And the most important thing....the killer never wore a mask!  I think that that was a cheap farse to make the story into another Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, and Halloween, just to name a few.  I mean the scariest thing is when you don't see the killer coming at all....he could be anyone.  I hope more people read the book, because Tom Savage is an outstanding writer.....I have to wonder what he makes of the movie, based on his novel.

The premise was good... nerdy kid grows up and goes after the snobs that made fun of him... granted, it's been done, but I found the whole creepy Valentine's and cherub mask to be a interesting twist.  The movie had a decent cast, with some excellent up and coming's like the afore-mentioned David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, and Katherine Heigel, as well as the well-known Denise Richards.  All of this said, the movie was oozing with potential, but fell quite short.Was it the lack of a plot that made sense, or a lack of convincing dialogue? Is it sad the only character that really seemed to interest me was a side character named Scary Gary that portrayed Marley Shelton's neighbor?  The guy had no more than 5 lines, but I found him to be the most amusing character.  I'm thinking that the worst part of this movie had to be the writing.  The story had 3 or four subplots that had no bearing on the rest of the story, and consequently made no sense.  There was about 20 minutes of the movie that took place inside a tasteless maze at an art show.  The whol e scene was ridiculous and didn't go along with the rest of the movie.  The charcter Campbell also seemed to have no point to the story.  There was also a bedroom scene between Denise Richards and a charcter named Brian, that although incredibly amusing, had ABSOLUTELY NO POINT.  Personally, I am still confused about the ending.  Nothing was wrapped up. I left the movie confused and disgusted.  This movie was supposed to be based on the novel by the same title.  I found out today that the writers of the screenplay didn't even READ the novel.  They only used the title.  No wonder it was terrible.Now, I have grown up under the assumption that horror movies were supposed to be.. well... scary.  With maybe even, god forbid, a little gore.  This movie fell short on all accounts.  It was too predictable to be scary, and there was no gore.  No blood.  I have to say, the best death scene involed a power drill and a hot tub...All in all, this movie was a waste of outstanding talent.  The only saving grace was the performances of David Boreanaz and Marley Shelton.  Both are phenomenal performers, and I hope this movie doesn't impede their careers. My reccommendation, if there is a person in this movie who you would like to see on the big screen for two hours, then go see it.  Other than that, don't spend the $7.75 to watch it.

When the film makers decided to make Valentine, I don't think they had Ebert or the New York times in mind. They set out to make an interesting, exciting, witty horror movie just as the makers of Halloween, Nightmare on Elmstreet and Friday the 13th, did the same 47 times...What all you want to be critics and you real critics fail to realize is that not everyone is a student of film such as yourself and not everyone needs things to be different, artsy, or groundbreaking in order to qualify as a good, entertaining movie.  People have to learn to take these movies as is.  Obviously it can be nailed as a cheesey, unoriginal horror movie which i accept.  However, that doesn't mean it can't be entertaining, fun to watch, or worth a trip to the movies.  I see this all the time. Teen horror movies, comedies, and other less intelligent films are bashed by critics amateur and professional for being unoriginal, cheesey, or stupid...but what they don't understand is that that's what the film makers set out to make...and that's what a kid with nothing to do on a friday or saturday night wants to see...I am huge horror fan and i will say...

The women are still not really nice. None are very bright, clever, moral, or quite frankly interesting people. Personality disorders aside, the story moves slowly (<- visual-> a sloth on a lazy day) forward. When the felines start to get death threat's via Valentine's Day cards- for NO APPARENT reason- they get a little frightened. Then they put one and four together and slowly (an all too recurring adjective in this film) figure it must be this boy they were so cruel to as cruel children.

Then, four years later we have 'Valentine,' &#x96; a slasher movie that feels as if it belongs somewhere in the eighties at best. Either that or no one on the entire production staff ever watched Scream or knew about its existence.The beauty of Scream was that it listed all the clichés associated with the horror genre and did its best to subvert them. Valentine, on the other hand, seems to want to adhere to every cliché and be totally predictable.At the start of the movie we see a flashback from yesteryear where a geeky looking boy was (slightly!) bullied at a school prom by a gang of girls and then beaten up by some boys. Skip forward twenty or so years and he's out for revenge on the girls he perceived as his tormentors. Here's the first thing I noticed... I know we're hardly meant to feel empathy towards the (as yet unknown) killer, but these girls didn't really do enough to warrant their grisly executions. Perhaps that's meant to make us hate him more, I don't know. I'd have thought he'd need more of a reason towards his hated. I know there are some brief explanations regarding how he was sent away to an institution after the 'attack' but it's all pretty glossed over.So, the film is basically the adult girls being stalked and eliminated one by one. Naturally, they all hang out with a multitude of unsavoury men, designed to make us wonder which one is really the killer in 'disguise.' Another thing you may notice is the heavy marketing towards Denise Richards. I know nowadays it's a bit fashionable to hate her, but, back at the end of the nineties, she was pretty hot (commercial) property. Unfortunately, she's not really the star. This is a shame because she's actually quite fun and is by far the most memorable character on screen.The death scenes (bar one regarding the hot tub) are nothing special and certainly not imaginative and you'll probably guess who the killer is simply because you will.

Valentine is definitely an old school slasher with similarities to My Bloody Valentine which also has the same theme. Valentine came out during the re-interest of slasher movies that was started by Scream and lots of others followed like I Know Whar You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends and this one.This movie certainly did not disappoint from the great opening with a young Jeremy Melton asking out a group of girls to dance but they all make fun of him and say no until one girl says yes and she turns against him and has him beaten up and humiliated, it then skips ten years later with one of the girls Shelly (Katherine Heigl) who teased him and she gets murdered, the build up to that was awesome especially the bit where she gets the sick valentine card Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue, they need Dental records to identify you. I also thought the killers mask, cupid was really cool and original. The ending to this movie is also really confusing when the killer is unmasked, but the death scenes were very creative and just brutal I won't give too much away just see it for yourself.Denise Richards (Paige) was absolutely stunning playing the slut and does it brilliantly, David Boreanaz (Adam) played the only likable male in this movie and is very good looking too, Marley Shelton (Kate) was really sweet and I loved her puppy dog eyes, I thought she did a good job as the main character, Jessica Cauffiel (Lily) was underused and found her funny and sexy, Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy) played her part well and you really feel for her as well, Katherine Heigl (Shelly) victim No1 looks cute and seemed interesting in her very short time and the other men Camobell and that artist guy really annoyed and bugged me.All in all If you like old school horror then you'll like this, it has a good start brilliant killings, stunning looking girls and well it's just a fun ride.

This movie is limited to a streak of murders but we do not lose our interest in it. The big advantage this movie has is that the secret killer also acts the way we would imagine him in reality he gives menacing gifts coupled with two-faced messages before approaching his victims and he often attacks them in their workplace. The suspense is not bad even though all the startling scenes are predictable, as they are in all respectable slasher movie. The murders are mildly violent but original enough. The killer doesn't always use the same weapon; this might interest or disappoint, depending on the viewer.

The film opens with a scene from a junior high school Valentine's dance, where a nerdy young boy is rejected a dance from some prettier, more popular girls, and is ultimately humiliated and beaten-up in front of his fellow classmates. Now, years later, the same group of girls who attended their school years together are being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac, whose first victim is a medical student that was also friends with the girls. The psychopath behind the murders, hidden behind a cherub mask, begins following each of the women, and more and more of them begin to disappear. It's up to the remaining women to discover the killer's identity before they become another one of his victims... could the killer be, perhaps, the boy whose life they made a living hell years earlier? Not quite as good as the 1981 slasher romp My Bloody Valentine, but also much different, Valentine is a surprisingly original little horror movie. The entire stalker thing has been done before, but it is uniquely presented here and is really interesting. Jamie Blanks, the director of Urban Legend, also directs this film, and is both stylish and consistent. The entire movie uses a lot shades of red, not only hinting at the entire Valentine's Day theme, but also going along with the color of blood. There are some very inventive sequences (among them being the entire love maze that the Lily character takes her friends to), and the deaths are really creative, providing an interesting way to kill off the characters. There are some clichés to be found in this slasher flick though, and they will be easily spotted - not nearly as many clichés as I was expecting though.The film's creepy villain (dressed in a jet-black trench coat and masked with a cherub face that is actually very scary looking) uses a wide array of weapons - knives, axes, drills - and of course, a bow and arrow! All of these scenes are very well executed, and obviously the writers wanted to think up some really creative ways to kill people - the hot tub scene was one of them! The acting in the film was decent. The cast consists of numerous beautiful (but ill-fated) young women, and I didn't have a problem with the performances. They could have been better in some aspects, but overall the acting was good. I was guessing the killer's identity throughout the film, and the shocking but abrupt conclusion was a wonderful way to end the film. It was unexpected and kind of leaves you hanging there, but I liked that.Overall, Valentine is an above-average slasher film. I'm a little surprised at the low user rating, I'd assumed this would have ranked at least a 5.0 average. Don't let the bad user reviews put you off though, this is a slasher movie worth looking at for horror fans. It has some very nice creativity thrown into it and a good plot line to boot. Sure, it's a bit clichéd, but it tries to be original and is a good step in the right direction. It's not perfect, but watch it for yourself, and then judge it. If anything, it's a fun little holiday-oriented splatter movie. 7/10.

It opens at a high school Valentine's Day dance where we meet a kid (whose appearance is jammed with so many `nerd clichés' he is hard to take as anything halfway resembling a real person) asking all the pretty girls to dance. As he ends up making out with `the fat chick', the two are caught by punks. `The fat girl' accuses `the nerd' of attacking her so that when the punks strip him down to his underwear and beat the snot out of him it is to be seen as somewhat noble.  The kids at the dance stand around them yelling Fight despite that it is clearly a gang beating.  Fast forward (a number of years I cannot remember) as our nerd has replaced his glasses with a creepy Cupid mask with a bulked out Michael Myers-type of body. Apparently with no life or just completely psychotic he now goes on a killing spree against the girls that rejected him - not the punks who beat him up, mind you, because the movie wants to say that the relationship is the be-all and the loss of a relationship is more traumatizing then even a gang beating. Still with me? The movie shows us this first scene of cruelty and then flips it 180 degrees having the A-group be the victims and expects us to go along with it. It is a nonsensical dichotomy that Hollywood loves to pander to this crowd and at the same time masochistically brutalizes them.I will give the movie one tiny prop. It busts a little cliché in it's first death involving the age-old bit where a character (Bride of Chucky's Katherine Heigl) hides among a room of cadavers. I was kind of glad to see the bit (which I will not spoil) promptly squashed in a  realistic and rather sickening way. However, it set me up for a more brutal, more daring horror movie that this one turns out to be.  Much of the pre-death moments involve the characters wandering around looking for the source of noises set to dull monotonous musical clanks. They wander on and on, long past the point it would have been suspenseful. Those pretty girls grow up to be Marley Shelton ('Sugar & Spice' hottie), Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel and Denise Richards. Usually counted on to a movie's babe factor in the likes of Starship Troopers and Wild Things, here Richards look to be infected with parasites that have made her frail and malnourished. Capshaw as `the fat girl grown up' grapples with her guilt over framing the nerd. The story focus primarily on her until the final few minutes when it awkwardly derails and hack screenwriter Donna Powers decides she wants this to be Shelton's movie. It doesn't matter anyway because everybody keeps their clothes on the entire time, the movie cuts away from sex scenes as though it was an NBC sitcom - unaware that that guilty pleasure aspect would have ratcheted the movie up to being watchable on at least one level.`Valentine' was directed by Jamie Blanks who previously helmed `Urban Legend', a diverting slasher movie in the wake of the `Scream' craze that I truly enjoyed to my own surprise. 'Legend' was playful and  inventive with it's gore and Blanks gave the movie a stylish look. A startling contrast to this movie which tries to make up for it's uninspired nature with the fierce brutality of the violence (and the killer). It gives us an unrelentingly repressive atmosphere, dull and dreary, right up until the final scene - a supposed twist that is telegraphed far in advance (the killer can only be 1 of 1 people). The movie is hollow and drags, but I will let the final score speak for itself on this aspect.A more talented writing team might have noticed and explored that a horror movie set against a love story/Valentine's Day backdrop could have made for an inventive mix and some delicious moments of irony. Instead, `Valentine' wants to play it straight, forcing itself into the same old template Hollywood's obsession with the high school A-group, and it's attitude that life stops and starts (literally, in this case) with the success or failure of people's relationships. Blanks has done herself a retroactive favor the more movies like this come out and immediately go to the bottom of the genera pile - the more I feel reinforced that  `Urban Legend` really was good as I thought. Easily, one of the worst movies of the new decade.

Wes Craven style nudge nudge wink wink ironic smirking gets stale pretty fast, so if someone decides to STILL make a slasher movie all these years later, after all the rip offs and inferior variations on a (very limited) theme, you would think they would have some kind of fresh spin on the genre, or at the very least a decent script, memorable dialogue, and interesting characters. 'Valentine' has none of these things! Four, count 'em four, scriptwriters get credited for this utterly unoriginal and uninspired garbage, directed by hack-in-the-making Jamie Blanks. Blanks already gave us the awful 'Urban Legend'. 'Valentine', if you can believe it, is even worse. This is one of the poorest excuses for a thriller I have ever seen.

Okay, so it was fun in the '70s and '80s, but then it died down (thank God!).  But then along came Scream, which totally revolutionized the entire genre.  And then along came the various sequels as well as several copycats, as was the case back then.  Valentine is the latest.       Hey, remember that kid that everyone was mean to and ignored back in school?  Yeah, we all know the type.  Anyway, in this film, we are introduced to a group of young, buxom women who also knew the type.  They consist of Paige (Denise Richards), Kate (Marley Shelton), Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw), and Lily (Jessica Cauffiel).  They all seem to lead very happy lives, enjoying their sexual, predatory vixen skills to the fullest.  But when their mutual friend, Shelley (Katherine Heigl), is brutally murdered, the girls all begin to receive menacing valentines from a mysterious killer who walks around in a Cupid mask.         Now, as the girls begin to get picked off one by one, they,along with Kate's on-again-off-again beau, Adam (David Boreanaz), must unmask the murderer before it's too late.       Based on Tom Savage's non-slasher novel of the same title, Valentine is definitely a true slasher at heart.  The film has good intentions, and the premise is quite original, but it just makes one mistake after another.       Starting with the all too obvious kill-a-celebrity-right-in-the-beginning scenario, Valentine has trouble gaining any redeeming qualities.  The sequence of events is so shamefully predictable that it's hard to imagine what poor Mr. Savage must be thinking (Who would do such an awful thing to my book?!).       The characters in the film are so flat and detestable that we really just wish every single one of them would die so that we could leave the theater already.The acting is standard horror fare.  Denise Richards once again shows us her amazing and wide-range acting talents  Those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call breasts.  David Boreanaz gives a fair performance, but definitely shouldn't give up his day job on the WB's Angel.  Newcomer Marley Shelton can't do much with her underwritten role, and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part.  The rest of the acting is close to pitiful.       Jamie Blanks's direction is unquestionably a few steps down from 1998's superior horror film, Urban Legend.       Valentine is most certainly a pretty bad film.  Though fun and actually, sort of, kind of, somewhat scary, it never goes where it might have been able to go with its clever premise.  This one's destined to escape our memories in the not-too-distant future.Rating  D+ "}{"Title":"entertaining if formulaic slasher film","Date":"7 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  An entertaining if formulaic slasher film about a former junior high geek who gets back at all the women who wouldn't dance with him way back then by killing them off many years later on valentine's day.

As soon as I saw the trailer the first thought that came into my mind was There is no way your getting me into that movie.  However, my girlfriend had a different opinion.  So, eventually, I saw the movie.  My lowest expectations couldn't have prepared me for the shock of this movie.As the story goes, in the sixth grade there once was a shy boy whom nobody liked, but he had a few secret crushes.  On the Valentines Day dance, he decides to confess his feelings and ask the girls to dance.  One by one, they turn him down, rather harshly I thought.  Then he comes to the last one, and she feels that he is 'the best she can do', so she decides to have a small romantic interlude with him (I was wondering if it was legal to make these sixth graders kiss for a horror movie).  They get caught, and she doesn't want to face the humiliation of kissing the most unpopular boy in school, so she denies it.  This, in turn, causes his life to go down the drain, going from Reform School, to Juvenile Hall, to an Insane Asylum.  Naturally, that made him a little mad.  So, he decides to brutally kill all of the girls that turned him down so many years ago.The mask he uses, which is supposed to be a Cupid, has no real significance to the plot.  He just wears it to hide his face, but they try to tie it into the plot by having someone wear it at the sixth grade Valentines dance. This movie was bad in every way a movie can be bad.  The directing was obviously sloppy, the plot was basic, and the acting wasn't believable.  For instance, in one scene, a girl eats a chocolate filled with maggots, and afterwards drinks a carton of orange juice.  Her expression while drinking the orange juice doesn't look at all like she just had maggots in her mouth (I don't know about you, but I would be brushing my teeth and rinsing out my mouth for a few hours).  This same girl rinses her hair in toilet water, and doesn't seem to mind that either.In short, I would recommend you see this movie if you are looking to kill some time, but if you really want to see a good horror movie, see Shadow of the Vampire (John Malkovich and William Dafoe) or wait for the much anticipated Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins).   1/10 "},{"Title":"You do not want to sit through this one.","Date":"2 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Thank god we caught the cheapy show for this flick, because it wasn't even worth the $5.00 that I had to part with to see it.

Denise Richards is great but again she sort of tries to make the film her own as if it were a Denise Richards film when really its a shared effort.The story is a good idea and well executed on film but it repeats itself a few times too many times with the same sort of stalking in the house type thing and also pointless characters that need not be there. Two great examples are Detective Vaughn who it turns out has a crush on Denise Richards character???? and also Dorothy's step mother who is younger than her and hate each other with a passion but they only meet in one scene nothing more happens between the two of them.The direction is good by Jamie Blanks who gave us 'Urban Legend' this film for me was a better film and i found myself rooting to find out who the killer was and i wasn't disappointed, Blanks gives a good twist ending although not on par with what 'Scream' did the twist i'm sure will leave you a little amazed but also wondering if a sequel is on the cards.Overall this is a good bit of horror fluff that wont have you scared much at all as we've seen this stuff time and time again but this one has a story and in horror it's hard to find that. With beautiful set pieces, great cinematography, and a good cast of characters and some great death scenes you really should pick this up just to have a look, that's what i did and i enjoyed every minute of it.****** out of ********** "},{"Title":"Sleek Slasher","Date":"31 January 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" First off, having seen 'Valentine' about six times, I have to admit that the first time I watched it(at the theater)I really had no complaints and I would have given it a rating of ten. Even now I don't really have any legitimate complaints. The casting is great and it seems like this movie had every hot actor or actress that was popular at the time(Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, David Boreanaz, etc.). It has all the necessities of your typical slasher flick, and it is truly comparable to some of the slasher films of the eighties like Prom Night, and it even has some crazy character dispatches like in the Friday the 13th films. Also, this film looks good. Well, actually, it's a little sleek, for lack of a better word, and it likes to flaunt its stunning reds and blacks at every turn.On to a different topic, and since I am a fan of slasher films, I must mention some of the death scenes in this one. The two that were the most memorable are/the one involving Ruthie(played by Buress from 'Cabin By The Lake'), who gets her face smashed down onto some glass shards, and other one is the hot tub scene with Denise Richards's character, Paige. Quote I'd rather be boiled alive! Hmm...how ironic. Other deaths include a throat slashing, an ax to the back, a bludgeoning with a hot iron, and, among many more, death by cupid arrows. How sweet! Overall, 'Valentine' is a great guilty pleasure for pretty much anybody. I would rate it a 6/10, though, because I think it is still just an average slasher movie with some memorable death scenes and a handful of hotties. Sound familiar? Oh well. I deducted from the ten points I mentioned earlier thanks to its outrageous opening death scene. I mean, come on! Would anyone in their right mind hide in a morgue inside of a body bag?!

It takes all that Halloween stood for and tries to update it.  It fails of course, but you have to give it full marks for trying.  Where as a lot of films try to be original and fail at that as well, at least you can say that there is a masked killer in this film, he is incredibly strong, he walks and still catches his victims as they run and he finds original and quite disgusting ways of disposing of his victims.  So I give the film credit for trying.  But like most other films that have tried to follow in Screams footsteps, it does fail quite miserably.Valentine is a story about a geeky kid that just wants to be accepted in the sixth grade.  He is at a dance and asks all the pretty girls to dance and they all say no.  Some of them are disgustingly mean to him and tell him that they would rather be boiled alive than to dance with him ( guess how that character dies? ).  Then one heavy set girl decides she will make out with him and then when all the popular guys catch her doing it, she says that he forced himself on her and they beat the tar out of him and he is sent to reform school.  That is the beginning and it is well done.  It sets up the killer on the loose with a revenge plot quite nicely.  We of course skip ahead about 15 years and we have beautiful women in college lined up to be slaughtered.  The opening death is extremely laughable but has its moments of nice touches and subtle homages to films like Halloween.  It is worth mentioning how the first woman is killed because it is a lesson in horror mythology of all the wrong things to do to attract a killer on the loose on a college campus.A young woman just comes back from a disasterous date and decides that she is going to go do an autopsy at 11 o clock at night.  Then to top it off, she is wearing a flimsy tank top, has large breasts and she decides to keep the lights off in the autopsy room, because, well you know, you don't need light to disect a human being.  I started to ask myself why she was allowed to disect a corpse with no supervision this late and with no lights on seeing as she was only a med student.  Horror movies are always filled with silly situations ( Friday the 13th's, no one wipes after they are finished in the bathroom, people always go to investigate noises and so on ) but this is one of the sillier ones.  Then when she is grabbed by the corpse, instead of leaving, she stays in the room to see who it is.  And then when the things chases her, she doesn't go for the door, she tries to hide in the other rooms.  DUMB! DUMB! DUMB!Figuring out who the killer is is fun, I must admit and they do a good job of concealing his identity until the end so you have to give it credit for that as well.  But this is not really a scary film and it is not even a well done film.  It had it's moments but when it leaves the theater, no one will really remember anything about it.  Nothing really jumps out at you.   I think Jamie Blanks has an idea of what it takes to scare an audience, he has probably tried to emulate many of the greats like Raimi, Hitchcock and Carpenter, but he can't quite seem to hit the perfect note.  Maybe if he keeps trying he will get it because there are scenes in here that are close to perfection but then they end too abruptly or without the proper pay off.  That is what made Halloween so elusive in it's brilliance.  The pay off was so horrific and so perfect that to try to duplicate it is almost unfathomable.  Valentine comes close but ultimately fails.This is not as bad as some horror out there but it is not in the same league as some of the new horror films that have made audiences embrace horror again.

Meeting up with Kate's boyfriend Adam Carr, (David Boreanaz) at the funeral, they are told from Det. Leon Vaughn, (Fulvio Cecere) if they'd help him with evidence in the case. As they get tormented by a series of strange valentine cards, old friend Campbell Morris, (Daniel Cosgrove) arrives in their lives as more strange deaths follow. Thinking back to their time together in an attempt to figure out who could've been behind the killings, they each have conflicting choices as to their identity, and when the killer targets them at a special gala party being held, they have to work to stay away from the killer and solve their identity.The Good News This was a nicely surprising and enjoyable film. One of the most surprising is that the film has some really great stalking scenes. There's really no better example than the opening kill, where a victim is dispatched inside a morgue. This is just insanely creepy, as the darkness and ever-present fear of death is executed perfectly, making it seem that every second spent was used to watch, and then the realization that there is someone there amps up the dread even more, and the chase around is simply nerve-rattling. Another one inside a maze of very weird videos along the walls, filled with closeups on faces, lips and eyes is another standout for being originally bizarre and suspenseful at the same time. The final chase through the house does have some tense moments as well, and the set-up for the jacuzzi doesn't really disappoint either. Other non-stalking suspense scenes show up throughout as well. The death scenes weren't all that novel, but are thankfully shockingly brutal, especially the attack where one of the victims in a wet bikini is trapped inside a jacuzzi with the killer jabbing at them through the cover with a power-drill. There's also a brutal slit throat, a decapitation and an ax in the shoulder blade as well, even though they're really that bloody or gory. It's simply the brutality that gets them noticed. There are a few other fairly decent ideas in the film too. The most inspiring is the idea of the killer sending his victims valentines cards with a twist. While not in the least bit an original idea, it's just refreshing to see some brutality brought back in the genre There was a cool killer disguise and that mask looked somewhat too freaky too. There's been far worse slashers along the way than this one.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot wrong here. The biggest is that film doesn't play the valentine-cards angle up very well and only half-heartedly develops the valentine-related novelty deaths angle. The card idea wasn't developed as much as it could have been, as if the film was waiting for a human-heart-in-a-box moment which never materialized ad was disappointing given the essence of the story. It felt like it could've gone much further than it went here, and after being introduced in the beginning, disappears from the second half and is never really introduced or mentioned again. Its greater failing is when it comes to the premise of a humiliated nerd who is getting revenge on the women who belittled him at the school dance. This is solid enough slasher movie motivation but then when it suits the film, it has the killer not just targeting the people he is after but anybody else &#150; boyfriends, witnesses, even someone found inside one girls' apartment. There's a sense of randomness in here that doesn't seem to be there from the others that have been influenced from before. The other last big problem is that the decidedly toned down nature, specifically it's gore and sleaze, should've been in abundance but seem mainly dried up here. The brutality of the deaths meant that there should've been a lot more graphic, and the sexiness of the women and the situations present shouldn't have been so tame. This will be the one that harms it the most amongst the real fans.The Final Verdict As there's really a decided lack of the real attracting elements in this film, it's got a real underrated feel even though there's some good elements here. Give it a shot if you've got an open mind or want to see a really harmless film, but hardcore horror fans of the past might not like this one all that much.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity "},{"Title":"Cupid's arrow misses the mark","Date":"21 December 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" When Halloween started off the trend of stalker/slasher movies, it proved to be something of a mixed blessing. For every inventive classic like Halloween and A Nightmare On Elm Street, you get an equally bad knockoff like Friday the 13th. Scream, another classic kick-started the whole genre off again with a distinctly postmodern spin. And now we have Valentine, a horror film that falls somewhere in between competent and dire.As the title suggests, the theme in question is Valentines Day. But don't get your hopes up. Valentine will never do for February 14th what Halloween did for October 31st. Everything about the film is derivative. Which might have been just about bearable if it tried some of the postmodern referential irony Scream did so well. But it doesn't.In a prologue that 'borrows' from Carrie, Jeremy Melton, a social outcast is humiliated at a high school dance when all the girls scorn him. When he is caught in an embarrassing clinch with Dorothy, a fat girl, she turns on him saying he forced himself on her. The rest of the kids grab him, and beat the holy crap out of him.That sets the scene for the horrors to come. 13 years later the girls who turned Jeremy down have all grown into beautiful (not to mention shallow) women. And on Valentines Day, Jeremy's decided to look them up. Cue novelty death sequences, innocent girls walking down dark corridors and lots and lots of blood and gore.Aside from the Valentines Day gimmick, there is nothing remotely original about Valentine. A killer wearing a Cupid mask (Halloween), a long list of red herrings and possible suspects (Scream), it just goes on and on.Director Jaime Blanks is certainly a stylish director. And to his credit, he keeps events going at a snappy pace. But Valentine is nothing special. It doesn't revolutionise Valentine's Day the way Halloween did for its holiday.In regards to the cast, they're merely adequate. Marley Shelton is OK as the virtuous Kate, but there's nothing about her performance that really stands out. Although she can look genuinely terrified. Jessica Capshaw is undistinguished, and the way the film sets up her character for a surprise shock ending merely comes out as bizarre. And as for David Boreanaz, what a performance! Or lack, thereof.He's pretty much anonymous. He's a very bland screen presence. His performance is practically phoned in. Bizarre, considering he's the villain of the piece. Which is all the more shocking after seeing his work elsewhere. Boreanaz was probably trying to branch out in other areas while he was doing his TV work. And when he's played the villain in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, it's something he does very well. In Valentine. Not so much. He may have a limited range as an actor, but he usually plays the role of the villain with relish. Its odd then that he's so underwhelming here.The one bright spot in Valentine is Denise Richards. Out of all the cast, she's the most fun to watch. She gives the film much needed energy and lights up the screen whenever she's around as the nymphomaniac Paige. When she dies, the film dies along with her I'm afraid.Valentine has a few novelty touches, and there are some welcome bursts of humour that crop up from time to time (courtesy of Richards), but its a fairly forgettable venture. Moderately diverting the first time around, but nothing to capture your heart.

Now, (SPOILERS!) seeing as how the Adam guy is the only man guy here it's kinda obvious that he's the killer but then at the last minute is twists and makes one of the girls (Dorthey) the killer. Then when Adam has his girl friend, the last survivor, alone they fall a sleep and his nose starts bleeding like the killer's and thats when i got confused. If Adam was the killer why was Dorothy wearing the killer's costume and if the answer is Adam made her put on the costume why didn't she say anything? The acting is alright i liked The guy who played Adam's acting and Denise Richards was just trying to relive her Wild Things days when she plays the slut in this movie but she falls very very short of that. The other girls are forgettable, like this movie, in there roles and should have never agreed to do this movie in the first place.Bottom line This movie doesn't even make the it's alright category but into the so bad it's bad category.

(USA/Australia - 2001) Several years after an incident at the high school prom sent a teenage boy into a spiral of depression and insanity, the perpetrators - a number of bitchy, upwardly-mobile young women - receive strange Valentine cards from an unknown 'admirer' who promptly murders them, one by one.Signalling the last gasp of the late-90's/early-00's 'slasher revival', VALENTINE was a sophomore outing for director Jamie Blanks, whose URBAN LEGEND (1998) at least scored points for its visual flair. Here, Blanks is saddled with a derivative script and a cast of unlikable characters, whose monstrous vanity makes it impossible for viewers to care about their eventual fates (even the detective charged with finding the killer turns out to be a lecherous sleazeball!). Adapted from a novel by Tom Savage - whose complex narrative was reduced to its most basic components during the transfer from page to screen - the movie substitutes endless dialogue exchanges for plot and character development, and with the exception of an unpleasant sequence in which über-babe Denise Richards is attacked in a jacuzzi, the murder set-pieces are routine by slasher standards. This may have been due to Warner Bros.' insistence on the removal of extraneous violence, which makes no sense in the context of an R-rated horror movie (perhaps they were hoping for a PG-13?). Performances are uniformly fine, especially Jessica Capshaw (daughter of Kate Capshaw) as the former 'fat girl' who still resents the bullying she endured in high school, despite slimming her way into the affections of the very people who made her life a misery in the first place. Towards its half-baked finale, the film's multi-authored (!) screenplay points the finger of suspicion at all remaining cast members, including David Boreanaz (TV's Angel), playing an abusive alcoholic whose ex-girlfriend is on the killer's hit-list, though the climactic rampage is too reliant on illogical contrivances to be entirely effective.

And of course he's killing to avenge those who destroyed his life! Of course, we have all loved movies with similar plots. But this one is too weak to be any likable, at least for me...As for the characters and the acting... Nothing really special. In fact, if there wasn't Denise Richards I'd be yawning during a large part of the film. And I didn't feel like I cared for the character. This really became clear to me at the ending when the real identity of the murderer is left an open topic (was it Dorothy, was it Adam?) and I realized that I didn't really CARE who the murderer was because I hardly even cared about this bunch of people...One thing that annoyed me in some scenes is how this movie really rips off from Halloween. Some shots of murders were like real copies of Halloween murders. Especially at the scene with Campbell's murder. Damn, even the poster of the movie reminds A LOT of Myers' mask (as I also stated above). Even at the behind the scenes documentary one production guy says that one of the director's main influences is Halloween!...There were a couple of things I liked about this film though (besides Denise p). For a little more than half of the movie there are many threads and possibilities left open as to who the murderer might be. Of course, in the beginning they use that cheap trick with that Jason guy (which shows that the writer didn't really know what he was doing), but overall it kept some interest in a movie that would otherwise be plain boring. I also liked the art gallery scene with the video maze, I found it very original and the murder scene there was the only one I found really good.

In the early 90's, it pretty much died down. Then Scream came, in 1996, and rejuvenated the genre with a film that was half-slasher, half a parody of slashers. Over the last few years, there have been quite a few slashers, most of them mediocre. When I found out that this was done by Jamie Blanks, the director of one of my favorite of the new slashers, Urban Legend, I immediately wanted to see it. It wasn't that disappointing, but it wasn't really great either. The plot is decent, but the pacing isn't very good. On repeated viewings, many of the early scenes(and plenty of the later ones as well) are kind of dull and boring. The acting is decent, but several of the big names are kind of disappointing, compared to earlier roles. The characters are pretty much just the typical clichés and stereotypes of the genre. The script is somewhat poor, and doesn't manage to keep your interest on more than one viewing(if even that). The film does have some good scares, some decent suspense and a little tension. The twist is far too obvious, though. On my first viewing, I saw it with a friend, and about half-way into the film, he had figured out who the killer was. The film has some pretty good death scenes, some of the best of the newer slashers, in my opinion(much like Blanks' other film, Urban Legend), but they are also the only really great thing about the film, and they are not really worth paying to see the film for. All in all, a decent slasher, but not one that is particularly worth watching. I recommend it only to big fans of the genre, Jamie Blanks or the actors. Anyone else should probably skip it, unless you really enjoy watching slasher flicks for the sole purpose of seeing well-done death scenes(which is fine, of course... I watched it for that very reason). If that's what you want from this film, you won't be disappointed.

The death scenes are surprisingly good and are the best feature of the movie. Most slasher movies of today lack of violent deaths and gore. Valentine has that 80's feeling that most of today's slasher movies lack of. In my opinion, that's a good thing.  The most memorable death scenes are a head impaled to a broken shower curtain, a very cool iron hitting in the head scene, and Denise Richards electrified in the jacuzzi. The acting is quite good for a movie of it's kind. Denise Richards apart from being super HOT she can deliver a good performance. She's the main attractive of this movie (not only visual). Mary Shelley is also good as the innocent and beautiful lead character. The rest of the cast is just o.k. Not the best cast you've seen in a slasher but still works. There is no scare factor, the movie does not pretend to be scary or something. Take Valentine for what it is, a straight slasher that only pretends to revive the genre.

However, this is where I have to stop agreeing with the majority of negative comments about the film .This is due to the fact that if you just look at Valentine as a routine horror flick and are willing to put aside any expectations of the film being the next Halloween, you may actually find your self having a fairly enjoyable 90 minutes. The plot of the film involving the stalking of five beautiful women headed by Denise Richards is a routine visit back to the style of the original slasher films of the 1970's and 1980's but with the post Scream style 'who dunnit theme' which was the main premise for the director's first film, Urban Ledgend (1998). The result is a very average formula horror film that does however posses some tense and sometimes even slightly scary moments that are all part of a storyline that although has little substance does at least prove to be of a better and more enjoyable standard than many others. This therefore serves one of a film's main purposes which is to just be an enjoyable experience for its audience.What also ensures that the audience won't immediately forget the film after watching it is the ending where the audience IS still left guessing as to who the killer is in a genuinely macabre ending. For all the critics that responded negatively to this ending, have they never actually heard of this type of ending before which actually hasn't been used in that many horror films, thus making this part of the film original leading to the audience walking out of the theatre still trying to figure out whether the stalker was indeed Dorothy or Adam or indeed both which may prove to be irritating to some yet highly though provoking to others.Overall, taking all of these elements into account, I would say that out of a possible 10 marks, I would say that Valentine would probably deserve around a 6.5 as although it isn't the next Halloween, it is a stab in the right direction that at the least gives its an audience a fairly enjoyable 90 minutes of their life.A definite watch to cure the boredom!!

Interestingly the main characters (Denise Richards as Paige, Marley Shelton as Kate, Jessica Capshaw as Dorothy and Jessica Cauffiel as Lily) are possibly the most developed characters in the horror films of recent times, though that still doesn't say much. The problem was with the other characters, many of them had very minor roles that made their participation in the movie almost of no importance, and yet they should have been. One character was obviously introduced to try and throw the viewer off the scent of the killer but because his role was so miniscule it just seemed tacked on.&#145;Valentine' tries to be in some ways a crime thriller. We know who the killer is but after thirteen years we do not know what he looks like and it is also possible that Jeremy (the killer) has now assumed another name but with so many pointless characters in the movie the plot twists become obvious and as the viewer waits for them the movie becomes more tedious.This isn't a total sham of a movie unlike many of the other post-Scream teen slasher movies but it fails to add anything new to a seemingly creatively dead sub-genre. Relying on quick `jump' scares and attempts at suspense which ultimately failed, &#145;Valentine' is somewhat of a dreary &#145;Scream' clone and I personally wouldn't recommend it in a hurry. Don't go out of your way to hunt this down but I suppose if it's on TV one night this movie is okay to pass the time with.

I liked the way it took place in the 80s in the beggining, then showed them all years later. It starts off at the Junior Prom where none of the girls will dance with this nerdy kid and most of them make fun of him(except for one girl named Kate)He ends up making out with this chubby under the bleaches, and when they get caught the girl tells everyone that he forced. After that all the guys beat him up and he is sent away.Years later when there all grown up, murders start to happen on and around valentines day. Everyone eventually starts to expect that nerdy kid(named Jeremy Martin, i think) but is it really him? Watch and find out!I have to say that even though it's a horror movie I think it has a good moral people should learn from. It shows what can happen when you go to far abusing a kid at school .I 'm not saying it was him doing the killings, or that it wasn't  but anyway you will notice what the movie is trying to say. I'm not saying it's right to Kill someone for revenge, but I think the movie was showing you how to much abuse can drive a kid totally crazy and grow up with so much hurt and anger they can just snap one day.Spoilers ahead.... (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)...I just want to comment about the ending of the movie. A lot of people don't understand why Dorothy was wearing that mask and chasing Kate at the end if she wasn't the killer. From what I gathered it was because she was the killer. They caught her right handed at the end. The reason a lot of you are getting confused is becasue of the last scene when Angel's nose was bleeding.I think they just showed his nose bleeding to show the viewers that he was that little nerdy kid. What I mean is, I think he was that nerdy kid that they all picked on, but that doesn't mean he was the killer. What they were showing I think was he came back for Kate cause she was always nice to him, his nose bleeds whenever he gets nervous the same as when he was a kid. Dorothy was the killer, they just didin't show her nose bleeding ever so we wouldn't guess it was her, but it was her really under the mask with the nose bleeds. She probobly just didin't get them till later in her life. Anyway I just wanted to clear that up, i'm pretty sure that's the answer, because i'm sure she wouldn't just run around with the mask on and try to hurt  Kate if she wasn't the killer. The only thing that makes sense is that she was the killer, not Angel.

There are few 'stupid tongue in cheek' deaths, and there is actually a bit of suspense involved in many of them.

This movie was made before the ADHD quick cut MTV inspired editing, and it takes its time in some of the stalking scenes. It was refreshing to see this, as most bodycount movies are all about that...and often with no buildup that leads to no payoff.There are, however, some really hot chicks in the film, including Denise Richards, which raised my rating by a whole star.

Even more groan-inducing were some peoples' superficial comments regarding Katherine Heigl's weight or the number of females in the film. Are those really valid reasons to dismiss a movie?Firstly what do you expect? Directors and studios cannot be blamed for adhering to well-established formulae when people like you (and me, for that matter) go and see them in droves. Instead of dismissing the film as a mere clone *after* you have seen it, perhaps you should expect nothing and be pleasantly surprised when a spark of originality does come up.Because this film in particular has more of it than most. OK - so there is a killer in a mask who stalks and kills in a variety of ways. But seriously there has to be a number of deaths in a horror film, and how else is it going to be achieved? OK, so perhaps the mask is a cliché that could have been abandoned. Or certainly improved - that supposed cherub face did nothing for me.As far as characterisation goes, there is a fair amount considering the ninety minute length. The character of Dorothy, although slightly stereotyped, is somewhat intriguing and portrayed admirably by Jessica Capshaw. Denise Richards, despite the claims of many, did the best with what she was given.One of the most original aspects of this film is the lack of a singularly defined protagonist. There is no Sidney Prescott/Laurie Strode heroine who is targeted but virtually invincible. The screen time is devoted equally to a few of the characters. One effect of this is that you never quite know who will be next or what certain character's motives are. This adds to the overall strength of the denouement - which is one of the best endings that I have seen for a long time in a film of this genre .The fact that Valentine contains references to Carrie, as well as many slasher films from the eighties, is neither annoying nor outstanding. Such touches can be effective, and as long as it is a step away from the ironic, in-jokey, post-modern Scream-type slasher (which was fine while it lasted, but has become overdone), then there is nothing wrong with it.Overall, a very entertaining and stylish movie. It is much better than Blanks' Urban Legend, which was itself a fine film in some places. The only thing that could spoil this film now is a sequel. And I love sequels.

It most certainly fits that description, but I am coming to a point in which I am starting to feel sympathy for individuals who make this kind of movie. Nearly every teen slasher film is a rehearse of the one preceding it, so should I continue to hold the recycling of material against the filmmakers?Valentine is all that you would expect in a movie with the tag line of love hurts. The movie contains the standard slasher gimmick; this one takes place near Valentine's Day and uses the holiday spirit as a means to make people suffer. It contains the good-looking female cast of young women in their twenties, including Denise Richards, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel, and Marley Shelton. They play the moronic victims of love letters featuring threatening poems and disgusting pranks from a mystery admirer, so to speak. The production also inhabits the standard character stupidity, involving such reused scenes as a potential victim hearing noises outside her hotel, and investigating with only a towel around her waist. Lets not forget the scenes where the characters travel down long, dark hallways without even bothering to turn on the lights. Nobody is developed and there are no memorable lines or sequences, only the typical jump scenes and violent encounters that leave unsuspecting individuals dead with puddles of blood surrounding their corpses.This motion picture also borrows a few ideas from the original Carrie as well. The concept of an innocent boy mocked and wrongfully accused by the girls when they were in the sixth grade is a major plot point in the movie. That alleged culprit is not the only potential suspect in the lineup. There is also a strange detective (Fulvio Cecere) investigating the case, and one of the girl's alcoholic boyfriend (David Boreanaz), or maybe a weirdo audiovisual artist (Johnny Whitworth), or the greedy Internet entrepreneur (Daniel Cosgrove), currently living with one of the girls.We know from the opening scene that there will be a person in a mask picking his victims off one by one, using various methods of murder; knifes, a power-drill, an ax, a bow and arrow, glass shards, and more weapons of choice. We can easily identify the next victim, which is one of the only things that keep us interested in the movie, because there is no where near enough story to fill the hour and a half of situations. Nor is there a large enough selection of suspects to choose from, so we can have fun guessing the identity of the killer. The potential psychopaths are not adequately developed, so even out of the few characters provided I didn't even bother to guess. Even after the movie I was unsure of the killer's identity.There are a few things about Valentine that I actually did like. The slasher sequences are well executed, not as gruesome as you might expect, and all of the violence is in context. The killer abides by motive and circumstance; there are no meaningless slays. The plot is consistent in that area, and for once the killer's motives are clear to use, not just stuck in the ending to fill our inquiring curiosity. There are moments of suspense and surprise, and I liked the cast; the performers fill their characters with interest and zest.Jamie Blanks directed Valentine, and it is not a shock that his only other film is Urban Legend, another teen slasher movie. I take a guilty pleasure in movies of this gender; the Friday the 13th series includes some of my favorites and I am ashamed of liking the critically mauled I Know What You Did Last Summer.I guess there is an audience who will undoubtedly enjoy Valentine, and for better or worse, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I just have a hard time recommending a movie that follows so close to its proceeding counterparts in Friday the 13th the killer wore a hockey mask; in Scream the killer wore a ghost mask; in I know What You Did Last Summer, the killer wore a rain coat; in Urban Legends Final Cut, the killer wore a fencing mask; and in Valentine the killer wares what other than the mask of a cupid. See the similarities? What's next, a movie called Easter Horrors with a killer dressed as a big bunny delivering threatening decorated eggs? Or The Holiday Scream with a killer looking like Santa Claus giving horrific gifts? I might have just given some producers a few ideas. God Forgive me.

It's a suspense scene, with the heroine walking around in the dark.  What do we hear?  Well, for the most part, we don't hear the ambient noises the heroine hears or imagines herself to hear (footsteps, creaking doors, rain outside, whatever).  We don't hear the musical score.  We don't even hear nothing.  What we hear is a high-pitched synthesised cricket-chirp - or low-pitched synthesised booms, or some such.  This is cheating.  They might as well make us uneasy by hiring people to inject drugs into our veins.  If Jack Valenti or someone were to ban the use of all non-musical noises that are neither part of nor representative of anything in the fictional world ... well, perhaps we'd lose a little something of value here and there (I gather that during the fight scenes in Raging Bull we hear bird screeches, for instance), but directors and composers would be forced to use their brains, and we'd all gain.P.S. It's both bizarre and disturbing when a film collects half a dozen attractive women just so that we can watch them get killed off, one by one, with perhaps one or two survivors ... so in a way it's kind of a relief that with one exception the actresses in Valentine are either stone-cold unattractive, or somehow made to look that way.

Some of them were okay (I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER), and some of them were pretty bland (URBAN LEGEND anyone?). Even low-budget studios knew there was a profit to be made and a few direct-to-video cheapies found there way on the market (CAMP BLOOD, PARTY CRASHER). But by 2001 the fad was starting to wear off and VALENTINE was the proof. A box office disappointment, it sounded the death toll for the late 90's/early 2000's slashers. (Warning contains spoilers!) The first few scenes in VALENTINE are the best. 1988 - A young boy named Jeremy Melton, the stereotypical class dork, is harrassing the popular girls at their school dance. After finally persuading one girl to go behind the bleaches with him to make out, he's caught by the school bullies. They take off his clothes and dunk him in raspberry punch, before, quite literally, beating the s*** out of him. 13 years have passed and those five girls who were the object of Jeremy's affection have now grown up into some really hot ladies. One of them, Shelley, has just escaped from a droning Valentines date. Skipping off to the local morgue where she works, she is persistently stalked and killed by a mysterious prowler in a cupid mask. It's here where VALENTINE shines. The scenes of the cupid killer chasing Shelley through the corridors and stabbing and slashing through body bags in order to find the frightened girl, who is hiding in one of them, are pretty tense. Unfortunately, after this great opening VALENTINE begins to fall apart. Basically, we have about an hour or so of character development, as the four remaining ladies go through their everyday lives dating, hitting the clubs and talking about guys. And when the cupid killer finally does show, we just don't care anymore. The main problem with VALENTINE is it's slow and boring pace. As the story unfolds we are introduced to literally dozens of characters who exist either to serve as red herrings are solely to be slaughtered. The entire film feels like a chore It doesn't help that the cupid killer waits like twenty minutes between each murder. And, naturally, that extra time is filled with dull girl talk and annoying one liners. So was there anything to like? Well, yes. The gore is good. In fact, this is probably the bloodiest of the SCREAM clones. Every once in a while there is a good shock and some minor suspense. Unfortunately, Jamie Blanks direction is very solid and stylish (recalling both Argento and Craven), but there's just no fun in the death sequences nor the chase scenes. Not only is the climax really dull as well but the twist ending is so obnoxious that I was tempted to throw the whole darn tape out the window. The only other thing that singles VALENTINE out apart from it's gory murders is the killer. The maniac, dressed completely in black apart from that creepy orchid mask, is one of the most memorable boogeymen in modern slasher films. It's just too bad the rest of the film couldn't have been as inspired . .. ** (out of ****) "},{"Title":"Good for a laugh","Date":"6 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" ....that's all this movie is good for, the acting, plot and murder scenes are far to awful, they'll make you laugh, and that's exactly what i did, and three other people in the theatre did. and the ending is two confusing, is it this guy, is it the butler, how did this movie ever get made?

I left the theater angry, disappointed, and confused.  Here is a brief synopsis of the plot.  A pathetic, 12-year-old boy gets snubbed by four girls at a junior high Valentine's Day dance.  13 years later, the girls who snubbed him (and other people around them for some reason) begin getting murdered.  The murders are occasionally prefaced with a clever Valentine card (the message is read aloud for the benefit of illiterate viewers) letting the receiver know she will soon die. The movie plays out like a very poor remake of Prom Night, a much better slasher film.The lame plot notwithstanding, I had several problems with this film. First, the writing.  The dialogue is very weak.  Nothing is implied, we must hear everything spoken in order to know what is going on.  Second, the characters.  The movie has about 5 or 6 main characters and a bunch of lesser characters.  The lesser characters fall into 2 categories red herrings or poorly developed secondary characters who really have nothing to do with the story at all (except to add some extra bloodshed).  Many of these characters appear briefly and either die or are never referred to again.  Third, the ending is without a doubt one of the worst I have ever seen.  It seems every horror film since Scream has tried to have a clever twist ending.  In this case, the twist is confusing, uninspired, and pointless.  The ending left me with many unanswered questions.Along with the 3 problems I have described above, the movie also has its share of horror cliches.  These are things like the sudden appearance of a character to make viewers jump and victims who isolate themselves even though people are being killed and they were advised to stay together.  On the plus side, the acting isn't bad at all.If you must see it, wait for it to be shown on cable.  You have been warned.

This is horror movie making by numbers with nothing new to say, but it fatally flawed from the start to the end.The plot summary is simply a young school boy is mocked by 5 female peers, and then 10 years later proceeds to murder the 5 women systematically.For starters, the shoes the killer wears only make a noise when appropriate.The interplay between the police officer and Denise Richard's character doesn't go anywhere, and when it does, it comes out of the blue. Denise Richard has an attitude with the police officer for no apparent reason long before they have their encounter. The police officer is there to help them, not make their lives hell. The way they act, you are glad when they meet their doom, because they are a pretty unlikeable group of girls.The film ineptly tries to throw you off the scent by present a few oddballs to suspect, but these are so badly done, you cannot trust the film makers.There is a bewildering array of characters which arrive and simply make the job of following the basic plot almost impossible.The main 4 characters have so little in common, along with absolutely no establishing shots, you are left wondering why these people ever came together in the first place.The film employs no flashbacks, meaning you cannot connect modern day characters with their high school counterparts, it might as well have been a different set of characters.Events, meetings, parties and shows happen in the film without any forewarning , meaning as a viewer you are left watching a myriad of images that make no sense and are genuinely pointless in the story, along with dialog that leaves you literally out in the cold by discussing events and topics of which you have no knowledge of. Its like they are bitching behind you the viewers back, and leaving you to feel triumphant at their demise.About halfway through the film, the scriptwriter (and I use the term loosely) is making this up as he goes along, as while watching this film you quickly realize no thought went into this film other than the next shot. At certain moments in the film things just happen or come up in conversation that are so left-field of what would be considered normal trains of thought. E.g. Plastic Surgery, the concept that the killer may have had surgery to look different suddenly turns up as the scriptwriter suddenly realizes he needs a plausible reason why the killer looks nothing like the boy in the opening sequence. The actually killer is such a huge bloke, that not only would he need total plastic surgery, but also a full body transplant. The film tries to throw you by showing you a guy who looks like the boy in the opening sequence too. And finally, the detective is looking for a man with the initials JM, and all the dead women so far have received a valentines card with the initials JM, and not one of them makes the connection. When they sit down and try to think of all the men they know with JM as initials they recount a massive long list, but not the killer. All I can say these women must be an impressive bunch of whores to have so many men in their lives with JM, hell, there's a whole alphabet waiting for them in the sequels.Stuff that doesn't make sense include, Maggots in chocolate sweets, how they hell does one put live maggots into them? The classic horror movie mistake is using the recognizable villain in his hockey mask, or leather faced mask. In this epic, we have the villain wearing a cherub's mask, except the only people who see it are dead. So when the heroine sees it she screams and runs without knowing anything. She suddenly has attained the knowledge of the viewer without any effort at all.This film fails on so many grounds and I hope to have highlighted a few here. But why did I watch it to the end? Its one of those films where I wasn't going to let its inane style stop me from watching the end, which was as predictable as I imagined it to be. Plus I wanted to see how bad it could get at the end, a denouement in my opinion can save a terrible film.

I'll say it right now - I'm NOT a fan of 1990's horror.  Scream, I Know What You Did, etc... they can do without me.  I'm a fan of 80's slashers, though - and the Italian horror films of Fulci and Argento.While Valentine does share much with it's 1990's brothren (hot young cast, pulsating soundtrack), it also has much to share with 80's slasher flicks, and the films of Argento (please, fans of the maestro do not crucify me yet).First an explanation of the 80's comparison, it should be a fairly obvious comparison.  A young boy is tormented and rejected by his schoolmates, and comes back later to seek revenge.  If that wasn't typical enough of the 80's, he also dispatches of victims in a way that reminds me of Prom Night. It's a very nice - you know who it is, but you don't - type of feel.  As for comparing Valentine with Dario Argento's films - just look at the style of the killer, and then view Tenebre.  The black gloves, the relentless stalking, and even the death scenes (at times) could be seen as style over substance.All in all, Valentine is a fun, but sometimes slow moving, horror flick that is just a cut above the average horror films of late.  It might not be such a big improvement, but it's definitely an effort.

This sophomore effort clearly shows that his previous effort was merely a fluke.At an elementary school dance, a boy is rejected at every turn by snobby little ladies. By all except the lonely fat girl. When they are caught kissing, the girl claims the boy attacked her and he is set upon by bullies. Fast forward a decade or so and we find the girls all grown up, but every bit as snobbish. Their lives take a dramatic turn for the worse when some one begins slicing and dicing the friends as Valentine's Day approaches. Is it the boy come back for revenge? Giving credit where it's do, the opening scene is at the school dance sets the appropriate tone for a slasher film (even if it feels an awful lot like the opening for Terror Train). The scene is dark and uncomfortable and the conclusion of it is just plain nasty. Unfortunately, nothing else in the film lives up to the promise.Fist thing wrong with the whole project are the characters. They are some of the most unlikeable people this side of a Nazi prison camp movie. Every one of the girls are hopelessly self-absorbed and all the men in the feature are either obnoxious, deranged or both. You will care if they live or die, that is you'll want them to die, the world will be a better place without them.In stark contrast to Urban Legends, Banks seems incapable of providing even remotely effective scare set-ups. Every death is telegraphed long in advance and he fails to employ any fresh or even interesting tricks. Watch an random 80's slasher and you've seen everything offered here. Even the killer's mask invokes more snickers than shrieks (a little cherub face, come on now).As was the trend when this came out, the film is stuffed with in-jokes and teen humor. None of it is funny though, as the script is dead on it's feet and the actor delivery is ill-timed. Viewers will laugh, just for all the wrong reasons.A deluge of slashers popped up during the post-Scream era.

The Killer's nose bleeds throughout the film, slit throat, (graphic but non bloody), arrow hits (non bloody), nasty looking corpses, someone gets beaten to death with a hot iron (very cool), Axe in the back, bloody corpse, a neck is pushed down onto a piece of glass (extremely cool), drill in the arm, a blood filled tube, and a couple bloody gunshot wounds.

It was not, however, until the seventies that the slasher movie began to emerge as a recognisable genre in its own right, with its own set of rules and conventions.The films to which Valentine is most indebted are probably the Halloween series, which started in 1978. Indeed, the name is probably an oblique reference to that series, All Hallows Eve and St Valentine's Day both being originally religious festivals which have taken on more secular connotations in recent years.The film is set around Valentine's day. (Or at least, it is supposedly so set. The outdoor scenes were obviously shot in the summer rather than in February). A group of young women receive sinister, threatening Valentine's cards, then one by one they are murdered in various gruesome ways by a mysterious stranger wearing a cupid mask. Apart from being friends, the one thing they have in common is that they were all at school together and that, about a decade or so earlier, they were all asked to dance at a school prom by the class nerd, an unattractive, unpopular boy named Jeremy. Four of them rudely rebuffed him, and the fifth falsely accused him of assaulting her, leading to his being beaten up and humiliated by a gang of bullies. It is presumed that Jeremy is the murderer and that his motive is revenge for his humiliation at the school dance. There is an attempt to provide a surprise ending, but this is so muddled and badly done that I ended up not knowing who the murderer actually was or what his- or her- motives were.The acting is uniformly poor, even though there are several relatively well-known faces in the cast- Bond girl Denise Richards, Katherine Heigl and David Boreanaz of Buffy fame. Heigl, whose character is the first to be killed, apparently signed up for the film without having read the full script, which would explain a lot. Richards's presence in this film provides evidence in support of the Curse of Bond theory- the theory which states that winning a part as a Bond girl will act as a permanent blight on the career of the actress concerned.Some recent slasher films, such as the Scream and Scary Movie franchises, have attempted to poke fun at the genre, but Valentine is a slasher movie of the semi-serious type rather than a deliberate parody. I say semi-serious because, whatever the intentions of the film-makers may have been, it is now virtually impossible to take any film in this genre seriously. There have been so many ludicrously bad examples that the genre has effectively parodied itself. There is a long list of well-worn conventions associated- the weird mask worn by the killer, the moralising tone whereby the victims all have some guilty secret, the terrified-girl-alone in-a-building-with-the-killer situation- all of which are religiously followed here. There appears to have been no attempt to make anything fresh or original. The result is a dull, formulaic, clichéd movie, an example of the slasher genre at its worst. It was billed as a thriller, but is about as thrilling as cold rice pudding. The one good thing that can be said about it is that it did not spawn a franchise of sequels. 2/10. And that's generous.

His superficial but straightforward slice and dice saga about a demented lunatic who wears a shiny plastic Cupid's mask and slays a gaggle of gorgeous twentysomethings lacks originality, suspense, and charismatic characters. The scene aptly epitomizing Valentine occurs after a curvaceous cutie finds a heart shaped box of gift chocolates on her doorstep. When she bites into one of the rich, gooey pieces, she discovers to her horror that maggots are squirming around in it! Valentine doesn't get any better that this allusion to Dario Argento's classic Suspiria. Although the body count rises every quarter-hour with robotic monotony and the filmmakers spill enough blood for an R-rating, the comparatively generic murders capture little of the adrenaline edge required to set your heart to trip-hammering. Hardcore horror aficionados that relish the good stuff will feel cheated. Generally, Valentine recycles all the formulaic clichés and conventions of slasher from the 1970s & 1980s but sacrifices any sense of ingenuity and inspiration. Without the humor of the Scream trilogy or the gore of the Friday the 13th flicks, Valentine leaves a taste as yucky as a half-eaten maggot. Obviously, the people that made Valentine missed Scary Movie. The Wayans Brothers skewered virtually every murderous scene here so the whole movie suffers from a bad case of déjà vu! The action unfolds at Robert F. Kennedy Middle School during a sixth grade Valentine's Day dance. Eleven-year old Jeremy Melton, a naïve, goofy-toothed geek in heavy-framed spectacles, asks the prettiest girl to dance. Three turn him down rudely; one says 'maybe,' and Dorothy&#151;heftier than her haughty friends&#151;convinces Jeremy to make out with her beneath the bleachers. While they are necking, several bullies harass them. Mortified, Dorothy reels in alarm and accuses Jeremy of attacking her. The bullies drench Jeremy with red punch (similar to Brian De Palma's Carrie where Sissy Spacek got baptized in pig's blood) then strip him to his shorts and send him packing out of the gym. The trauma of this ordeal scars Jeremy so badly that his nose bleeds whenever he stresses out. His bleeding snout emerges as a recurring character trait that symbolizes the closure of each murder. Later, when our heroines confer with a cop in what amounts to an obvious bout of exposition, we learn that Jeremy went to reform school but wound up in an insane asylum. Eventually, we learn that Jeremy's parents died in a mysterious fire, and photos of Jeremy survived the blaze.Indeed, not only are Blanks and his scribes not content with making a slasher, but they also try to forge an Agatha Christie whodunit. They manage to assemble all the appropriate elements, but they have overlooked adding enough red herring to challenge audiences. No matter how many bathroom breaks or concession stand forays you make, you should have little difficulty in cracking this mediocre whodunit. The characters are so stupid that they never see the end coming, and the ending of Valentine is so contrived that even the surviving characters should have known better.Anyway, thirteen years elapse in a flash. All five dames have matured and embarked on either a career or college. Nobody gives poor Jeremy a second thought. Kate (Marley Shelton of Sugar & Spice, a sweetheart who struggles with alcoholic boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer), have become a journalist. Hard-to-get Paige (Denise Richards of Wild Things) admits in retrospect that they mistreated Jeremy. Medical school student Shelly (Katherine Heigl of 27 Dresses) has gone her own way to college. She prefers to dissect male cadavers rather than dine out with a real-live fellow. Slutty Lily (Jessica Cauffiel of White Chicks) still lets her hormones rule her and hangs out with Paige, while insecure rich girl Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw of Minority Report) takes advantage of her wealth and affluence to host big parties for her friends. Aside from Kate, none are remotely sympathetic despite their stunning looks. The girls haven't had any reason to stay in touch until the authorities discover Shelly's mutilated remains in the morgue of the university. Somehow, the Cupid killer gained access to the morgue and caught Shelly hiding in a body bag before he stabbed her repeatedly to death. Before long, the girls receive sicko Valentine Day cards with messages like Roses are red/ Violets are blue/They'll need dental records to identify you. Eventually, our masked menace in a Navy watch coat tracks them down and kills them with a vengeance that recognizes no restraint.Sadly, Valentine qualifies as a predictable, run-of-the-chills slasher. Consistently, the women behave like clueless cretins. They display the singular knack of isolating themselves in dark, dead-end places away from any source of help and get the axe. Typically, the slasher never breaks a sweat. He trudges along with the comatose gait of a zombie and always seems to get his guy or gal. Blanks competently stages the murders in a variety of creepy settings, and lenser Rick Bota's atmospheric, widescreen photography enhances the mood. Unfortunately, because the victims act so much like morons when the killer confronts them, you feel like you should cheer the villain instead of the heroines. Oddly enough, if anybody should win our sympathy, Jeremy should. After all, he was the one who was humiliated and whose life was destroyed. Nevertheless, Blanks blurs the morality when the heroines show what wenches they are. Apart from Kate, each shows herself in a negative light that alienates her from audience sympathy. Moreover, everything between the death scenes in Valentine generates little urgency. Far too much to the story relies on contrivances rather than character motivated movement.Altogether, Valentine qualifies as half-hearted hokum.

Pre-conceptions perhaps but they are correct in this case as this is nothing but a genre flick and it is one that suffers from really poor writing. The plot starts and continues by making it totally clear who the killer is &#150; in fact so clear that only a fool would be taken in by it &#150; the phrase 'he doth protest too much' comes to mind when considering how hard this film tries to get us to accept that he is the killer. Despite this the film plods on and I suppose at least it is different from it throwing us red-herrings all the time but the eventual twist is all the more tiring for the fact that we know it must be coming. The film throws up quite graphic killings, not gory but quite vicious but the problem is they aren't scary &#150; they are just unpleasant and I'm not into that for its own sake (although some may be).The writing is uninspired as it is punctuated by murders every 10 minutes or so and the rest of the film is almost padding with poor dialogue. Compounding this problem is the fact that the characters are awful. The girls are all beautiful and really bad to all the men in their lives &#150; how was I supposed to care about a collection of rather preppy b*tches who are presented as quite air-headed! To excuse this behaviour the script makes all the men jerks and none of them have any character and only serve as red-herrings in the final 20 minutes. In one regard the casting of mostly b-grade actors makes it harder to guess who will live and who will die and I wasn't able to predict them. Richards is sexy but gives a poor 'air head slut' performance; Boreanaz is given almost nothing to do until the end (where he is used in a stupid way) and if you can't figure out why then you must be thick! The rest of the cast include Shelton, Capshaw, Cauffiel and Heigl who all run around and scream lots. None of them are any good but it is mostly because the material is so poor.Overall this is poor even by genre standards. The violent scenes are just nasty and are not tense or scary; the dialogue is terrible, the characters nonexistent and, when the twist inevitably comes is it stupid, illogical and a total insult to the intelligence of the audience. Even compared to other films that have the same genre weaknesses then this is poor &#150; no scares, no thrills, no characters, no plot, no logic and no point. A vacuous and stupid film.

Sure it's banal modern day horror junk that hangs together by clichés and stupid plot holes, but at least it's never boring and it's actually quite funny in a cheesy kind of way. Five hot twenty-something babes, seemly with a lot of free time on their hands, all receive shocking Valentine cards signed with the initials J.M. Could this be the morbid revenge of a nerdy kid that the popular girls collectively humiliated during a school dance more than 12 years ago? The joke really becomes alarming when Shelly is found brutally murdered...and she's only number one. The poorly written script is (unintentionally?) hilarious! Even though it are mainly just girls that get slaughtered, this movie is very man-unfriendly! Every male character that gets introduced is either a sexual pervert or a socially dysfunctional loser...most are even both! Heck, even the police inspector turns out to be an obscene freak! There's absolutely no tension and you can predict every next twist hours in advance. The beauty-queen killings are reasonably inventive but almost entirely bloodless, so gore-hounds beware. The ending (as in the actual revelation of the killer's identity) is totally absurd and makes the movie even worse that Jamie Blanks' previous turkey Urban Legend. In fact, Valentine was released 20 years too late! With a plot and gore opportunities like this, it could have been a minor 80's slasher-classic like Happy Birthday To Me or &#150; oh yes &#150; My Bloody Valentine. Nobody cares about such slashers anymore nowadays. The politically correct American horror standards don't allow nudity or brutal gore and that's why every new slasher attempt looks lame.

Pretty good teen slasher.","Date":"2 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Valentine starts with Jeremy Melton (Joel Palmer) the school nerd being rejected & publicly humiliated by every half decent looking female at a school valentine party, that is until he comes across the equally desperate & fat Dorothy Wheeler (Kate Logie) whom at fist is eager to get it on with Jeremy but then decides to humiliate him even more when everyone else catches them together by saying that Jeremy attacked her... It's now '13 Years Later', Valentine's Day is fast approaching & the girls from that night all those years ago are looking for love including med student Shelly Fisher (Katherine Heigl) who has just had a nightmare date with a dork named Jason Marquette (Adam Harrington). Shortly after Shelly receives a threatening Valentine's card & is brutally murdered. Four of Shelly's close friends from school, the fat Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw), the popular Kate Davies (Marley Shelton, the funny Lily Voight (Jessica Cauffiel) & the very sexy Paige Prescott (Denise Richards) attend the funeral where Detective Vaughn (Fulvio Cecere) tells them to be careful. Which turns out to be good advice as strange things start to happen, more creepy Valentine cards, chocolates with live maggots inside, clothes being taken & the small matter of a psycho murderer in a cherub mask who has his sights set on revenge...This American Australian co-production was directed by Jamie Blanks & is a pretty good entry into the popular slasher film sub genre started by the likes of Halloween (1978) & Friday the 13th (1980). The script by Donna Powers, Wayne Powers, Gretchen J. Berg & Aaron Harberts based on the novel by Tom Savage moves along at a nice pace, it has a nice mystery angle to it with plenty of suspects & red herrings as to whom the killer may be. The characters are quite likable for the most part & unusually for an almost entire teen cast nobody got on my nerves. Valentine is far from original as this has nothing new to offer slasher fans than any of the similarly themed films from 25 years ago. It uses the clichés & stereotypes well enough to create a film in it's own right & I found myself rather liking it. On the negative side the Valentine angle could have been used more other than a couple of cards with threatening messages written on them & the killing methods could have been Valentine or love themed like Lily's death when she is shot by arrows which is obviously a cupid inspired murder, the ending seems to confuse a lot of people as well although I think it's quite clever & very satisfying. Valentine could have used some more gore & deaths, according to the IMDb's 'Altenate Versions' section Warner Bros. made director Blanks edit the film for violence which annoys the hell out of me & it even suggests that the murder of Dorthy's stepmother was cut completely, damn studios. Valentine has good set pieces including a murder committed in a maze of monitors at an art show, the opening in a morgue & when Paige is killed in a Jacuzzi with a huge drill. It has that slasher feel to it & is very well made with nice cinematography & production design considering it's budget of about $10,000,000. The gore & violence is disappointingly tame, an off screen slit throat (one scene that was cut apparently), someone is shot with arrows, someone has their throat impaled on broken glass, an axe in someone's back & a scene involving a drill. The cast all put in decent performances & all look gorgeous apart from Jessica Capshaw who has a square jaw & just looks strange if you stare at her for too long. A special mention goes to Denise Richards who is a total babe & we get to see her in a very skimpy swimming outfit which is almost worth the price of a rental on it's own. David Boreanaz better known as Angel (1999 - 2004) makes an appearance & does an OK job. I liked Valentine, I thought it was a fine slasher film for modern audiences. Definitely worth a watch if not just for Denise Richards...

You know who the killer is. You know who will die. You know who will get the big chase scene. Lets just say that the teen slasher films are getting a tad bit unoriginal. Scream, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, I know what you did last summer,Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Friday the 13th are the original teen horror flicks. And all these other movies are coping off them. So to the director, maybe you should come up with something more original than killer-chases-big- breasted-girls-who-can't-act moteff another step.1/10 "},{"Title":"Another slickly made teen slasher garbage.","Date":"28 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Valentine is just another teen slasher from Jamie Blanks,the director of extremely generic Urban Legend.It tells the story of five school friends now grown up.One by one the girls start to receive strange cards around Valentine's Day.The cards all bear the same initials and when the girls and the detective get together they all point the finger at a school nerd they knew years ago whom they had all humiliatingly knocked back at the local school dance.From then on in as the girls are killed one by one you are left to work out if is it the school nerd or whether someone else is responsible.Valentine is a suspenseless and almost completely bloodless slasher film that literally offers nothing new.The acting is surprisingly flat and the plot heavily borrows from Canadian slasher My Bloody Valentine.The script is poorly written,the conversations are all lifeless and dull and as for the plot,it's safe to say you won't find many more stupid than this one.The climax is awful with totally pointless plot twist at the end.The film is slickly made and moderately entertaining,but the lack of gore is hard to forgive.A typical trash for teens,who don't know the genre.3 out of 10.If you want truly grisly and savage piece of horror rent Haute Tension.

Is it him? Who cares? How this got greenlighted is beyond me. It's basically a lousy copy of all those c**p slasher movies of the 1980s. You would think in the wake of movies like Scream filmmakers would try something new. Sadly not. The plot is old (this has been done hundreds of times--a masked killer stalking women--how original!), it's suspenseless and the acting--wellllllll. David Boreanaz is very good as an ex of one of the girls, but he's wasted in a minor role. Everyone else is bad--and I mean EVERYONE! Even Denise Richards (who can be amusing) sucks. The worst thing about this movie is that it's too timid. There's no nudity (even though there are plenty of chances) and the murders are very tame--a little blood and that's about it. If you're going to do a stupid slasher film at least give us gore! Also logic disappears frequently (one woman running from the killer has two choices...a door leading outside, one leading to a sauna. Guess which one she picks? The sauna!!!!), and the ending is screamingly obvious. It's an insult to horror fans (like myself) and everybody else will be bored. You end up rooting for the killer! Avoid at all costs!

This is without question one of the worst slashers to come out of the post-Scream era. There's really not one single thing to enjoy here because we get all sorts of obnoxious characters who you want to see die because of how much you hate them. There's no one to cheer for, which is a major deadly sin in a horror movie like this. The ending tries to be smart but it's easy to see the twist coming. Denise Richards is pretty much wasted in the lead as is the young Katherine Heigl who would gain fame several years later with Knocked Up. Both My Bloody Valentine and Hospital Massacre feature similar stories and are a lot better. "}]
