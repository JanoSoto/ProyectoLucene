All I gotta say is, If you didn't like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain? Do all of us Friends of Jim Carey a favor, if you don't like his humor, just go find some stuffy anal retentive fluff film, and write reviews on them that we will never read since those movies are for stuck-up self absorbed types.

Ace retires from being a Pet Detective until Fulton Greenwall (Ian McNeice) offers him a large amount of money to find a missing sacred Bat. The plot of this movie is not as good as the original. But it's funnier! And a lot of fun. I remember watching this 10 years ago at the theater when it first came out. Frankly, I think there should be one more movie before Ace retires.

Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also satirizing old stereotypes about Dark Africa. Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (It was RIGHT there!) Or the slideshow in which Ace's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just hilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!) And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being annoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.

Later on when someone tells you the very same joke again something is already different. You don't laugh to it anymore, you just give it a little weary yawn and say I've heard that one before. However, there are refreshing exceptions. Ace Ventura When nature calls is one of them because if the joke is good enough and someone can still tell it properly it can be just as funny even though you've heard it once before.This sequel isn't better than the original but unlike some other IMDb-users I feel that it really isn't much worse either. If you loved Ace Ventura Pet detective I see no sensible reason why you shouldn't love this one as well. Best thing about Ace Ventura When nature calls is the fact that our beloved pet detective has moved right from urban city surroundings deep into the exotic African locations. It would've been a really hard job to figure out perfect settings for the third part of this unholy saga so I'm pretty damn glad they never made it (as far as I understand Carrey refused) because these two flicks are so sensationally good comedies it would have been quite a shame to see how the excellent idea wears out after too much use.In the mid-90's when Jim Carrey was just becoming a huge superstar I used to consider him just an annoying and overrated jerk. I simply didn't understand him. I guess it isn't always easy to admit that a guy who talks through his arsehole is one of the most talented comedians of our time but in the end it probably tells more about our time than Mr. Carrey. The Truman show, Man on the moon and The Majestic has also proofed that Carrey is more than just a gifted comedian, he's a really believable, charming and impressive actor.Actually I predict that sooner or later when the time is right and he ends up in a right movie he will definitely get his Oscar but it's not coming from something like this that's for sure. Let's face it, if you're not used to Jimmy's humor these movies are not exactly the easiest ones to swallow since the breathtakingly lunatic Ace Ventura is one of the most (if not the most) overdone characters of the whole movie history. But if you give it a try, you may just love it. I can honestly say that I do. This is classic Jim Carrey at his best.

The Mask had too few of the 'mask' scenes, Pet Detective was just about OK, nothing great. This movie though is better because the story flows freely(unlike P.D) and it has a lot of Jim Carey (unlike The Mask). The scene at the monastery is actually brilliantly shot and to have such OTT comedy at what otherwise seems so mystical a location, I've never seen something like that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it's Ace's love for animals that comes out quite well.

Along the way, he nearly sleeps with a seductive African princess before her wedding, experiences astral projection with an enlightened monkey, masturbates, collects bat dung and, last but not least, is birthed by a mechanical rhino. Often short on taste, the film is nonetheless full of good spirit and plenty of genuine belly laughs particularly during the fight scene with a diminutive tribal champion.Not for every taste, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is either hilarious or insufferable, depending on the viewer's opinion of Carrey's unique brand of slapstick and sight gags.

However he finds things are not all as it seems.The sequel to the first film was never going to be a fantastically inventive affair but rather more of the same, albeit not as fresh or different.  The plot is almost meaningless and certainly not important to enjoying the film.  The comedy is everything and it almost manages to make for a good film.  Opening with an inspired and hilarious Cliff Hanger spoof followed by a reference to William Shatner's episode of the Twilight Zone, the film fails to really keep it up and slips into relying wholeheartedly on Carrey's mugging.Mostly this is funny but it is less sophisticated than the first film (if it's possible to describe the first film as that!).  The jokes become more about the faces he pulls than about any invention in the dialogue or writing.  As such you'll like this or hate it based on how you like Carrey when he is manic.  I like him when I'm in the mood and laughed pretty regularly here.Carrey of course carries the film with ease but also has famous support like he did in the first film.  However they are not given as much to do and are of less value &#150; Callow, Gunton and McNeice are not that missed when off-screen.  Of curiosity value are several British actors playing Nigerians &#150; Akinnuoye-Agbaje is better known as the amazing actor from Oz on HBO and is given nothing to do here, meanwhile Okonedo is pretty and humorous for those of us who know her better for her gritty role in Clocking Off on BBC1.Overall anyone watching this should just be aware of what they are getting &#150; it's a silly comedy that is totally reliant on Carrey's mugging to carry it.  If you're not in the mood for that then avoid &#150; but even if you are then you should be aware that it still might not be that good a film.

Guess what? He's back and still has every quality he had in the original. I know, it sounds like there's a catch here. Well there is not-at least with Jim Carrey's character. I did not like this movie as much as the original for one reason and one reason only. No it wasn't that Courtney Cox didn't reprise her role as Melissa Robinson. That I can deal with. My problem was that the story involved some characters that made Ace Ventura's character seem stupid. What made the original funny was that Ace Ventura was on top of his game. He knew what he was doing and how he was doing it. What also made it funny was that nobody ELSE knew what he was doing and although it seemed strange, Ventura got the job done. This occurred throughout the entire first film. And that's how it goes for most of this movie. The part of the movie that I think either did not need to be added or could have been modified was when Ace Ventura was among the African Tribes. What was so hard for me grasp was that in the first movie, they took a smart crazy detective and put him around a bunch of normal people that understood nothing of what he did. When Ventura is around the Tribe members, he is the dumb crazy detective. Why do I say this? Because Jim Carrey's character does not speak their language. It is this major flaw of why some of the laughs fail in this movie for me. For example, when Ventura starts to eat the food at the tribe's festival, he does not realize what he was eating until he is told what it really was. I thought Ventura was the smart one here? The whole point of the first film was so that the joke would be on everyone else; now the roles are switched? Why? Does the laugh really need to be on our comedic hero? It was at that point I started to wonder whether Ace really knew what he was doing.Of course these kinds of instances did not happen all the time. There were many parts where Ventura was surrounded by upper class people who thought they were better than he was and just like the first film he proved them wrong with a snotty remark and an obscene gesture. That's the old Ace I know! That is what made Ace Ventura such a character. Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is almost a perfect sequel. It still has good laughs but it is dumbed down by its mediocre screenplay. It is because of this that Ace Ventura does not seem always on top of everyone else like he was in the first film.

It was so funny I was practically hysterical and had suddenly lost that feeling of being too tired to move.Anyone who used to watch In Living Color can attest to Jim Carrey being a master of physical comedy. I used to watch him do utterly amazing stuff on that show and looked forward, every week, to seeing what he'd do next. Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is, unquestionably, Jim Carrey at his very best.That goes for the entire crew of the movie. I think many people tend not to notice but there are huge differences between the quality of a comedy such as When Nature Calls and the rather half-hearted movies that just don't work very well and are not very funny as a result. Some of this can be directly attributed to how well the director frames scenes and how well they maintain the energy. To how well the writers, director of photography and the film editor did their jobs. With When Nature Calls, you have all of these bases covered in spades. It's truly well made in front of, as well as behind, the camera.Carrey never loses his momentum in this movie. He goes over the top quite frequently. Unlike some other comedic actors, though, he seems to almost always know when to stop. And when to play it cool, although that doesn't happen very often. I don't know how much of the movie is scripted and how much was ad libbed, but whatever the combination, it works beautifully. It's almost always hilarious and the camera always seems to be in just the right place. Exquisite production.Ace Ventura is a force of nature and all the world's a straight man for him, apparently. No one is safe. He is constantly pulling someone's chain. Particularly the bad guys who he always has squarely in his sights. I would definitely recommend this movie to a family. The small children, particularly the boys, will get a big kick out of it. It's disgusting from time to time and drifts effortlessly in to the scatological here and there but it's all good. One tip when Ace gets to the African tribe's village, that might be a good time to leave the room for a few minutes. You're welcome.

That doesn't mean this sequel isn't as bold, brash and bountifully braggadocio as its predecessor; a riotous laugh-a-minute wild kingdom zoo train (but see disclaimer above).Ace is called out of retirement by an explorer (a game Ian McNiece), to travel to Africa and locate a missing sacred white bat, which will avert war between two tribes. Along the way, he engages in a loogie-fest with the Wachati tribesmen, a test of manly skill with their opponents, the Wachootoo tribe (featuring Tommy Davidson as a maniacal little tribal warrior), is birthed naked by a robot rhinoceros, wrestles a crocodile, is forced into a Wolverine hairdo, deflowers a forbidden virgin tribesgirl, uncovers the whitey corporate plot (with Simon Callow as a contemptuous upper class Brit), and once again talks through his arse.It becomes obvious from this movie that Jim Carrey's inimitable performance in ACE VENTURA was no fluke and that his star rising was no accident. Seeing him in action, we realize that the White Boy from IN LIVING COLOR has become a dynamo force of nature that no vagaries of the industry could have stopped. Physical comedians Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Jerry Lewis were from an age long dead - the world was hungry for the next larger-than-life King of Comedy.Unlike mundane comedians like the Patton Oswalts and Ray Romanos (who rely on writing, direction, editing, soundtrack, to convey their stunted comedic stylings), Carrey is able to turn writing and storyline into a visual hurricane of ideas and kineticism, aware of every muscle in his body during every moment of screen time, ever driving to squeeze the last iota of juice from his performance. It is not that he is bombastic - of course he is, that's Ace - but that he can imbue that bombast with such creativity.Underneath it all, WHEN NATURE CALLS is a call to nature - the message of conservation spears home loud and clear. You Earth faddies should love that, right? No matter what you may think of Jim Carrey, he opened the way for a new strand of physical comedy, the likes of which Will Ferrell and Rob Schneider and Jason Biggs should be eternally grateful.So before you even speak of that black hole, deal with that black hole speaking....--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

Not only did the movie suck but there is a mean spiritness running all the way through the proceedings that is hard to swallow. I am not talking about the gross-out humor, like Carrey making the biggest loogie in history (by the way that was quite disturbing) but the director seems to think that Ace has to be the World's biggest jerk to survive in the African setting.As in the first film, many of the supporting characters are just decorative, except Simon Callow (he was the gay guy who croaks in Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Sophie Okenedo. It's amazing she was nominated for an Oscar this year judged by this film. Carrey totally dominates every scene and it looks like that the star in him has taken over completely. That's acceptable, as so many 20 million Dollar men would probably do the same.The plot of the movie does seem more thought out but in this kind of venture who cares. It is totally under the mercy of how many catchphrases Carrey can recite and the rather embarrassing slapstick humor. Another annoying thing is the way Ventura has suddenly been turned into a pervert although the twist at the end is rather clever.So in summary the film is in very bad taste but there was a market for that sort of thing as the movie was a huge hit.

It opens with a parody of Cliffhanger where Ace Ventura fails to save a raccoon stranded on a mountainside. Depressed, he secludes himself in a temple until he is summoned to Africa to find the sacred bat thus preventing a war between two tribes. Basically the same stupid concept as Ace Ventura Pet Detective that devises predictable developments and recycled dialogue. The tribal jokes are offensive but director Steve Oedekerk allows for beautiful shots of Africa that are pretty much the best aspect of the film. In fact, watching ninety minutes of African footage on your average wildlife program would be better time spent than watching this. Jim Carrey does nothing new accept portray Ace as a bigger jackass. Ian McNeice is wasted as Ace's contact. Simon Callow plays the villain whose final scene has him molested by a gorilla. Sophie Okonodo plays the tribal Princess who encounters Ventura and allows him to pop her cherry before her wedding.

His latest case, the disappearance of a rare African white bat, draws him out of his spiritual retreat at a Tibetan monastery following the tragic outcome of his previous case. That traumatic experience, which makes for a hilarious opening-scene send-up of the Stallone thriller Cliffhanger, prompts Ace to venture to Africa, where he goes native with the tribe that hired him to find their symbolic bat. From that point anything goes, with Carrey pushing the boundaries of good taste (what, you were expecting good taste?) up to and including his now-infamous birth scene from the backside of a mechanical rhinoceros.

The opening sequence involving a raccoon suspended from a wire high up in the mountains (in an amusing parody of Cliffhanger) is a little too cheesy even by Ventura standards at some points, but the movie as a whole is a very satisfying comedy. Ace commits himself to an Ashram after losing the raccoon, unable to bear the emotional turmoil of allowing the poor animal to fall to its death. When Fulton Greenwall shows up to ask for Ace's help in retrieving a sacred bat so that war between two African tribes can be prevented, Ace at first refuses the task, citing how sorely needed he is here at the Ashram. The monks' wild party after he agrees to take the case was a little too childish, but it was a hilarious scene when Ace rolls the slinky down the stairs of the Ashram (`Of course! Let's do all the things that YOU wanna do&#133;'), and it was even funnier when Greenwall was trying to explain the situation to Ace on the plane (`I'm sorry, what were you saying?').There are a lot of goofball antics that sink slightly below the level of Ace Ventura comedy, such as the dusting for fingerprints scene and Ace's `meditation' scene, but there is no shortage of laughs in the film. The hilarious scene at Ronald Kamp's party is also done in a slightly different version here, as Greenwall takes Ace to see Vincent Cadby at the consulate in Africa (`Funny, it didn't seem that painful when you were doing it to the horse&#133;'). Some of the jokes are recycled, such as Ace's breathless analysis of Cadby, but even these recycled jokes are not entirely without effect. In the movie's defense, at least the jokes weren't copied to the extent that they were copied in the sequel to Austin Powers, which was far inferior to the original.Jim Carrey delivered a style of acting in the Ace Ventura films that is fairly unique to them - he never really acted this crazy in any of his later films, probably because he became so much more well-known and this kind of acting was just too silly for the quality of an actor that he later proved himself to be. There was some of what could be called over-acting in Ace Ventura When Nature Calls, but the comedy is never compromised because of this. The Ace Ventura's are not the most classy comedies ever made, and they require the presence of at least some of your inner child in order to fully enjoy, but their comedic appeal is much higher than is common in movies like this. Watch them with an open mind, and you're sure to enjoy them.

A must-watch!","Date":"26 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Shikaka! Ace Ventura is one of my favorite movie characters of all time! This character catapulted Jim Carrey from small TV character actor from 'In Living Color', to A-list celebrity, when the film, 1994's Ace Ventura Pet Detective became a surprise hit. The first movie was such a hit, it spawn a somewhat funny animated television series (1995 to 2000) and one really bad 2009 spin-off children movie, Ace Ventura, Jr. Pet Detective. The best from all of these films, had to be the 1995 sequel, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. This film has developed a large cult following since its release and I agree with them. This movie in my opinion, is probably the funniest Jim Carrey's movie in the 1990s. Yes, I said it! Jim Carrey reprises his role as the title character Ace Ventura, a detective who specializes in retrieval of tame and captive animals. This time, Ace Ventura is heading to Africa, to recover a sacred bat stolen from poachers, before two African tribes go to war because of it. Directed by Steve Oedekerk, the movie did a great job in location. I really thought, the movie was filmed in some type of Africa country. Actually, the film shot in various locations in and around Charleston, South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas and British Columbia, Canada. Who knew! The writing for this film is just amazing. Not only is the jokes, more hits than misses to the funny bone, but it's very clever with its gross out puns/sight gags, pop culture references, and movie parody humor of previous films like 1993's Cliffhanger. The crime solving mystery of the film is also pretty brilliant. You really get into the story, as Ace Ventura recover clue after clue. The best highlight of the film is Jim Carrey's acting. The way, he can move his body in a silly way for slapstick humor was astonishing. In his day, nobody could touch this guy for pure facial and voice comedy. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. Yes, he did overact, a bit here and became more like a cartoon than a person, but his overacting as Ace made it, very entertaining. This was Jim Carrey in his prime. He was and still is a mad genius at making people laughs, but lately hasn't found good material and tamed done since then. If there was any reason to watch this film, it's for his performance here. You'll find yourself, laughing more than once. I remember my whole family were crying, unable to breath with laughter the first time watching this. Spank you very much, Ace Ventura for making me laugh. The main theme song is pretty catchy by Robert Folk. The movie does a great job using establish songs like 'Secret Agent Man' & 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' to add to the humor. Indeed, the movie did come with alternative versions, when aired in syndication in International countries and on television. In order to receive a PG certificate, the UK release of the film features a number of cuts, equaling one minute and 35 seconds for the theatrical release, plus a further three seconds when re-classified for home video. This version is the worst, as it cut really funny scenes like Bumblebee tuna balls joke, and alternative version of the 'rhino scene'. Don't watch this version. Just find the US standard. Nature Calls does have considerably less offensive swearing, sexual jokes, and vulgarity than the previous film, but it doesn't really affects the quality of the film. Yes, there was Product Placement. An obvious ad of Subway is placed on a highway billboard early in When Nature Calls, but it was used as a gag about being in nature. The pacing is a bit off for a 90 minute film. Honestly, they could have cut like the whole first 15 minutes as it takes him forever to get to Africa and the story to start. None of the first part in the Himalayas and Tibet were that funny to begin with. The supporting cast was a bit missing. The female lead, the Princess (Sophie Okonedo) was barely in the film, and just there for somebody for Ace to bang with. It's a far cry from big female leads of Courtney Cox and Sean Young from the last movie. At less, this movie get a really good funny supporting character name Oda (Maynard Eziashi) that made scenes way funny. Ian McNeice as Fulton Greenwall & Bob Gunton as Burton Quinn & Simon Callow really did work, well as the straight man stock characters to Jim Carrey's outrageous cartoon character. Even fellow 'In Living Color' cast member, Tommy Davidson, got a few laughs in, as the Tiny Warrior. Overall It's a movie that you find yourself, rewatching it time after time, because it's so funny. You'll find yourself repeating the funny phrases and wisecracks. Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is a must watch, must have, film to add to your comedy collection.

But that's not necessarily a good thing !Actually this movie (or rather Carrey) tries so hard to be at the furthest nasty limit. The thing is this nastiness wasn't laughable inasmuch as dreadful. Regard well  (Carrey) suffers from sexual repression so he masturbates (that's not funny or has been done in a funny way !), (Carrey) in some African fight with a man of the primitive tribes so he unclothes the last one's underwear to make him butt naked, (Carrey) in the most concocted scene comes totally naked out of rhinoceros's ass, then at the most violent scene &#x96; that gave me one of the highest disgusting moment I've ever lived - (Carrey) puts his own hand so all of his arm in the mouth of an ill man (that's sickening horror not comic at all !??), and finally look at (Carrey) speaks, literally, out of his ass (or for better don't !).I could swear no script got all of this. They seem all parts of (Carrey)'s antic behaviors at the moment. He was here something between Jerry Lewis of the 1990s with touches of (John Waters) filthy cinema. And by all means the final result was intolerable crap that hurts your nervous system more than putting a smile on your face.Historically, it was about time for this kind of comedies to rule. In the next 4 years you'd have (The Nutty Professor), (Kingpin), (There's Something About Mary), (Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo), and of course (American Pie) where the comedy is nothing but heavy amount of sperms, urine, and all what the rudeness dictionary could contain. Definitely that found an audience that took a fancy to it, compensating a certain quantity of lost filth in their life or maybe feeding their inner longing for more. In any case, I'm not a big fan.Though, (When Nature Calls) isn't totally unfunny. There are some moments where Carry provides some chuckles. But that was in rare places. Originally the cartoonish persona of Ace Ventura, that (Carrey) carried out perfectly in part one, was creatively different, a bit childish, and totally entertaining. Yet here, OH MY GOD, it transformed into (Carrey) himself with all the unfunny wanton manners. And despite having an agreeable plot, the loud sense surpassed and ruined the good bits. So even if we replaced the word Fandango in the previous equation with the word Funny for some time, it'll still give the same resultant  Awful !It assures how (Carrey) was a walking special comedy back then. And how the studio loved the money that that brings. So watch (or watch out !) the real sinister climax of that - one year ahead - in (The Cable Guy). At that one he had - for the first time it happens for an actor in the history of cinema - a sum of 20 million dollar salary, to deliver nothing but unbridled ridiculousness! Actually in a few years (Carrey), or us, got board. So he brilliantly developed another more sane persona, considering Ace Ventura as an era that must not go forever. Wise move if you ask me.If you loved the first one, then this sequel will disturb, if not offend, you. I think the title (When Nature Calls!) says it all, giving us a cinematic toilet to get rid of what bothers you, yet I found more of that there ! "}{"Title":"The Hair...

Miami may be crazy, but not as much as Jim Carey. Reality was Jim Carey's foil. And the joke was on reality. He also had his down time, when he was real and not so wound up alrighty then.In this one, Jim Carey has done away with any resemblance of Ace Ventura to a real person. He's a cartoon character now, not just a zany free spirit. He's thrown away the off button. No rest for this guy, even when meditating. But that doesn't mean he's funny just because he's on.The new movie doesn't take place in the real world, either. It's not Nairobi or Johannesburg or even a real rural Africa, but some fictional Africa where Apartheid seems intact, natives still fight wars with spears and there exists a species of great white bat. Goofy native customs are made up solely for ridicule. In other words, Jim Carey has given up the first movie's one foot in reality and settled on a stereotypical fantasy Africa.The problem is that when you don't know how a culture is in reality, it's hard to tell when the culture is being lampooned.

It treaded on the line between funny and silly, between good and bad. This one crossed the line. It wasn't especially bad, but I can't call it good. Most of the good jokes are recycled from ACE VENTURE PET DETECTIVE. All that's left within ACE VENTURA WHEN NATURE CALLS are stupid gags. (This proves my theory that sequels that are made the very next year of the movie are never as good, aside from SCREAM 2.)Ace Ventura, (Jim Carrey) after accidentally letting an animal die in one of his cases, has gone into self-imposed exile. But he returns to the pet cases at the request of Fulton Greenwall (Ian McNeice) to save a sacred bat. The wealthy Vincent Cadby (Simon Callow) has paid Ventura to save the bat before two African tribes go to war over it.Jim Carrey is his usual overacting self in this movie, but it's more annoying this time. This is the stage of his career I really didn't care for. This movie is still not as bad as DUMB & DUMBER, though, but the jokes are either old from the first movie or stupid. Ian McNeice and Simon Callow do an OK job, but their characters are not interesting because of bad plot and acting. The absence of Courtney Cox is probably the worst part of the movie.My final analyses...don't bother with this movie unless you are a Jim Carrey fan.

It has plenty of great moments such as the Secret Agent Man montage, the bit with the Monopoly Guy, and of course, the Rhino scene. It's all good stuff. However, it's just not as good as the original. Now it's not this movie's fault, there are only a few sequels that surpass their predecessor. So why is this not as good as Pet Detective? In the first one, yes Carrey, was over the top and goofy. I went over that in my Pet Detective review. But it still seemed real. Every time Ace is searching for clues, hunting down his suspects, or just saving a dog from a dog-napper; it all feels real and grounded in reality. Need some examples? When Ace tells Melissa about his dream. Now granted it was a joke that Ace was playing on her, yet he didn't feel all that cartoony. How about when Ace goes into Ray Finkle's room. Nothing cartoony about that scene. Funny? Yes. Cartoony? No. Now we'll switch over to When Nature Calls. This movie does not seem to be set in a real realm at all. I mean come on, there's a monster truck parked outside of the... dang it. I can't remember what that building was. Was it the British Embassy or something. I can't remember. Any way, you know what I'm talking about. Another thing, Carrey is just non stop in this. I mean ,for lack of a better word, he was very cartoony. More so than the last one. In fact this movie felt more sophomoric than the first movie. And I don't mean sophomoric as in a second film. I mean just plain juvenile humor. Don't get me wrong. It's funny. Like my title says Another funny Carrey movie. It's better than Bruce Almighty and The Number 23. I know, one of those is not a comedy, but I don't care. When I give reviews I try to break every thing down. And this is the result. Comparing it to other movies. So if you look at the movie by itself, it's good. It's funny and I would highly recommend it to any Jim Carrey fans, fans of slapstick, or just comedy fans looking for some laughs. On a side note I don't know if I spelled cartoony right. It wasn't in the dictionary and it's just one of those words you don't see often. It feels like there sured be an e between the n and the y. So don't condemn my review based on my spelling of the word cartoony.

Oh how I regretted that as I watched When Nature Calls. Jim does his best to make the movie funny and he almost succeeded. He uses his rubber face at comic timing to the full extent and almost pulls off another cute, silly, fun movie. But the script seems to be working against Jim throughout the entire movie. Ace was such a funny character in the first movie because he was so out of place living in the city. But this new movie puts Ace in the jungle right where he belongs. Ace looks more in place picking nits off of monkeys that he ever did driving a car. Ace does everything you would expect from the first one but this time there is nobody standing in the background looking appalled. Courteney Cox, who was very funny at trying to get Ace to act human has been replaced by an African Princess who seems to accept Ace for who he is. That is not to say that the film doesn't have its moments. The temple stairs and the Slinky scene is still one of Jim Carrey's better scenes from all of his movies.

Many of the team members have given up the search, except for one Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! He soon finds the raccoon on the mountain across from his. He climbs across to it, straps the raccoon to him and starts back when suddenly the strap breaks and the poor raccoon falls to his death. Ace was devastated. A man, Fulton Greenwall, was seeking out Ace Ventura. He found him living in a Buddhist monk temple. He came to them a broken man and had finally found inner peace. Greenwall explained the situation so Ace a sacred animal of the African Wachati tribe had been stolen. Ace said he could not leave the temple, however there was $20,000 in it for him and plus the monks encourage him to go. They throw a giant party when he leaves. While on the plane to Africa, Greenwall explains the entire story the Wachati princess is set to wed, however the rival Wachootoo tribe is against this and unless the sacred animal is returned within four days, the tribes go to war. Ace wasn't paying attention as Greenwall spoke. They soon arrive in Africa and in a Jeep driven by Ace, they head to the consulate. Ace takes a bulky short cut, but they soon tumble to their destination.         Once at the consulate, Ace meets Vincent Cadby and Burton Quinn who had a raven, Tinky, on his shoulders. Ace mingles with folks but ends up making a fool out of himself. He and Greenwall then travel to the Wachati village. Along the way, Ace finally learns what sacred animal he was chasing after a Great White bat. The bat was the only animal which Ace detested, but he wouldn't give up his case. When Ace meets the chief, he learns that launching loogies is a show of affection. That evening, Ace attends a seductive dance the Wachati princess performs, even though she is spoken for. While the tribe and Greenwall dance, Ace investigates the sacred hut and finds a black feather beneath the cage. The princess and Ace chat. She says she wasn't really looking forward to her wedding.  Well, the next day, Ace reluctantly investigates a bat cave and finds another black feather so he suspects Quinn. He spies on him inside a mechanical rhino, but what Ace didn't count on is that it can get pretty hot in one of those things and the door wouldn't open. Ace soon finds a most unpleasant way out. He then interrogates Quinn who turns  out innocent. When Ace explores the jungles, he's hit with several poison darts from the Wachootoo tribe so he sneaks into their village. He's caught. They tell him that he must pass several Wachootoo tests to live. He passes all but one pit of death. His opponent was a tough one. But since Ace's fighting made the tribe laugh, they didn't kill him.             Ace next stumbles upon a group of poachers Mick Katie and Gahjii who had the Great White bat in their posession! They capture Ace and tie him to a raft on the river that goes down a waterfall. When Ace surfaces, he wrestles a crocodile. When returning to the Wachati village, Ace was confused. What was it the kidnappers were after? And then it hit him Guano, (bat droppings). Ace returns the consulate. Mick and Gahjii were just handing the bat to Cadby when Ace burst in and solved the case right then and there. Ace then calls on his jungle animal friends and soon heards of elephants, lions, zebras, antilope, etc. come crashing in. Ace takes care of Mick and Gahjii with a skunk. Cadby escapes but Ace gives chase in a big-foot truck. By then, the Wachati and the Wachootoo tribes were getting ready for battle. That's when Ace successfully grabbed the bat and returned it to the sacred hut. Cadby escaped into the jungle but was soon caught by a silver-back gorilla, and it was mating season! Soon the wedding of the Wachati princess was on, only they made the detection that she was no longer a virgin. Suddenly Ace found himself being chased into the jungle by both tribes.        Well, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls wasn't really as good as the first. The first was much better. Jim Carrey reprises his role as the world's craziest animal detective. I wonder if there will ever be an Ace Ventura III. I doubt it. It seems as if Jim Carrey is getting more and more into serious films, but fear not, Carrey fans, I hear Jim will be making a return to comedy this spring in Bruce Almighty. Until then, we can enjoy his other physical comedy films, such as Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. Not as good as the original and is packed with crude humor but Ace Ventura fans as well as Jim Carrey fans, it comes recommended by me!- "},{"Title":"Alot of recycled jokes but still kinda good","Date":"27 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  SPOILERSBest bit has to be Ace standing all over the sacred ground whilst the chief spoke to the interpreter.

I don't mind him too much and can put up with his silly faces and noises in moderation but I guess he gets on some peoples nerves. I originally saw this at the cinema in 1995 with my girlfriend and she continually told me that she was fed up with Jim Carrey's noises.When I was at school many many years ago, there was some kid who was always making funny noises and messing around in the playground. Some kids (such as myself) couldn't get enough of him whilst others stayed as far away as possible. You either love them or hate them.Back to the film. I don't think the story was as exciting as the original but it was good enough and did have some funny scenes in it although I would have liked to see a bit more of beautiful Africa in it. There is a good cast here and Carrey does seem to have chemistry with them.All in all, a ridiculous but enjoyable movie which can be enjoyed if you are in the right mood and can put up with Carrey's pranks.

I absolutely adore them. And even though I was advised to avoid the Ace Ventura Pet Detective movie after I enjoyed The Mask so much upon its release because it would supposedly ruin (my) impression of Jim Carrey, I decided to check it out anyway simply because the basic premise of a cartoonish goofball who genuinely cares about animals appealed to me a lot.(To give you an idea concerning my affection for animals even though I understand the opening of this movie as a fiercely clever satire of Cliffhanger, nevertheless I couldn't help but feel terribly upset and disappointed at watching an all-too-realistic scene involving that poor raccoon falling to his death.)I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the first Ace Ventura film, because it made me laugh hysterically despite a couple of off-colour gags--until I reached the whole last act involving the nature of the villain, and then I almost lost my stomach at a certain shot concerning the appearance of a certain character's underwear upon their being turned around for the camera as evidence. The ending killed it for me.I expected this film to be worse. Much worse. Instead, I ended up enjoying it much better than the first one! Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I knew I would be safe from the same ending the first one had, I don't know... but I rented it out of curiosity and ended up laughing myself silly.Warning possible spoilers ahead.One of the things that made Carrey's performance in both movies so appealing to me--aside from the simple fact that Carrey is playing them--is that he is a genuinely likeable character. He's a nutcase, sure, but he's also likeable in how he tries so hard to cheerfully help out the situations he's hired for. By example, let me point back to the previously-mentioned raccoon scene--part of the reason why it works so well is not just because the victimized raccoon is so cute (I know they can be vicious in real life, but never mind), but also because Ace's heart is so much in the right place. I was actually really rooting for him to save that raccoon and was so sure that he WOULD get it right that I was actually shocked and upset when he didn't. Deep down under all the nuttiness, you just KNOW how much he cares and wanted to get that rescue right, as opposed to Eddie Murphy's recent sarcastic and thoroughly unlikable variation of Dr. Dolittle who simply acts as though he just puts up with his talent instead of genuinely caring about it. Carrey plays Ace as a wildly optimistic guy who basically loves his work, and that makes it all the more fun for me.Oh, and without giving anything away I also want to mention that this movie has the most hysterical gag about wearing stoles that I've ever seen committed to film which is both hilarious and makes it's point at the same time!There were maybe three gags or so that made me feel uneasy, ones that I had prepared myself for by reading about them here on IMDb first, but they turned out to be far less obnoxiously done than I had been led to believe. I wouldn't show those scenes to my young nephews, but still they could have been much worse. Somehow, even the weirdest gag that I didn't like ended up not completely turning me off from the film as a whole. That gag involved instant assistance to a pregnant woman. While my brow furrowed at it and I thought, That wasn't necessary at all, the attitude behind it is still miles away from other modern comedies which tend to be flat out cruel. Compare this bit to a semi-similar scene in what's easily the worst comedy done so far, Freddie Got Fingered Tom Green bites a baby's umbilical cord with his teeth and then swings it around, spraying blood all over everyone to the horror of all present. Carrey, on the other hand, gets the baby shot up healthily right into the arms of the father, who smiles gratefully and is obviously pleased. There's all the difference in the world here simply due to attitude.What I'm saying is that this film is much easier to stomach during such moments because it doesn't have the emotion of Isn't this so obnoxiously in-your-face that it shows disrespect for you as the viewer??? behind it. I didn't care for the birthing scene, but Carrey clearly believes he did it in the tradition of cartoon silliness as opposed to the current shock-and-make-everyone-mad-at-you routine.In other words, Carrey knows he's likeable. He doesn't NEED to act enraged at the world. He's confident in knowing that his happy-go-lucky performances are his main appeal in his comedies. And that makes this film far lighter even during its few gross moments in my book. That said though, I don't defend all he's done--I hated Dumb and Dumber and thought it was repulsive, had a lousy script and was simply below his level.Give it a try, and see what your final verdict is. You just might end up feeling pretty cheerful afterwards!

The sequel, however, lacks whatever mysterious ingredient it was that made the first one such a treat.  So much so that a wan smile is often the best you can come up with when you really feel like the makers wanted you to be holding your sides.   Perhaps it's down to over-familiarity with the character, but I doubt that's it.  The old Ace was always wacky enough so that you never knew what was coming next unless you'd seen the film.  The same is true here I suppose, but most times the punchline is really weak, and definitely not worth waiting for.  I think there is more material in Ace, but I doubt that we'll ever see it unless they bring in a new actor.  Jim is above playing this kind of slapstick goon now.   A more accurate reason for the dip in quality between films would have to be laziness.  This is basically just your staple 'fish-out-of-water' comedy with the same tired old jokes, but revolving around the ingenious central character.  Unfortunately, even HE can't resuscitate ideas that have been dead for so long.  It shows that the film is uninspired because it was knocked out little over a year after the original.  After the phenomenal success of the first, the producers must've just seen dollar signs.  It's a shame.

While at the monastery, he is visited by an African missionary who seeks his assistance in recovering the legendary sacred animal, Skikaka (a white bat), whose loss threatens to cause tensions to spill over between two warring African tribes. Steve Oedekerk (Kung Pow, Barnyard), project consultant on Ace Ventura Pet Detective, borrows a page from the Ernest movies by putting his obstinate and annoying character in a completely unique setting for more of the same rude hijinks and physical humor in this sequel. The result is a more visually inventive yet even more juvenile effort (hard to imagine), which once again allows the star comedian to cut completely loose with the material for some choice sight gags and sporadically funny crude humor.When Nature Calls continues the tradition of the first film in terms of its level of humor (namely, aiming pretty low), but the main character is a little more proactive in trying to annoy the rest of the characters in the film, holding absolutely nothing sacred, save for his precious animals. The result is a fitfully funny comedy that does contain a few clever moments of fun, but your mileage will certainly vary when it comes to a very over-the-top assault on your funny bone in a very crude fashion. It's the kind of movie where once you start laughing, you might become too giddy to stop -- or if you find yourself not laughing, the film will only continue to press your buttons to the point of annoyance.I think that younger viewers will tend to enjoy When Nature Calls more so than adults, as the gags are more slapstick-y and broad than they had been in the first effort. However, for those who liked the cameo appearances and detective storyline from the first film, there's less to identity with in this sequel save for the personality of the main character, whose famous catchphrases and one-dimensional delivery become redundant very quickly. Carrey is still a marvel, and Oedekerk often quite inventive, but in the end it just doesn't work out.For Carrey Fans only and no one else.

The humor in the first one was at times crude, but mostly civil(nothing you felt really crossed the line, in my opinion). In this one, it's flat-out disgusting; it's very, very crude, mostly has to do with bodily fluids, and there's too many sex jokes for my tastes(and bad ones at that). The film really has very little to offer for anybody but the biggest of Carrey fans(I am a big fan of him myself, and I found this film hard to sit through). Another problem is that it borrows too much material from the first; every good joke is copied directly from the first(several lines are exactly the same), and the movie tries too hard to make you laugh at things that aren't actually funny. I also found the disrespect and mocking towards the tribes fairly insulting; while they may not be civilized, these people are hardly lesser humans, as this film makes them out to be. Another thing I despised was the way they changed Carrey's character to the worse; in the first, he was eccentric, mildly annoying, but mostly funny, and somewhat smart, actually. In this one, he's just annoying, arrogant, childish and, well, completely pathetic. We're supposed to laugh at this character, but how can we possibly laugh when he's so utterly annoying? He was somewhat immature in the first, but here, he's like a spoiled brat. It really seemed like the director didn't get the point of the first film at all; Ace Ventura isn't funny because he's a pathetic loser; he's funny because he's eccentric yet smart, and he somehow manages to be appealing, though he is like a grown child. It's like Oedekerk just took all of the lesser points of the first film, magnified them, put in some of the good, and released it. The plot is less interesting than the first, the mystery is less involving, as both are obviously pushed into the background to allow for the humor instead. I also thought that the humor seemed far too forced and overdone; not one single joke was minor or a detail. No, you have to show something completely ridiculous, and hope the audience finds it funny. One thing that I also have to mention is the special effects; they are truly horrible. I know that it shouldn't matter in a comedy, but come on, every single effect looked so fake. And who's decision was it to make that damn little ape appear in every other scene? It's not like it had a major part in the first movie, after all. It had as little a role in the first as any of the other animals. If they were going to bring back characters from the first, why not bring back some of the ones that work well with Carrey and his character; like Emilio, or Woodstock, or even Melissa. They were actually entertaining, unlike the supporting cast of this film. All in all, a very average film, and not really worthy as a sequel to the much better first film.

Not that I've re-watched Ace Ventura When Nature Calls again I can see why they stopped with the series after this one. (I'm not really counting in the upcoming movie Ace Ventura Jr Pet Detective, since it obviously features a different main character.) Well, it was not like its predecessor Ace Ventura Pet Detective was brilliant but it showed some good potential for more. This potential gets basically all ruined and wasted within this movie.Thing I simply hated about this movie was its absolutely dreadful script. It's such an incredible childish and simple written script, that features nothing original, nothing surprising and very little funny actually. Most, if not all the fun from this movie comes from Jim Carrey's performance. It's an annoying story, that is set too much at the same locations. All of the other characters within this movie also just don't work out, due to its very poor story and writing in general.The movie is supposedly for most part set in Africa but its obvious that not one step get set on African ground during the production of this movie. It's obvious studio work and the movie for some parts got shot in wild life park(s), I would imaging. It gives the movie a cheap look and feeling as well, even though of course this wasn't a low-budget production.Yet, still it's a movie that will make you laugh. Jim Carrey is totally crazy as Ace Ventura and he's actually more hilarious in this role than he has been in any recent movie of his. The first Ace Ventura movie launched him to stardom, which allows him to in this movie go even more over-the-top with his character. It provides the movie with some great laughs, due to sheer stupidity. Yes, the movie and its comedy is at times so stupid that you can't help but laugh.So, watch this movie a get a few laughs from Carrey's performance. Otherwise, you can easily do without ever watching this movie.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"A guilty pleasure","Date":"26 January 2003","Score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  By no means is this a great comedy, but it does at least have the guts to accept no concessions to good taste in pursuit of a laugh. You get the impression the studio simply let Jim Carrey out of his cage and told him to do pretty much whatever he wanted with his Ace Ventura character. He is basically about 90% of what makes this movie work, with the remaining 10% split about equally between Ian McNeice as the guide/interpreter and the monkey, who makes a surprisingly good `sidekick' for Ace.This is, quite simply, a case of Carrey playing yet another utterly manic, yet basically loveable, goofball character, and you either go for it or you don't. Those who like their comedy built on subtlety, wit, and sophistication will pretty much hate this movie, the rest of us just go along for the ride, watching Carrey mug for the camera with unrestrained abandon. A lot of the comic material is iffy, and without Carrey, this movie would have been a real stinker, but thanks to him we get a number of scenes that are simply priceless; whether he's hiding out in a Buddhist monastery sitting in meditation with a gloriously goofy grin on his face while bugs flutter around his head, driving through the jungle at insane speeds while singing the `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' song, prancing about the posh headquarters building in front of assorted dignitaries making a complete ass out of himself or going berserk when he finds out the sacred animal he's been hired to find is a bat, the ONE creature he absolutely fears and loathes. Let's face it, when it comes to doing outrageous physical comedy (especially involving over the top facial expressions and body gestures) and, in general, behaving like a complete lunatic, Carrey is in a class by himself, and he turns what would otherwise be a lame piece of junk into what could be described as a great `bad' movie, a true guilty pleasure.6/10PS The DVD version, while conveniently offering up both the full and wide screen versions, contains a pretty paltry collection of extra features, meaning people who enjoy stuff like audio commentaries and deleted scenes will definitely be disappointed.

It's a fun sequel that is much larger in scale and budget than the first one, we get to see Ace Ventura head off on an even bigger adventure this time around that takes place in some very expensive looking locations that show that the studio put some big money in to this movie, but the actors and director still get the creative freedom to make the movie they wanted thankfully. It's certainly a disappointment in comparison to the original Ace Ventura, it's not as entertaining and wacky as the first, and there aren't as many memorable moments, I also would have liked to have seen other characters other than just Ace return, particularly Courteney Cox's character would have been a welcome return. The highlight of the movie is of course Jim Carrey, it is always a delight to watch him on screen, here he is given loads of free time to run around and improvise, and the best scenes of the movie are actually the parts that have nothing to do with the actual plot, they're just Carrey being the legendary funny man he always is. Though it's certainly more forgetful than the original, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls is still a fun ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Ace Ventura (no relation to Jessie Ventura) is inside a mechanical Rhino, spying on crooks, when his ventilation system fails, and even disrobing doesn't give him relief. So he works his way through a small hole below the Rhino's tail about the same time a group of parents and their children drive up to observe this very strange birth as the naked character falls to the ground, in a fetal position.But only about 1/4 to 1/3 of the gags worked for me, the rest were just plain dumb. The scene where Ace and the Tribesmen spit loogies in each others' faces to show approval was just plain gross.Jim Carrey is back as Ace Ventura, this time hired to recover a white bat (the kind that lives in caves) to save a tribe from extinction. The bright spot in all this is pretty Brit Sophie Okonedo as The Wachati Princess.Another very funny scene is when Ace gets shot with darts and as he runs through the forest to escape his attackers, the tranquilizing effect of the darts slowly takes effect, and he has to move forward with half-paralyzed legs and arms that hang as on a rag doll.Carrey truly is creative with his physical comedy, and I really like the way he does the exaggerated John Wayne swagger with his head weaving back and forth.

The second movie is still funny with some really good scenes (I am thinking of the great scene where Jim Carrey comes out of the special robotic rhino that he was hiding in to watch the bad guys without being seen) but it never is as funny or as consistent as the first/original Ace Ventura.Definitely worth seeing but don't expect the same laughs from the first movie.

Though that is not to say that this film is good, for me it isn't. The film does look good, it was interesting to see the likes of Simon Callow and he especially does bring some dignity and like in the first Jim Carrey does a fine job carrying the film. However the plot is very predictable and flimsy, and the direction lacks the energy and imagination of that of the first. The film also could have done with being longer consequently some of the characters lacked credibility. Also the pace is not as snappy and smart, when the humour fell flat(like it did one too many times) it felt like a balloon had been popped. The slapstick is very juvenile here, while the script is more childish than sophisticated and for me that was a bad idea. Overall, disappointing but thanks to Carrey it is at least watchable if nothing to go wild about. 4/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Not original, but still funny","Date":"2 July 2000","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  When I saw thsi movie, I knew it had as much originality as Weird Al Yankovic's parodies.  But luike Yankovic's paroides, this was funny.  Jim Carrey brings out the Ace Ventura like no one else can (possibly because no one else wants to do an impression from they're butt).  Humor comes in heavy doses, like the first one, and I laughed at a lot of it.  But it's just that this one seemed done before, and not as good as the first.  Still though, for Carrey fans (or for people looking for a laugh), this film is for you.

The movie gets off to a good start with a spoof on CLIFFHANGER and the following scenes aren`t a million miles removed from RAMBO 3 , and as the action moves to darkest Africa OZ fans will notice the chap who plays Simon Adebisi , ( I can`t be bothered to spell his name ) , alas when the action moves to Africa the problems with this movie also begin with the plot featuring Ace looking for a rare bat becoming more and more obscure with Carrey`s slapstick mannerisms coming more to the fore . I`ve never been a slapstick fan and I find even Mr Laural and Mr Hardy can be hit and miss ( And believe me Carrey doesn`t belong in the same sentence as that legendary duo ) so the more the movie went on the more I found myself disliking it , and by the end credits I absolutely hated ACE VENTURA WHEN NATURE CALLS For Carrey fans only  "},{"Title":"Ace Ventura When Nature Calls","Date":"9 March 2005","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" This is the interesting sequel to Ace Ventura Pet Detective. We see Jim Carrey return with a weird second film. He is hilarious, but there are some tiny moments where he's a bit annoying. But apart from those moments, this is a good comedy. A praised animal has been stolen from an African tribe. It is Ace's job to find it. The only problem is he's afraid of it. The only animal Ace does not like is a bat. But he must put his fear behind him in order to find it. With appearances from Simon Callow and wonderful gags, this is a good sequel. My favourite part was when he wore a man on his shoulders to teach a fox wearing woman a lesson. Worth watching! "}]
