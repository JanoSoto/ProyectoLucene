[{"Title":"Cate Blanchett Displays Her Own Gifts","Date":"9 September 2001","Score":"94 out of 106 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  In a small town deep in the South, a single mother endowed with a special ability becomes involved with the disappearance of a young woman and has a brush with the supernatural, in `The Gift,' directed by Sam Raimi.  Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow attempting to raise her three kids and provide a decent life for her family, scraping out a living on Social Security since the tragic death of her husband in a work related accident the previous year.  She supplements her meager income by doing `readings' for the local townsfolk, accepting their donations for the insights she offers them into their own lives.  Annie has a `gift,' the ability to see certain things in the cards that enables her to advise her clients about personal issues.  It's something she can't explain; she knows only that it's inherited (which she learned from her grandmother), and that it's real.  And though it's helped her maintain her home, she soon finds that it doesn't always make for the most pleasant of situations, as when she must advise a young woman, Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank), on how to cope with her abusive husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), or attempt to help a troubled young man, Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) come to terms with some sensitive aspects of his life.  Then, when a client comes to her to ask for help when his daughter disappears, not only does it take her to the dark side of the human experience, she discovers that certain individuals, including local sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) do not believe that her `gift' is real.Stylistically crafted and delivered, Raimi's film will keep you engrossed and on the edge of your seat until the very end.  He successfully blends reality with just a touch of the supernatural that makes for riveting suspense while keeping it within the realm of believability.  The relationship played out between Donnie and Valerie is anything but unique-- you've seen this before, many times in many films-- but within the context of this story it's fresh and it works.  The doubtful sheriff and the cynical, jaded defense attorney, Gerald Weems (Michael Jeter), are fairly stereotypical, but that can be easily overlooked in light of the overall story and especially due to the credibility of the Annie character, which is well developed and never presented as anything beyond what can be readily accepted as true to life.  As the central character, Annie anchors the film and enables the circumstances in which she is involved to be perceived as real; it's the strength of the film, and it's what makes it all work so well.What also makes it work is the strong performance by Cate Blanchett, who makes Annie so real and accessible, displaying her `gift' with restraint and avoiding the possible pitfall of taking it too far over the edge, which could easily have made it suspect.  Instead, she brings a depth to the character that draws you into her world and allows you to empathize with her, which would have been impossible had she invested Annie with even a touch of the charlatan.  With consummate skill, Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor, she definitely has a very real `gift' of her own.Ribisi also does a memorable turn as Buddy, with a striking performance in which he creates some disturbing moments that are almost painful to watch; his is a character study of a soul in distress, seeking solace and resolution, and even as he attempts to sort out his life, you are able to sympathize with his plight as you share Buddy's experiences.  And it's through Buddy (as well as Annie, of course), that the audience is able to make that necessary and very real connection with the film.  With films like `Saving Private Ryan' and now this one, Ribisi is on his way to establishing himself as one of the premiere character actors in the business today.Playing somewhat against type, Reeves proves that he can be a good `bad' guy, giving possibly one of his best performances ever as Donnie.  He very credibly conveys that sense of explosiveness lying just beneath the surface that makes his character menacing and dark, which in turn makes Donnie psychologically as well as physically threatening.  It's a good job by Reeves, who deserves credit for taking on a role that is so disagreeable and insensitive.The supporting cast includes Greg Kinnear (Wayne), Katie Holmes (Jessica), Kim Dickens (Linda), Gary Cole (David) and Rosemary Harris (Annie's Granny). A taut thriller that is emotionally involving, `The Gift' delivers what it promises early on, which is exceptional, as many films of this nature often fail to actually follow through after a tremendous opening act.  Rest assured, this one does and has it all; suspense, credibility and some memorable moments, all courtesy of Raimi, a good story and a superb cast. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

She is asked by the police to aid in the search of a missing person and what follows, is a journey  into the supernatural.  Sam Raimi knows how to set up a scene for the maximum scare potential.  Honed on  his Evil Dead series, Raimi lets a scene begin slowly and allows the viewer to sense the dread and feel the  suspense build.  There are visual tricks, interesting camera techniques and the fine performances by a very  talented cast that propel this story forward.  Among this cast that really stands out is Keanu Reeves.   People have always complained that Reeves brings down a movie.  At least some of the people I know.  I  prefer to think that Reeves is an underrated actor.  In the role of Donny Barksdale, Reeves brings a certain  menace to his character that usually isn't scene in his other roles.  Barksdale isn't a creature of the night,  or a space alien, but a flesh and blood creature that is capable of true evil.  When you watch him, look at his  eyes and you'll see a true menace lurking behind those dark brown eyes.  Cate Blanchett shows that she can  master just about any accent that's out there.  She sounds like she's a native of the south and she has a  quiet courage about her.  Most notable when she's squaring off against Reeves.  All in all, The Gift is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller.  It has brains and doesn't insult the viewers.  It  will keep you hooked up until the very end, and there are quite a few surprises throughout the film.  Highly  entertaining, and very spooky at times.

The film's main strengths are its screenplay, its beautiful mise-en-scene, a strong ensemble cast and a haunting soundtrack (those of you who enjoyed 'The Shipping News' will recognise the composer from the lilting score of that film)But perhaps 'The Gift's' main attribute is the presence of the wonderful Cate Blanchett. Although I loved the film, I was forced to wonder if in the hands of a less capable actress, whether it would have had the same captivating power. Somehow I think not. Cate Blanchett's restrained portrayal of Annie exudes compassion and tenderness, and is integral to the success of the film as a whole. Her sensitivity as an actress is important in relation to the subject matter - ESP and the occult - as these areas generally attract much scepticism. Blanchett, through her unique skill as an actress, manages to make the more fantastical elements of the story not only plausible, but intensely moving. She is luminous to watch, reminding me of the (also magnificent) Meryl Streep in terms of her quiet beauty, her range of expression and her adept skill at accent mimicry. Who could believe that she is Australian?In short, 'The Gift' is well worth seeing, primarily for Cate Blanchett, but also for the supporting actors Keanu Reeves (very impressive and effective) Hilary Swank (underused) and the magnificent Giovanni Ribisi - who is both explosive and reticent as Buddy Cole. Also demanding attention is the imaginative screenplay, and the hauting beauty of the mise-en-scene which manages to be both beautiful and eerie at the same time. Overall, 'The Gift' is a resounding success, due mainly to the heart of the film - Cate Blanchett's resonant performance. The actress has a unique gift herself, which richly deserves to be seen by many.

His story with Evil Dead is one that tells us that if you really believe in what you are doing and have an undeniable passion for it, you can succeed with an indie.  Evil Dead was that film for Raimi.  Now that he has bigger budgets and better casts, one could expect him to fail, but with terrific films like A Simple Plan and now this one, he proves that he does possess a gift as a film maker.  The Gift takes him back to his roots as a horror director and he doesn't disappoint.  The Gift is a tight, tense film with some questionable weakly written court room scenes, but take that away and you have a very effective thriller.The Gift has an all star ensemble cast that takes everything they are given and shines with it.  Cate Blanchet is awesome to watch as the small town clairvoyant that some people look upon with utter reverance and others disregard as nothing more than a Satan worshipper.  Keanu Reeves is very effective as a wife abusing husband and Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi and Gary Cole are all very good in their roles. I especially liked Reeves as the wicked wife beater.  I grew to hate his character and not just because he was a wife beater, but because he was such a smug, I'm above the law wife beater.  I like seeing the smaller and perhaps more challenging roles Reeves is taking in between his billion dollar turn as Neo.When a local town aristocratic beauty disappears, all fingers point towards Reeves as the murderer.  He was having an affair with the girl, he has a violent temper, and he has scratch marks all over him from her and most importantly she was found dead in his swamp on his property.  That is pretty compelling evidence against him.  Also, Annie, the clairvoyant had visions about her whereabouts being located on his property.  But soon after his impending incarceration, Annie begins to have other thoughts.  She thinks the wrong man has been put away and now she fears that the real killer is going to come after her.What The Gift benefits from, besides great performances, is tight direction. Raimi shows us here why it is that he got his start as a horror director. There are at least half a dozen scenes that are tense and frightening. When Annie is having her visions of death and sees dead women in trees and in bathtubs and such, there are collective gasps of fear in the audience. And when she is visited by ghosts or visions of people, you feel the heart race a little faster.  This is not to say that the film is flawless because it's not.  The flaws come from the writing of the court case where there is so much heresay and such that any good lawyer would have jumped all over the defense's case.  When a man is being tried for murder and your defense is questioning how you came to know where the body was, they are two different issues.  Why does it matter if an elephant told you where the body was or if you happened to fish it out of the pond with a crane.  The point is that the body was there and it was on the accused's property and the accused had scratch marks on his arm from the deceased.  That in my book is a pretty simple case.  I was disappointed with how Thorton wrote the court room scenes but that is about all I was disappointed with.The Gift is not one of the best horror films I've ever seen, but it is an enjoyable one and if I had to compare it to another similar one to it, I would have to say that this was better than What Lies Beneath.  I think Zemekis is a great director but Raimi just has that certain intangible quality about him.  He can make suspense out of something when perhaps there is none there.  This is worth seeing and if you are a horror fan or just like a few thrills in your film, this'll keep you entertained.8 out of 10- a good creepy horror film with a few genuine scares and a plethora of great performances.

I saw her in this movie, and I became baffled as to why she wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.  She carries this film on her shoulders, and never once budges.  Not only does she totally get rid of her Australian accent and perfectly don a Southern accent, but she gives a deep, powerful performance as the innocent widow, Annie Wilson, who is looked down by many in her community but simply wants to share her psychic gifts with her willing clients.  Blanchett communicates great emotion with a simple facial expression.Of course, I also have to give it up for the multi-talented supporting cast. Though most of them, with the exception of Hilary Swank, couldn't really nail down the Southern accent, they are absolutely terrific.  The only actor I felt was miscast was Katie Holmes.  Not only is her accent phony and over-the-top, but she just seems too young and innocent for the role. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, is a revelation.  I knew, ever since his breakthrough performance in Suburbia, that he had great promise as an up-and-coming actor, but in The Gift he delivers his most powerful performance up-to-date.  I would even argue that he deserved an Oscar nod. He constantly stirs up sympathy in his audience, despite his mental instability and momentary outbursts of anger.  I was also extremely impressed with Keanu Reeves, who delivers a genuinely haunting performance. It's times like this where I just can't fathom why many people still insist on picking on Keanu, regarding him as dull and cardboard.  Personally, I thought he was great ever since his emotional performance in Permanent Record.  But he better demonstrates his versatility as an actor as the abusive Donny.  He made his debut, as a villain, in the throwaway thriller The Watcher, but I found him much more haunting in this role.  Plus, he sports a rugged look, totally shedding his pretty-boy image.  Greg Kinnear is good and subtle, and Hilary Swank continues to flaunt her brilliant acting abilities as the vulnerable wife of Donny who constantly takes beatings from him, yet still maintains her love for him.The story is very intriguing, revolving around a cast of colorful characters.  This isn't a scary movie as it somewhat looks in the previews, but it is full of mystery and thrills, without cheaply going for shock value.  There is a nifty twist at the end, which is credible and not thrown from left field, but the plot isn't packed with surprises.  We're simply going along on an emotional journey, through the mind of our protagonist, Annie, and that's how the tension is created.  Sam Raimi creates a haunting mood and Billy Bob Thornton wrote a fine script.  The story is easy-to-follow, and not as mind-bending as some of these other supernatural thrillers.  Just keep in mind that this is not a horror movie. But it's a good mystery and a good mood piece and a damn good film altogether.My score  7 (out of 10)      "},{"Title":"A smart and atmospheric movie.","Date":"4 November 2001","Score":"35 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  THE GIFT (2000) Rating 8/10The Gift is one of the most intriguing suspense movies I've seen in a while. I'll admit the movie is pretty slow in its beginning, but when it starts to get to the murder information and readings, this movie picks up speed and brilliance. I did notice the film was generally slow to develop its characters a bit more, but I did find it a tad boring at the start. Sam Raimi is an amazingly focused director. With this movie, he betters his last effort For Love of the Game by a long shot. He makes the movie very atmospheric and the movie succeeds in its eeriness and excellence thanks to him. What really makes The Gift as spine-tingingly great as it, however, is the ensemble cast and their performances. Cate Blanchett leads the way with a brilliant performance. She literally becomes her character and works well in this thriller. They couldn't have cast her better. Giovanni Ribisi is highly believable in this film, his character is a sad one and we feel sympathy for him. Keanu Reeves displays a great performance as the wife-bashing freaky guy. His scenes are some of the most powerful ones and Keanu has rarely been better. Supporting performances from the sexy Katie Holmes, the highly talented Greg Kinnear and the masterful Hilary Swank all satisfy. This film is a highly original one, and the story will stick with you long after the credits roll. The script is one of the most engrossing and surprisingly heartfelt horror scripts to be written in a long time. Watch this movie at night with the lights off, a bag of chips and get ready for a chilling and interesting ride that will make you shake in your boots and your brain work overtime.

To the actors' credit, the characters as portrayed are three-dimensional and believable, for the most part.  Unfortunately, several loose ends and unlikely occurrences hamstring the film.  Cate Blanchett's character, whom we are to believe is a strong and independent woman fiercely protective of her children, fails to contact the authorities after twice being assaulted by Keanu Reeves, once with a multitude of witnesses.  When she finally does call the police, she fails to bring up the attacks in support of her charges of breaking and entering.  In fact, during the entire trial of Barksdale the issue never arises. The plot twist is also unfortunately predictable.  I suppose this is a case of pandering to the lowest common denominator of filmgoers; how many movies are there based on the premise you thought he was the good guy--but he's really the bad guy! Finally, has it occurred to anyone that when Greg Kinnear goes off to the big house, Donnie will probably be released?  And that he probably isn't going to be too happy with Blanchett (now without her protector, Ribisi)? This is a loose end that really ought to have been tied up.

The main role went to Cate Blanchett as a psychic and a widow raising three boys. She did a marvelous job and was never less than fully convincing in the part. Giovanni Ribisi played a troubled young man, with some sort of psychosis, whom Cate helps. Early in the film, I realized that he was something like Robert Duvall in To Kill A Mockingbird and that he'd play a key role in Cate's life. Ribisi did a great job too. Keanu Reeves played a violent wife-beating redneck who hates Cate for counseling his wife (Hilary Swank). Greg Kinnear was well cast as a teacher, engaged to a slutty woman played well by Katie Holmes.So, all around, the director has to be commended for bringing out good acting. The acting is a 7. The story is more a 6.The story is on the slow side. It takes its time getting to the plot twists, but the acting manages to keep you engaged. Then the mystery takes over. The supernatural element is kept within bounds of reason for most of the movie, perhaps a bit too detailed in her visions. Cate has visions and she sees things as if real. I don't doubt that this happens to people in a waking state or a dream-like waking state, and I don't doubt that they observe cues and process them intuitively.Katie Holmes is murdered, and the question becomes who did it? There are several suspects, because she had several lovers. Suspicion falls on Keanu Reeves and he is tried for the crime. Cate is dissatisfied with the outcome. This leads her into considerable danger. It makes for a good thriller.The supernatural element becomes more prominent at the end, although with effort one can devise explanations devoid of it. However, I think the movie's intent is indeed that Cate has a gift and to follow through on that in this genre that allows the extraordinary to happen as part of the story. It is faithful to its story in its own terms.An interesting theme is that one should not be one's own psychic. Cate has a problem solving her own problems even as she helps other people with theirs. But in the end, she faces up to her husband's death, rather than denies it, which is a problem of hers during most of the movie. And by facing up to it, she resolves her eldest son's grief. The last scene showing this is very touching.Overall, the story is fairly modest but in the main successful. The movie is a good one.

Whether it's genre driven films such as the Evil Dead series or the recent Spider-Man he has a very good sense of the films he's making. Of his more serious recent films such as A Simple Plan and For the Love of the Game, I think The Gift, his last serious effort before Spider-Man, stands out as the best. The film has a few faults however so I just want to get those out of the way. Some of the characters aren't developed enough so we lose interest in them quite quickly. Also the outcome is quite obvious early on in the film, so a few more twist to maybe keep the audiences guessing would've been appreciated. Other than that however we have a pretty well made picture so these minor flaws don't overshadow an otherwise brilliant production. First and foremost this is a character driven piece lead by the incredible Cate Blanchet. She is quite the chameleon in her movies. She can go from playing Queen Elizabeth, to a southern fortune teller without skipping a beat. Her talent is something that most performers should strive for. She's very efficent in her part here. She's very likable and she makes you feel for her character. Giovanni Ribisi is also very good in the film. He could've played it like the stereotypical crazy person but he brings something new to the role. We feel for him because he brings his struggle across so well when he's on screen. Hillary Swank is good also but her character is majorly underdeveloped. She falls into stereotypical battered wife mode but I did like her performance. I just wish she was given more to do. Keanu Reeves was such a shock in this film I never took him seriously as an actor until I saw this. He literally scared me at certain moments in the film. He brings such a realistic intensity to the role that he becomes more frightening. Greg Kinnear is ok in this film His character suffers from lack of development as well. I'm also tired of him playing the nice guy in films. It's getting a little old. His southern accent also isn't very consistent. Kept coming in and out. It's hard for me to buy he and Katie Holmes as an item but I guess it worked for the filmmakers. Speaking of Katie Holmes, props to her for taking on a more adult role. *SPOILER. It's not even the fact that she shows us her breasts but it's the fact that she's playing against type and does it fairly well. She has minimal screentime but she makes an impression. Especially in her final scene of the film. *END SPOILER* Over-all I thought The Gift rose above the standard supernatural thriller. To me it's more a Character piece and fairly decent whodunit.

Sometimes an artist risks everything and you participate in the danger. And some films (but only a few) are worth watching because they are competent.This film is the latter. It surpasses `What Lies beneath' and `Stir of Echos' by leagues. but not because of the script. The writers took no chances, just plugged away at a formula. BillyBob constantly disappoints.But the execution is highly competent. Competence is a wonderful thing -- you don't have to even like the film to get an exhilaration from the high level of craft. I had this experience with `Autumn in New York,' which was a syrupy formula also presented with relentless competence (and which was also punctuated by Simmons). This film is similar except it has a golden center in Ms Cate.So see it for the craft, and because of Cate. She's a treasure. Not showy. facially quiet.But there's something else, some negative from Thornton. What would we do without the American South? Our mythical zone where every man is a buffoon or violent lowclass, and every woman is mindless. What would we do without the mist of voodoo and the inference of evil in swamps? Without the hint of incest and the threat of beflagged pickups? Why without these crutches, you'd have to be a real writer. At least BB didn't drag alligators into this one.He was on my mildly interesting to watch list. Now he is off. As an actor, he has intensity but no depth, rather like Nic Cage. As a director/writer he just follows the playbook, sometimes blindly, Rather like Costner. I'll avoid him in the future. It's his good fortune that a strong group showed up for this film.

There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff 'round here. Katie disappears. Blanchett, who is one of those psychics who cannot control their visions so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen, has a vision of Holmes' body at the bottom of a pond. She reveals her vision to the Sheriff (good performance by Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). Well, he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision. Sure enough. They drag Katie's remains out of it. Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him? I won't go on with the plot. It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones.It was written by the co-authors of the far superior, One False Move. But this is a pretty weak effort. We hear New Age lines from a bunch of small-minded townies. A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her, she backs hesitantly away and says, I don't think this is a good idea right now. (The guy is falling-down drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place.) She's gone, the man tells the woman, but I have to learn to live with that, just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband. (Real MEN don't talk like that.) And, later, I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me. The director, Raimi, is efficient without being in the least original. The music cues us about looming threats. When Blanchett is worried, a shadow crosses her curtain -- but it turns out to be a friend! As the climax approaching, to heighten the tension, there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning. (Ho hum.) At the end, when all is being revealed, the rain is replaced by fog. One blow from a flashlight conks a full-grown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it.Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help. The young man, Giovanni Ribisi, is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but, I escaped, he tells her. He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her would-be murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog. Well, not that it matters, because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway. This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural. This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them. It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics.All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not. The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting. Whodunnit, you know? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance. She makes the movie.She isn't exactly beautiful. She's lean and narrow shouldered. Her nose is long and pulpy, and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes. But faces have characteristics or traits. Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality. Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty. Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort. Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity. Not intelligence in any academic sense, but an ability to figure things out, to see through them, to discern patterns and form Gestalts. This trait is put to good use, of course, in a role that calls for psychic abilities, but she showed the same ability to use her skills in Elizabeth too, where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence.Her accent alone is fascinating. Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here. It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South, and it's not from the low country either. Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma. She has even the slightest of marks down right. I didn't really think anything OF it. And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South. (The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in druuuunk.) Sorry. Bit of regional linguistics there.Oh -- I ought to mention wardrobe too. A fine job. They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lower-middle-class Southern widow of no sophistication might wear. Example In one important scene, she wears this fuzzy white V-necked sweater -- angora or cashmere or something. (I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like.) Underneath this sweater, though, there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck. Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness. Yet in another scene, at a party, her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are, and neither can Kinnear, the guy she's with.But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller. With her, it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching.

The scene-switching goofs and errors aren't enough to destroy the whole of the film.I like the entire concept of having a crime which was witnessed by a person who wasn't even in the crime scene but witnessed it through her dreams and visions.Despite the fact that movies featuring extrasensory perception of a character is not very unique, what makes this movie really crafted is the great talent of its producers to create an ambiance of mystery without the need of making mainstream plots like having deaths caused by ghosts or monsters haunting for justice.I also liked that they were able to portray spooky scenes without using heavy prosthetic make-up and with just a little of computer generated effects. It made everything appear natural and affright natural.Furthermore, I know that the ending wasn't that perfect. There seem to be many aspects in the story left behind leaving the viewers ask what happened to this and that. However, I don't know why I enjoy the ending that much (and that is how an ending should be, enjoyed by the viewers).The screen portrayal of nearly all individuals was quite good and that ain't surprising 'cause they all are awarded by different awarding bodies.The over exposure of the trees however, is I believe, something that is not needed because it just kills the runtime.

He doesn't seem to worry about the studios or the box office as much, and allows his creativity free reign.3 &#x96; I love good supernatural stuff. The plot of The Gift revolves around the disappearance of a young woman from a small backwoods town in the US, and how the various townsfolk are somehow involved or impacted.The primary character is Cate Blanchett as a hard working, penniless mother of three named Annie, who happens to have eerily accurate visions of the future. The strength of Cate in the role is that she is a good actress and makes some of the later visions a little more credible than they might otherwise be - and she also has no issue with wearing some of the dodgiest tracky dacks ever seen on TV.Annie gives readings for many local people, including several regulars who fortunately are professional actors, Giovanni Ribisi as Buddy and Hillary Swank as Valerie among them. Valerie has the good fortune of being married to full blown ignorant redneck Donnie, played with spotty-bearded abandon by Canoe Reeves. Donnie has no issue with threatening Annie for urging Valerie to leave him, and obviously does a lot worse to Valerie behind closed doors.Buddy is a local bloke working at a dinky mechanics workshop, he is obviously a very troubled individual with serious inner demons and wears his insecurity on his sleeve. As Annie seems to be the only person who believes in him and takes an interest in his affairs Buddy sees her as somewhat of a personal saint.As mentioned Annie has three young kids, is a widow and doesn't appear to have a high disposable income (see trackie dacks) so her girl buddy drags her out for a rare evening of relaxation at the local lodge. There they encounter local school principal Wayne, played by Greg Kinnear, and his partner Jessica, played by Katie Holmes. Annie and Wayne seem to take a shine to each other, which is unfortunate as he is engaged to Jessica. Annie also finds out over the course of the evening that young Jessie is somewhat the local slut and Wayne appears oblivious to her saucy fraternising.Anyway so Annie gets home to pick up the boys from the babysitter and finds out someone was in the house doing menacing things. She immediately assumes that it was Donnie following up with some of his earlier threats.The morning comes and it comes to light that Jessie has gone missin' the night previous. Her father and Wayne, and a local cop (who is more than a little sceptical) consult Annie for a reading, which initially fails due to distractions. The remainder of the film takes a great many twists and turns on the way to clarifying what happened to Jessica and who is ultimately responsible.Among the red herrings and dead ends are many of the signature Sam Raimi LOUD moments, indicating things or bad guys may or may not be there, the suspicion and blame of prominent characters, and Buddy has a couple of memorable moments that help to illustrate his insanity.The ending was a little preposterous and hokey, it almost appeared that they run out of interest and just tacked on a that'll do ending to get the film in the can. In any case it was less than satisfying and a little disappointing seeing as how things were developing nicely for a while.4 &#x96; And Katie gets 'em out in a flashback. Without doubt her finest acting moment.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10. Worth a look, a surprisingly low key effort from Sam with a couple of gonzo performances from Ribisi and Reeves.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "},{"Title":"The Gift","Date":"13 August 2006","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I always said that Keanu Reeves was not that good of an actor but I still always have liked him.

(Annie)","Date":"14 September 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  SPOILERS - Ever listen to a singer who looked like they knew what they were doing, sang pretty well, but you knew something wasn't quite right, maybe they weren't exactly on key? That's how this movie, The Gift, feels. Many of the characters (Ribisi, Reeves, Swank) are a bit over the top, and the fantasy plot just doesn't unfold nicely like a fine fantasy film, like Frequency. The clear majority of IMDB ratings is 7 and that's about where it belongs.This is Annie's (Cate Blanchett) story. Like Bruce Willis' character in Unbreakable, she is just beginning to realize that she might really have powers, and believe she can do something with it. Her fortune telling for donations is mainly an innocent way to pick up pocket money, but she does begin to have what are real premonitions. Since her husband died a year earlier, life just hasn't been right. In this film she discovers who she really is, and in the process solves a murder, and the story ends with her finally achieving personal peace along with her three sons at her dead husband's grave.While there are a few scary moments, they become mainly formulaic. Each scare is accompanied by some loud and surprising sound. After a while you expect dripping water to turn to dripping blood, and it does. The film is significant for a few break-out performances. Keanu Reeves as a genuine bad guy, a real b**tard. For Katie Holmes to do some above the waist nude shots. For Hillary Swank to find an interesting role after Boys Don't Cry.We enjoyed the film, it kept our interest, most of the performances are very good. But it still reminds me of a singer who can't quite sing on key, and thus leaves little lasting impression. Cate Blanchett, bless her little heart,  makes a perfect homely southern girl, and of all the performances hers stands out.The DVD is OK, but the ambient surround sounds aren't quite realistic as the better DVDs. The extras are limited to a brief set of interviews with several cast members, a music video, and the theatrical trailer.

The plot is extremely predictable.  If they hung a big sign on the killer that said `MURDERER', it couldn't have been more obvious than the way director Sam Raimi constructed the story around Billy Bob Thornton's screenplay.Kate Blanchett does a good job as the fortune teller, although I wouldn't put it on a par with `Elizabeth'.  Keanu Reeves seems to be trying very hard to shed his good guy image, following his performance as a psychopathic killer in the `The Watcher' with this role as an evil country boy.  I would have to say that he was more convincing as a bad guy in this film than `The Watcher', but he is still not cut out for the villain roles.Katie Holmes is another actor who uses this film to attempt to break out of her mold as the sweet teen.  She tries hard to play the shrew, spicing it up with some R rated nudity and profanity, but ultimately comes across as spoiled sarcastic brat, landing not far from the teen perception she is trying to shed.  This is a step backwards for her after a very solid performance in `Wonder Boys'.  Greg Kinnear is awful as Mr. Perfect schoolteacher, and his attempt at creating romantic tension between his character and Blanchett's is abysmally inept.And then there is Ribisi.  I have liked Giovanni in every role in which I've seen him.  The kid can flat-out act.  Here he outclasses the entire cast with a gut wrenching performance as Buddy, an emotionally disturbed character whose most important reason for being in the film is to add to the list suspects.  Luckily, Raimi wove in enough of Buddy's story to give Ribisi an opportunity to strut his stuff, because his performance is one of the few things that elevate this film from mediocrity.  Ribisi throws himself into the part, ripping his heart out and shredding it right on screen (for all you horror addicts, that was a metaphor, not a literal description).  If Ribisi keeps belting out performances like this, he could well become another Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro, great actors who didn't fit the standard leading man mold, but made it on pure talent.Overall, this was a middling story with average acting, mundane direction and a standout performance by an up and coming actor in a supporting role.  I rated it a 5/10.  Worth seeing for Giovanni.

I thought that he did a good job portraying an insecure redneck, but he was so out of place in such a secondary role. Same goes for Hillary Swank, playing the white trash wife.

On top of all that, regular Raimi collaborator Christopher Young provided a marvellously eerie blues-tinged score that perfectly complemented DoP Jamie Anderson's excellent atmospheric cinematography. With credentials like those, it's no big surprise that the film is such a hugely enjoyable experience.Raimi plays his horror perfectly straight for a change, brilliantly blending tense supernatural scares, emotional drama, supernatural mystery, and even courtroom drama to make The Gift one of the most mature and well-rounded films of his directorial career. The film's only weakness is that the finale is perhaps a little too predictable, the villain's identity rather easy to guess and the ghostly denouement inevitable, but with such expert handling and excellent acting throughout, this is pretty easy to overlook. In fact, The Gift is such a hauntingly effective film, it makes me wonder why Raimi bothered producing a remake of over-rated Asian horror The Grudge when he already had such a truly great ghost story under his belt.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

Some of them perfectly succeeded their conversion like Adrian Lyne with Jacob's Ladder (1990) while others failed What Lies Beneath was a disappointment in Robert Zemeckis' work. Sadly, with the Gift (2000), Sam Raimi definitely belongs to the second category. Before watching the movie I didn't expect much of it because I had already quite bad reviews about it. I was right and it isn't difficult to define the reasons why this film badly works.First, the Gift suffers from a patchy cast. If I am touched by Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank's sensitive performances, on another hand, Sam Raimi made a mistake by hiring Keanu Reeves. He acts a violent and racist character which makes him disagreeable right away. His pitiful performance spoils the movie and you can really regret his role as Neo in the Matrix (1999).The failure of the Gift also comes from the screenplay. It was partly written by Billy Bob Thornton and it doesn't carry much weight. It consists of a thin plot that has nothing special. Sorry Mr Thornton but we have already seen the trick of the wrong culprit many times before. Furthermore, it isn't really a suspense story that Thornton designed. We can quite easily guess the person who is responsible for the murder of Jessica King from the beginning of the movie. Indeed, at this moment, Katie Holmes asks Cate Blanchett if she and her husband will have a bright future. I can't remember very well what she can see but I know it wasn't hopeful visions. Then, the same Katie Homes dates with quite numerous men in the small town. It is enough to make her husband angry. Due to this, it is very tempting to think that an important part of the film is nearly padding.It seems that Thornton did everything to leave the story a little low-key so as to leave the best in the last sequences of the film. But given that you guessed the real culprit, they fall flat. Besides, the end of the film is no good because the scriptwriters have succumbed to a fashion to amaze the spectator by inserting a coup de théâtre. But it is so hokey that it doesn't make the end of the film convincing.If he perfectly succeeds in recreating a Southern atmosphere thanks to the scenery, the landscapes, the mentality of the inhabitants and even the music, Sam Raimi fails to impose a disturbing climate. It is embarrassing for a supposedly fantastic movie. All right, there are a few frightening moments, but unfortunately too rare, they don't enable the movie to take off.Then, a quality that you could attribute to Sam Raimi is that through the years, he had found his own style without the help from Hollywood which had made him a recognizable director as the cult horror movie Evil Dead (1981) and the excellent detective movie A Simple Plan (1998) testify. Here, he gives the impression of having shooting the Gift with Hollywood presence on his back. Several passages in the film clearly show it and I will retain this one the inevitable trial sequence.Ultimately, the Gift is a very impersonal and disappointing movie where Raimi, once an iconoclastic film-maker lost his credibility in Hollywood mainstream. One last thing, the meeting Raimi-Thornton-Blanchett doesn't necessarily shine.

Although some critics had their reservations about the film, it seemed to me that most billed it as this year's Sixth Sense, and were piling quoteable praise on it.I suppose we should take one thing only from this; never trust the critics.It was slow, dull, filled to bursting point with caricature actors thinking they were character actors and directed with a lack of enthusiasm I find surprising from a man who can make the third film in a zombie franchise seem fresh. Billy Bob Thornton can't write, Keanu Reeves can't be menacing, and Katie Holmes can't be slutty, but that didn't stop all three giving it their best shot.I suppose I'm mainly surprised by the overall positive response this film received.

On reading the plot, my hopes for the movie were not particularly high. The main reason for this was due to the whole story revolving around the main character's abilities as a fortune teller. I've always seen this as a rather bad storytelling device, mainly due to so many recent movies utilizing visions and clairvoyance to allow characters to know things that the writers can see no other way of expressing to the audience. Check out Jeepers Creepers 2 for a perfect example. The creators were struggling to let the audience know the history of the creature involved, so instead of figuring out an ingenious way to do so, one of the cheerleaders suddenly starts to have flashbacks and visions for no obvious reason. Anyway, seeing that Sam Raimi, the director of the cult Evil Dead series and more recently the Spider Man movies was at the helm for The Gift, I thought I'd give it a shot despite my concerns.When a young woman (played by a very sultry Katie Holmes) disappears, the police are baffled as to what has happened to her. In desperation, they grudgingly seek advice from the town clairvoyant Annie (wonderfully portrayed by the extremely talented Cate Blanchett). With the help of her psychic powers, Annie leads the police to the property of Donnie Barkwell (Keanu Reeves in a surprisingly cast role). But is Donnie a killer? And can Annie's evidence against him hold up considering its psychic origin? There are a few things that make this movie work. Firstly, the acting is mostly superb. Cate Blanchett is just staggering as Annie. I mentioned earlier how difficult it is to use psychic phenomena as a plot builder, and it takes a seriously talented actor to be able to pull it off. Cate's performance is completely believable, which is just as well, as the whole movie depends on it. Besides Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, Hilary Swank and Katie Holmes all put in good performances. But Keanu Reeves is the surprise packet for me. I know he can act when given a role that allows him to do so. The Devil's Advocate showcased his abilities to some extent. But I never would have thought he could ever play a villain role, or in this case, a dangerous tough-guy redneck. While he's nowhere near as impressive as the movie's star, he puts in a dominant performance with the help of good direction.Speaking of direction, Sam Raimi does an awesome job crafting a tight thriller with supernatural and horror elements. His dabbling experience in different genres is really paying off now with an ability to pull A list actors and still make movies designed to creep you out and scratch your head in equal doses. The Gift is a really enjoyable horror themed thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. If it wasn't for the highly dubious climax (which I won't give away here except to say that it pushes the boundaries of what the audience should be willing to except) and the occasional cliché characters (the police are always idiots in these films), I'd give this even higher marks.

Meanwhile Annie is being terrorized by the husband of one of her customers.The Gift has a big-name cast that includes Greg Kinnear and Keanu Reeves. While some of the film is rather predictable, the cast and suspense keep things interesting.

This movie is a pretty good example of it. Basically, a fortune teller tries to solve the murder of a young woman using her Gift for seeing future and past events. So, they didn't add anything significant to the genre- but at least it was effective.  Cate Blanchette was awesome, and Keanu Reeves was all but recognizable as 'stereotypical redneck.' I think a lot about the success of the movie is that it keeps the audience interested in the story by being a mystery, ornamented with scares and 'visions.' It's a good movie to rent and watch at night. There's nothing too gruesome or violent- but you will be gripping your seat.

But recently, I decided to give the DVD a shot, because of it's intriguing cast, and I am still a sucker for thrillers.The Gift was definitely a big improvement over A Simple Plan.  Raimi did a very good job of creating a really scary film here. (Watch it at night, in the dark, by yourself)  You are in constant fear for Cate Blanchett's life as you wonder what is going on.Unfortunately, Raimi also runs into the same problem he had with A Simple Plan in that he has a habit of making things a bit too predictable.  Of course, this is a Hollywood picture, but there aren't enough possibilities as to who the bad guy could be by the time you get towards the end. In fact, it was also frustrating why Ms. Blanchett's character was so stupid so often, even though it was intended to create fear, it was done at times in the all too typical Hollywood fashion of doing something stupid to get a jot...which hurts the credibility of a films' characters, especially since hers seemed to be so intelligent.Anyway, I still enjoyed it and was entertained throughout, but when you find out whodunit it ended up being anti-climactic.  It was his toying with our fears and emotions, which Raimi was good at, and what I hope carries over into Spider Man when it is released.  Hopefully he leaves out the predictability aspect.

This film is stereotypical to the extremes, and I was disappointed that Billy Bob Thornton, and anyone who touched American Gothic, would choose to not give greater depth to the topics of psychicism, small-town living, and better defense of this phenomenon as non-evil. The Southern accents of all major players are weak at best, and completely unconvincing at worst. Annie is absolutely moronic in most of her decisions, and we could have gotten to the same place with Donny without as much sheer ignorance on her character's part. And come on...the murdered girl---the character didn't even make enough impression for me to remember her name since yesterday---looks enough like Monica Lewinsky so that it completly shattered any sort of idea that the stereotypes were used to add to this film. I can not believe that I actually bought this movie based upon the name of Billy Bob Thornton. I have been a great admirer of Billy Bob, but wonder if Hollywood hasn't erased his true roots, and the ability to portray the South with any sort of clarity. Do better man! I've never been into hero worship, but really thought this intelligent, multi-talented entertainer would go the extra mile with everything that he touched. Maybe the next film will be spectacular and I can modify my opinion, but for now...I recommend that you check out the other movie I reviewed which deals with The Gift in a touching, thought provoking way.

Giovanni's character, Buddy Cole, was the most interesting even though he was the stereotypical small-town idiot.  His performance elicited equal amounts of sympathy and fear.I would've rated the movie much higher if it wasn't for Annie's motivations toward the end.  She knows through her visions that Donnie didn't do it. She then states this revelation to the two most likely suspects!  She even lets the prosecutor know that she saw them at the country club.  Not only does she put herself in more needless peril, she continues to jeopardize the lives of her sons.  So much for her motherly instincts...  I understand her desire to see the right man put away, but there had to be a more inconspicuous way to accomplish this goal.Also, in the end, we're confident that the murderer will go to jail.  Did the screenwriters forget that the wrongly accused wife-beater would now go free?  He is not exactly a rational man, and he would certainly exact justice on Annie for helping send him away. Maybe I missed it, but we should've learned that he died in jail.  Otherwise, we know that the peaceful moment that wraps up the movie is fleeting and Annie can look forward to continuing terror.All in all, a well directed movie with a good cast and a suspect screenplay.

It is the standard deck of cards which researchers use to test psychic ability (the waves, the square, the star etc, and I just wish I could remember the name of the inventor) and has nothing to do with reading someone's fortune.  I think the director could have at least have her use a tarot deck, or runes, or even a conventional deck of cards to read as opposed to that deck. In addition the scene where she is supposedly looking for the dead girl and turns up three wave cards (one would assume indicating water) is so hokey it creaks.

How wrong I was!Cate Blanchett plays a widowed pyschic who ekes out a living reading the 'cards' to the local inhabitants of a redneck Southern town made up of wifebeaters, murderers, psychotics and women who don't know any better.If Cate were smart she'd have packed her bags and come back to Australia before getting caught up in the lives of this pack of deadbeats. But Cate's different; of course she is. She's not happy to confine her reading sessions to the context of the 'cards'. No, she's one who likes to add a bit of editorial comment herself, and this tends to get well and truly up the nose of the lowlife, mentally-challenged family members of her clients who hang around on the fringe of humanity. Naturally, this leads to threats against Cate and her sons and naturally the local constabulary who inhabit movies don't take Cate's complaints seriously.And unfortunately Cate gets herself into deeper excrement when she accurately describes the place where the murdered body of the missing local good-time girl has been dumped. This infuriates many of the local bunch of no-hopers who watch a lot of horror movies and cry 'witch' and 'Satan' as an expression of their gratitude. No, Cate doesn't get a lot of credit for seeing dead people, which seems a bit unfair to me because Hollywood holds this skill in high regard. At the trial of Keannu Reeves - it was his property the body was found on and he just happens to be the wifebeating husband of one of Cate's client's and who has it in for Cate - the defense lawyer sets out to discredit the pyschic profession, which seems to me to be a ridiculous bit of logic, especially as Cate turned up the missing body by using her psychic powers. Pretty hard to fly in the face of success. And the plot proceeds from there to its ludicrous denouement.There's no doubt in my mind that ridiculous scripts spawn bad performances from good actors. And Cate Blanchett lives up to that assertion. As the script becomes more ludicrous so does her character's actions and acceptance of what is going on around her. No-one in her right mind would go through what Cate's character suffers. And Cate looks completely baffled by it all as she tries to translate this hokum into acting terms. If you are happy to suspend disbelief, then this might be your ticket 5/10.

The idea for the story supposedly based upon the psychic abilities of Virginia Faulkner Thornton (Billy Bob Thornton's mother - she predicted his Oscar win), `The Gift' is a trim little package of murder, trepidation and the supernatural, peppered with an all-star cast and crew of Oscar winners (Swank, Thornton) and nominees (Blanchett, Kinnear, Harris).Annie Wilson (Blanchett) is a humble mother of three quietly making a living in fictional Brixton, GA off of social security from her husband's death and performing psychic readings for the townspeople.  Her recitations consist of one burning taper and a bizarre deck of cards with various symbols (star, circle, wavy lines, etc.) printed on them.  Her abilities as a clairvoyant are honest and true but (wouldn't you know it) Brixton is a backwoods community full of conservatives, skeptics and zealous Christians that believe the reserved widow is a practicing witch.  One man in particular named Donnie Barksdale (Reeves) harbors a special hatred for Annie because his battered wife Valerie (Swank) has been visiting the psychic's home on a regular basis to receive readings.  Donnie harasses Annie, making direct threats to her and her sons and even breaking into her home to creatively render the word `Satan' with her cosmic deck.  When Jessica King, the aristocratic daughter (Holmes) of a Brixton bigwig, turns up missing Annie has a vision that will help the BPD locate her.  She is at first snubbed by the chief of police for her marked reputation but when authorities finally take a chance on her, Jessica's body is found on Donnie Barksdale's property and he is immediately taken into custody for her murder. There's a bigger game afoot however, and Annie must single-handedly solve the mystery before the killer attempts to silence her permanently.Blanchett does her best to look simultaneously frightened and determined as Annie, a woman who is against all odds.  We already have proof of her abilities as a dramatic actress (Elizabeth, Paradise Road) and she is not disappointing here, sporting a decent Georgian accent and making her character human despite her inhuman abilities.  Holmes looks too young for her role and it's hard to fathom the chemistry between the 22-year-old actress and her 38-year-old co-star Kinnear (my husband even remarked that she looked like a teenager wearing her mother's clothes).  It's even more weird to see her sexing up `Office Space' yeeah-guy Gary Cole (who is 45) in a scene involving bathroom whoopie.  I guess it's just another case of casting directors pitting a beautiful ingénue with a handsome fogey twice their age (a la Richard Gere/Winona Ryder, Bo Derek/Dudley Moore, etc.). Kinnear does an admirable job as Wayne Collins, but a project like this is too simple an undertaking for his acting skills; most likely it was a labor of love for him.  Reeves actually manages to himself seem intimidating as Donnie Barksdale and Swank plays another dimwitted southerner minus the sexual identity crisis.  Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris makes a brief appearance as Blanchett's intuitive grandmother.Ribisi is the standout here as the erratic Buddy Cole, a man who is consistently on the precipice of a psychological meltdown.  He is a blubbering, tearful mess one minute, hot-blooded and precarious the next. What is really compelling about Ribisi's performance is the inner turmoil divulged in his roan and expressive eyes.  We know all we need to know about his character's struggle to stay sane simply by surveying his face.  Not a lot of actors have the ability to embody their characters in this way and Ribisi is to be commended for making Buddy a dynamic and remarkable individual.  Although he has yet to get the Academy's attention, the future looks incredibly bright for him and it's almost certain that he will become a hot commodity in the next few years.`The Gift' delivers most of what it promises but sci-fi/horror fans will most likely be disappointed by its artsy approach (compliments of director Sam Raimi), its failure to scare the bejesus out of them (The Gift has MINOR scares) and its sad predictability.  The story manages to point an accusing finger at everyone but about halfway through (or even sooner, depending how attentive one is) it's easy to identify the culprit.  If you're looking for a semi-suspenseful flick with a distinct and talented cast, `The Gift' is an ideal and enjoyable rent.

This is the first time I see either of them, so I can't compare their performance to any of their pervious roles. The other members of the cast give a good performance as well. Katie Holmes' much talked-about topless scene is definitely with taste and I don't think it was put there to draw the younger audience to see the movie. However, I do feel it wasn't vital, and the story would have stayed intact without it. Danny Elfman gives what seems to be the shortest cameo in cinema ever. As my favorite composer/musician I was looking forward to his cameo and expected it to be a speaking part and a bit longer. Nonetheless, he did a good job. I don't know why he was so hard on himself with the outcome. (BTW, did he remind you of Beetlejuice too?) Sam Raimi did a great job. He made the characters highly believable, and brought out a very realistic performance from the cast - notably the violent scene in which Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves) breaks into Annie's home and drags his wife (Hilary Swank) out, while Annie is chasing them and slip on the paint. The first half of the movie is fascinating. However, it is the second half - which suppose to be suspenseful and more interesting than the first - that I found quite weak. Perhaps it was because I knew who the killer was; perhaps it was because the overall feeling was that after all there isn't much suspense, that the details given before don't contribute a lot, other than to try to confuse the viewer a bit, and that at the end it's just a very simple story, which can be summed up in one sentence; And finally, perhaps it was because some of the characters were highly detailed, while others (such as the murdered woman herself) were very low on details and almost absent. * MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD * Several things that disturbed me the most were before and during the trial. First, why would it be so bad for the prosecution that a Psychic had told the police where to find the body - does it matter WHY they came to look for the body at the lake? The facts stayed the same - none of them was based on a Psychic evidence. Also, while Annie was on the stand, I felt that it was only reasonable for the prosecutor to say Objection. The witness is not the defendant here!. Another thing was Donnie Barksdale on the stand. A wife-beating redneck that suddenly becomes a lamb, confessing (in court!) of beating up his wife and realizing he's a bad guy doing unchristian things. The beatings are also taken as granted a few scenes earlier, when Donnie beats up Annie in front of a surprisingly indifferent Sheriff. * END OF SPOILERS * Overall, I think the story is the weakest point in the film. If it was for the first part alone, I'd give the movie a 7/10, but at the end I felt quite disappointed, which brings it to a 6/10. Good score by Chris Young.

The Gift also has a winning cast, and characters that are not the villain bait the horror genre all too commonly employs. Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) for example, is unforgettable in the way he evokes pity and empathy through his sad, pathetic, but strangely familiar behaviour.Apparently, Cate Blanchett's character is modelled after Billy Bob Thornton's mom.

"},{"Title":"A rare gem from Raimi","Date":"19 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Director Sam Raimi has long been an underestimated and ignored director. His films include such cult classics as &#145;Evil Dead', &#145;Army of Darkness' and the incredible &#145;Darkman'. Yet, Raimi is also responsible for attempting to expand his visually intense genre films with the horrendous Kevin Costner romantic drama &#145;For the Love of the Game'. In Raimi's latest film, he returns and displays his progress as a director in creating a film that will not only be limited to be loved by his cultist followers as were his cult classics, but that is a considerably well written and an ultimately satisfying and interesting film. In sharing many similarities with his other character driven film &#145;A Simple Plan' Raimi directs &#145;The Gift', a superbly directed film that makes us eagerly anticipate Raimi's biggest film to date &#150; next summer's SpiderMan film. &#145;The Gift' is at heart a murder mystery. Yet Raimi focuses the first 30 minutes of this film on the introduction of all the eerie and mysterious characters in this small redneck town. Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson; a fortuneteller if you will who has reoccurring dreams concerning the small town's headline grabbing disappearance. The town's bigshot daughter suddenly disappears before her big wedding resulting in a cross-town mystery encapsulating everyone as a suspect.  If the tagline &#145;Everyone is a suspect' was ever so prevalent &#150; it is in this film. Raimi paints a dark cloud over this simplistic little town and all the citizens that inhabit it. From suggestively incestuous relationships between father and daughter, to laissez-faire law enforcement officials to eerie redneck racists. Raimi brings to life a visual cross between a good old-fashioned murder mystery /dramatic thriller with a dash of horror that ends with a suggestively pervascent supernatural ending. One element that in my opinion Raimi still has not mastered and that is visible in both &#145;A Simple Plan' and &#145;The Gift' is the pacing. It seems as if Raimi does not know when the audience has fully ingested all the character development or the clues to solving the mystery within his films. Both these two films have been compared and contrasted because Raimi is one of the few directors who has two completely different styles when it comes to the types of films he directs. With his &#145;Evil Dead' films, he brings forth a wild and terribly kinetic insanity that leave the audience dizzy after the film. As for the two films in question in this review, he lets off the visual wizardry quite a bit and expands upon the character's focus within the film's frame. &#145;The Gift' boasts a great supporting cast including Keanu Reeves, Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank and Katie Holmes. Raimi always has some great casting within his films and it is definitely shown within this film. All the characters that inhabit this town all have mysteries of their own and Raimi makes no attempt at masking this important and crucial element. The only negativistic element in this film is that somewhere along the lines it quietly becomes a courtroom drama for a short period of time. This in turn removes us from the dramatic sequences that take place outside the courtroom and actually within the town that distract us from the great build-up to this point. Nevertheless, once outside the courtroom Raimi's brilliance shines and the film returns to a quiet and subtle creepy thriller that makes good use of this director's visual abilities.Giancarlo's Rating **1/2  "}{"Title":"A perfect machine","Date":"17 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  It's a pleasure to see a film like The Gift once in a while.

She's only in her early 20's and I hope if she does plan to have a successful future career, she does something with herself. All she contributed to the movie is a cute face and few flashes of nudity. Aside from her, Blanchette was terrific, but I loved Ribisi's performance above all. Whatever character her tackles he does it with ease and is clearly one of the few young actors who knows what he's doing. Hilary Swank too, is a young actor and has mastered her technique.The acting is what really saves the movie, I was impressed to say the least, even the young boys did a good job which is hard to find in child actors. I just think there could have been more twists and turns. For some reason I was left feeling like the movie shouldn't be over yet. I'll admit I didn't guess who the killer was until about 30 minutes before the ending... but still that's too early. I would have liked to be thrown off a little.

The story revolves around Annie (Cate Blanchett), who is a single mother and widow who has an extraordinary power- or more appropriately, a gift. Her psychic ability helps her see into the past, present and future. She uses her talent through tarot cards readings to provide income for her children, but also to assist the various people in sorting out their lives. There is Buddy, played brilliantly by Giovanni Ribisi, who is mentally unstable and has to fight his demons from the past. Then there is Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) who is in an abusive relationship with her violent husband Donnie, played by Keanu Reeves (who is surprisingly convincing), who begins to torment Annie when he finds out about his wife's visits.The story unfolds when Jessica King (Katie Holmes) disappears, who was soon to be married to local school headmaster, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear). He then convinces the Police to enlist Annie's help, and her 'gift' in searching for the whereabouts of his fiancée. This creates an interesting whodunit as Annie begins to uncover the grisly truth, where the townsfolk are all potential suspects. However, The Gift doesn't manage to be edge-of-your-seat material, as the pacing lacks tightness and the ending was somewhat predictable. Also Katie Holmes was miscast in her role, but her fans should still enjoy her performance.

Even in a cliched and hokey episode of The X-Files gone south, which is basically what the new Sam Raimi &#145;thriller' is. Granted, there are some  exquisite shots and the occasional genuine thrills, plus the presence of Ms. Blanchett, but there are just too many cons outweighing these pros.Basic premise Blanchett is Annie Wilson, a struggling widow who relies on her &#145;gift' (ie. an eerie ability to psychically tap into events via crazed and bizarre camera angles), for financial support, earning her some loyal friends and customers, including battered housewife Swank and the oh-so-unstable Ribisi. This &#145;gift' however, earns Annie more conservative, anti-witch propagandist enemies than friends, in particular the wife-beating Donnie. But when young socialite, fiance to the school principal and town bike goes missing, these enemies turn to her for help faster than you can say trust no one.The general story (loosely based on writer Billy Bob Thornton's mother) is not exactly unchartered territory - one of the aforementioned cons.The next is casting. Despite the wonderful Queen Cate and Keanu Reeves in a genuinely vicious performance as a violent wife-beating murder suspect, pretty much all else is lost.Firstly - Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes as a couple? It just is not believable. Katie - a sweet girl she may be - I continue to believe is no gifted actress, yet quality directors continue to cast her. As for Kinnear, his loving school principal just doesn't fit. Nor does Giovanni Ribisi, reprising his role of the creepy nut-case he seems to play in every second film (Saving Private Ryan the one wonderful exception) - only here, the character seems utterly pointless - having no relation to the basic plot what-so-ever.Hilary Swank, who was so brilliant in Boys Don't Cry, goes to absolute waste here, sidelined to the cliched role of the battered, yet ever-loyal wife to Reeve's abusive Donnie.Then there is Raimi's direction. It is somewhat lacking throughout the film. You don't really notice it - it is as if you are just standing by, looking at the film rather than actually watching it. Raimi does however, adopt some schlock techniques from his The Evil Dead days; gratuitous close-ups of a dead naked Joey - uh, I mean, Jessica and some sporadic gore, (usually in the form of a dead, naked Joey).Raimi's last effort, A Simple Plan, was a wonderful example of lucid, minimalist direction. Shots were beautifully composed and he made one really fine film, but with The Gift, there is too much &#145;Evil' and not enough &#145;Plan'.But if you are easier to please than me (and you probably are, almost everyone is), and can get past these cons (especially, but not specifically, Kinnear and Holmes), then you will probably be mildly entertained for a couple of hours.P.S. Cate Blanchett, despite The Gift's general mediocrity, is still wonderful.

As usual, Mr. Reeves gave as wooden a performance as his limited repetoire allows. However, Ms. Blanchett did her best with what she had and so did the rest of the cast.

I wouldnt say it was scary,it barely made me move,yet one thing that really stood out in this film was....yes! Cate Blanchette. The Gift is generally about a mysterious murder that takes place,and the witness is someone who wasnt even here, its really simple,but they try confusing you with this film, trying to add twists, i wasnt really excited, i found it rather plain, the ending definantley wasnt something new. This film had potential to be EXCELLENT as its on the VERY GOOD scale now. The cast in this film was very big, from Hillary Swank to KEanu Reeves, or the more infamous Katie Holmes, who really didnt suite a role for this movie. KEanu Reeves did an acceptable performance but dont expect any emmys. The acting was great by Cate Blanchete, she is a really gifted woman. The story was good, it was pretty different,but something i appreciated this film for was its cinematography, stunning camera actions and appearations make the scenes a pleasant suprise. One thing with The Gift was it really tried to brag on, it was trying to prove it has a very different plotline,and at times it becomes obvious and you begin to appreciate the movie less,luckily this happens towards the end,so you arent dissapointed really. Did this film have suspense? Well......No! Certain cast members did great performances,but it wasnt really scary,it was very mystique. Overall i do reccomend you watch THE GIFT, you cant really hate it,there are many good points to the film (cinematography) and theres always downhills (katie holmes), but overall a enjoying psychological thriller.MY RATING OUT OF 5 STARS (*)=half a star.Acting- ****Actors- ***(*)Cinema- ****(*)Suspense- ***Script- ***Sound- ***(*)Overall- ***(*)  (3 and a half stars out of 5) "},{"Title":"A masterpiece","Date":"28 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  8/10 one of the best movies i have seen this year!!!

I loved her in Elizabeth and this really made me realise how talented she really is. Giovanni was well cast and had an excellent performance, and the scene where he took revenge on his father was rather disturbing.  Katie Holmes was good and I found it an interesting change from her Dawsons Creek character, although I did find her topless scene to be a little unappropriate (more for male viewers I suppose).I think a problem I saw in the characters was there weren't enough scenes for each one.  Sure there were quite a bit of Cate and I, personally could get involved in her character but the rest of them it was hard to sympathize with them.  Hillary Swanks character was extremely underused and she is an excellent actress.  The direction was good and a main reason I went to see this movie was because of Sam directing it.

So was the cinematography. Cate lives and breathes the role of Annie and makes her seem like a real person. Not just a character in a movie.PLOT The fiancee (Katue Holmes making a welcome change from Dawson's Creek) of primary school teacher Greg Kinnear turns up dead floating in a tree... no it's not as stupid as it sounds. The police are baffled as to where she has disappeared to so they call in the town psychic, Annie (Blanchett) despite the sheriff's skepticism. Annie already has enough on her place. The mentally-sliding Giovani Ribisi, the abused wife, Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, and the abusing husband (Keanu Reeves) as well as her 3 sons, one of which keeps wondering why they never visit their father's grave.Annie can't help the police until threw the night she has a dream where she is at Keanu's house, out the back in the swamp. She later wakes up and goes outside and sees the body of the young girl in her tree... is it still a dream? you decide.The police search the swamp and find the girls body just as Annie pictures but after he is arrested she begins to suspect the murderer is still out here.This leads to a fairly silly and anti-climactic ending that is a little too silly to be believed. Even if this movie does have supernatural elements it's as if the writers wanted to make a very Sixth Sense-esque ending that would shock and puzzle audiences and leave them thinking... they didn't succeed.Apart from Cate's wonderful performance, Keanu Reeves and Hilary Swank provide some good shots. Greg and Katie don't see like a real couple (he looks 37, she looks 19) and Giovani Ribisi, though good, seems a little *too* into his character and is disturbing in a scene where he takes his revenge out of his father.The movie *is* good but it is a puzzler. The movie is always of a higher standard than most recent supernatural thriller (excluding what lies beneath which woukd've been great if it wasn't for the trailer) but the movie doesn't get near The Sixth Sense in terms of freakiness.See this movie, you will have a good time. but don't expect something like the trailer says not since the sixth sense have audiences been so terrified to look at the screenI was scared to look at the screen during Hollow Man... but that's another story.

When a promiscuous local rich bitch (Holmes, looking very Lavinsky) disappears, Annie sees the body and gets sucked into the murder investigation... Overall, a slow-moving whodunnit with an explicit supernatural element. Some wonderfully creepy atmospheric scenes, but also some sloppy plotting and direction that irritate. Blanchett appears to be concentrating too hard on her accent to put much energy into her character, and is still not 100% successful - the intonation of one line is so far wrong that its meaning is not that intended! She has done much better. Some vital lines from other characters are mumbled or screeched into incomprehensibility. The red herring suspects are clumsily and obviously slapped down in front of us, and it does not help that two of them are nearly indistinguishable clones of Cliff Barnes out of Dallas (hint neither is married to the battered Pam lookalike). Amazingly, Keanu Reeves shows signs of acting ability. Some clever shooting has gone into making him look 6' 6 tall and 220 pounds, which lends credence to his unpleasant thuggish character. However, the show is stolen completely by Giovanni Rebisi as a disturbed, retarded garage mechanic, who can oscillate wildly between fawning loyalty to his friends and psychotic violence to his enemies. Rebisi throws himself into the role and is spellbinding. 6/10. Not bad, but overly hyped, particularly Blanchett's acting.

In A Simple Plan, there were no camera tricks at all, and the effects were subtle, but audiences were still thrilled and shocked because of the strength of the great screenplay, story, and acting.  With The Gift, Raimi tries to have it both ways, and for the most part succeeds.In the script, Billy Bob Thornton has combined the best elements of his own Sling Blade and M. Night Shyalaman's The Sixth Sense.  Psychic Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) has visions of the future and converses with dead people, and manages to make a very meager living with it.  In her rural Arkansas hometown, she has to contend with Donnie (Keanu Reeves)--a wife-beating alcoholic who threatens Annie and her kids--and Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi)--a semi-retarded, mentally ill mechanic with a penchant for violence.  The story--as with all Thornton screenplays--takes its own sweet time to unfold, but the time is not wasted.  The main plot concerns the disappearance of Jessie (Katie Holmes), a country club socialite engaged to the local elementary school principal (Greg Kinnear).  Annie with her supernatural powers is the only one who can figure out what happened.As to the direction  Raimi goes back to his roots, so to speak.  The film is hardly short on spectacle.  But it is a more subtle variety than in his pre-Simple Plan movies.  Raimi, like Shyalaman and Alfred Hitchcock, seems to know that the devil is in the details.  He's figured out that a shadow passing by a window is scarier than a screaming blood-gorged zombie. He's discovered what depths of fear can be culled from a dripping water faucet.The only thing uneven about this film is the acting.  It ranges from the sublime (Blanchett, Hilary Swank) to the putrid (Ribisi, Kinnear).  Katie Holmes--who has done well for herself in The Ice Storm, Go, and Wonder Boys--is badly miscast in her first (and hopefully last) role as a heartless, promiscuous bad girl.  On the other hand, even though Keanu Reeves has made several movies in the last decade, The Gift marks his *acting* debut.The Gift is not Sam Raimi's best film.  The script and acting in A Simple Plan are far superior.  But those two films in combination give hope that Sam Raimi is evolving from being merely a cult director to being a truly great filmmaker.  I'm looking forward to his next work.  8 out of 10.

Whereas the Evil Dead film's hurtle along at an electrifying pace, The Gift drifts along in almost an eerie manner, not dis-similar to that of The Sixth Sense. Even though the film has a fairly slow pace, it is done with such style and suspense, that you find yourself lost in the movie, and if you are anything like me, not once will your mind feel like wandering.The film's casual pace is occasionally broken up with moments that are guaranteed to make even the calmest of individuals heart beat speed up to an almighty crescendo, and maybe even, cause them jump out of their seat! Also, the film produces many good performances from its all star cast.  Kate Blanchett in particular is at times mesmerising, Keanu Reeves is frighteningly convincing as a wife beating Red-Neck, Katie Holmes proves that she can play the man-eating vixen as well as her sappy Dawson's Creek character, and Giovanni Ribisi is also  thoroughly convincing as the towns gibbering, unstable yockel.All in all, I think that Raimi has created an thoroughly entertaining,  suspenseful movie, that will leave the audience on the edge of there seat, and send the pulse racing!

Blanchett is fantastic as Annie Wilson, the widowed Psychic whose dreams give her (often horrific) insights into the future.  In fact the shining highlight of this movie is the way Raimi allows us to glimpse into Annie's mind, whilst she is trying to come to terms with the visions that present themselves to her.  Annie is wonderfully balanced, kind and level headed and selfless.  When a pillar of the community's sluttish daughter, Jessica King (played by Katie Holmes) goes missing, Annie is visited by the Police as a last resort.  She leads them via a dream she has the night after they visit to where her corpse lies in a pond..soon it seems justice has been done, but Annie, via another dream, is convinced that this is not the case.  The finale is frantic, but in my view, there was only ever one person who was logically the real killer.. That was the main disappointment.  Despite an American Beauty style oh no..it's too obvious..let's quickly implicate everyone just before the killer's identity is revealed sequence, there is only momentary doubt with regard to the identity of the guilty party.

He's on his way to perfecting the psychological thriller, taking a step up from the also great A Simple Plan.Cate Blanchett is Annie Wilson, a small town clairvoyant and fortune teller who reads tarot cards for a group of regular customers. She claims she can't do it for financial gain or it won't work. So any compensation she receives for her services are conveniently called 'donations'. If there is any benefit to her at all, her gift doesn't work. It's not just money either. She can't tell her own fortune, for instance, because her emotions block the way.The main question the film wants the audience to ask is, by telling people their futures, is she really helping them? Her clientele are among the town's most fragile, desperate, afraid. In a way, she's taking advantage of them. At the same time people like Buddy (the amazing Giovanni Ribisi) need her like a drug. She's become his guardian angel, protecting him from himself.  Another client, Valerie (Hillary Swank), comes to Annie often to see if her future holds anything better than her abusive husband Donnie.The first plot point is the disappearance of Jessica King (Katie Holmes). Having no leads and no suspects, the skeptical town authorities go to Annie and ask for her help. Not only is the woman missing, Annie finds, but she's dead. A suspect is found, tried, and convicted, but Annie's name and profession are dragged through the mud in the process. What's worse, Annie begins to fear she may have helped to convict the wrong guy. From this point on it becomes a pretty good whodunnit, with many possible suspects. The big secret isn't revealed until nearly the last scene.Much of this strikes you as cliche', using a lot of small hicktown stereotypes to move the story. But Annie's character is so original and interesting, all is forgiven. Everything around her needs to be the way we'd expect in order for her character to be the outcast. Her 'kind' is not exactly welcome in this small, Southern, church going community.Raimi's usual flawless direction also makes a huge difference. It's not until long after you've left the theater that you realize why he's chosen to show you the images he has, in the order he shows them in.

This is a complex woman, gifted with clairvoyance yet guarded in how she reveals it, generous with her love yet mindful of love's limits, and vulnerable to what unfolds before her yet strong enough to take life's punches.  The Gift does have suspenseful moments - a local harlot killed, it would seem, by an obvious suspect yet three other people have motives for the crime and the film does a good job of bringing them out.  The film, however, telegraphs the villain to us long before the climax and has the audacity to make believe we would not know. It also undercuts itself by unfolding a very slow story.  The supporting cast is adequate but one must wonder about the Greg Kinnear character - at once suave and professional looking and yet trying to be hick like everyone around him.  That disconnect never resolves itself.  But what does work is Cate Blanchette, which The Gift fittingly revolves around and which, by her strong faithful character, makes this film worth watching.

But Raimi returns to the creepy genre with his latest film, THE GIFT.  THE GIFT has the classic who done it? murder mystery plot mixed with the basis of Stephen King's THE DEAD ZONE.  But like THE DEAD ZONE, it's one great thriller that has you rooting for the underdog, despite all of the other characters disliking of them. Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) is a widow mother of three young boys in Alabama.  She feeds and shelters her boys with the social security checks she gets from the work related death of her husband, and from charitable donations from clients who has Annie read their fourtunes.  You see, Annie has a rare gift which can see people's future with wither touching a personal object or reading her cards.  Some of the townsfolk believe her very much while others label her as a witch.  There's simple minded Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi) a emotionaly disfunctioned mechanic who seeks Annie for help.  Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) a battered woman who asks Annie if her cruel husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves) is going to kill her or not.  And school principal Wayne Cole (Greg Kinnear) who has been friends with Annie for a while and doesn't really believe in her readings until a tragic event happens.  Wayne's fiancee Jessica King, (a very very very beautiful Katie Holmes) turns up missing, but Annie had a vision of seeing Jessica's feet covered with alge and water.  So Annie believe that Jessica is murdered but she can't prove it, since no one can see her visions.  The town proscuter, David Duncan (Gary Cole) likes to prove that the wife-beating Donnie is responsible for Jessica's disappearance.  But Annie believes and remembers that Donnie is not a killer from reading the cards, despite Donnie treating Annie and her boys' lives and labeling Annie as Satan. THE GIFT is a great suspense thriller that should be seen before or after David Cronenberg's THE DEAD ZONE.  Both stories deal with telepathy and people seeing the faith of other people.  Unlike THE DEAD ZONE, the only thing that Annie can do is solve the mystery to Jessica's disappearance while in DEAD ZONE Johnnie Smith played by Christopher Walken tries to prevent the deaths. But both are very well done with their story telling.  Sam Raimi manages to make the story a bit grotesque but not to much to keep the viewer's attention.  He also does some impressive jobs with the dream sequences by it's visions and tension.  This movie is along a serious tone of Raimi's as A SIMPLE PLAN is, and like A SIMPLE PLAN both films are great story telling.The acting is also very well performed.  Cate Blanchett (who is hopefully going to be a U.S. star soon) does a good job carrying the film as the psychic reader who wants to put things right.  Greg Kinnear and hilary Swank are also both good as two people suffering throughout the film, Kinnear for the disappearance of his loved one, and Swank for being abused by her loved one.  Katie Holmes does a impressive sulty and sexy performance that will get men's hormones rising.  But Giovanni Ribisi and Keanu Reeves would both have to give the more impressive performances with THE GIFT. Ribisi as the quiet and shy mechanic who is friendly and kind to Annie, but if someone threatens her or her kids, he gets very violent.  And Reeves as the wife beating redneck who loves to scare and bully the town. Overall, THE GIFT is a movie worth watching.  If you do enjoy a good thriller and didn't care much for UNBREAKABLE, then you might enjoy THE GIFT more.  And I think THE GIFT should get more recognition than the highly overrated WHAT LIES BENEATH.  And yes men, about one hour and thrity-nine minutes into the film (99 minutes) the eight wonder of the world is revealed, and I'll tell you this, it deals with Katie Holmes, and it's not disappointing.

And, although it used many of the modern day cinematic sight and sound tricks, as I call them, I first and foremost tried to focus on the performances.In that area, I found few, if any, faults.  Let me firstly say, that as an old timer, I was raised on the notion of actresses (ooops, there I go again showing my age; I know the term today is actor for both sexes) being glamorous.  I saw and immensely admired Cate's turn in Elizabeth in a starring role and even liked her in a minor part in The Talented Mr. Ripley. But, in The Gift, I think she has truly moved beyond a limited audience. This time I was impressed not only with her acting ability, but her beauty, as well.  I think I have finally come to fully understand that beauty truly does come from within.  Cate is luminescent!I think enough has already been said about Reeves' strong performance as a bad guy, but I was really knocked out by two lesser roles played by J. K. Simmons (Call me Schillinger) as Sheriff Pearl (how'd ya like to have that name as a man in a small southern town?) Johnson or Michael Jeter as Donnie's attorney.  Both were terrific.So, to all you drama students out there, I guess what I am saying is if the plot is bad, try to focus on the performances.  If those are bad, try to appreciate the cinematography.  If that's bad, just enjoy the car chases and the bare breasts!

Sam Raimi seems to be trying to escape his TV background and become a player on the Hollywood scene.  Problem is, his work (The Quick and the Dead, For Love of the Game) just shouts television.  The exception was his previous collaboration with Billy Bob Thornton, who scripted The Gift.  Their teaming on this one, almost works, but could have used Billy Bob in front of the camera!  Cate Blanchett is sympathetic as the blessed/cursed heroine and Keanu Reeves has the presence to pull off the bad guy role (when he's not bellowing ridiculous lines about devil worship).

Its that the screenwriters were unable to really flesh out the characters (except for Cate Blanchett's Annie) in a way to really draw us into their lives. As the plot twists unfold, it really is necessary that we understand the motivations for what the characters do. But we really never learn much about what makes them tick.

I drove 50 miles to sit through a cliched, under developed, easy-to-guess whodunit.Billy Bob Thorton teams back up with Raimi after A Simple Plan, which was, undoubtebly, one of 1999's best films. What we get here, though, is a character study without any depth or CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Numerous questions ran through my mind during the film's duration. Why was the Blanchett character such a soft-spoken push-over? Was she in a bad marriage? Previously beaten? Had a depressing childhood? I figured since she was a single, struggling mom, that she'd have a bit of character. None of these questions are answered, yet we are later forced to sit and watch her withhold important information from the police with no explanation.Thorton seems to be in his usual screenwriting territory, as he makes Keanu Reeves' character a wife beater. How charming.Those aren't the film's only problems (though, believe me, I wish they were).There is a long, tedious courtroom sequence, involving Blanchett, that is completely irrelevant to the proceedings going on. She is questioned on what motives she used to find a body. What does that have to do with the killer's innocence? I was screaming, Objection, your honor! Irrelevance!.The killer couldn't be easier to guess, as fingers are obviously pointed in their direction. The ending is unsatisfying. I kept thinking to myself; Psychic Woman Discovers Body and Tracks Down Killer, would be a perfect headline for a tabloid. Oh well, the movie never goes that deep.Bottom Line When a movie's two hour duration is used mainly for character development, yet the character's motivations are never understood or explained, you know the film has failed.

Katie Holmes did well for her first mature role that I have seen, although they did not give her enough lines to really test her skills. Since I have not seen Wonderboys, I'll say that she has potential to be a good actress. Her character, although well done by her, was not given enough time to find out why her character was they was she was. I really liked J. K. Simmons. He fit very well into the sheriff role. It was good to see him in something besides the role of Emil Skoda on Law and Order. Hillary Swank was also very believable. Although not the role like she had in Boy's Don't Cry, her character was still given enough depth for Hillary to dig deep inside and give a great performance. Greg Kinnear was good, but his character seemed a little old to have a relationship with Katie's Character. I don't think he fit into this cast as well as someone else could have. The film was frightening in parts and did keep you guessing who the murderer was. Some of the scenes are graphic, but tasteful, not overly gory. Overall I saw no real flaws in the film. For those who want to be scared, this is a good film. For those who want a pictorial essay of the poor and uneducated in  south Georgia, this is the film for you.

Cate Blanchett's character is a misunderstood and somewhat meek woman who is picked on by every closed-minded, ignorant person in her town, and it broke my heart each time. Her character, Annie Wilson, and her psychic abilities, are based on screenwriter Billy Bob Thornton's mother. I think that's the main reason this movie has something most movies lately have not had a soul. This movie has more emotion, heart, soul and power in each frame than any whole movie in the past year has all together. Every scene flows with the plot and builds up the mystery. I love deep southern gothic mystery tales, and The Gift is the epitome of them. I can't even find the words to describe how this film moved me. The courtroom scenes are the most riveting I've seen, and the ending is as surprising and shocking as The SIxth Sense, not that I'm comparing Sixth Sense with this merely because each has ghosts. No. Both of these films are fantastic, but again, I'd have to go with The Gift out of the two. Same with What Lies Beneath, another GREAT film. That's why I hate comparing, because I normally don't believe in it. But this movie is so great I have to. No other movie has moved me and literally kept me glued to my seat through the entire thing. You always hear people say It will keep you on the edge of your seat! but you're like, Yeah, whatever. With this, it's damn true. And it's all in the writing, directing and acting. I won't even really go into Keanu Reeves, except to say he was actually VERY GOOD for once in this. I can't stand to look at his face after his character in this. But that's a good sign, he actually managed to convince me he was his character. I wanted to jump through the screen and harm him for harming Annie. That's why I was almost cheering aloud when Giovanni Ribisi trashed his truck with a crowbar after threatening one of Annie's little boys. One of Annie's dreams where she has visions includes her walking down a path, her clothes off her shoulder, as if she's half dazed. She looks around and sees white flowers, a fence, and a fiddler, which is one of the spookiest and most chilling pieces of the film, as they speed up the film when the fiddler fiddles. That whole sequence was the most beautiful sequence I've seen in years. And it leads the investigation to that exact spot when they're looking for the socialite girl who has disappeared, played wonderfully by Katie Holmes. I can't say enough about how wonderful and powerful this film is. It's one of those rare movies where each and every minute detail falls perfectly into place and there's not a weak link in the whole thing. In short, The Gift is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Very rural (redneck) setting, with the concentration on the setting and the characterization rather than the story itself.  The story is more a means to explore the characters.One of the flaws with a movie written in this manner is that it can become rather predictable.  Maybe not the exact details, but the general path the story will follow.  A number of people I overheard while leaving the theater commented I knew that was going to happen.But in spite of the slight predictability, the movie was quite good.  There are a couple of other minor complaints that might make some people less interested.  First the story is very slow developing.  The first half of the film is really background material for the meat of the movie.  The other complaint is the overuse of suspenceful situations.  Woman walking through a creaking house checking on a noise sort of thing.  Sure this is a suspence movie, but the audience can only sit through so much before it become blatant and irritating.The best performance in this movie I would have to say is given by Giovana Ribisi.  He is also the character that adds perhaps the most disturbing images of the movie.  I had read some stuff prior to seeing the movie that were spoilers, and even then I was not quite prepared for the power of the imagery presented.

Her portrayal as a small-town widow/psychic in this film will do much to help her in that regard.The plot of The Gift, at first glance, is pretty standard southern- gothic stuff. Think The Sixth Sense meets SlingbladeAnnie Wilson, a young widowed mother of three who scrapes out a living as a dining-room psychic and tarot card reader, begins having disturbing visions of a missing local woman. When the woman turns up dead, exactly where Wilson said she would be, all matter of suspicious, colorful suspects crawl out from other the rocks. Finally, suspicion falls on Donnie Barksdale, the town's requisite bullying redneck.Anyone familiar with the genre will have the ending figured out by the middle of the film (if not sooner.) But I do not think that the shortcomings of the plot detracts from enjoyment of the film.The real gift of The Gift rely on the atmosphere that director Sam Raimi injects into this hoary chestnut of a story. He manages to sustain a sense of gloom and dread over almost every second of the film. Like any good suspense director, Raimi realizes that the potential of fear is far more effective than a gallon of blood splattered on the screen. In the process, he creates some truly scary and eerie moments.This is not the Raimi of Evil Dead and Darkman, all raucous and self-referentially winking at the camera. This Raimi is actually (gasp!) subtle and mature. Actually interested in things like character development and performances. If this is considered selling out (more like growing up) so be it. I like it.Finally, there are the breathtaking performances. I am not a worshipper of acting, by any means. If an actor is mearly competent in a well crafted film, I am pretty lenient. I have a hard time distinguishing qualities in acting, unless they are very piss-poor. To me a good script will usually go farther than any acting fireworks.However, I will make an exeption in this case. Everyone in this film was superb. I doubt very much that the likes of Greg Kinnear or Keanu Reeves (playing against type as a surprisingly scary Donnie Barksdale) will ever be this good again.But Blanchett is the true wonder of the story. Her Annie Wilson is tough, vulnerable and very appealing. She manages to handle the super-natural nature of the story without comic-book melodrama or Northern Exposure-style quirkiness. She plays it completely natural and straight. She rises above caricature and hokiness.As far as I'm concerened, there is noone better than Blanchett.If the myopic, stodgy acadamy can look past their habitual distaste for genre pieces and give Blanchett a well deserved Oscar, it will go a long way to help their battered credibility.See this movie!

Cate Blanchett shines (she really is beautiful) as the gifted psychic who can sense the past, present and future. Giovanni Ribisi gives another wonderful performance (but why does he always get cast as a lunatic?). Keanu Reeves is actually good (don't expect his typical routine), Hilary Swank follows up her Oscar with a strong performance, Greg Kinnear is excellent (we need to see more of him) and Katie Holmes tackles her first adult role and does well (showing some skin does help a little). I have to give a strong nod to the casting director for her choices, big and small. The secondary characters were just as solid as the leads; Michael Jeter and JK Simmons gave good performances. My only reservation about the film is that is doesn't go far enough with the supernatural phenomenon, but that is to be expected. No one wants to take the risk of putting too many paranormal details in a film. After all, they are looking to reach a main stream audience, and although movie goers are ready to suspend reality for two hours, I think they are still afraid to give themselves up completely to fantasy; especially when it comes to ghosts and fortune telling. Most people will say it's hocus pocus, but we all know deep inside that we really want to believe.

With an upbeat, elaborate plot loosely similar to 1999's Stir of Echoes, together director Raimi (A Simple Plan) and writer Billy Bob Thornton (star, director and writer of 1996's wonderful Sling Blade)really know how to make an audience jump out of their seats! Although it was Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett (of 1997's Elizabeth)that was donned the title role, the true star (who hopefully won't be denied of an Oscar nomination for best Supporting Actor) is Giovanni Ribisi. Even more so than Keanu Reeves who plays a character he never played before, Ribisi dominates in making the audience jump, laugh, cry, and simply say Wow! Is that really the guy who starred in that rancid Gary Marshall movie The Other Sister? Yes, that is how good he is. Hillary Swank (Woah do I envy her abilities after one of my personal favorites 1999's Boys Don't Cry... She's the kind of girl I wish would e-mail me and meet me somewhere for lunch, dinner for that matter!) plays Keanu's abused wife who looks to Blanchett for spiritual advice. (Yes, the title of the movie comes from Blanchett's gift being a professional tarot card reader, VERY professional!)As always, including her adorable performance in The Next Karate Kid, Swank is brilliant, she has the nicest eyes, but her performance is amazing even past her eyes! Then Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes (God bless her for NOT having a no-nudity contract)surprisingly play an engaged couple in the film. At first you'll think the casting is crazy but eventually you'll realize it was undeniably brilliant casting. Kinnear's character is not just thrown in, he is the school principal of Blanchett's two young boys, and he progresses into the widow of Katie Holmes, whose murder is the mystery of the film, the sight Blanchett must discover spiritually. I WILL NOT ruin the surprise ending for you under all circumstances for I strongly encourage you see this movie. It is almost impossible not to look this movie. The acting is great by everyone, the direction is eerily clever (but what do we expect from Raimi now that he learned his lesson from For Love of the Game), and the always brilliant work (writing in this case) of Billy Bob Thornton is great! It will scare you so be prepared, and also be prepared to have a good time! ENJOY!

Totally un-needed as the tension works a wonderful solo.The cards she uses to get her 'visions' are weird - what are they. This, for me was the biggest weakness. They are an unnecessary prop, the character's psychic ability could very well stand on its own as visions and dreams.There's not badly cast person in this thriller, especially the three boys who their roles brilliantly, one wouldn't know they were acting. If you love Blanchett, you'll not be disappointed. Had it been a little tighter and not so strung out, I'd have given it a 10 - as it is, 8's a pretty good score I reckon.

'The Gift' is by no means the best of its kind but there's something about the Southern setting and atmosphere that grabs the viewer's attention and Cate Blanchett mesmerizes the viewer. The story is full of plot holes and the courtroom sequence is quite funny but Raimi manages to balance the supernatural elements, humour and drama in order to make it entertaining enough. The special effects are brilliant as the contribute well in creating the atmosphere. Moreover having a cast of well-known actors always helps to pull a crowd. Keanu Reeves is a caricature redneck. Hilary Swank is miscast. Greg Kinnear is adequate. Katie Holmes is passable. Giovanni Ribisi was almost getting typecast (even though he acts better than the other actors). But for me it was Blanchett's transcendent performance that made up for all the flaws of this movie. She carries 'The Gift' with grace. Not only is she strikingly luminous but it's hard to tell that the character is played by an Australian actress. This is pretty much a one-woman show.

But otherwise, I recommend it. Strong acting, directing and visuals certainly net this one a higher than average ranking.Also starring Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes, Rosemary Harris (whom Raimi later cast as Peter Parker's aunt May), J.K.

Appropriatelly subtle, well acted, well shot and specifically well scored, with the the line between sound effect and music virtually disappearing (as is typical of all Sam Raimi films)Set in the town of Brixton (Louisiana I think), Annie Wilson, recently widowed with three kids is the town fortune teller. The police department turn to her visions for help when the daughter of a wealthy businessman disappears. As things start to heat up, Annies visions turn into nightmares, and she suspects foul play. She could be in danger herself for all she knows, considering the town does not like what she is doing.I like the rhythm of the film, no too slow, not too fast, there are definitely forces at work building up towards something. Depending on how hooked you are however, that 'something' may or may not disappoint. The third act is a bit contrived, and anti-climactic, which a twist that sort of becomes evident quickly. There are numerous characters in the story, some of which are left unattended for, but not that it does any real harm.I wouldn't call The Gift a ghost story, but it certainly feels like one. When the Ring came out two years later, many critics called it the scariest ghost story of the decade, (until last years Paranormal activity). Frankly I think this is the film, that Gore Verbinski's mediocre Japanese Remake could've been. The Gift is a descent time investment, for the spook fans.

Just follow my lead as I take you on a journey to a section of the theater, to a movie where everyone sits still. A movie that will likely grab everyone's attention 100% along the way with no hassles or interruptions. My suggestion is to see The Gift. Though it may be too old to be in theaters, it's still a great film to rent or buy and shouldn't be overlooked.When it was released in theaters in early 2001, it didn't draw big bucks at the box office, but was praised by the critics and the wonderful direction of Sam Raimi (One False Move). Of course those who love watching something blow up, will most likely say that it's not worth your time or money and to avoid it at all costs. In The Gift, there are no explosions. And it has nothing to do with that last minute trip to Walmart's to find that present for your cantankerous boss. What The Gift has for us is a terrific cast of talented performers, creepy scenarios, psychologically unstable nightmares, and a mystery that will blow your mind. As a treat for all those who hate Katie Holmes, she dies in this movie (at least her character that is). And Keanu Reeves will steal the ladies' hearts and every scene he's in the wife-beating redneck in one of his more natural performance he's ever been in.The setting of this movie couldn't be any creepier than the marshlands of Georgia, where a local woman named Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) has a tremendous gift. Her husband was killed in a horrible accident, leaving her behind raising two boys on her own. Her income comes from her self-employed profession as a clairvoyant who can read predictions and listen to her clients' problems. When the local sexpot Jessica King (Katie Holmes) is nowhere to be found, the town depends on Annie track track down clues that lead to her disappearance. The investigation lead to a compelling array of mind-numbing suspense and unpredictable terror.Since this film is part of the thriller genre, it could've easily been a stinker. But we have director Raimi to thank for his outstanding direction, the acting by the cast is truly believable with very little stereotypes, and the location to where it's set is creepy enough to freak you out. Nothing clichéd about this movie. The supporting actors portrayed are at most excellent including Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi and Greg Kinnear, but Austrailian actress Cate Blanchett was the real star of this movie. Putting on a wonderful Southern accent, she takes great pride in helping those around her with her psychic abilities, she provides both the heart and the soul of the movie. "}{"Title":"Much creepier than I expected!","Date":"11 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The Gift comes on the heels of The Watcher, another relatively lesser known thriller in which Keanu Reeves plays a bad guy surprisingly well. The Gift is the much better of the two, and for obvious reasons, given the astonishing level of talent involved. Everyone is in this movie! Cate Blanchette, Giovanni Ribisi, one of our most versatile actors, Reeves, Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank, Michael Jeter &#150; and it's directed by Sam Raimi! It amazes me that this movie is not more famous, because this is one of the best teams I've seen assembled all at once in years.This movie, despite the surpernatural content, has a much more realistic approach than The Watcher, which was really just your standard by the numbers thriller. Granted, there is not much subtlety in the characterization (especially with Donnie!), but Sam Raini has never really been known for his subtlety. Reeves plays the role of Donnie Barksdale, the abusive husband of Valerie Barksdale (Hillary Swank), who comes under suspicion when a dead body is dredged up in the pond behind his house. This is the makings for a boring murder mystery, but the tangled web that is weaved among the striking number of three dimensional characters is brilliant in its complexity and (as is usually the case when a murder mystery goes for this level of complexity and depth), none of the scenes or occurrences or revelations of evidence ever seem contrived or tacked on. For a movie with such a supernatural element, it has an amazingly real world feel.Cate Blanchette plays Annie Wilson, a local mystic who makes a meager income telling fortunes, or whatever you would like to call it, mostly to local friends, many of whom receive her tellings for free. Wilson's husband had been killed some time before, casting doubt on her true ability to see the fortunes or misfortunes of others before they happen. Soon she has a vision of a woman's murdered body Jessica King, played by Katie Holmes) having been dumped in a lake, which turns out to be the lake behind Donnie's house.The movie spends a lot of the first half establishing how viciously abusive Donnie is to his wife. She shows up at Wilson's house asking for help, but refuses to leave Donnie. She's afraid, as abused women so often are, to leave him, because she is sure that he'll kill her. And judging by the extent of her bruises and injuries, it doesn't seem like a stretch. Needless to say, Donnie forbids Valerie from seeing Wilson because he's sure she's involved in some kind of witchcraft. Similarly, his defense attorney has a field day with her story about her vision of Jessica's body in his lake. She becomes the one weak link in an otherwise airtight prosecution.Interestingly, there is something to be said about human nature, as it is difficult not to sympathize with Donnie, even after all of the terrible things that he said and did during the film, when he is on the stand, admitting that he is an abusive husband and acknowledging how wrong it is. The entire courtroom scene is outstanding, you can literally feel the tension in the air. Imagine how terrified Valerie must have been!! It's good to see such a well-made courtroom scene, since it's the most important part of the movie. Then again, the rest of the law enforcement content of the movie is botched pretty badly. Donnie gut-punches Annie Wilson right in front of the Sheriff when they're searching his lake. No one seems to mind, even though everyone had a right to be there, even the police, yet they do nothing. There is also the unexpected addition of the fact that Valerie WANTS To forgive Donnie, because he had been having an affair with Jessica King, and she thinks she deserved what she got. It's an interesting analysis of the bizarre mentality that some abused women have. I can never understand why women stay with abusive husbands. It always seems to me that they would be embarrassed to still be married to a man who beats them, but apparently their fear outweighs that. Here, she forgives Donnie for cheating, but not the woman he cheated with, even if he was the one that killed her. The story involving Buddy Cole (Ribisi) is wonderfully acted, as always, and satisfying in that we get to see something that, I think, we sometimes wish more people could experience, the abused son getting back at his father as an adult. I think this almost never happens, because while abused children tend to hang on to that anger for the rest of their lives, they also hang onto their fear, so revenge stories like this are remarkably hard to come by. I'm no expert, of course. Just thinking out loud. The end of the film is great, even though it ends with the hint of a small cliché about the senselessness of violence (You think you know someone&#133;), but can I just say one thing? The music that comes on when Cole rescues Wilson at the end of the movie at the lake, for the first second or two, sounds almost exactly like the beginning of the Back to the Future overture. Maybe it was just me. The movie also, by the way, contains what might be the creepiest fiddle playing I've ever seen.At any rate, this in an outstanding accomplishment for everyone involved.

It isn't a bad movie but probably not one I would watch again. But on the whole, this movie, which was recommended by several of my friends, wasn't much above average for me.There were several things I liked about it. One was the atmosphere. This is a genuine southern Gothic who done it film and the movie was positively DRENCHED in atmosphere. The moodiness was spot on and I like movies that take place in the south so I appreciated that. The Gift is a movie that knows a lot of the appeal in movies is getting the atmosphere right and that was evident here.Another positive was the genuine who done it aspect. There are many suspects to choose from and the movie manages to keep one guessing throughout. One really does, constantly, go through all the possibilities. Could it be this one? That one? The list of suspects is plentiful and at least for me, it really did have me changing my mind moment to moment about who I thought did it.Then there's the acting. Everyone here put in a good performance and the cast was really really good. Keanu reeves in particular I must mention as I did not even realize it was him at first. So that's a definite positive. There are several really good things about The Gift and that's why I gave it a 6. The movie's intense too and at the end of it I Just thought wow. It definitely couldn't be called boring.But there were some negatives too. There is such a thing as a movie being to intense. This movie was one of the gloomiest I've seen in awhile as well being very emotionally brutal. I definitely would not recommend it for children or people who have a difficult time with violence in movies. I'm usually OK with that stuff but did have difficulty here. Part of the problem was the dark aspect. There wasn't one light moment in the whole film and although it is, essentially, a mystery I think the movie would have been easier to watch if it had been a little less brutal and a little lighter.There were also numerous sub plots that I guess did help bring the story together but it did seem at times that the movie had to much going on. And at times it seemed to be straying away from being a mystery/drama and getting into thriller territory and I think the movie was at it's best when it did not do that.And then there's the fact that very few of the characters were very likable. That was frustrating. And many were very one dimensional. The movie also jumped so quickly from the discovery of the victim to the trial. I felt it didn't flow wonderfully either.The actual revelation of who did it wasn't as intense as it should have been either and I was disappointed that it went the route of the fiancée. (to predictable.) It would have been more of a shocker to have it be Swank's character or if the movie really wanted to be unpredictable have it be Keanu after all. Anyway....Basically this is a movie I really did not like very much but that I can see had some really good aspects to it. I was disappointed at the end but would give it high marks for atmosphere, and doubly high marks for all the performances. My vote's 6 of 10.

Annie Wilson has had this gift of psychic perception since she was a little girl and it was passed down to her by her grandmother, Rosemary Harris.Early in the movie we see grandma materialize out of thin air as a startled Annie, who's hanging up her laundry,watches which is he first explanation to how she has these paranormal powers. At a social event in town one evening Annie meets her children's school principal Wayne Collins and his fiancée Jessica King, Greg Kinnear & Katie Holmes. Earlier Annie met the two at Wayne's office about her son Mike, Lynnsee Provence, who was having trouble at school and had a disturbing perception about what the future holds for them. Later Annie came across Jessica secretly making out with one of the persons at the party who turned out to be none other then the towns district attorney David Duncon,Gary Cole.With what Jessica was doing behind Wayne's back being none of her business Annie kept quiet about what she saw until the next day when Jessica was reported missing by Wayne to the police. It turned out that Annie, unknowingly, picked up what happened to Jessica in a nightmare that she had that very night after the party. Being widowed with her husband killed in a industrial accident Annie supported herself and her three young children by giving reading with cards,that she made up,to supplement the meager monthly social security check she got from the government. The only way that her psychic gift could work is that she didn't require a fee from those who sought out her services and only took graduates or tips from her many customers in and around town. Picking up images of Jussica floating in some body of water Annie felt that she's dead and at the bottom of one of the many lakes and ponds in and around Brixton. The towns police chief Pearl Johnson, J.K Simmions, who at first felt that Annie was some kind of kook but as a last resort followed up her leads and sure enough Jussica's body was found in a lake on Donnie Braksdale's, Keanu Reeves, property. It turned that Donnie was not only abusing his wife Valerie, Hilary Swank, but was having an affair with Jessica who seemed to be having an affair with every man in town.The fact that Donnie belted Jessica, almost knocking her out cold, the night of her disappearance made him the #1 suspect in her murder.Being persecuted by state's D.A Duncan the case against Donnie is open and shut with him being convicted for Jussica's murder.With everything taken care of by the court and with Donnie Braksdale safely behind bars Annie realizes that Donnie, even though he's a brutal and vicious thug, didn't murder Jessica; even worse Jessica murderer is still out there and that she, knowing that the wrong person is behind bars for Jessica's murder, may very well be his next victim.Becides Annie local garage mechanic Buddy Cole, Glovanni Ribisi,also seems to have psychic powers that stemmed from, of all things, the sexual abuse he received from his father when he was a little boy. It was Buddy, at the end of the movie, who was somehow able to come back from beyond to save Annie's life from Jessica's killer and it may have been that psychic connection between the two that attracted them so much to each other.The Gift is a well structured film that even though it's central theme is about the supernatural comes across like a very good murder mystery more then anything else.

With this movie he has done a rather different project. Sure, you could call it a horror movie too, but personally I rather like to see it as a mysterious thriller.When a local young woman disappears and the police can't find any leads, her father, a prominent citizen in the town, consults Annie.

Slowly she starts having visions of the woman chained and in a pond owned by Donnie Barksdale, the abusive husband of a client, and with her visions she is able to lead the police to the body. Donnie is arrested and convicted but her visions about the murder don't end. What if Donnie is innocent, what if he has only been thrown in jail because of her visions and the real killer is still running around somewhere ... free?

The cast is a good mix of famous and not so well-known actors and it really works well. My personal favorite is Keanu Reeves.

As a woman dies and everything seems to put Donnie as the suspect, though it seems like there's something wrong about the judgment...As said; it includes some pretty good thrills and character performances (especially Blanchett), but the whole movie isn't interesting enough to keep the whole thing to be a good thriller, though it's running time is respecting 102 minutes. Keanu Reeves plays a very little not-Keanu character with his violent, threatening and wife-beating Donnie Barksdale, though it isn't the movie's most convincing performance it's always funny to see actors doing totally different characters than they usually do.It's by all means a psychological thriller, and being at times pretty exciting and good, it doesn't keep this movie from just being a everyday thriller that gets support for Cate Blanchett and Sam Raimi doing a pretty nice job behind the camera after all.

Hillary Swank also turns in a great performance as Valerie, the white trash neighbor who takes more than a few love taps from her husband. I live in Alabama, so I can say from experience that she nailed the part. Kuddo's to Reeve's who managed to get through a whole movie without saying Whoa. The story line is nothing new, but the director does a good job of telling the story and giving the movie a haunting feel.

However, Annie's powers cause her to be unjustly implicated in the disappearance.The title of the film 'The Gift' is representative of Annie's psychic abilities.  The main theme of the film is psychic ability and how it reflects the prejudice felt by people towards those who appear to be different to themselves.The strength of this film is in the acting and editing.  The acting of both Cate Blanchett (Annie) and Katie Holmes (Jessica) was at all times believable and made the audience empathise with their on-screen personas.  The editing is memorable particularly in its use of graphic matches, flashbacks and sound bridges.  A striking example of a graphic match occurs when the camera shows Annie brushing her hand across the page of a photograph album, before cutting to a shot of her brushing her hand across the surface of a gravestone. Flashbacks occur frequently throughout the narrative, as depicted in the court room scenes where the lawyers are cross examining witnesses who are recalling the last time they had seen Jessica.  Sound bridges are also used in this scene.In 'The Gift', past and present often merge in order to propel the narrative forward.  An example of this occurs when Annie is hanging up a sheet through which she sees the figure of a dead relative. This sheet is symbolic of a mist between past and present.The mise-en-scene includes a visual motif in the form of tarot cards which are used by Annie to aid her readings. These tarot cards not only help to remind the audience of Annie's gift but also reflect the prejudice felt by the town's residents.  This is illustrated when Annie returns home and the cards have been used to spell the word Satan on her bed.The camerawork helps to reinforce the visual motif by use of wide shots and high angles.  A high angle is used in the scene where the tarot cards are lying on the bed.  Dissolves are also used to reinforce the psychic theme in the film.  An example is when Annie is asleep on the bed and in her dream an image of the tarot cards appear over her face.The sound in this film is atmospheric and is used to great effect to promote suspense within the audience.  In a scene when Annie suspects that somebody is in her house the only diegetic sound that the audience could hear was her heartbeat.  In conclusion, this film has a well constructed narrative as a result of good editing and particularly strong performances by Cate Blanchett and Katie Holmes.In my opinion the message of 'The Gift' is that you should resist condemning someone and always keep an open mind, whether you are prejudiced towards others because of their psychic abilities or whether you have any other form of prejudice.8/10 "},{"Title":"A Haunting Supernatural Thriller","Date":"27 April 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Annie Wilson(Cate Blanchett) is a lonely woman, who's husband just recently died and she lives with her three young sons and makes money by using her psychic power and tells fortunes.

Well, in fact The Gift works both ways, and I feel the need to give all my credits and respect to the writers, the director, the whole actors team. Cate Blanchett was amazing from the first scene up to the end. Her performance has been awesome, as the neurotic single mother of three, her gift necessarily to make a living, yet social controversial. At some point, one could see her eyes's injected like after crying a lot, is this possible to be a special effect, I wonder yes, but ingenious.

My respects here. The feelings of being unsecured, trapped transcends and catches the viewers. (This is what I have felt). The whole atmosphere was genial realized, like in a black and white old movie, but the end where in the cemetery, one can feels peace and mild autumn colors.

I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie. Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancée; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern Gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced débutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us. The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's Furniture Room Lullaby which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer.

However when Jessica disappears, Wayne and her father come to Annie for help in locating her.  Annie has visions of Jessica underwater and helps the police find her body - in a pool on Donnie's land.I don't know if this was his first film after the Matrix but it was definitely the next film of Keanu Reeves to hit the UK cinemas after that massive hit. As a result it was marketed pretty heavily on his back. Despite this big push on adverts and posters the subject matter didn't seem to appeal to me that much and I couldn't help but see it as an average looking thriller with a supernatural twists and lots of well known actors. While I don't think I have the same gift as Annie I now know that my thoughts all those years ago were pretty much bang on the money.  The plot is nothing original and takes way too long to get to where we all know it is going.  The vast majority of the running time is just filler as we chase what we all know is one big red herring, the real killer is not as obvious because there are so many suspects - but I guessed it and got it right. The final twist is not really delivered very well and is quite dull and even after it has delivered it's payload it still hangs around like it doesn't know when to end.  I was in a forgiving mood and found it quite passable but I'm sure many will just be annoyed by the fact that it is far too obvious (even for the genre) and slow while all the time acting as if it is cleverer than it actually is.Blanchett is reasonably good in the lead role and doesn't overdone the Southern clichés in the way that plenty of performances set in the area tend to fall into.  Her character is quite bland and this results in Blanchett just reacting to things - but it is good enough for this material.  Reeves must have been looking for a role that is as far from Neo as possible and he gets it here; he gives a good performance but it will be apparent to all but the most accepting of audiences that his entire performance is just a big noisy red herring designed to make the suspense last longer.  Kinnear fills out the cast and spoils the film by being the only person we are NOT meant to suspect, Holmes is sexy and OK despite having big hair. Swank is OK but her character isn't used well and the same could be said of Ribisi, who acts well but his character is just window dressing.  Cole, Jeter, Ross and Simmons all add to the feeling of class in the cast that helps the film feel better than it actually is.Overall this is nothing special and is actually pretty dull and slow at times.  The cast help it by giving it the feel of quality in numbers and several good performances almost make up for the fact that the material completely wastes them.  The plot thinks it is cleverer than it is but actually spends most of it's time on a very obvious red herring before rushing in with a poorly delivered `surprise' twist that we all saw coming from miles away.

The clairvoyant pagan Annie (Cate Blanchett) is of course a paragon of virtue and her only real friend is a mentally challenged and sexually exploited mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi).

The justice system of the South is also defamed. The lawyers are some of the smarmiest seen on screen in recent years and Sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K.

The character is totally out of place in a serious thriller like The Gift and appears to have been written only to insult the justice system of the South.

The fact that Raimi directed this was a warning; he is one of those horror-film directors like Romero and Hooper who started off with a major classic (or classics), then went mediocre. The bigger warning was that Billy Joe-Bob Thornton co-scripted this piece of tedium. Billy-Ray Joe-Bob Thornton is a man of the South, but he seems to have sold himself to the Hollywood Establishment. He has co-written a story about a Southern town where men beat their wives, fathers molest their sons, their sons then burn them with gasoline, and sheriffs who pay more attention to their supplies of dough-nuts than a murder investigation (i.e. the obligatory cop dough-nut gag). Billy-Bob portrays the South in a similarly loathing way as most Hollywood writers/directors. What gives? (Ironic, how the decadent Hollywood finds so much bone to pick with the moral fiber of the American South.) The movie also makes a cardinal sin of being a horror drama &#150; a very tough genre to be successful in. By not being a straight-out horror film the movie indirectly sells the idea of fortune-telling as a valid ability. This is supported even more by an ambivalent attitude of the locals towards Blanchett the psychic. Billy-Bob and his new Hollywood friends feel superior to these semi-skeptical locals; in the meantime, every other Hollywood moron visits a psychic and think that that's so New Age and hip, not to mention intellectually sound.Apart from being very dull, with its clichéd elements of tiresome drama, this forgettable horror drama (thriller even?) also suffers from some rather idiotic casting. A whole bunch of totally unsouthern-looking actors are cast as white trash or thereabouts Blanchett - an English woman - plays a poor Southern psychic. What idiot cast HER?! Keanu plays a violent white-trash husband with a funny Elvis accent. His character is so ridiculously over-violent that one has to wonder how come he isn't already serving time for a killing spree; he is constantly shouting, threatening, or hitting someone - literally all the time (a sad, over-used ploy to make someone seem like the obvious culprit; as if I'd fall for that cheap shtick).

So here I am now writing a review because I just can't believe the ratio between known quality talent (Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes - for goodness sake think of the movies that could have been made with this line-up!) and end product. You folks should start a new Blockbuster vs Bomb index of Resulting film divided by Known talent - this film would be darn close to the worst possible 1/10 score - a true Bomb.Nearly every cheap film-making cliché is used to manipulate the viewer - discordant violins at the crucial moment, gross-out make-up and blood splodges, scary wind and lighting effects in the Bayou trees, sudden appearances on-camera, etc. Name 'em, they're in there. Then there are the paint-by-numbers characters that are used to fill in the blanks, such as various sheriffs, etc.It is true that Keanu Reeves is convincing as the wife-beating redneck - a good performance. Cate Blanchett was presumably under Director's orders to project all kinds of strong emotions, which she does. And like many actors before him, Giovanni Ribisi puts on a compelling show as the unpredictable mentally ill guy. When you roll in sweet girl Katie Holmes as the village slut and tidy Brit Cate playing the Bayou welfare single mom, it leads me to guess that the reason for making the movie was to give all these people an opportunity to play a contrasting role with their historical castings.I am seriously going to ask for my rental money back when I return it to the video store, something I have never done before. I have previously watched equally bad movies but never before have I seen such a waste of talent and, ultimately, money.

He was quite believable as a tormented soul.Hillary, while she fit the role well... looked rather sickly in real life. Severely under weight.Brilliant movie even if some of the events fit the typical pattern, Cate's role brought a deep compelling presence to the story which pulled the audience in.I highly recommend the movie but a little too brutal for the kids...

A film that had all the ingredients of a B movie turned out to be a pretty good motion picture. This is contrary to what usually happens in many movies where potentially good material is spoiled by the makers of the film. It only goes to show that given good Directing and a cast of excellent actors doing their best, anything can be made into a good, or at least enjoyable film.The acting is really good all around, but I would have to single out Cate Blanchett whose performance was certainly worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination for Best Actress in a leading role. The way she portrayed Annabelle was utterly believable, her fear and feelings where well tangible to the viewer, and her accent was phenomenal...

Between Valerie Barksdale (Oscar winner Hilary Swank), an abused woman with a vicious husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), and the other town residents, Annie makes pretty decent money to support herself and her three sons. But she soon finds herself entangled in a mystery involving the daughter of a prominent town citizen, Jessica King (Katie Holmes), who has seemed to vanish into thin air. Her worried fiancée, Wayne (Greg Kinnear) comes to Annie for help, resulting in a slew of disturbing visions involving Jessica's vanishing. Soon Annie is asked to use her gift to try and help the police solve a disappearance, which soon turns into a murder...I saw The Gift quite a few years ago, and it had a lasting impression on me. Directed by Sam Raimi, who earned his place in the horror hall of fame for the cult classic Evil Dead series, this is quite a spooky little mystery film. I haven't seen too many films that center on psychics or this type of psychic phenomena, so in that aspect the story is a nice take on something fairly refreshing and new. The script is strong and the characters are well developed, which is an important factor to this film's success. The audience gets to know the characters well, and each of their stories are told appropriately throughout the course of the movie. While it may not be a 'horror' film per se, there are quite a few delightfully creepy moments in this film, among them being the visions Annie has of Jessica, and the terrifying fiddler in the swamp sequence that gave me a good dose of the creeps for quite a while after viewing the film - this was definitely one of the creepiest moments of the movie.One of the strongest points of the film though is it's stellar cast, led by the talented Cate Blanchett, who turns in a near flawless performance as a troubled widow who is trying to cope with visions of a horrific crime and the repercussions of her special gift. Giovanni Ribisi plays a drunken mechanic, one of the few people Annie fully understands, and Hilary Swank and Keanu Reeves portray a couple in an abusive relationship very realistically. Greg Kinnear plays Wayne, a friendly, southern-gentleman-type school teacher, and Katie Holmes plays his fiancée, the prominent and wealthy Jessica. The performances here are powerful and overall stunning, this film managed to gain an amazing line-up of some talented performers. Overall, The Gift is a superior supernatural thriller that grabs you by the throat and pulls you right into the mystery, never relenting until the surprising conclusion. Stellar performances, excellent story, nice cinematography and atmosphere all make this a far above-average supernatural film that I'd recommend to anyone who would like to watch a quality, involving suspense-mystery. Excellent movie. 9/10.

It feels a little familiar, but holds plenty of surprises along the way. Cate Blanchett does a really creditable job of playing a lower class American Southern gal who has a gift. A real success of this film is presenting her visions and dreams in a way that are flawed, and that makes them seem all the more real.The roles are stereotypes, but if you have Southern family, you know these stereotypes exist for a reason. They are all fleshed out beautifully and brought to life with an edge of danger. Hillary Swank (in her first role after BOYS DON'T CRY) plays an abused, beaten wife, filled with real ambivalence. Giovani Ribisi plays a disturbed Boo Radley type with a oddly romantic soul. Greg Kinnear plays the quiet School Principal while Katie Holm plays his socialite girlfriend and bares all, displaying the natural gifts that captured Tom Cruise. The real stand out surprise of this cast is the knock out performance of Keanu Reeves as the wife beating, cheating redneck. He's a character actor! Who knew?! No wonder his leading men are so boring - they don't interest him. He is simply fantastic here and holds his own with Ribisi. The special effects are kept to a minimum, so that they are extremely effective here. While overall this is the stuff of a TV murder mystery, the performances, script, and sensitive handling make this a tense, tight thriller, calibrated for maximum suspense.

She secretly has a soft spot for a guy named Wayne (played by Greg Kinnear) who is engaged to the Mayor's daughter Jessica (played by Katie Holmes in her Pre-Tomkat days). You see what I'm saying? Nearly every character is a major film star. But anyways, while juggling a tempestuous friendship with a mentally challenged mechanic Buddy (played by Giovanni Ribisi), Annie must also watch out for Donnie Barksdale (played by Keanu Reeves) the psychotic husband of Valerie Barksdale (played by Hilary Swank) who is against his wife's friendship and patronage of Annie.One day, while out at a function honoring the Mayor, Annie spies Jessica (Holmes's character) having sex with a man that is not her fiancé in the restroom but keeps this to herself. Later that night, when she (Annie) returns home, she has a nightmare about a dead girl who seems to be trying to tell her something. The next morning, word starts spreading that Jessica King has disappeared. Convinced that she can help, Annie lends a hand with her tarot cards but this causes her more grief than relief. Eventually, she leads them to a river where she instructs the search party to search the bottom of the lake and there they find King's body. The story now becomes a whodunit, and the race to save Annie's life as the killer seems to be after her as well.There is a Bollywood version of the film entitled Rakht, starring Bipasha Basu in the Cate Blanchett role, Sanjay Dutt in the Greg Kinear role, Dino Morea in the Keanu Reeves role among others.

Later on her dreams starts giving her visions of the murder though.This movie is in a way a classic Who did it movie, and it does indeed keep its murderer hidden, it's not the butler, so don't expect that ) However there aren't many clues given to who the real killer is, at least i didn't see any, and the one i saw was wrong. This makes the end seem a bit like a relieve, like finally we discovered it, and it is naturally not what one expected. However the end is flawed, some of the visions of the murdering just didn't fit with the murder for me, i am not going to give to many spoilers here, i just found the end of the movie rather flawed at the twist, and especially the second twist seemed meaningless and pushed too hard to give a deeper meaning to the movie.The movie naturally is a suspenseful thriller, however many of the shocking scenes are build upon various cliches, the movie has stolen various parts from random classic movies and already used schemes. For example one will notice that everytime there is a shocking scene the subsense technique is often used, also the use of lightning and loud sounds are often getting used together with the same music routine, i spotted it early on, but still managed to get one shock in the best scene of the movie, but it is obvious that the director have borrowed his techniques from other movies and experimentation. Therefore the movie doesn't bring much new to this genre and does not revolutionate in any way, it comes and does it's job, and it does it pretty well.It's obvious that the director is doing a routine work, or maybe he doesn't know better, it's not very experimental and there is frequent use of basic film education, even for a basic film study guy as me, he uses the basic camera angles, music. But he uses them the correct way, a standard job for the directing, it's not spectacular, but it's not awful in any way either. I have seen better and more experimental work from Sam Raini, feels like he is having just another day at work here. The horror scenes especially, he uses the usual suspense as has been scene many times before, which is also one of the reasons they aren't always shocking, there are about 3 times where i was thrilled so i could feel it, the 3rd time was the best.This movie has a very good cast, all of them are doing a good job, and it's interesting to see Katie Holmes stepping out of her Dawson's Creek character and try to do some daring acting, i think she succeds pretty good. The rest of the cast are all above average, and are one of the reasons the movie is interesting all the way through.To sum it all up a bit this is quite a good movie, it's entertaining and keeps you guessing to the very last moment, ignore the end and it's even better. The movie has a few flaws, or copied moments so to speak, everything has more or less been seen before which brings the movie down a little, a little more originality would have made the movie much better.

This Billy Bob film is superior to both, largely due to his screenplay and Blanchett's extraordinary performance. Those following Billy Bob know his own mother had the gift and was a locally active psychic when he was growing up. So the caring and firsthand knowledge he's written into his characters give The Gift authenticity and charge. His plot lacks the unpredictability of thrillers like House of Games or Sixth Sense, but what it lacks in surprise, it makes up for in depth. Its on screen power comes from Raimi, Thornton and Blanchett's detailed observation of Annie as a widowed mother of three making ends meet by doing readings. There's such a transcendent yet maternal tenderness imparted by Cate Blanchett to her role that when Annie's home and kids are breached, you feel it in your gut. If you want to see an actress who completely understands her character, watch Blanchett in this. Her performance is comparable to Gillian Anderson's performance in House of Mirth or Streep's in Sophie's Choice. I became deeply involved in Annie's ordinary yet extraordinary life and, through her, became involved with the characters around her.Giovanni Ribisi explodes as Buddy, and the usually flat Keanu Reeves provides the right physical menace as Swank's out-of-control redneck husband, Donnie. The rest of the cast measure up well with Hillary Swank, Greg Kinnear and Michael Jeter standing out. The climax stretches credibility a bit, but the twist at the end will touch you. Yes, you'll respond to Raimi's usual thriller moments, but it's the degree to which you care for the characters, and the time and care taken by the director, writers and cast to accomplish this that are the film's great achievements.

The main character is a widow who is raising three young boys and is of modest means apparently due to her husband's death approximately one year prior.  She receives small death benefit payments from the Social Security Administration and donations for her psychic readings which she provides as a service to her appointments.Her character is impeccable, honest, caring, loving, understanding, forgiving, and conscientious.  She is called by one member of the community, The Soul of the town.  The entire theme of the movie revolves around her.Some of the characters included in that revolvement are a victim of childhood sexual abuse and sadomasochism, an angry and rageful physical and mental abuser (tyrant), and a murderer.The main character is able to see into the past, present, and future and is an inter-dimensional individual who is strongly religious in nature but accused by some of the town's folk of being a Satanist and a witch.This movie can be considered an actual depiction of the lives of some people.  Cross dimensionality is also depicted in the movie on numerous occasions by three different individuals, the main character, the murder victim, the childhood sexual abuse victim, and on one occasion by one of the main character's grandmothers who she calls granny.Individuals who are still in denial regarding their own behaviours probably will not care for the honesty in this film nor will those who are into formula.The film's classification is fiction with a purpose - it teaches about real human lives and real human situations and circumstances as well as offering solutions to some of the dilemmas that human beings find themselves in.

What makes this film interesting and noteworthy is the beautiful southern backdrop, abrim with Spanish moss, full moons and photogenic bayous; the quietly matter-of-fact handling of one woman's extrasensory abilities; a sterling cast rising to the occasion by instilling a level of truth and integrity to their performances. Cate Blanchett, at the helm of this remarkable ensemble, is soft-spoken and restrained as Annie, whose 'gift' suddenly immerses her into the vortex of a dark and dangerous place, which she confronts with rectitude, compassion, and courage (arguably foolishly or not). Keanu Reeves is appropriately menacing and despicable as the villain of the piece (I'd be surprised if he didn't base his character on DeNiro in 'Cape Fear'), unleashing his rage most frequently on his hapless wife, portrayed by Hillary Swank with wide-eyed, bayou-backward conviction. Greg Kinnear, quickly becoming one of my favorite actors of this era, professionally fleshes out a somewhat thankless role with warmth and sad-eyed sincerity. That the victim of the story (lustily played by Katie Holmes) is a debutante-harlot seems somewhat misogynistic (the implication being that she got what she deserved), and it is my only real qualm with the movie. Most astonishing, however, is Giovanni Ribisi's amazing portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Buddy, who seeks advice and redemption from Annie, and whose torment and anguish in the face of his inner demons is palpable. It is a richly textured and heartbreaking performance, and should have certainly earned Ribisi an Oscar nomination. Mostly because of the script, 'The Gift' is not a great film, but earns high marks for sharp direction, superb acting, and lovely cinematography. And, oh yes . . . there are genuinely creepy moments that will chill and startle and leave your heart racing. But, significantly, those moments are not gratuitous, and are for the most part necessary to the story line. My rating--8 out of 10.

Sam Raimi also proves that he's still a pretty brilliant director when it comes to suspense. A lot of directors seems to think that everything needs to be completely dark for things to get scary. Raimi proves them wrong by having Blanchet turn on the light, which any reasonable person in real life would have done, when she enters her house suspecting there might be an intruder in there, and still Raimi manages to create a fairly suspenseful moment. What's so sad about this film is that the plot is not very original. It's easy to figure out where things are going. You can early on tell who the killer is.

Annie sees things and uses a pack of special cards to give advice to a group of some of the most screwed up people you will ever meet.While visiting her son's principal, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), to discuss her oldest son's behavioral problems, Annie meets Jessica King (Katie Holmes, all grown up, to put it mildly), Wayne's fiance.

It's well-directed by Sam Raimi with a similar quiet grace he used in A Simple Plan.  Plus, he managed to get great performances from all of his actors, even the ones who haven't been so great in films past.  I have to admit, I'd like to see Raimi get back to his roots.  The Evil Dead films treated us with scene after scene of relentless creativity.  While there's nothing I'd necessarily criticize about his style in The Gift, I hope to see Raimi return to above-and-beyond mode for Spiderman.As I mentioned, the acting is strong.  Cate Blanchett is the shining star here.  If there ever is a time when we don't believe her, it is more the script's fault than her own.  Giovanni Ribisi does a fine job as does Keanu Reeves most of the time (it's one of his few tolerable roles).  Greg Kinnear is mis-cast.  He should stick to smarmy, sarcastic roles (he generated half of the few laughs in What Planet Are You From?) and stay away from any roles that require a Southern accent.And now for the not-so-good. I don't want to say that the writing is bad, but it's not great.  The story is a good one, but it's slowly paced and can be predictable at times.  Worse, there are times when you start to not care whodunit and hope for the quick arrival and passing of the inevitable scene where the villain explains his/her motives for the crime to the protagonist before the final battle ensues.  Luckily, there are some carefully interwoven threads that offer some powerful moments and one particularly nice twist.  Whether you have the patience to wait for the threads to converge is up to you.  Usually I'd blame bad pacing on the director, but I really think most of the fault lies within the script.One last note  This film has its fair share of dream sequences.  They are necessary as plot points, but I've become so familiar with the standard Hollywood dream sequence that I could just about cue every picture edit, sound effect, and music crescendo from my couch.

Hollywood producers do not usually mis-cast actors, but when they do they do it big-time. The result is an almost laughable representation of Reeves as the skinny wimp who, once given a full, healthy beard (which could have been stuck on for that matter) is expected to be transformed into a figure that all fear and none dare challenge. Hooey!However, the said actor is not alone in the ridiculous nature of the plot and talent made (mis-) use of in this movie. The protagonist, Ms. Blanchett is a widow, left to raise 3 small children after her husband is sent to his untimely death by an explosion at his place of work (an incident the fortune-teller 'quite-but-not-completely-anticiapted-yet-not-in-a-very-convincing-enough-ki nd-of-way'). This sets the scene for a family comprised of four people who, if able to break a smile is soon reminded that tragedy is everywhere and sadness is a fact of life, so get used to it. Cue Reeves, a man who is about to make this quasi-tragic setting seem like a walk in the park. If ever you wanted a reason for why Reeves was not the murderer in Scream, calling up his victims prior to making his attack then here it is. Listen to him on the phone and see if you are even vaguely interested in what he has to say...However, the movie is not without it's attractions. Like Giovanni Ribisi, who, if ever there was a man worthy of the award for Best Schizo in a Supporting Role never fails to entertain with his outstandingly outrageous outbursts the two that immediately spring to mind are firstly, an emergency stop worthy of a manual on how to get your driving license... with style! and secondly an attack on a vehicle with a crow-bar worthy of how to lose your.....

Donnie doesn't take too kindly to the interference and threatens Annie and her children.Meanwhile Annie has become friendly with one of her child's male teachers. But when his girlfriend Jessica (Holmes) goes missing he comes to Annie in the hope that using her abilities she can trace the body. When the inevitable happens and she leads them to the body, Donnie becomes the prime suspect.'The Gift' has many faults but the main one being that the writers, Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, cannot decide whether they are creating a supernatural thriller, a mystery whodunit or a jump-out scare-a-thon. In the end they fail on all counts and the result is highly disappointing.If the overall writing wasn't bad enough then the plot is full of holes also. For example Annie's supposed best friend takes her out for an evening away from the kids and promptly disappears for the rest of the movie. The court scene is unrealistic and uninspiring and Cate Blanchett seems to have remarkable healing powers as despite having a serious gash above her eye in one scene, a quick drive home and suddenly it's disappeared.Katie Holmes displays the full range of her acting ability in her three main scenes. Firstly she is having sex up against a wall, secondly her dead body is being dragged out of a lake and thirdly in a flashback she is topless up against a car. Like Joshua Jackson and James Van Der Beek have found out before her, she should stick to Dawson's Creek.The one redeeming factor is the quality of Blanchett's acting. She brings depth to a two-dimensional character and at least partially saves a movie that was dying on its feet. Despite this though she alone is not enough to salvage an overlong plot with more holes in it than Swiss cheese.6/10 "},{"Title":"Get rid of the crazy guy!","Date":"15 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Potentially, this film could have been far better. Although parts were indeed chilling, timing was bad and cliches evident throughout. Having seen Cate Blanchett in many films, most memorably 'Elizabeth', I would have thought her performance to be excellent. However, I was hardly bowled over by her portrayal of Annie Wilkins, single mother and clairvoiant. She was good, but not memorable. In my eyes, Hilary Swank is a gifted actress who's role in this movie was sadly minimal. Swank, who played Valerie Barksdale, an abused timid wife who depends on the psychic readings of Annie, was great. Little mannerisms made her character so believable, and I admired her for playing a less than beautiful (highly unflattering) role. Keanu Reeves.....hmm I just wasn't getting that! Reeves plays Donnie Barksdale, a vile, detestable man who beats his wife continually and has a bad name throughout town. What with Keanu being a bit of a pretty boy, he rarely plays the bad guy, so in that way I suppose is type cast. He was reasonably good, but I just didn't didn't believe him. I guess 'The Matrix' kept on springing to mind! Katie Holmes has great potential. For an actress who is continuallly type cast as Joey Potter esque roles in crappy teen movies, this was refreshing. Ever so slightly OTT, butpromising none the less. I believed her to be the promiscous Jessica King and thought she was surprisingly good at playing the bad girl! The topless scene, although hardly gratuitous, was not particularly called for, but it managed to bring in a huge male audience I suppose! I don't think her taste in men quite fitted though.  My biggest complaint? The crazy guy!! What the hell?! He annoyed me so much I can barely remember his name, I think it was bud! Why Annie felt sorry for him I don't know, she welcomed him into her life after he tried to whip her and burn his own father. He was stereotypically bad at playing the nut, and man would I like to delete him from the film! The imagery was at times boring, but flashbacks intense and at times scary. The South was a good place to set it. The ending could have been better, the killer could have been more believable and the crazy guy should have been axed at the beginning. Far from perfect, but perfectly entertaining and good in parts. Glints of talent apparent throughout.

It just takes too long for the movie to get going. As a viewer you're not getting involved with the characters, just with the 'whodunit'-part.A second point is that it is just another movie about supernatural things. There was The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, Bless The Child, Unbreakable. 'The Gift' felt like a good concept being exploited.The movie is good for a few scares and a few twists with regard to the plot, but offers little more. There are a few good performances Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank. The other performances are not worth mentioning, but it's still very pleasant to see Katie Holmes walking across the screen.I don't want to talk anyone out of going to see the movie, but I can assure you, there are better movies to watch. I'd give this movie 6/10.

The film was great from the start to about ten minutes from the end when it began to fall apart, mainly due to Raimi's efforts to fit a 'twist' in that ultimately didn't gel. But this is almost my only criticism.The thing that really made this film work was the casting, most notably Cate Blanchett. She looked luminous and really anchored the film and held it together. She portrayed her character with real sympathy, displaying the confusion and pain her gift has caused her, but never allowed her to fall apart or appear weak. She was a strong, credible yet fragile character.Keanu Reeves did a little less well and those looking for evidence that the man can act will have to wait longer I'm afraid. His character, Donnie Barksdale, is required to do little more than shout and look menacing which is all Keanu can do really. That'll be him perfectly suited to his character then.All together the cast, including Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes, does great, with the one exception being Hilary Swank who is woefully underused as Donnie's long suffering wife. Special mention also has to go to Giovanni Ribisi who excelled as troubled mechanic Buddy Cole. It's about time he started getting more recognition in Hollywood and hopefully now's the time.Overall it's a film I recommend to anyone looking for a good spinetingler. Not too gory, so I was surprised by the 18 cert it got here in Ireland. It's not quite as jumpy as What Lies Beneath either, but it doesn't really set out to be. What it is is a good old fashioned chiller eerie, slowburning, character driven and definitely worth the admission fee.

Cate Blanchett decided to show her flexibility once again( its a shame she didn't get more recognition for her brilliant performance in Talented Mr. Ripley). The shock of this film however lies in Giovanni Ribisi. I admit to paying little attention to him before...but this was quite showy role for him. Oscar worthy? Most definitely but its doubtful he will be nominated. Hillary Swank made a wise decision in her role also. It took me a while to settle down and realize it was her with long hair. Katie Holmes ventures into a brave new world with this one. I wish we could have seen more of Rosemary Harris. Her skills never fail to amaze me. Kinnear also did a great job. I was least impressed with keanu Reeves. I don't know what it is about Keanu. It just seems like despite his role, he always seems to throw off that Bill and Ted appearance to me.

It was killing me.  Now that it was released nationwide, i finally got the chance to watch this incredible movie.  The direction by Sam Raimi is the best i've seen him do, and i'm glad he is being taken seriously now-a-days.  The acting is just as good.  Of course the talk of the town is Cate Blanchett, and she deserves much attention, because she is truly a blessing to the acting community, and doesn't go over the top and overshadow the rest of the cast and the direction.  Usually, whenever i saw Keanu Reeves in a movie, i had a hard time taking him seriously.  I always viewed him as Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (you know what i'm talking about)...but this time around, i didn't think that, i saw him as a very talented person, doing a great job as the abusive husband.  Giovanni Ribisi should be well noted for his role as a mechanic with many childhood problems tearing at his adult mind, he was incredible.  Everyone else did equally as well, like Katie Holmes and Greg Kinnear, complementing the story and acting in a way that it was like they were one with the character (i know that sounds corny).  The plot is not deathly original, but the ending threw me off guard, and the pace more than made up for it. With such appropriate acting and the taut direction and cinematography, i believe this to be one of the best movies i've seen in a while.  There is a scene so perfect i was in complete awe.  Cate's character comes out of her house, inspecting something, and she looks up and sees Katie floating below the branches of a tree, swimming in the air.  Great. Highly Recommended.

Zener Cards are never used for this purpose. They were designed for use in card-guessing experiments with a sender looking at a card and a recipient trying to use his powers of ESP (if any) to guess (as shown correctly in the film Ghost Busters).

In 35 years of psychical research I have never come across anyone using Zener cards for predictive or clairvoyant purposes and there is no suggestion that they would work, even with gifted psychics.

It actually is one of the most predictable thrillers I've seen it my life, yet there isn't one dull or annoying moment to find in the entire film. Thanks to the stylish directing skills of Sam Raimi and the multi-talented all-star cast, the Gift is brought up to a higher dimension. You forgive the plot for being weak and you accept the twists, even though you see them coming from miles away, just because it's beautifully shot and edited flawless. The film is appropriately set in a nearly forsaken town, suffering from poverty and redneck-behavior. Cate Blanchett plays a widow who takes care of her three sons all by herself. For gaining a little more money, she reads the future of several town inhabitants through cards. When the beautiful daughter of a rich businessman is missing, her father and future husband come to seek help. As said before, this main plot synopsis is inferior to the tense settings and the deep emotional character portraits. We learn that there are multiple, severely troubled minds living in this town and their stories are much more fascinating than the murder-mystery (which isn't that much of a mystery). Cate Blanchett is one of the most solid and charismatic actresses at the moment and that is stated once more, here in The Gift. She's being supported by one of the greatest casts ever, including Hillary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, Gregg Kinear, Katie Holmes and even Keanu Reeves in his most diabolical to date. To end up a flawless cast, there are adorable little roles by J.K Simmons (as the macho policeman) and Michael Jeter (as the despicable lawyer).Sam Raimi directs The Gift very strict and manages to set a deeply depressing tone. The tempo is slow and the scares are limited, but the wholesome is pretty atmospheric and that's what counts most, I think. The most interesting aspects however, are the spooky visions and nightmarish dreams Cate Blanchett suffers from in The Gift. To me, these ghoulish sequences of morbidity are the undeniable evidence that Raimi still is a devoted horror-director in the first place. The dark shots of the lake by night and the frightening image of the fiddler portray Raimi's real capacity as a storyteller. I hope he'll return to horror soon.or at least continues to make macabre supernatural thrillers. If the complete above-written review didn't convince you to rent The Gift just yet, I might end by mentioning that the gorgeous Katie Holmes shows a lot more flesh here, then she did in 10 boring seasons of Dawson's Creek.

Great flick! Later I discovered that Billy Bob Thornton was one of the writers (or something?)--- and was pleasantly surprised. He was a good actor, and he showed great promise as a movie maker (check out Sling Blade Primary Colors, and even his bit part in the horrible Armageddon). But then his decent into Hollywood Party-fluff and Celeb Pose-O-Rama in the tabloids for a few years sort of took him off the map, serious artist-wise. And his dalliance with 2-dimensional Angela Jolie, and all the other tedious Celeb Bulls*** lifestyle stuff had made me wonder if his talent was gone. Had he become yet another used to be that burned out and now only appears on TV in lame-o crap such as Hollywood Squares or at celeb charity ego-fests? NO! The Gift would indicate that Billy Bob is back with us, and that is a good thing.The Gift is a suspense drama, or something. Kind of a thriller, but the events are less important than the characters' relationship to the events. I suppose not knowing the ending in advance would give a degree of excitement--- but one could see this movie a second time and still enjoy the performances.The supernatural touch was just right--- hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions, of people have just such visions at some time, usually unbidden. What struck me as accurate in this movie was the emphasis on how such visions are indeed no different than regular sights. One begins to understand that having a vision is no different than looking out a window--- you see stuff. The meaning you derive from what you see is purely subjective, however. Who you fundamentally are is still the backdrop against which you then undertake understandings or behaviors, whether you are seeing physical objects or meta-physical objects. The movie subtly brings this out as well. Cate's visions don't propel the plot, nor are they critical to the movie itself--- it is her relationship to the visions that is the movie's core. This relationship is also the kind of thing that many, many people contend with daily, in the real world.Overall, great movie! "},{"Title":"Eh, The Gift.

I also found Reeves very interesting in a strong and well-executed departure from his usual roles.

Halle Berry is proof enough that this doesn't make you immune to mediocrity (Gothika) or all-out awfulness (Catwoman), but the lesson to be learned here is that lightning doesn't strike twice.Though 'The Gift', like 'Sling Blade', follows the Southern Gothic conventions, and explores some pretty dark themes, such as familial abuse and mental illness, the mystery element of the film is so clumsily executed that it undermines the more interesting and effective drama of the piece. I'm not actually sure if I found it so easy to identify with clairvoyant Annie (Cate Blanchett), because she was a well-written character or because I was also able to make accurate predictions, not only about the correct identity of the killer, but the entire narrative structure of the film within the first five minutes. By the time the principle cast have all been introduced, you will know who will be offed, who will be wrongfully accused of said offing and who actually did the offing. So if you insist on actual 'mystery', steer clear. That said, the film has redeeming features, mostly to do with the cast. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as always as Annie, imbuing the character with a quiet dignity as she is repeatedly mocked and sneered at for her gift. Matching her is Giovanni Ribisi as her tragically disturbed friend Buddy. The scene in which he avenges himself upon an abuser is truly sickening. Ribisi is an extremely versatile actor and handles the intensity of his character. Rounding out the stand-out performances is an actor not generally known for his versatility or intensity Keanu Reeves. While he usually appears as a somewhat animated piece of cardboard, as the repulsive wife-beater Donnie, Reeves is on terrifying form. Intimidating not only to the other characters but to the audience, Reeves method seems to be when he's bad, he's very very good; when he's good he's wooden. Hilary Swank is effectively pathetic as his down-trodden wife, but, this being the deep south, Swank is saddled with a hilariously awful she-mullet wig, so bad that no degree of pathos can transcend the unintentional comedy. Despite a quartet of excellent performances, it's thanks to Dawson's Creeker Katie Holmes that this film is remembered. Referenced in 'Harold and Kumar', Holmes does indeed bare her chest. Given her overzealous southern accent and rather poor attempt to add depth to the 'village bicycle', Holmes should be thankful that this is the only thing people can remember about her role in this film. Greg Kinnear should also be thankful, as he is incredibly bland in this film, which is strange given that he is usually quite engaging. But this thankless, underwritten role is overshadowed by the other characters.What makes this film so disappointing is the quality of the actors involved; they all deserve better than this. Particularly Reeves, who wasted a rare, excellent performance on such mediocrity.

But it's disappointing to see her give such an interesting performance in such a poor film. In fact, I would even separate her performance from the dull character she is given to work with.The female characters in the film are all victims. The men are all basically evil - or stupid. Without exception.Not even the main character is allowed to be very strong. Most of her visions are misleading or basically wrong. She goes to help Giovanni Ribisi's character, only to watch him suffer even more. And the viewer along with him.What was Sam Raimi thinking? There is more style in his Evil Dead movies. Dare I say it, more passion and energy in them, too.Only two visuals in the whole film are worthy of him - the sped-up fiddler and the woman in the tree.

It could've been a better movie if some attention to Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO and REAR WINDOW would've been paid. A better plot twist would've been for the murdered fiancee to have been found in a car trunk, a la murdered Marian in the PSYCHO swamp/dump.  Also, some more attention to how law enforcement can be helpful instead of just obtuse could be learned from REAR WINDOW.  The 2000 film is quite quirky with some of its casting but I found its primary strengths the ethereal performance of Cate Blanchett and the manic unpredictability of Giovanni Riblisi.  The director, Sam Raimi, demonstrates a characteristic way of tipping his hand in a double cross kind of way here but I had guessed the not-so-smart ending regardless.  The film is highly spooky in regard to water dripping and the non-traditional use of ESP cards; I found it to be also non-stereotypical as far as the parent taking responsibility for what the kid needs supervision on.  The courtroom scenes, however, seemed a bit plagiarized in my opinion (a flip-flop of the innocent defendant in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD).  The back-story of the family and their grief deserves some expansion; is there a sequel possible here?  The extras on the DVD are excellent; I highly recommend the making of documentary.

I still don't know if I can ever forgive Mr. Reeves for his hideously bad southern accent in 'The Devil's Advocate'.  But, I grudgingly admit that he was on target with his performance as Donnie Barksdale.  You hated the little weasel, and you were supposed to.   Being from a small southern town, the characters in this film could've been my neighbors growing up.  Ms. Blanchett's performance was magnificent  - she didn't over or under do one single thing in even one of her scenes.  You had sympathy from her from the word go.  Hillary Swank WAS the (unfortunately) typical battered wife.The cinematography and editing of the film were at once strikingly familiar and goose-bump creepy.  Kudos to the director and crew.  As aforementioned, being a 'fringe' movie afficionado, the overriding reason for my interest in the film was its writers.  Mr.'s Thorton and Epperson did not disappoint. They are one fantastic writing team.  A friend watching this movie with me (who by the way is NOT a Billy Bob Thorton fan) had to admit it was good.

And yes, there are some brief scary moments.  Yet, it's nothing new...it's what I call stupid scary, you know, the stuff we've all seen in What Lies Beneath, etc.  So to make a long review short, to watch this movie, you have to get past a few things.  First, Keanu Reeves.  No matter how much people insinuate his growth as an actor, I just don't see it- there easily coul dhave been at least ten other actors that could have easily of been cast as a brutal, racist, wife-beating redneck and pull off some of the dialouge which Thorton's script leaves somewhat to be desired.  Second, the long, drawn out court-room scenes.  What can I say?  Excepting Grisham and Schumacher, these can get boring.  Thirdly, the predictability.  It's SOOO predictable.  I mean, Wes Craven should have been called to spice up the twists, at least put some twists in- and there is one, at the very end, but nothing you didn't see coming.  I was expecting something more like L.A. Confidential or Hitch-cocky, with a gothic twist.  Anyway, if you can get past all these things, look at the ACTING.  Here's where brilliant actors take a somewhat mediocre script, no, not mediocre, rather- I'd say more systematic, or trite, in other words, and weave some powerful drama.  The scenes between Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi carried me through this film- Ribisi gives a tour-de-fource preformance, very intense.  Even though I know it won't- there are too many potential nominees out there already- he should garner and Oscar nomination, but I doubt it'll happen, unfortunately. The pain with which Ribisi imbues his character is quite powerful, and very eloquent.  All in all, I'd give it seven outta ten stars.

No one was more surprised than me to discover that he can be utterly convincing playing against type as a truly vile, unsympathetic character, but he pulled it off with aplomb. We're not talking about his role as the leather-trousered pantomime villain Don John in Much Ado About Nothing; this is a thoroughly foul, menacing, sneering performance.Perhaps Sam Raimi is to thank for that performance - he is at his best directing among peeling paintwork and limpid pools - or we could blame previous directors for not challenging him enough. Either way, it shows that the man has a range that's usually underused.Katie Holmes (just 21 at the time of filming) is also pitch-perfect in a role that many actresses would shy away from, or try to inject some sympathy into. Holmes instead just exudes uncompromising conceit and arrogance, and kudos to her for that.Giovanni Ribisi seems to have cornered the market on unstable loners, and turns in his usual sterling performance, and Hilary Swank isn't really challenged by playing skinny white trash. I don't rate her as an actress, but at least this role allows her to play to her strengths i.e. annoying and ineffectual.If there's a weakness in the cast, it's Kinnear, who is just a soupcon too awkwardly wholesome, and occasionally doesn't seem to be in the same scene as the rest of the cast.Commenting on Cate Blanchett's performance would be superfluous. Watching her watching paint dry would be a compelling experience. She combines the raw edgy charisma and overwhelming talent of De Niro with the elegance and grace of Hepburn. Sublime, utterly, worshipfully sublime.With a cast and director like that, the actual plot is almost irrelevant, but it proceeds competently enough; the supernatural component is admirably underplayed and matter-of-fact, the whodunnit mystery is maintained until into the third act, and the (expected) twist at the end has a (unexpected) twist. The pacing remains fine all the way to the end, and the cinematography is simple enough to not get in the way of the story. The ever reliable Christopher Young scores the film in a very restrained and appropriate way.This, taken as a whole, is a masterclass in cinematography. Fine actors, directed by a perfectionist, telling a compelling story, shot, edited and scored in a way that compliments their strengths rather than distracting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second, and it doesn't get any better than that.
