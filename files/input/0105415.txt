[{"Title":"Little moments make 'Singles' one of my favorite movies","Date":"27 December 2004","Score":"42 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Cameron Crowe is one of those directors that thrive on making the little moments in movies the most memorable ones you'll ever see in your life. In 'Almost Famous,' it was when everyone on the Stillwater tour bus was singing along to Tiny Dancer. In 'Say Anything...' it was when Lloyd was driving around and proclaimed how his heart was exchanged for Diane's pen. Crowe also creates many memorable little moments in 'Singles,' which may not be the most famous movie he's made but it's one of the best.Even though 'Singles' is about twenty-somethings in Seattle, everything rang true to me as I am now, a teenager. The film is honest and real in how couples become couples and how relationships can fall apart. 'Singles' isn't at all mean-spirited or depressing in its portrayal of relationships or the dating game, so it might turn some people off who want to see the extremely ugly confrontations (a la 'Closer'). But the moments in 'Singles' that make it worth watching are when Linda (Kyra Sedgewick) gets to know Steve (Campbell Scott) while going through his record collection in his apartment. Or when Janet (Bridget Fonda) sneezes and gets a bless you from someone she (and the audience) would least expect.Everything about 'Singles' is great. The cast, the music and the truth behind the movie will bring a smile to your face.

An oft-heard criticism of this film is that it's not an authentic portrayal of the Gen-X culture of the early 90's, but I've yet to see that done well in any film.More importantly, the film never claims to be a Gen-X film.  It's set in Seattle during the height of Seattle Sound but the cast is made up of driven professionals and slackers alike.  It's more of a cross-section of 20-somethings, not a focus on Gen-X or Grunge.  The characters, settings and themes are all to a certain degree idealized, which is a staple of Crowe's style.  Where this film's charm really lies is in capturing the spirit of the early-90's and the anti-classist sentiment embraced by teens and young professionals in opposition to the status is everything 1980s.  It's nice to remember a time when being socially and environmentally conscious was actually fashionable for a time.  Sadly we all got sucked into the dot-com thing and realized we can be just as bad as our parents.

Friendship. Companionship. These are the themes obviously explored in Cameron Crowe's early movie Singles, which revolve around the love lives of singles (naturally) living in a common apartment. We follow each of the protagonist Steve (Campbell Scott), Janet (Bridget Fonda), Cliff (Matt Dillon) and Linda (Kyra Sedgwick) through their ups and downs in dealing with the weird little emotion called Love.Well, not quite. As we know early in the film, each have problems and their own peculiar viewpoints on the dating scene. We see Linda meeting and breaking up with a Spanish student she was so into, after seeing through his lies and sweet talk. It hurts, and she doesn't want to be hurt again. Steve too have had a bad experience, and (I can identify with this) swears off relationships for the next few years, deciding instead to focus on career. As Fate would have had it, these two will meet at the unlikeliest places and get into a relationship.Cliff, an aspiring rocker, seemed to have taken his girlfriend Janet, for granted. And I think this is something that most people can identify with. When efforts go unappreciated, or when things go mundane, the question is, do you want to bail out? And when you do, what next? Would you give the ex another chance? If you do, how would you approach it? It's fun watching a movie that was made 13 years ago, and you wonder about how the initiating and sustaining of a relationship back then happened without technology which we are so used to these days. Back then, a mobile phone was a cordless one, and there is no such thing as an instant message, but an answering machine. Where Speed Dating was unheard of, but Video Dating was the rage (check out the funny Tim Burton cameo).You wonder too about the career of the leads. Campbell Scott was noticed by many after his pairing with Julia Roberts in the movie Dying Young, but after this, seemed to have vanished into obscurity. And so has Kyra Sedgwick. Only Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda are still around, somewhere.Oh, the music. Peppered throughout the movie is the wonderful musical tracks that always seem to punctuate a particular moment succinctly. I like Tarantino and Crowe movies because music plays an integral part of the entire experience, and Singles too had excellent ballads blended with grunge rock, say, Pearl Jam (before they made it huge), which also made an appearance.It's a beautiful, quirky little movie with excellent identifiable dialogue, music, humour, and a younger cast of stars whom we know today, thrown into situations that everyone in love would have experienced.

Set amidst the backdrop of early '90s Seattle, the film itself often takes a backseat to its excellent soundtrack including some of grunge rock's best. However, Crowe's signature charm highlighting the little things of personal relationships amid big cities and big music earns this one a place alongside gems like Say Anything and Almost Famous.The film's title speaks over a range of topics within the film. The core characters find themselves single, living in single apartments, or even cutting singles in bands. Yet single relationship status above all helps to form the meat of the film, carrying us through the parallel paths of friends bound together by their apartments and the music they enjoy. The wrestling match between commitment and escape, love and friendship underpins every moment of every conversation.Music lover Crowe's early days as a journalist for Rolling Stone magazine have rubbed off in many memorable ways over the span of his career. Often the sounds of his movies speak more potently than the actors, or augment their performance (we all remember John Cusack's Peter Gabriel moment in Say Anything). Peppered throughout Singles are fantastic songs chronicling the swell of Seattle grunge and alternative rock, including club performances by Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Three members of Pearl Jam make delicious cameos as Matt Dillon's band mates, and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden even makes an appearance. Perhaps the best scene in the film occurs when Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick sit silently over the pieces of a broken plate, both utterly entranced with May this Be Love by Jimi Hendrix.Admittedly the film has its flaws, owing mostly to the clunky nature of incorporating several different parallel plot lines into a film of this length. Some characters are squeezed in with marginal and ultimately forgettable results. However, Crowe's ability to forge the very fabric of what people love about each other and their lives keeps Singles afloat above other romantic comedies. Simply put, he nudges our own memory bank with a combination of music and storytelling that allows us to connect with his characters.

But funnily enough, this flick was in production BEFORE that scene took off. As a result what seemed like cashing in was actually foresight.The relationships unfolding in the apartment complex were done realistically and the scenes involving the band will be enjoyed by anyone into that era's music. And Campbell Scott almost steals this film. His idea for the city was actually a good one.And yes that is 3 members of Pearl Jam as Matt Dillons backup band.

These directors are John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Buehler), Savage Steve Holland (Better Off Dead) and Cameron Crowe (Say Anything). All of these films are characterized by witty, tongue-in-cheek dialogue (satirical but not sarcastic) and surreal, music-video-like gags such as, I dunno, a pigburger patty grabbing a guitar and rocking out to Van Halen's Everybody Wants Some.When the 80s ended, apparently so did their unique and idiosyncratic brand of humour. John Hughes stopped directing in 91, and Savage Steve's last feature film was also in 91. Cameron Crowe evolved into a different style with his hugely successful 30-something comedy Jerry Maguire. Here, folks, in 1992 I believe we have the last (and possibly best) of the great 80s growing-up films. If you've seen the others I mentioned, don't consider your life complete until you see Singles.Even with Crowe's 1989 Say Anything, focusing on high school graduation, Crowe was the most mature of the bunch yet every bit as quirky and hilarious. Singles covers the next age, 23-to-27, establishing careers and facing grown up problems but still as wild and emotionally reckless as high school kids. I suppose some of us carry that same crazy recklessness late into life which is what makes this movie great for oddballs of all ages.The movie is perfectly cast with Cambell Scott in the lead (think John Cusack but a sharper dresser), Kyra Sedgwick as a slightly flakey control freak (maybe an early version of Tina Fey in 30 Rock), and a host of awesome supporting characters Bridget Fonda as the slightly neurotic groupie who refuses to admit that she's a groupie, Sheila Kelley (remember the hot paralegal in LA Law?) who plays a goofy, insecure maneater, Eric Stoltz (Caprica, Pulp Fiction, The Prophecy) in the oddest role he's ever played an obnoxious mime who won't shut up, and of course the show-stealer Matt Dillon as the not-so-bright artist/rockstar whose magnum opus is a song called Touch Me, I'm Dick.Speaking of rock music, cameo appearances, as well as performances, include... are you paying attention, folks...?Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard from Pearl JamChris Cornell and the gang from SoundgardenThomas Doyle singer for TAD (You got the wrong number, lady, but I'll be right over)Pat Nizzio singer for The SmithereensEveryone from Alice in ChainsJeremy Piven (Ari Gold in Entourage) as the funniest checkout clerk you've ever seenBill Pullman as a nerdy breast implant surgeonPaul Giamatti in one of his first speaking roles ever (What?!!)Cameron Crowe's motherand none other than director TIM BURTON as Bryan the next Martin Scorcese (pronounced Score-seeez haha)And if that's not enough to make you want to rush out and rent this movie, don't forget the killer soundtrack with tunes by the aforementioned bands plus Jane's Addiction, Smashing Pumpkins, Paul Westerberg (The Replacements) and others I'm probably forgetting.The story itself is fantastic, not only hilarious but probably the most insightful peek into romance disorder since When Harry Met Sally. This comedy has it all. See it, see it again. Live it. And praise the gods of 80s comedy that we were given this final masterpiece of a bygone era.

However, the movie itself is a bit of a letdown. It tries to bring out the chaos of twentysomething love. It doesn't have great leads for the primary love story. It's strange that I always thought Bridget Fonda was the lead in the movie probably due to the poster. I remember her more than the primary leads Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott.

Like his directorial debut, Say Anything, Singles brings us great music, a cast of unknowns we all know now, and a story with heart and laughs. Maybe it just goes to where I am in my life at the moment, but this movie really resonated with me. The fact that life relies so much on luck, whether good or bad, to shape our personal relationships, our career, and our loves is quite prevalent. Sometimes it takes an accident, an event that you were never looking for, to bring two people together, or rekindle something that was thought to be lost forever. If only I lived in Seattle right now and it was the early-90s, I wouldn't mind going through it all as much as in Buffalo. At least I could go to a club show and see acts like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Citizen Dick. Now that was a music scene.Singles is about just that, a group of twenty-somethings going through that transition after college, beginning careers and looking for meaningful relationships. Most of the characters live in a small apartment complex and are very close friends, (I guess you can look past the fact that the entire five person building consists of that one age group). There is the rocker working four jobs and not able to see the perfect girl standing right in front of him (Matt Dillon); the girl who is working off her loans to go back to school and make something of her life (Bridget Fonda); the guy who has found success in work but not in life finally running into the girl of his dreams in the one place he never thought he'd find her (Campbell Scott); and that girl, tired of the games and heartbreak, trying to open herself up to him, someone she cares for, but is too afraid to risk losing everything again (Kyra Sedgwick). Each of these actors is fantastic and adds just the right amount of quirk and individuality to the film. We all know people like these and I know I started to superimpose myself with my friends into the story because it has or could happen to us. Sure it is a different decade and yes the film is dated in that way (garage openers as the new varsity letter jacket?) but at its core, this could be any year.I also really like the direction by Crowe. He is a writer and rock music fanatic by trade and attempts to infuse a lot of his own sensibilities to the work. There is a novice quality still at play and it just makes everything that much more believable and tenuous. Without the gloss and polish you feel as though it all is transpiring right before your eyes. Even his use of breaking the fourth wall, for no apparent reason whatsoever, worked for me. Splitting the film into vignettes is a nice touch too, but it is the narration straight to the camera that intrigues. I would love to say a show like Saved By the Bell owes much to this film, but sadly it predates it. So, maybe Crowe appropriated the gimmick himself, either way it works as a way of seeing inside the leads and flesh them out a bit more. The payoff of Scott yelling out the window for Dillon to be quiet as he was talking is great. He's talking to us as an aside fictionally, but I guess the guy needs his concentration. I even liked the spotting blatant material objects for each character, especially books. One is by Lester Bangs, (a future role infused in Crowe's Almost Famous); Sedgwick, of course, has Franny & Zooey (a superior novel in my opinion to Catcher in the Rye as she is looking for her Holden Caufield); and Fonda has Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, as should every aspiring architect.And the cameos&#151;how can I not mention the plethora of bit parts, all priceless in their own way? We have the soundtrack's performers sprinkled throughout from Dillon's band Citizen Dick consisting of Pearl Jam's Vedder, Ament, and Gossard to Chris Cornell enjoying Fonda's car get the bass kicked out of it on the street corner. The great Bill Pullman as the lost plastic surgeon, overwhelmed by career success yet unable to have fun; Eric Stoltz as the philosophical mime that doesn't mind talking; and Jeremy Piven as the loud-mouth fan of Scott during his DJ-ing days (who else can mix Elvis Costello with Public Enemy?) are each a joy. The real knee-slapper, though, is mister Oscar-nominated actor Paul Giammati with his one lined, prolonged make-out session in the diner. I was on the floor laughing.

Singles is clearly one of his best.  In short, the film revolves around six twenty-somethings who live in Seattle, and search for the right relationship while trying to figure out who they actually are.  Crowe is always in touch with his audience, and is somehow able to capture what they have gone through during some period of their life. Campbell Scott really stands out in this one as Steve, an upwardly mobile employee of the Department of Transportation.  Steve is just like you and me (I'm willing to bet we all know somebody like him).  He's nice, relatively easy going, smart, hip, motivated and painfully in need of the right relationship.  Steve is the classic example of a the nice guy who doesn't finish last, but can't get what he wants.  Scott is brilliant in his portrayal of Steve and is somehow so honest when showing his true feelings.  Matt Dillon (another stand out) on the other hand is Cliff Poncier, a wanna be rock star (and a poor one at that) who has three jobs, including being a delivery boy for a florist.  Without digressing into the plot, let's just say that Dillon/Poncier is the classic example of a guy who doesn't realize what he has until its gone.  Dillon's comedic timing in this film is impeccable.  You often wait to see what this good natured clown is up to next (for those of you who have seen the film installing the stereo in Janet's car, the answering machine message, etc.).Singles is one of those films that you relate to all too well.  The cast maintains a very fine, cohesive balance filled with convincing performances by all.

Taking place in grunge-era Seattle, this fun movie is about a group of friends and their search for love.	Like most other Cameron Crowe directed movies, Singles fully develops its main characters.

It made them seem more realistic, more universal. 	The soundtrack was also great, including Smashing Pumpkins, Alice in Chains, and lighter songs by Paul Westerberg.

Exploring the world of dating for 20 somethings in the 90s, this flick works really well by not going down the trodden part of establishing a drama and a solution, but rather letting the narrative flow be determined by the character's lives in a way that doesn't seem forced. With a nice cast of lovable and ratable characters, this makes for a good one time watch, with a nice sprinkling of humour and period pieces. The struggle during making a romcom often is to avoid being cheesy and yet manage to induce a happy feeling in the viewer, which this movie achieves.

This is one of them. Unfortunately, this is his most underrated. I guess one of the reasons why it is underrated is because this is set in Seattle during the Grunge explosion. When everybody had long hair, wore flannel, had ripped jeans, wore fanny-packs and listened to cassette walkmen. I love 90's rock and grunge, so I loved this movie. The Seattle scene makes three ordinary love stories extra cool and fun. Bridget Fonda tries pleasing her rockstar boyfriend, Matt Dillon; Kyra Sedgewick and Campbell Scott contemplate commitment; Sheila Kelley tries video dating to find her perfect man. As I said earlier, the grunge style and music is what sets this apart. Chris Cornell from Soundgarden appears as a mime and later performs with his band; Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard appear as matt Dillon's band mates and Alice In Chains performs at a nightclub. If you don't like grunge, you will at least like the stories. If you like grunge, this is the movie for you.

However, since he's still collecting royalties off it, I'm guessing his relative lack of fame doesn't really upset him.I just watched this for the first time in almost 20 years, and was rewarded with a decent (if understated) viewing experience. This movie sat on a shelf for 18 months until Warner Brothers finally released it in Sept. of '92, and were rewarded with a modest hit. By that point, the Seattle music scene had exploded, with Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains all huge national acts. In retrospect, the movie may have been a bigger hit if it would have focused primarily on all of the emerging bands instead of quirky twenty-somethings, but then it wouldn't have been called Singles, right.Once again, I'm not going to discuss the plot, as it's been hashed over several times here. Let's just say that if you want to see what the origins of grunge and its club scene looked like, this is a great place to start.P.S.-of all the great actor cameos everyone has talked about in this movie (Stoltz, Giamotti, Burton, Horton, Garber, Piven, Pullman, Skerritt, and even Cameron Crowe himself), the one that freaked me out the most was Christopher Masterson playing Steve at age 10. Being that he was probably in the 5th grade when he shot his scenes, I wonder if he can remember any of it today.P.S.S.-Bridget...COME BACK!!!!!! "},{"Title":"A pretty ordinary movie about relationships, with great memorable cameos of the Pearl Jam dudes, Chris Cornell and Tim Burton!","Date":"25 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I always considered Cameron Crowe's SINGLES as something I really had to see. My one and only connection to it the grunge. As a huge grunge fan (especially of Pearl Jam) I've had since years ago a sort of pending meeting with Crowe's second feature. Today I finally sat down I watched it on DVD. I have to say, if you want something more related to music, something like, I'm pretty much guessing as I have seen only parts of it (the Tiny Dancer part for sure), Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS, or something that really puts you in the grunge scene, you'll disappointed. To be fair, it made think in that music-related talk with Quentin Tarantino from the Collector's Edition of the PULP FICTION Soundtrack. And that is because Tarantino says this what I don't wanna do is, and I've see it happen in a lot of movies, where they just turn up the soundtrack to create a false energy, or in particularly to create a sense of period. They're not investing in the picture. OK, it's the sixties, we play a lot of sixties songs and that will create the period. To me that's cheap, like listening to the radio and watching a movie at the same time. They don't really go together. In this case, I wouldn't go as far as to call the use of some Pearl Jam songs, and the scenes of Alice In Chains and Soundgarden playing at some bar, cheap, but they definitely don't create something special, something that, like I said, really put us in early 90s Seattle. For instance, it's only people dancing in a club to a Pearl Jam song (always great to hear Pearl Jam though). And yes, maybe that's just early 90s Seattle, and yes I'm caring too much about the setting of the story but to be more fair, I wouldn't have seen a romantic comedy by Cameron Crowe if not for the grunge thing. I mean, something like Crowe's SAY ANYTHING&#x85; is not the kind of movie I'm always looking forward to check out. So, the level of disappointment that SINGLES gives to you may certainly vary. I mean, you can enter here not knowing anything about the grunge setting, or you can enter here seeking for a movie about early 90s Seattle musicians (maybe thanks to the image of Matt Dillon with the grunge look and his guitar). In my case, and like I said, it did disappointed me in the setting thing but in the end I really can't say this is something anybody should runaway from, that anybody should avoid at all costs. It's a pretty darn normal relationships movie, simply as that. It almost never feels false in that regard, which is certainly the best thing. My main point here is that pretty much this whole story doesn't go hand-to-hand with the period it is setting in. Sure, Matt Dillon's character Cliff has a grunge band (you just gotta like a whole lot this character! Now, a song like Touch Me, I'm Dick is about... what?; Cliff Well, I think Touch Me, I'm Dick, in essence speaks for itself. I think that, you know, that's basically what the song is, um... about... is about, you know... I think a lot of people might think it's actually about, you know, My name is Dick, and, you know, you can touch me, but, I think, you know, it can be seen either way) and the other main characters (played by Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick, Bridget Fonda, Sheila Kelley and Jim True-Frost &#x96;nice to see Prez from The Wire&#x96;; the acting is fine) go out to bars to listen to Alice in Chains (there's a scene with main character Steve, and Sedgwick's character Linda, and his record collection, Hendrix, the Clash, you know), to dance to State of Love and Trust, but are they really Generation X characters? Well, the main couple in the movie, Steve and Linda, ain't. Like I said, it is an ordinary relationships movie, that is entertaining and that probably you can enjoy more than me. If I will remember SINGLES for something is definitely for its great cameos Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament (is just fun with these guys! They play the band mates of Cliff's band. Eddie is the drummer of the band, by the way), Chris Cornell (totally great, hilarious! Sort of reminded me Jay and Silent Bob from CLERKS an other Kevin Smith movies I have yet to see) and Tim Burton (as a video maker who is only like the next Martin Scorsese!). So, memorable details in an entertaining if totally ordinary love story&#x85; that would be my summary of SINGLES. Oh, and the soundtrack is certainly great, but some of the background music during the film is not (think of the opening theme of Friends and you'll get the idea. When I thought this I didn't know that this movie became sort of the basis for Friends, if wikipedia doesn't lie Warner Bros Television tried immediately to turn Singles into a television series. When Crowe balked at the notion, the company proceeded with the idea, engaged a new writing and directing team, changing elements and the name to Friends).

While it may have had some comic relief, it was not enough to keep me entertained. The best part of this film was the soundtrack. It was an upbeat mixture of grunge and rock. It featured such bands as `Pearl Jam', `Alice in Chains' and `R.E.M.' The music fit perfect for the time. Not only did I enjoy the music but also I respected the artists. It was kind of disrespect to the artists to place it with such a low quality film.This movie was about a group of 20-something who were connected one way or another, not just by mutual friends or acquaintances but also by the fact they were all single in Seattle. In this Emerald City search Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) is a down to earth guy who wants to lessen the traffic load by making a `Supertrain'. Along the way he meets an anxious Linda Powell (Kyra Sedgewick) who is looking for love in all the wrong places. Together they battle unruly neighbors and pregnancy among some other small hurdles. Debbie Hunt (Sheila Kelly) and her off and on boyfriend Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon) battle trust, monogamy and appreciation for each other.The transitions between scenes are interesting pictures, which in fact are foreshadowing. The filmography is exceptional and tasteful. The actors performed up to the bar which unfortunately wasn't set high at all. I think Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgewick performed well considering and had good chemistry. Matt Dillon represented a typical early 90's guy living in Seattle.

The entire dating plot becomes rather self-indulgent, though the more entertaining one is between Janet and Cliff, since Cliff is such an oblivious moron.And, what is an early 90s Seattle-based movie without some music? This movie is partly advertised for it's soundtrack, which features Pearl Jam (the gorgeous Eddie Vedder and bassist Jeff Ahmet of Pearl Jam appear in several scenes as accompanying musicians in Cliff's band, Citizen Dick). Soundgarden has a stage scene as does Alice in Chains. They picked the creme of the crop of Seattle Grunge (but where's Nirvana?) to add some flavor to this somewhat lackluster movie. I've never been much a fan of Cameron Crowe films, anyways, which I think are often overrated (see Vanilla Sky). If for nothing else, I'd highly recommend it for fans of the Grunge Days because this is really a page from the Grunge Diaries. "},{"Title":"Love in the '90s?

There are some lines in movies that just stick with you. They are usually brief, but memorable. If for no other reason, see Singles for the cameo of Tim Burton as a video director for Expect the Best, a strange Seattle dating agency. Now to review the other 85 minutes of the movie. Singles is a romantic dramady about twenty-somethings who live mainly in the same building and follows them through the course of their on/off relationships. There are good points and bad points to Singles. I don't know where Cameron Crowe got the idea to make it a music movie, but it worked. The songs flow beautifully into the film. Paul Westerberg's songs are awesome, but sound the same. There are some funny jokes, a few great cameos, and it really makes you think about your love life. There are some weak points, however. Bridget Fonda's character, Janet Livermore, becomes VERY annoying, VERY fast. For instance- she asks her boyfriend if her breasts are too small for him, out of the blue, for no reason at the moment. The garage-door opener thing is odd, and some dialogue is completly pointless and stupid. Don't do this! Don't make me remember this chili dog forever! Remember it. Make that a historic chili dog. Alrighty. I would recommend this movie for those who are single and have been so for quite some time. Warning this film can be painful to watch if you're getting over a breakup. And remember, if you choose to find that special someone through a dating agency, if the director of your video wants 20 bucks instead of 10, scream, run from the building, and never look back.  ;-)   "},{"Title":"Illustrates the scene decently enough.","Date":"20 August 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This was an OK movie, liked it A lot when I first saw it actually, not the type of movie I'd see over and over-more like once every few years or so.

While it may have had some comic relief, it was not enough to keep me entertained. The best part of this film was the soundtrack. It was an upbeat mixture of grunge and rock. It featured such bands as `Pearl Jam', `Alice in Chains' and `R.E.M.' The music fit perfect for the time. Not only did I enjoy the music but also I respected the artists. It was kind of disrespect to the artists to place it with such a low quality film. This movie was about a group of 20-something who were connected one way or another, not just by mutual friends or acquaintances but also by the fact they were all single in Seattle. In this Emerald City search Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) is a down to earth guy who wants to lessen the traffic load by making a `Supertrain'. Along the way he meets an anxious Linda Powell (Kyra Sedgewick) who is looking for love in all the wrong places. Together they battle unruly neighbors and pregnancy among some other small hurdles. Debbie Hunt (Sheila Kelly) and her off and on boyfriend Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon) battle trust, monogamy and appreciation for each other.The transitions between scenes are interesting pictures, which in fact are foreshadowing. The filmography is exceptional and tasteful. The actors reached the expectations bar which unfortunately wasn't set high at all.

It is a very realistic view on singlehood. Quite honestly I did not like that stage of my life at all. Society imposes upon young lives a time for falling in love which somewhat coincides with the best years for procreation. As far I was concerned that clock would click forever and would still be single. That is why I like this movie so much. All the characters has their idiosyncrasies.  I like Cameron Crowe's (Jerry Maguire) fresh and spontaneous look on the topic. I like how Campbell Scott (The Spanish Prisoner) is always so natural in his parts sort of less is more. I like his style. Steve Dunne comes to Linda Powell Kyra Sedgwick (Something to Talks About) she has just about had it with the whole dating game and ignores him completely or perhaps she is just watching to see how hurt she is going to get this time. All I say is been there, done that.  The part played by Matt Dillon (Beautiful Girls) Cliff Poncier  is annoying because he is very eccentric. But I guess I just don't like loud music, and he ends up breaking the windows of his girl friend's car,  Bridget Fonda Janet Livermore (Doc Hollywood). I liked the role Bill Pullmann ( Sleepless in Seattle, Zero Effect) played  Doctor Jamison. He gives his patient advise in not having breast augmentation.

He combined both and the finished product was Singles. This isn't pulled off smoothly. I have been in an interesting mood lately, trying to view things that I remember getting bludgeoned over the head with through advertising until I finally gave in as a middle schooler/teenager. Singles is my latest project. The idea is to see if there was any real substance to these old films or if it's just cultural fluff and a sign of the times. Singles=cultural fluff.I won't deny that there is a special thrill in the first scene with Alice in Chains. And it is fun spotting Pearl Jam and Chris Cornell as youngsters. That thrill subsides pretty quickly when you find that you've entrapped yourself in a formulaic love story that tries to package itself as something modern.Opportunities for a serious edge were squandered. Bridget Fonda's character makes some interesting and independent choices, yet the script couldn't resist putting her back where she she started. A serious plot twist that developed between Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick was quickly and conveniently done away with, after only a few moments of screen time. The movie spends a few moments here and there at local concerts with the likes of Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, and pans over the writhing mosh pits in an effort to remind this that this is the new 90's style of being young. Does not work with this story. As attractive as Kyra Sedgwick is (and a decent actress) I would not have chosen her for the lead female role. Her personality and appearance to not fit the style of the movie, and she looks woefully out of place at an Alice in Chains concert, like she wandered out of an elementary school library to see what was going on. Is it worth a watch? Yes it is. There are some genuinely funny moments that I had missed as a kid, involving cameos by Jeremy Piven and Eric Stolz. Bridget Fonda is just adorable and her style holds up pretty well after 2 decades. However, from what I hear, we have Singles to thank for the parade of youth watching over the next 10-15 years, from Reality Bites to Friends, bringing us more and more white post college young adults exchanging remarks and looking stylish. And let's not forget the coffee shop. The question that begs is... Were Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden truly looking for a break through the big screen? I won't deny that this really helped a-list all those guys. Nirvana backed out. Is Chris Cornell ashamed? hmmm...

It would be like shooting a film involving the New York hip-hop movement of the eighties by shooting everything at Rockafeller Plaza and the Empire State building. To put it another way, nobody who listened to and appreciated grunge in '91 hung out at the films chosen 'recently-arrived to Seattle' Yuppie locations.In the area of story, at least Crowe found somebody with life experience to write, or assist in writing his next few screenplays. The entire story just screams out, I've been written by somebody whose life perspective was shaped exclusively by watching TV and lame movies. Really, the story is a movie-buffs daydream. There is nothing realistic about an entire apartment complex of single adults in cosmopolitan Seattle hanging out together. Only a freak would give more than a common 'hello' to their neighbour in closed Seattle urban life. The characters are very shallow, and the three intersecting love stories are dull and comically fake. If the story were about 18 year olds in a dorm, it would work. But people in their late 20's, with job titles reserved for people in their early forties, acting like immature 18 year olds, just doesn't work...... And the humour is as witty as a Friday night pre-teen sitcom, without the laughtrack.On the plus side, there was one funny moment in the entire film. But the three seconds of laughter is not worth your two hours (and I'm not going to give it away). However if you're a die hard fan of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains or the faces of Sub-Pop, and you get giggly like a little boy whenever you see your favourite band members on the screen, and you're not currently taking your prescription medication, then you just might enjoy this film.

It deals - albeit in a generally optimistic way - with people getting screwed over by relationships, and makes the point that the reason establishing a connection with someone is so hard is because, in love, everyone plays by their own rules... I feel as if I know this only too well from my personal life, and given the subject matter, I felt like I maybe should've identified a bit more. The focus on unifying threads together is never really strong though, and although the characters are likable, we never stay with them long enough to find if they'll ever straighten their problems out.It also leans rather too heavily on the music culture of the time, and the bleakness of grunge doesn't really mesh well with the larger sentiment that these are young people with their lives in front of them just trying to find their place in the world.The film does have its good points though. Matt Dillon is hilarious, and delivers (I think) one of the funniest comedic performances ever as a clueless band front-man trying to make it on the scene as he's weighed down by finding himself in a committed relationship... It's absolutely worth seeing the movie just for his turn alone, and it gave me a whole new esteem for him.The wider perspective for me though is that, in my opinion, Crowe peaked artistically with first Jerry Maguire and then Almost Famous; I wasn't at all impressed with Elisabethtown, and I get the sense that even his earlier work was just a fertile testing ground for his two more polished efforts later...

One other thing Campell Scott's coffee slurping in the opening scene sets the tone for this piece of grunge induced garbage. "}]
