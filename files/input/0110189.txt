[{"Title":"disappointing if you've heard their albums.","Date":"23 September 2007","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This movie could have been a lot funnier if only they didn't use almost the exact same dialogue from their prank calls. Seriously some of the scenes from the movie are almost word-for-word with the calls. If you haven't heard their jerky-isms (rubberbeck, sizzle-chest) then this might be funny to you. Anyway the movie is about two low-lifes from Queens, two late-20's guys who can't get a job who still live at home. They end up calling a random number which just happens to be a local mob boss. Johnny Brennan does his hilarious Frank Rizzo voice claiming to be childhood friends with the guy who becomes infuriated after being called fruity-a$$. (the only really funny scene.) Once they meet the boys in person, an arrogant local boy Brett Weir sees them at the same restaurant and clues the mafia in as to who the Jerky Boys really are. So the rest of the movie is basically them trying to outrun the mob. Some scenes following were okay, with a cameo by Ozzy Ozbourne and the NY hardcore band Helmet. In the end when the gang kidnaps Johnny's mom and fits her for a pair of cement shoes, Johnny and Kamal call the newspapers up to expose the mob. The end. A lot of people said the plot was clich√©d. Not really, I thought it worked good, it just wasn't EXECUTED properly. And by properly, I mean humorously. The first time I heard the call about the old man with the Mexican immigrant worker it was funny. I kicked him in his little hiney The second time it seemed rushed, like they had to create a scene where the actions would fit perfectly with the call. This one happens to be made over a call box on a warehouse where the bad guys are standing near, to distract them while the boys escape. Some of the actors, who have played distinguished, critically-acclaimed roles in other movies (Alan Arkin, Vincent Pastore, William Hickey) seem like they're having a REAL hard time saying their lines. They must have needed money. I won't tell you not to see it, because as far as i know it has not been released on DVD. And I can guarantee you can find it for a buck or two at almost ANY movie store. So if you have or haven't heard the prank call albums but you still want to see it, you'll only be a few bucks short if you don't like it.

Its not anything you should really have high expectations for when you start into it. That being said, compared to the bottom of the comedy barrel these days this movie is a worthwhile and entertaining entry. The supporting cast actually isn't too bad. Other reviewers have questioned the appearance of Alan Arkin in this film, and maybe it is weird, but whatever he's in it. So is Vincent Pastore (Big Pussy Bonpensiero from The Sopranos) and cameos from Tom Jones and Ozzy Osbourne (a particularly rare depiction of him when he still had some vital essence left and decked out in appropriate mid-90's high fashion.)Speaking of the the mid-90's, there's a lot of great footage of New York City in the years right before Giulianni started cleaning the place up. Anyways, the movie is funny. Its not the funniest movie ever, but the ad hominem attacks, creative profanity, and silly voices will make you laugh. Its nice to see their skits made into live action, even though the real genius of their humor on their tapes was that the calls were real and the calls in the movie are scripted. Its a solid B-grade comedy. If you're expecting more, you have the wrong idea.

I knew about them by the time I first came across a copy of this film for rent at a video store recently, but didn't know they had their own movie until then. Released in 1995, long before I was old enough to watch R-rated movies, The Jerky Boys is a comedy starring the two prank callers, John G. Brennan and Kamal Ahmed. By the time I watched this, I had heard many of their recorded prank calls (it seems they were falsely credited for several of the ones I heard, but most of them really were from the duo), and thought they were generally funny, but since I was aware of this film's lack of popularity, I wasn't surprised by its overall mediocrity.Johnny B. and Kamal are two lowlifes from Queens who have been making prank telephone calls since they were kids. John's mother warned the two of them what they would be like when they grew up if they didn't change their ways, and sure enough, they have since grown up and turned out to be exactly what she predicted, two unemployed idiots still living at home. Making prank calls is still a major hobby of theirs, and they've had certain jobs in the past, but due to their stupidity and incompetence, they didn't have them for long. Unfortunately for Johnny and Kamal, their prank calling gets them into serious trouble when they call the local mafia and Johnny pretends to be a crime boss from Chicago named Frank Rizzo, and the two of them then pose as two of Rizzo's hoodlums when they go to meet members of the Queens mob in person! They soon find that not only are the local mafia after them, so are the police! Shortly after I began to watch this 1995 flop, I did find myself laughing or at least smiling at times, but not enough to make me think it was a actually a good comedy, and I didn't care for the part with Johnny and Kamal (as kids) watching a boy getting in trouble with his mother after they prank called her, and what the mother says she'll do to her son when they get inside. None of the gags in this movie are among the most revolting I've ever seen, but one fairly lame scene is the one with hot dogs made from human bodies! Most of the film is basically just mediocre, unfunny, and boring. The plot also isn't that interesting, with the two pranksters getting into more and more trouble. I certainly did laugh at times, such as the drive-thru scene and the part where the main characters (the Jerky Boys playing themselves) steal a cab and Kamal poses as the cab driver. These laughs definitely weren't always just small ones, either. Still, for the vast majority of the film, I kept a straight face, and cannot give it a high rating.This silly comedy was apparently panned by critics and seems to be fairly obscure, but it seems that some Jerky Boys fans like it. However, it also appears many of those who have seen it think it's atrocious, and I'm sure a number of the duo's fans have been disappointed by this movie of theirs. As someone who has never listened to any of their albums from start to finish but has heard enough of their recorded pranks individually to be convinced that they know how to be funny, I sure would have been disappointed if I had expected this film to be as good. Apart from occasional funny moments (some very funny and some mildly amusing) and a cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne as the Band Manager, there was hardly anything in 1995's The Jerky Boys (a.k.a. The Jerky Boys The Movie) that appealed to me. If you're not a Jerky Boys fan at all, I suggest you skip this film, and if you are a fan, I can't imagine how you could watch this without finding anything in it funny at all (though you never know), but don't be surprised if you find that it doesn't live up to the duo's audio recordings.

To me these guys will always be the Kings of the prank call. I was literally in tears when I first heard the albums; so when I heard about a movie coming out I was psyched! I learned the movie was going to be a PG-13 and I was a little disappointed because the Boys are known for vulgarity. Upon seeing the movie I was entertained, it certainly had its funny moments. I believe you have to go in having an open mind. It is a movie with a plot, so their normal comedy of getting unsuspecting people is not there. I think they do a good job at comedy and the movie overall is funny, I think a lot of people expected their normal stuff but this was an attempt to broadening their audience and take them into the realmainstream. If your a die-hard Jerky fan, I think you will enjoy it and if you like comedies I believe you will enjoy it. If your expecting for it to be just like the tapes then you will be disappointed. Aside from a couple of my favorite characters missing I enjoyed it, laughed, and will watch again.

The jerky boys main strength lies in the quality of 'Gangster accents'' portrayed by the lead characters. The whole idea of two 30 year old men sitting round making obscene and very funny phone calls all day would in principle sound like an unattractive watch. In saying this though the jerky boys has some hilarious moments which left me and my father in fits of laughter, (no exaggeration),. IN terms of a plot the jerky boys doesn't come off so well which is why all included i feel it overall deserves a 6.

I mean these guys were just playing around making funny (prank) calls when they accidently call a mob boss, needless to say hillarity ensues.  They team with a rag tag crew of homeless children and one mean ol' rappin granny and attempt to take back the streets from the mob.  I won't reveal the ending, but I will say a hanky maybe needed, who knew that these two comic geniuses could also make you weep.  The good news is the ending was left open enough for a sequel, come on Paramount get on the ball it has been seven years, and the chemistry between the two leads may start to fade.  I heard they actually adlibbed most of the movie, and spent weeks making actual prank calls to get into character.  Add Kamal and Johnny to the list of fine comedic duos such as Martin and Lewis, Abbot and Costello, Cheech and Chong, and Stallone and Getty.  A must see for lovers of the cinema who aren't afraid to laugh at the human condition that is reflected so poignantly in this fine film.  On a side note why don't they actually make a record of prank calls and release it?  I am sure it would sell.  "},{"Title":"Two out of work pranksters.

OK, let's start by saying that the Jerky Boys weren't that funny when they were doing phony phone calls let alone a movie.  Hey guys, the whole reason why anyone found the phone pranks amusing is that real people didn't know you were goofing on them and their reactions to the goofing makes the bit funny.  Now that we have actors saying whatever lines make the bit the most funny (at least funny to whatever hackneyed writer you used for this piece of garbage) - IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. sigh - will Hollywood never learn?Now on to some specific comments...SARCASM ALERTThe Jerky Boys seem to love using certain words, chiefly the noun lips  (which they pair with adjectives to form such memorable put downs like liver lips and meat lips) and the adjective sizzle (which they couple with nouns to make even more memorable hilarity with taunts like sizzle chest and sizzle neck).  To be honest, the most surprising thing in this film is that the obvious pairing of what I would think would be their favorite adjective/noun combination never took place.  Alas, not hearing sizzle lips was a blow I could hardly recover from.The few sight gags in this movie were so predictable (and so bad) that they almost leave you speechless (almost - see my friend's comment below). For example, when the Jerky Boys are locked in a meat locker by the mob and then try to escape out of a window (in a meat locker ?!? - pa-lease...) they turn to groan strings of hotdogs to use to repel down the building.  One of my friends went so far as to shout No, NO, NO F-ING WAY! as soon as the Jerky Boys asked aloud how they would get down from their prison.And poor, poor Alan Arkin.  He must have been on some serious drugs to ever agree to do this film.  (Did he ever read the script?)  Arkin must have needed several months of rigorous therapy to recover from his participation in this abomination...OK - I know you can't take a movie like The Jerky Boys too seriously, but honestly, a comedy should at least be funny.  I'm not entirely positive, but I'm not sure if we ever laughed during the film at all - well, except maybe in disbelief at just how bad it really was.  This film gets the rare honor of being one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of 'em.  Only Clifford (see my IMDB review on that one) was worse.

I recall laughing at the pranks as a 20- something, but whatever creativity that was present in the original tapes it not present in the movie. Every joke and every scene is so contrived that it is a wonder at all that Alan Arkin agreed to take part in the romp. I'll give the film a little credit for offering a couple of laughs, but it is nowhere near enough to excuse itself for somehow wriggling its way into existence. As someone else alluded, this creation exists solely because some executive heard the product, thought of the genius concept movie and immediately saw dollar signs.As for character development, it is of course non-existent, as the shorter, mullet-toting John Brennan generally finds himself spewing animosity to anyone and everyone in an awkwardly driven attempt to rehash nicknames and one-liners from the old tapes. Kamal shares less lines and mostly acts as the naive, passive sidekick stumbling into an absurd scenario involving mafia, sausages and lots of running away that ultimately makes no sense. Each scene is set up to derive from the previously established pranks in such a way that we always see the joke coming from a mile away.I am at a bit of a loss as to how glowing some of these opinions are.

If we lived in a world where everything was the opposite, it would be one of the finest movies ever made. But we live in the real world, so avoid it. If you must watch it, just mourn the loss of time and money and celluloid wasted on this.

I am now getting their cd's. The plot They dialed the wrong number & got the mob & now the mob are out to get them in this hilarious film. Watch for the bathroom scene where Johnny & Kamal are together & 2 mob guys are looking for them. Its worth seeing even if u arent a Jerky Boys fan. Its only 1 hr & 21 min long, so its short, for those cry-babies that cant stand long movies, he-he, jerky.

The Jerky Boys were good at catching people off guard and generally making fools out of them.  But that is the fun - the off guard and the fool.  In this movie, it takes away the reality & humor from any of the prank calls - and the only fools are the actual Jerky Boys (or the people who paid to see the film), turning the entire formula around and making the whole thing completely unfunny.  This isn't even an attempt at depicting their actual rise to fame, day-to-day lives, or to put their characters into a story - just putting the actual Jerky Boys (who can't act) into a contrived, cliched plot where the mafia chases after them and they re-enact prank calls from their first album to scripted actors.First there was some amusing albums, then a book (now out of print), a TV special, and then this horrible movie.  It just begs the question - how much money is enough?

I can't say whether it's #1 or #2 until Joel Schumacher decided to Batman 5 or not.  On to the film at hand When I find my self saying, as I walk out of the theater, Gee, not even cameo appearances by Alan Arkin, Ozzy Osbourne and the minimalist punk-metal group Helmet made that movie watchable at all!, I feel the cold hand of evil around my heart. This movie could have been something if it had had a script... or sets, or even a clear sense of plot, but it didn't, so it wasn't.

It should have a health warning on the box.  People with heart trouble, high blood pressure or any other health problems should not watch this movie!The story begins with our star heroes as little boys, making a crank phone call.Then it continues, 20 years later.  Our heroes are older but not wiser, just more devious with their crank phone calls.They dial a crime boss and mess the mob around, getting them in all sorts of trouble with dear old mom, the mob and the police.Although I am not a fan of MTV or any of the stars of MTV, the Jerky Boys are an exception!  This movie was so funny!  I was laughing so hard that I got severe stomach cramps.  So I had to turn the VCR off after watching only 20 minutes of the movie.The next day, I was able to sit through the whole movie.  But I was laughing so hard that I almost fell off my chair.  By the time the movie was finished, my voice was hoarse and I had stomach cramps from laughing so hard.  After watching the movie 5 times, there were still parts that were still so funny that I laughed until I was out of breath!This movie is too funny for words.  Watch it as your own risk!

I place it in the realms of Cheech and Chong and the Blues Brothers. Not many Guys could pull off making crank calls into a Big-screen comedy. Fast paced action and wacky impressions make this movie a winner. Even though it was a box office flop I bet video rentals more than made up for poor ticket sales. This is a stay home, 12 pack type of flick.

I can watch this over and over again and still laugh. The characters are very memorable. I don't want to say more about the film so as not to spoil it. Unfortunately I don't think this film exists on DVD so you have to get the VHS out of the closet or garage to see it. Good performances also by Vincent Pastore, Alan Arkin and Kamal Ahmed.Johnny Brennan is probably the greatest comedian of all time and for sure the most under-rated comedian of all time - no question about that.Go see it now liver-lips, or Frank Rizzo will split your nuts from your head to the back of your ass!
