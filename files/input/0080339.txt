[{"Title":"Arguably one of the funniest films ever made","Date":"6 June 2004","Score":"176 out of 206 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Airplane! is, was and always shall be the master of spoof movies. It is single-handedly responsible for literally inventing a sub-genre of comedy. It is the ultimate Silly Movie. A satire of the disaster movies of the 1970s, particularly the Airport series, nothing makes sense and it doesn't need to. There's no real plot. Just laughs - and plenty of 'em.It was helmed by the ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker), whose dedication to making the audience laugh is surprisingly adamant. Recent spoofs may have left a bad aftertaste in your mouth, but it seems to be a universal agreement Airplane is the funniest film of its genre ever made. (Closely followed by The Naked Gun - also penned by the ZAZ trio - perhaps.)The plot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is a war veteran-turned-cab-driver who decides to chase after his girlfriend, an airline stewardess named Elaine (Julie Hagerty), who has dumped him in order to pursue a new life. Right before her plane takes off, Ted climbs aboard, hitching a ride in order to woo her back into a relationship again.When the aircraft is in midflight, both pilots become very ill after eating their meals. Eventually many passengers begin to show symptoms of a rare disease, apparently transmitted by the food. Onboard, Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) takes care of the sick passengers as Ted - an ex-fighter pilot from the war - decides to try and land the plane. If he messes up they will all die, and in a particularly funny scene, the pressure becomes so unbearable that he begins to literally sweat gallons in the cockpit.That is essentially all the film is about, but most of its duration is spent cracking jokes. Spoof films are entirely different from other movies because normally we would criticize a film if it considered its plot to be the least important element. Not so here. This is a truly brainless piece of celluloid - a movie that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. From the opening credits - that cleverly spoof JAWS - to the closing we realize that this is an altogether unique film going experience.The movie's biggest laughs come through unexpected flashbacks, such as when Ted remembers where he first met Elaine in a crummy bar (...it was worse than Detroit...), and begins to disco-dance a la John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever (complete with Bee Gees soundtrack blaring in the background and the famous Travolta pose). Then, later, we are taken back to when Ted was hospitalized after the war, and finds out that he was responsible for the death of six men. Seven, actually, he is informed, which adds to the pain of the moment for him. Though this movie is very funny, many jokes misfire. If you're not pop culture savvy and you don't remember Mrs. Cleaver from TV's Leave it to Beaver, the humor is going to go over your head. But unlike many comedies, Airplane! offers something unique for each person. I know that as a film lover, I picked up on many movie in-jokes that some people might not recognize. And then there were the gags that I first missed but picked up after a second viewing, or when someone explained them to me, or both. And I'm sure there are many yet that I'm not aware of. It seems that every time I watch it, there's something else to laugh at that I missed previously.Airplane! not only was a huge success in 1980 (the year of its release), spinning off a horde of imitators and one sequel - it was also responsible for crowning Leslie Nielsen The King of Spoof. Prior to Airplane! Nielsen had been a veteran of more serious productions, stemming back to playing cowboys on The Mickey Mouse Club and other embarrassing attempts at acting. However, Nielsen later claimed that he had always wanted to do a comedy, even when he first started acting seriously with projects such as the classic Forbidden Planet (one of the best science-fiction films ever made). He later reunited with the ZAZ trio for The Naked Gun trilogy, appeared in similar spoof films over the years such as Wrongfully Accused and Scary Movie 3, and had his iconic comedy shtick ripped off by many screen veterans - most noticeably by George Gaynes in the unbearable Police Academy (1984).When it comes down to a single evaluation, Airplane is simply the best spoof film ever made. It's like a MAD Magazine parody come to life. There are the occasional misfires, but unlike many other spoof film imitators, this one contains far more hits. The deadpan acting is genius and everything else fits into place, resulting in what may arguably be one of the absolute funniest films ever conceived and put on the big screen. And if you decide to watch the movie, don't blink - you might miss a gag or two. The Police Academies will come and go but Airplane! will never be forgotten.

You get a chance to see such serious actors as Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen subvert themselves and their own personnae into near oblivion thanks to the writing/directing team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.  Not to mention visual and verbal send-ups of darn near every movie that ever took place in the air, and a few that didn't, but should have.  Kudos to Leslie Nielsen, who with this movie gave himself the greatest reinvention of any actor this century.  At one time, he was the very model of stoic sensibility.I swear.

Unfortunately the fish meal on the flight is bad and causes the crew to go sick leaving the plane on automatic pilot.  With Striker the only man on board who can land the plane can he overcome his fears of failure stemming from the war? This without a doubt one of the best comedies of cinema, it is far and away the best spoof ever made - and it was made when this type of humour was still fresh.  From the opening moments right down to the closing credits this is hilarious.  The plot is a straight spoof of 1970's Airport disaster movies, and is only an excuse for a range of jokes.  However the plot is bang on - it's detailed enough that it could be a serious disaster movie and allows the film to poke fun directly at the disasters movies themselves. The cast are perfect.  For Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty this represents the best things they've ever done.  Both play the straight men for the majority and are relied upon to take it all seriously and drive the plot while jokes occur all round them, that said they deliver many themselves but always straight faced.  Nielsen and Bridges are also spot on as stereotypical doctor and traffic control guy who chose the wrong day to give up drinking!  They are both so straight faced that they make the whole thing seem even more silly. Robert Stack is excellent as the man brought in to talk the plane down, playing the butch masculine figure ignoring all the madness around him.  Also on the ground, Stephen Stucker is great as the camp controller who delivers many brilliant one liners as he walks through scenes.  Peter Graves and Kareen Abdul Jabbar are great as two of the pilots that almost are in a different movie the things they say! The film is a spot on spoof of disaster movies, making fun of the many clich√©s of the genre - the nuns on board, the sick child, the only man who can land the plane, the poisoned food etc.  But it does more than just poke fun at these - it is hilarious in it's own right.  All the cast deliver their lines brilliantly and the script! The script is excellent - I'm not going to start listing lines but they come so thick and fast that you usually miss something because you're laughing at the last joke.This is the mould for all spoofs - this is the one to beat.  While many spoofs are hit and miss this is almost a total hit.  Decades on and many viewings later this is still as fresh and as funny as it ever was.  A brilliant, brilliant comedy!

It handles the broad range of parody, satire, and plain silliness expertly, and has some of the greatest one-liners and sight gags ever put in a movie. Sure some of the jokes are dated, but great comedies (especially parodies) exist in the moment, and you have to expect that. The fact is, enough jokes hit the bullseye that it really is one of those rare movies where you are laughing constantly. I am, at least. This movie launched Leslie Nielsen's career as a comedy actor, although he still hasn't made anything this good (Naked Gun comes closest, but it's still light years away from this). Do any movies come close to hitting the zenith that this one does? Young Frankenstein comes close, but even the best Mel Brooks film doesn't top this. There has simply never been a funnier movie than Airplane! and for that, it deserves to be considered one of the greatest MOVIES of all time (I know for many people that's a stretch, but I stand by it; I've been watching it my whole life and there's still nothing I flat-out enjoy watching more).

I eventually watched it one day because I worked at the video store and could rent movies for free, and was continuing on my desperate attempt to watch every movie in the store (a goal which continues to this day, although by now I've come to realize that it's never going to happen). During my quest, by the way, I also saw the old 1970 film Airport, probably ten years after having seen parts of Airplane!, and realized that this is one of the many movies that inspired Airplane! In general, I'm a little cautious about movies that have exclamation points in the titles, but Airplane! is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made. Consider, for example, those little montages that studios sometimes put together and put at the beginning of movies when they come out on videotape, honoring the great movies that the studio has made in the past. They show lots of memorable clips from their old movies (and I always write all of these titles down, determined to watch them all, and then promptly lose the list that I made) to remind you how great they are. I had a good time watching Airplane! and picking out how many scenes are in the movie that can and do go into those memorable montages.Airplane! is made up of a series of hilarious scenes that string together a thin shoestring plot, which ironically speaks in the movie's defense. In general, movies with weak stories that are driven along by comedic stunts and pranks and whatnot tend to be pretty weak, but Airplane! is not driven by stunts to cover a weak story as much as the quality of the stunts and the slapstick comedy is so good that they overshadow everything else. It's interesting to watch someone like Robert Stack so many years ago and see that he looked and talked exactly like he did in Unsolved Mysteries so many years later, a show the seriousness of which boggles the mind, given that it's hosted by someone who did so well in a movie like this one.My favorite thing about this movie is, obviously, the huge amount of sound bytes that comes from it, just the cleverness of the way it was written and put together. You have the main character's `drinking problem,' the airport announcers (`Listen, Betty, don't start up with your white zone sh*t again&#133;'), the stress of the people investigating the situation on the plane (`Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking/drinking/amphetamines.'), the plays on words (`There's a problem at the control tower!' `What is it?' `It's the big tower where the air traffic controllers talk to the planes.'), that one airport employee who was suspiciously bubbly and excited throughout the entire movie (while providing some of its best comedy), and then of course were the situational gags, such as Robert Stack pulling off his sunglasses to reveal another pair underneath (arguably the most famous scene in the entire film). This is a movie where a list like this could go on and on, and I'm sure if you go to the memorable quotes page on the IMDb you'll find a gigantic list of hilarious quotes from the movie there. It is no secret that this is something of a childish and immature comedy, but it is smartly written and has so many great scenes and bits of dialogue that it's one of those rare movies that makes you want to take notes so you won't forget a lot of the lines. It is one of the earlier versions of Leslie Nielsen's spoofs, a genre in itself which went on to tremendous success with lots of great (and some not so great) spoofs to follow.

The film is filled with hilarious gags!  Sure, in every one of these campy farces, there's usually a few gags that are way too silly.  In this case, it was the drinking problem gag and that annoying gay man who works on Lloyd Bridges' staff.  But when I can actually count on my hand how many gags didn't work, that's a good sign.  The majority of the film sent me into a frenzy of laughter!  One of my favorites is when the blow-up auto-pilot runs out of air and Julie Hagerty blows it back up again.  You'll have to see the movie to find out why it was so hilarious!  I also got a great kick out of the running gag in which every passenger who listens to Robert Hays ends up killing themselves.  This is definitely the Zuckers and Abrahams in top form!  Unfortunately, I haven't seen a great spoof in years.  The Scary Movie films were pretty good, but incredibly lewd and crude.  And obviously the Zuckers and Abrahams have much better eyes for satire than the Wayans brothers.  I caught Scary Movie on cable and watched it a second time, and I didn't laugh nearly as many times as I did the first time.  I can watch Airplane 200 times and still laugh like there's no tomorrow!  The film was made back when comedies didn't go strictly for sex and toilet gags to make an audience laugh.  This was back when writers used to employ this quality called wit.  Kentucky Fried Movie had some racy gags, but even those were witty for the most part.  There is a certain rhythm in every gag that helps make the film work.  For example, Lloyd Bridges starts out by saying I think I picked the wrong day to quit smoking.  Then he says he picked the wrong day to quit drinking.  And when he finally says I picked the wrong day to quit amphetamines, I was laughing my head off!  So basically, you watch a film like this and feel the urge to mail a copy of the video to the Wayans Brothers and whatever crackheads wrote Not Another Teen Movie, along with a note saying THIS is how to make a spoof!  There are so many other gags worth mentioning, including the Saturday Night Fever sendup, which is definitely one of the best comic moments caught on film!  That scene also contains my favorite line  I told the guy next to me to pinch me to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  After that voice-over, we see the guy next to Robert Hays repulsed and walking away from him.  Another great example of perfect comic timing and delivery!  If you want to get some authentic belly laughs--I'm not talking chuckles, but actual LAUGHS!--you must check out Airplane.  Trust me, movies don't get much more original or funny than this!

It has everything that a comedy should have. The cast is fantastic, the jokes hilarious and almost constant.One of the best things about Airplane that I have found is that the jokes are not all obvious, and because of this it has far more re-watchability than most comedies, as every time you watch it you pick up on more of the subtler jokes and background sight gags.It is a film that manages to cater for almost all tastes in humour, from dry wit to slapstick via spoofery and dark humour. If you haven't seen this film you MUST watch it. This is one of those few films that everybody can enjoy. It's fairly rare to find a comedy the whole family can enjoy, most are either unsuitable for children or too childish for adults, but Airplane manages to find that balance where all ages can enjoy it.In conclusion, if you have yet to see this film, watch it.

I've got to concentrate... concentrate... concentrate... Hello?... hello... hello... Echo... echo... echo... Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon... Manny Mota... Mota... Mota... That pretty much sums up the seriousness of Airplane!, the lampoon of the 1970s Airport movies, and pretty much every other disaster movie pumped out by Hollywood. The same guys who pieced together the Naked Gun movies write and direct this silly movie. Most of the jokes need to be seen to be properly experienced, the first rate actors are what brings the laughs. Robert Stack plays it straight, over-the-top straight, as a problem solver for the airline who happens to wear 2 pairs of sunglasses at all times. Stack's comedic timing and deadpan delivery bring out some of the biggest laughs of the film. Lloyd Bridges is the over-worked, over-stressed traffic controller who has picked the wrong week to stop drinking, smoking, and sniffing glue. And Leslie Neilson plays a doctor who has an acute sense for the obvious, surely one who could save the passengers and airline crew if they land safely, just don't call him Shirley. A few cheap laughs, a few misses, but over all, a pretty funny movie. If you like The Naked Gun, you'll like Airplane!

It's a shame they didn't do more spoofs, or that their output has been rather infrequent, resulting in each of this team making their own movies with varying degrees of success, since there is so much material out there to rip apart from.Here, it's the fear of flying. That any flight could encounter problems either from the weather or from machinery is nothing new -- it happens, plain and simple. That a shot of the flight depicted here as it flies dangerously close to the Chicago skyline probably won't give anyone a 9/11 jolt nowadays, but the undertone is there. There is a fear of planes, and this movie takes that specific fear and turns it inside out with hysterical results from the opening shot to the closing credits.Using the premise of ZERO HOUR and the AIRPORT franchise, AIRPLANE brings Ted Stryker, a man who has a neurotic fear of failure and is a war veteran, gets on a plane to get back with his estranged girlfriend Elaine, a stewardess on the flight. That he tells his tragic tale to not one, but three people (all who commit suicide) is one of the many laugh-out-loud sequences, but some danger actually ensues when the meals are served and those who have eaten fish fall ill, and this includes the pilots. With no one left to fly this plane, Ted is called into duty and guided by Captain Kramer (whom he hates) he has to fly the plane to safety.This is, essentially, the bare-bones of the plot. The real stars of the movie are the incessant, mile a minute visual, referential, and verbal jokes that assault the viewer faster than he or she can register. References to classic movies, soap operas, commercials from the 70s (Jim never drinks a second cup of coffee at home...), pedophilia, basketball, voice recordings that guide people through airports, outrageous takes on characters from the very movies they are spoofing; in short, nothing is spared here, and it makes for a relentlessly funny movie.That the actors play it straight makes AIRPLANE even funnier. It's as if they weren't sure as to what exactly were they doing and were trying these waters out on a lark; luckily for them that it paid because not only it made David Zucker's, Jerry Zucker's, and Jim Abrahams' career, it also brought back Leslie Nielsen into the limelight as a deadpan funny man who could deliver ridiculous lines as if it were the real thing. Its success was so evident that it spawned an inferior remake, a slew of similar-toned movies, many of them directed by the Zucker-Zucker-Abrahams team, together or separately. This, however, remains as the spoof movie to watch, the one all spoof movie should measure itself to, and one of the funniest comedies of all time.

The Zukko Bros & Son's affectionate tribute to British-rooted brand of absurdist, literal, surrealist, cretinous comedy which borders on subversive is, indeed, a one note affair but forces us into comic submission primarily due to some fine calibration of the rudeness in humour - unadulterated, smutty, subtle, gross, vulgar, as well as the sheer volume of it - and it still remains a milestone in comedy all these years later. The fact that the film is often recently being accused of losing topicality and being dated doesn't particularly bother me - this film has already made so many generations laugh their guts out so why worry whether or not future ones will know who Anita Bryant was. The truth remains that this is arguably the funniest movie ever made.It's also worth remembering that Airplane! was filmed and released in 1980, effectively still in the late seventies (disco gets sent up not once but twice in the course of the film), generally a very liberal period where few taboos were exempt from scrutiny - therefore we can roar with dark delight as we learn that the wife of a paedophile pilot does one better and sleeps with a horse, little white girls fancy big black men, spinsters snort coke, respectable older ladies talk jive in chimp terms or lay eggs orally, outrageous queens rule the flight control tower where glue is also sniffed and so on. The comedy spares no one (blacks, wasps, jews, gays) and, as many users correctly pointed out, the gags are riotous but not offensive. On a tamer note, you can see genuine affection in the way the ZAZ team parody and even quote source material, amongst which Airport 75 and Zero Hour! end up studiously lampooned to perfection. Besides, the performances are spot-on (Julie Hagerty is just fab-u-lous, especially in her scenes with Otto), the music is knowingly and hilariously blown out of all proportions (listen to the shrieking amorous vocal trio at the end, as Hays and Hagerty embrace) and, contrary to mathematic possibilities, the soundtrack comes up with an even MORE idiotic in-flight guitar tune than Helen Reddy's Best Friend ever was. I watch this avalanche of gags every once in a while, just to get me a giggle detox - it never fails. R-e-s-p-e-c-t....and of course, I haven't felt this awful since we saw that Ronald Reagan film!.

David Zucker stars in this fantastically funny movie topped off with a performance from Leslie Nielsen. This movie is great for a evening laugh, it does not take itself seriously which works well for this film as there is a gag at about every 30 seconds. It is one of the funniest films i have seen in a while while some of the humour is predictable most of it isn't and works very well and there are some great one liners which will stick with you. There is so much humour in the film it is likely you will have to watch it several times before you find all of the gags; some of them are very subtle and take stabs out of other movies of the time.The humour is never ending with hidden jokes that creep up on you in the next scene. The disco scene is excellent, not to mention Leslie Neilson's don't call me Shirley lines, the nun's cheery song, the Vietnam flashbacks, the hysterical passenger, the haphazard crew at the control tower. Much of this simple style of humour lives the stream of fine detail. Although slightly dated the humour is still fresh.Overall rating 8 out of 10.

The story here basically exists as an excuse for one gag after another, and ZAZ manage to cram a remarkable number of jokes into the film, ranging from sight gags, to physical comedy to deadpan comedic verbal exchanges. With so many jokes thrown into the mix, it is perhaps only inevitable that some fail while others succeed. The gags that do not work tend to be the more juvenile ones (the lead actor drowning in sweat towards the end), however, for every gag that backfires here, there are twice as many that work. Peter Graves arguably gets the most comic mileage from his part, constantly showing far too much interest in the young boy who he has allowed into the front of the plane, though the off-screen dueling PA announcers are arguably the funniest in the film, all the more so since everyone else in the airport goes about their business, oblivious to the quarrel -- which in turns suggests something about how little most people pay attention to such announcements. The film is best appreciated though without ZAZ's latter efforts in mind; the lack of three dimensional characterisations (such as in 'Ruthless People') makes it at times hard to get into the story. That said, Robert Hays does fairly well with his lightly fleshed out former pilot character who has grown to fear flying. Julie Hagerty is also always welcome to have on hand and the 'Saturday Night Fever' parody in which they first meet showcases the film at its zaniest.

A movie that spearheaded a new, zany, off the wall type of humour that is still being replicated today nearly 30 years later. It was also the film that was responsible for re-categorising both Lloyd Bridges & Leslie Nielsen from ageing 'B' movie stars of yesteryear into 'A' list Comedy superstars.The film is a well executed spoof on the 70's disaster genre and takes place on a stricken airliner where the entire cabin crew and the majority of the passengers have come down with a violent strain of food poisoning, leaving ex Vietnam pilot Ted Striker, (Robert Hayes), the only person who can take the controls and save the day.It also remains one of the most quoted movies of all time, with immortal lines like What A Pisser and Don't Call Me Shirley and  I take it Black...Like My Men.However, Airplane's clever writing is not solely reliant on the spoken joke or throw away one-liner, it also contains a lot of visual sight gags that would have made Chaplin & Keaton as proud as punch, none more so as when the 'sh*t hits the fan'.It also has some extremely funny flashback sequences to explain why Ted, (a confirmed aviophobic), is even on the plane to begin with.The support cast is also simply brilliant with Peter Graves, Julie Hagerty, Lorna Patterson, Barbara Billingsley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, (who, and forgive my Englishness here, was an Ex Basketball Player). However, the funniest characters by a country mile are Dr. Rumack, (Neilson), McCroskey, (Bridges) and Rex Kramer, (Robert Stack).If there had not have been an Airplane, there would certainly have been no Police Squad TV series, Naked Gun Movies or even Hot Shots.

This has just about every kind of material you can imagine Slapstick, random jokes, sight gags, verbal humor, gross-out comedy(thankfully not very much at all), sexual, physical and possibly more. The vast majority of these work(they clearly put effort into it), and hilarity is the main ingredient in this. The timing is spot-on, and the performers are well-chosen. This is what launched Nielsen as a funny man, and you can tell why. Stucker is marvelous. The pacing is good. The plot is, as well. The acting fits. The effects are nicely done, and the production values barely leave anything to be desired(in spite of the low budget). There is some racy content in this, in addition to what I've already mentioned as types there is relatively strong language, in a moderate amount. Children shouldn't be allowed near this, although they hopefully won't understand all of it. I imagine there are alternate versions, and among them, there may very well be milder ones. The regular DVD holds a commentary track with the three writer/directors and Jon Davison, and while there are silent areas in it, it's worth listening through, and is nicely informational and entertaining.

It set the standard for the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker style of humor, which originated in their first film Kentucky Fried Movie, consisting of plenty of word play, non sequitors and many sight gags that would later develop in Police Squad! and the Naked Gun movies.The cast was outstanding with Robert Hays as the acting pilot, thrust into action when the regular pilot took ill, Julie Hagerty as his ex, Lloyd Bridges as the neurotic air traffic controller who picked the wrong day to quit various substances and NBA great Kareem Abdul Jabbar. A hilarious cameo came from Barbara Billingsley (better known as June Cleaver) as the Jive Lady. Her sound bite from the movie can frequently be heard on the Sirius XM 70s Channel. And let's not forget Otto, the Automatic Pilot, although he never said anything, he was a great sight gag. And finally, a regular member of the ZAZ stable Leslie Nielsen who quoted the famous line Thanks. And don't call me Shirley. If you have never seen Airplane! or plan to see any of The Naked Gun movies, I highly recommend renting it since you'll enjoy seeing how the ZAZ comedic style has developed.

For me, the most memorable characters were Leslie Neilsen, as the monotone doctor on the plane, and Lloyd Bridges, as the air-traffic controller. Neilsen, of course, gets to deliver his well-known Don't call me Shirley! in this film. Several of my personal favorites from Lloyd Bridges (the lines starting with Picked the wrong week to quit smoking) also come from this movie. For me, it's the fact that this film throws in one joke after another that makes it so continuously funny. From the man dressed as a train conductor at the airport to the inflatable auto-pilot, Airplane! provides so much to laugh at. Once in a while, I found myself groaning at the jokes that were either too predictable or too over-the-top and badly delivered to be funny. The laughs far outweigh the bad jokes, however.

In Australia, this movie is known as Airplane and was a parody of a spate of aeroplane related disaster movies (as in the sequence of Airport movies).Why is this movie so funny? Well, it is four-dimensional comedy. You will only get a fraction of the jokes in this movie, as they come thick and fast from every direction-in the foreground, middle-ground, background, in the audio and the credits. Flying High could be the movie that started end credits featuring jokes.Here's the plot in a nut-shell a former US Air Force fighter pilot, trying to re-establish a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, who is a stewardess on a commercial passenger aeroplane, takes a flight with her which goes from bad to worse. The pilot and co-pilot get sick and the ex fighter pilot who is afraid of flying has too...(I'm not giving away too much here, but that's enough plot).Not sure if this is the first movie by the creators, but they have had subsequent success with this kind of absurd comedy, in movies like The Naked Gun. Perhaps The Kentucky Fried Movie was their first such comedy. All these movies are worth watching, as is the other obscure movie, Top Secret, which has some brilliantly surreal humour.Anyway, if you are a rather literal-minded person, you may not enjoy this movie too much...you'll complain about planes not really being like that, or professional people not really acting like that.This movie is heightened reality. The visual gags are funny & the dialogue is funny too...I still remember the bizarre and somewhat disturbing ex-change between the pilot and a small boy, named Jimmy, invited to view the cock-pit (as children often are in movies)-Pilot Jimmy, have you ever seen a grown man naked?. Hmmmm.Honestly, this is a movie that rewards multiple viewings, to absorb all the jokes you missed the first time around. And, like I say, don't forget to scan the end-credits for more comedy gold.

In the end, they just look like slapstick comedies, so instead of making parody films, they do terrible spoof movies, where every scene has 30 references people who see it in 10 years won't understand. Though Airplane is a parody of disaster films, like the Airport movies, it never actually spoofs a scene from the film. It's more like a typical disaster film. Everyone is completely serious in their roles, no matter how goofy what they have to say is. There's no stupid voices and dumb readings, and that's one major thing that makes this a great parody film.Airplane starts off much jokier than it becomes. Once everyone is aboard the plane, all the characters are introduced through a joke scene. For example, the little boy gives this girl he likes coffee, and she says, I like men like I like my coffee...black. That is an old joke, but in context it's very funny. Any repetition in the jokes is admitted. Every time someone misunderstands what someone else has said, the actors end their sentence with, ...but that's not important right now. It's purposeful repetition that gets funnier as it goes along.Now, onto the actors. They were all phenomenal. Aside from the two main characters, who were fairly new to acting (This was Julie Haggerty's first film), everyone else was a long time serious actor. Leslie Nielson plays Rumack, a doctor who happens to be on the plane. Leslie Nielson takes the role completely seriously, never once cracking a smile to his ridiculous character. Robert Stack plays Rex Kramer, the man piloting the plane from the ground, trying to make sure everyone gets home safely. Peter Graves plays the weird pedophile airplane captain, and Kareem Abdul Jabar plays the co-captain. Lloyd Bridges has a pretty thankless role as the man down in headquarters trying to get Rex Kramer. So, this movie had some good actors, minus Kareem Abdul Jabar, who was still good.This is a classic parody movie, and a timeless one, and will live on much longer than any Date Movie or Meet the Spartans.My rating *** 1/2 out of ****. 83 mins.

I guess that's another way of saying I like it very much.Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-pilot who hasn't flown since the war, which turned him into such a guilt case they put him in the special hospital with the guys who think they are Ethel Merman. His flight attendant girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty), noting he lives too much in the past, tells him she's leaving him. To win her back, Ted buys a ticket on her flight out, bringing nothing with him but feelings of hurt, a fatal case of nostalgia (to himself and others), a drinking problem, and most importantly for the purposes of this film, no appetite for fish dinners.I just realized that I described Airplane! as if it had a plot of some kind. I apologize. What plot there is, taken directly from a 1950s flight drama called Zero Hour!, is more a kind of wide-stretching net for catching any gag that can possibly be imagined, nearly all of which work. Abortion, the Bee Gees, Ronald Reagan, heart transplants, jive talking (not the Bee Gees' kind), rear projection, Scientology, the Peace Corps, nothing is too high or low for a cheap shot from director-writers Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker, a design inspiring the best (The Simpsons) and worst (many of ZAZ's subsequent productions) comedies ever since.Airplane! is held dear for many reasons, perhaps mostly as the film that launched Leslie Nielsen's second career as deadpan funnyman, him playing a doctor named Rumack who pulls eggs out of a woman's mouth and quickly realizes she is deathly ill.This woman has to be gotten to a hospital, Rumack tells Elaine.A hospital! What is it?It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.Nor is the fact it's been 27 years since Airplane was first released. It has aged, yes, but in a fine-wine kind of way. It's actually amazing how enjoyable the comedy plays after numerous viewings, in large part because of its solid tone throughout. Instead of mugging, Nielsen and the other elder B-movie vets on hand here play their roles absolutely straight. Well, straight may not be the word to describe Peter Graves' Captain Oveur, but he and Robert Stack as a gruff ground-control guy (Flying a plane is a lot like riding a bicycle...it's just a lot harder putting baseball cards in the spokes) give the film's best performances in a movie full of them.The disassociation many will have now from its more contemporary gags only enhance the genial surrealism that has always been this film's secret strength. Witness the falling watermelons, flying spears, and Stephen Stucker's zany non-sequiturs as a control-tower worker with a thing for Barbara Stanwyk and J.C. Penney's.If comedy never gets any respect from movie people, and it doesn't, it's hard imagining Airplane being the film to break that cycle. Even among comedies, it is unique for not allowing itself to be taken seriously. Yet surely that is the very reason for its enduring greatness.And yes, I did just call you Shirley.

It also made a star out of Leslie Nielsen at the age of 58. Nielsen had been a reasonably handsome leading player of the second rank for years, (probably best known as the space ship captain in Forbidden Planet), whose convulsively funny performance here, ('Don't call me Shirley'), catapulted him into the limelight and the role of Frank Drebin in 'The Naked Gun' movies which emulated the quick-fire scatter-shot gag ratio of Airplane! to almost equal effect and for people of a certain age and generation it's for this movie that Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and Robert Stack will be remembered.

This on-target comic spoof spawned many imitations and clones, but this is the granddaddy of them all. The gags come at a lightning fast pace so that if one gag doesn't amuse as much as you think, there's another one not far behind. The movie is smartly written with a great deal of attention to the set-up of a joke as well as the actual payoff. Hays gets great support from Julie Hagerty, as the ex-girlfriend and head stewardess, Peter Graves as the pilot with a thing for young boys, Leslie Nielsen as a stone-faced doctor (possibly an inspiration for his Frank Drebin character), Kareem Abduhl Jabaar as the co-pilot who has an identity crisis, Lloyd Bridges as a grounds control pilot with an addiction or two, and Lorna Patterson as another stewardess.

That is because there is nothing to get. You don't 'get' it, you just watch it. Of they complain about Leslie Nielsen doing his same old comedy style. In Airplane, that wasn't his same comedy style. Until that time he had never done any comedy so it was all new.Airplane is a true classic. At its release it was the number 1 comedy film going, and 26 years later it is still one of the top ten comedy movies ever made. I can't imagine anybody not having seen it, at least in part on TV, but if you haven't, watch it the next chance you get. You won't be sorry.Just remember, don't 'try' to like...don't try to 'get' it, don't over think it at all. Just watch it. If you are under 30, there will be a lot of references you might miss which will weaken some of the jokes, but most of the humor is timeless and truly classic.But I will warn you. If you actually...and I mean you genuinely find current comedies on TV funny, then you may not enjoy this movie. Because there is nothing on TV that is really funny today. And if you actually think today's TV comedies are funny, then your sense of humor has been damaged, possibly beyond repair.Enjoy.

Honestly, the sequel was bad (not a ZAZ film, by the way), but don't hold that against this film, without Airplane we would never have gotten the Naked Gun films, or Hot Shots.This film is even more funny if you understand the pop-culture references of the period. Few young people today understand that the Jive Lady was Beaver Cleaver's mom, the ultimate white suburban Mom. References to Anita Bryant, From Here to Eternity, Ethel Merman, and, most of all, understanding that almost NONE of the actors in the film were comedians, they were the foundation of 1960s and 70s dramatic films and TV. Only AFTER Airplane do they go on to do comedic roles. Imagine current actors such as Russell Crowe doing a parody film today and you might begin to understand why seeing and listening to these actors do these parts was so damned funny. Leslie Nielson had been the prototype handsome dramatic actor until the film, only then did he become a comedic star.So, time has made it hard for people watching it for the first time today to understand all the humor, but still, watching the shit hit the fan has to be good for a few laughs.

When released in 1980, Airplane came after a decade of ever worse disaster movies (anyone remember Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, and the car crash that was Airport 79 The Concorde) and blew them all out of the water. The basic storyline came from a 1950s TV piece called Zero Hour where a passenger plane is crippled after the pilots fall ill. Airplane sticks pretty close to the plot, although a few passengers from Airport 75 also make it on board and then adds a massive dose of hilarity.Some of the jokes in Airplane simply come by taking things very literally (excrement and desk fans comes to mind) while others are just comic genius. Absolutely nothing is sacred in Airplane, Nuns, sick children, sports stars, airport staff and even the airport announcers all prove to be sources of humour. But the jokes always work by having the actors play it completely serious despite the hilarity thrown at them, from deflating automatic pilots, thieving press ('OK boys, let's get some pictures) and passenger riots.I could go on but to be honest, the best way to understand just how funny Airplane is, is to watch it. Unless of course you picked the wrong week to quit watching movies... "},{"Title":"Hilarious!","Date":"5 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The scary story of a plane crash is mocked irreverently by a cast including the then serious actor Leslie Nielsen. The film is packed with funny spoofs and slapstick comedy. Much of the comedy is only noticeable on a second viewing, it would almost appear that jokes are present in every single scene. The problem comes when you blink or look away for whatever reason and you end up missing a series of funny moments which is why a second or third viewing is necessary.The film is very similar to the later Naked Gun films with Leslie Nielsen. The laughs come from often slapstick moments that are mainly visual. The dialogue does provide some comic gems, but it is the action that you will find yourself laughing at the most.Altogether a hilarious film that is a must watch for all fans of comedy. It may not appeal to those people who enjoy very plain sophisticated comedy, but for those who like quick punchy dialogue and hilarious slapstick should definitely watch this film.

Following on the heels of all the high-budget, star-studded disaster epics of the 1970's (Airport and its sequels, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno, etc.), the time was ripe for a spoof. The cast of Airplane! is itself star-studded, but in an off-beat kind of way. Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack were at the time the film was made, character actors best known for TV roles, as was Leslie Nielsen (who seemed to be an almost weekly TV villain in Hawaii 5-0, Cannon and the other detective shows of the 70's). Bridges, Stack and Nielsen all played the stereotypical heroic roles in disaster movies with a great flair for the melodramatic and with a perfect deadpan solemnity that made the ridiculous things they said and did all the more funny. None of the jokes here have to be explained; that helps make the movie a comedic masterpiece. Of course Airplane! spawned a sequel and other films attempting similar humor. Of those imitators, the Naked Gun films, starring Nielsen as Lt. Frank Drebbin, come close to matching the layers of humor that permeate Airplane!, but Airplane! is the original, still funny after all these years, all the imitations and all the attempts to quote it around the water cooler notwithstanding.

Sometimes comedy is about timing; the well timed line can be devastatingly funny and when a trio of skilled comics are playing off one another the consequent synergy can be electric. This happens more than once in Airplane, in fact, it happens so often that there is comic relief from the non-stop comedy. Brilliant! All of the disaster movies of the 60's and 70's are parodied here, and pokes are made at sports figures, popular causes and all manner of popular stereotypes of the day.

From the opening segment on through the crash landing, this film never slows down. I could probably list over 100 gags that still crack me up and I have seen this movie over fifty times. In my opinion that speaks volumes in itself. Anyone who fails to find this funny is either a) terminally ill b) in a coma  c)unfamiliar with modern air transportation or d) too traumatized to think the subject matter is appropriate. Despite the turmoil of modern times, few among us have not traveled by air and we can all relate to many of the subjects which are poked fun at in this film.All spoofs owe more to this than almost any other comedic film. Some may credit Mel Brooks with the first actual spoof movies, and rightly so, but the pacing is easily more frenetic and nonstop in Airplane! than in anything Brooks did up to this point in 1980. If you watch the films Brooks did after Airplane!, you can tell he was trying to play catch up by adding non stop jokes in fims like Spaceballs and Robin Hood Men In tights, although his skills at such are not up to snuff with Airplane's Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker crack comedy team.Laugh until you cry, my friends. 10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Groundbreaking!","Date":"31 May 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"     Break-through comedy spoofing the airline disaster genre (and many other things) in the now-inimitable Abrahams/Zucker style.

Leslie Nielsen has been mining the same kind of humor for years now with varying degrees of success in the Naked Gun series and elsewhere, Peter Graves was surprisingly effective as the pederastic pilot and the late Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges were also excellent comedians. Various cameos such as Ethel Merman as Lt.

Paramount had a huge surprise hit with this film which was originally conceived as a small film with a lot of big stars and nothing more. Genuine laughs are plentiful and the visual sight gags steal the show in this tale of a young man named Ted Stryker (Robert Hays), a passenger on an airplane that is careening out of control because the crew has been poisoned. The man with the fear of flying learns to overcome his fear, take control of the plane, and save lives. The entire supporting cast which includes Julie Hagerty, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Robert Stack, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and numerous TV stars play off hilariously amid all of the odd behavior going on around them that they're usually unbeknownst to. Former dramatic actor Leslie Nielsen suddenly became a major comedy actor following the success of this film and a new type of comedy, the visual sight gag was popularized thanks to this film and the imitations have been countless but naturally few of them have reached the heights of this one, the one that started it all.

And then you can't stop thinking about it and you see it cop up more places.Robert Hays plays Ted Striker, a man who has never left his love for Elaine Dickenson (Julie Hagerty). A former pilot, he lost his entire squadron in Macho Grande, and hasn't been near a plane since. So, of course, Elaine is a flight attendant. Ted buys a ticket onto that flight (smoking, of course), and lots of kooky things happen, including food poisoning.Directors Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker (ZAZ) make many plays on words to make us laugh, such as here between diologue from Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) to Elaine We need to get these people to a hospital A hospital? What is it? A big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Filled with those kind of jokes, Airplane! cracks you up for 80 minutes.Hagerty's bubbly personality (Ellen Greene from Little Shop of Horrors, anyone?) and Hays' serious-but-maybe-not-so-serious type makes the characters fun to be around. Lloyd Bridges plays an Air Traffic Controller with every vice possible; Neilsen plays a doctor who happens to be on the flight. Robert Stack is another airport guy, and Peter Graves is the pilot of the plane. Ensamble comedy? No. Many characters aren't in most scenes, just there for comic relief, so to speak. As in a couple other movies, the actors don't think they're in a comedy.And, of course, how could I write a review of Airplane! without mentioning Otto, the auto-pilot, who may or may not have ulterior motions with Elaine.

I had not heard of it and really didn't even know it was a comedy.  Few today will ever get the experience I got that night, seeing one of the most brilliant slapstick comedies ever made.  I was bowled over by the frantic pace and the brilliant irreverence.  Airplane is a great film.  The genre is common today, but at that time it was not.  Never had there been a film that toss puns, jokes, paradies, and everything else they could think of at you at such a frantic pace.  The movie never slows, bombarding you with a level of silliness that must make the Pythons jealous.  Today, it's just one of a large number of the slapstick parody movies.  But, I consider it great for two reasons.  It was the root of the entire genre and proved to be a strong root on which to build.  And, how many lines from this movie are know by everyone today?

All sorts of crazy things are happening on this flight. It all starts when Ted Striker arrives at the airport to try and patch things up with his ex-finace√© Elaine Dickinson, who's a flight attendant. She doesn't listen and boards the plane. Ted must go to Chicago with her and straighten it out, but he has a horrible fear of flying. Back in the war, he had a terrible experience, but he gathered courage and got a ticket to Chicago, when asked smoking or non-smoking, he said smoking, so his ticket began billowing smoke.            The flight crew consisted of Captain Oveur, Roger Murdock the co-pilot, and Victor the navigator. Among the passengers on the plane was a little girl who needed a heart transplant, two jive dudes, and a little boy, Joey, who was fascinated at exploring the cockpit. He pointed out Roger Murdock being Kareem Abdul-Jabaar. Captain Oveur asked him all kinds of questions, like if he ever saw a grown man naked or hung around a gymnasium. But not too far along the line, the trip ran into turbulance. Food poisoning. Everyone who ate fish for dinner, including the captain, co-captain and crew, all became ill. On the ground, Steve McCroskey and his team tried to help out. They sent for someone who wouldn't crack under pressure. Johnny suggested Mister Rogers, but McCroskey felt Captain Rex Kramer would be better.           It was soon all up to Ted to take the controls. Elaine helped, while Dr. Rummack looked on at the sick people. Before long, they made it to Chicago. Everyone was rushed to a hospital and things were patched up between Ted and Elaine.           A pretty funny movie! Robert Hay is here, so is Julie Haggerty. The late Lloyd Bridges is Steve McCroskey. Also dead is Stephen Stucker (Johnny). Sadly. Peter Graves is good too. They're all good!

It revolves around an airplane on which the entire crew gets sick, and the fate of the plane rests in a Ted Striker (Robert Hays), who still has problems from what happened to him during the war.  The script is full of witty jokes ranging from spoofs of the aforementioned disaster movies, to flat out ridiculous puns (Surely you can't be serious.I am, and don't call me Shirley.)The plane is full of great characters, acted superbly by every member of the cast.  Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen are particularly funny, but there is really no weak link in the cast.  I don't really know what else to say about this movie other than it offers as many laughs in an hour and a half as you could find anywhere.

I've seen this movie so many times I probably know every single line, but damn it, it's still funny as hell! The basic concept of this film is pure genius.

Airplane doesn't try to be a movie as much as it tries to be one long comedy routine.  The results are hilarious and extremely creative.  Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack and Lloyd Bridges are classic in dead pan roles while the situations around them fall apart and get goofier by the second.  Robert Hayes as Ted Striker gives a solid performance as the poor rummy who can't win and Julie Haggerty is also very funny as the emotionally weak stewardess.  Leslie Nielsen is so good as the doctor that he became type cast for the rest of his career in goof fests after previously enjoying a solid career as a dramatic actor.  The dialogue is so great that everyone comes off as funny, even Peter Graves and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  The movie is also incredibly politically incorrect, with slang talking home boys, jabs at nuns and jewish sports legends and a cocaine snorting old woman.

Truly the zenith of the genre.The film comes off so funny because at no point do the actors let themselves in on the joke.  It takes the plot of Flight Into Danger and plays it straight for laughs, punching holes in all of the plot gaps and cliched dialogue that have plagued the suspense movie and the disaster movie for decades before it.  It probably killed the Airport series outright, a feat that had only been accomplished by Blazing Saddles (which killed the Western) before it.  However, where Saddles went for the laughs big time and suffers from overacting, all the gags of Airplane! are throwaways and the actors, although caught in a melodrama of epic proportions, keep their emotions tightly in check.  Those who don't got slapped silly.  Perfectly cast is Julie Haggerty whose anxious manner and tiny voice keep a check on lines that any other actress would play to the hilt (By the way, does anyone back there know how to fly a plane?).Unfortunately, the sequel deliberately went for laughs and fell a little flat.  Moreover, the remainder of the Abrhams Abrhams Zucker films, although great in their way, forgot the formula that made the first such a classic.

Every joke in that movie deal with fat, more fat, fat women, fat farting women, sex, more sex, implied sex, dirty one liners, more dirty one liners, vulgarities and obscenities. Same as with Nutty Professor I and II. Or take Liar, liar. Funny, but it wears off fast simply because it is as dumb as it can be while trying to convey a message. Yack.Airplane! might be a silly comedy, but it is never dumb. It works on many levels; the word plays are great and they just keep coming, one after the other. Vulgarities are kept to a minimum (as drug usage). People are abused, but not by the sake of it, but because (at one point or another) they truly deserve it. Lead characters are not one-dimensional; using flashbacks the story of each of them is told, so by the middle of the movie you develop some sense of affection for them.And Leslie Nielsen... what can I say about him. He made the movie. He gave the performance of his lifetime. He is so funny while being dead serious.

Amongst the hundreds of sight gags and clever one liners lies a story. It may not be a very good one, especially for a spoof, but Zucker and Abrahams manage to pull it off with remarkable flair and ability.	The disco sequence during WWII is likely one of the funniest scenes in movie history, and the cast is dead on, headed by a hilarious Leslie Nielsen, this being the role that launched his comedic career. The characters and especially the flashbacks tend to get a little annoying after a while, but there is enough humor injected into these slower sections to make them worthwhile.	But during the better scenes, which occupy about 50% of the film, watch out! Some parts are so unimaginably funny, the lines delivered so well, that you won't stand a chance.

Disco is given a going over as well in a rip on Saturday Night Fever.  Many great one-liners and hundreds of sight gags set the standard for later films of the sort.  The film is so packed with jokes that even if you laugh at only one out of every twenty, you'll be laughing from start to finish.  Yes, it is silly, but it is just so funny!  Robert Hays stars as an alcoholic ex-air force pilot who caused the death of his squadron in Vietnam.  He is called upon to land a passenger plane when the entire crew comes down with food poisoning.  It does not sound like a plot that is full of laughs, but that is exactly why it works.

The first time I saw this movie was when it first came out in theaters way back in 1980 (I was 9 years old at the time). 20 years later, the movie still cracks me up. This is my kind of movie comedy, which features one silly joke after another. And the best thing about it is that the jokes rarely stop. The Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team are a master at this method, and they would display the exact same method with The Naked Gun films, which is the funniest movie comedy series ever. (Airplane II The Sequel wasn't as funny as this one and that was no surprise because Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker had nothing to do with that one.) A lot of people have said that the recent box office smash There's Something About Mary is the funniest movie ever made. No way! That movie is nowhere near as funny as Airplane! The jokes don't come flying out at 100 m.p.h. in that film as they do in this film (and in The Naked Gun films).

It's a good gauge for imagining what the pre-production writing conferences must have been like among the screenwriters.  If they were having fun, so will everyone else.With Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker's Airplane!, the conferences must have been hilarious.  Their fun translated into words, which translated into one of the best American comedies ever made.  The verbal gags and satire come rapid fire and 99% of the humor works well.   Airplane! has long been said to be a homage to Airport (1970) but recently I discovered this is not the case.  While flipping channels yesterday morning, my wife (an avid classic movie fan) settled on an old black and white Paramount Picture on one of the classic movie channels.  As I am more of a contemporary film fan, I didn't pay much attention until I heard two characters having a discussion in the cockpit of an airliner about some of the passengers contracting food poisoning from eating the in-flight fish dinner.  Sound familiar?Paying more attention now, I discovered what we were watching was the serious version of Airplane! called Zero Hour (1957) starring Dana Andrews as former World War II combat pilot with shot nerves Ted Stryker (sound familiar?).  Both films are virtually the same, right down to lines of dialogue and camera shots.  These films could be twins, with Zero Hour the serious sibling and Airplane! the comedic sibling.Which one of us has never sat watching dramatic film and added funny lines to the dialogue every once in a while?  This is exactly what Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker did with Zero Hour.  Is Airplane! paying homage to this film?  I think so.  Both films would make a good evening double feature.   Airplane! is a laughfest from beginning to end.  It won't change the world, but it will make you forget it for 88 minutes.

Airplane! Is one the funniest films, it just has to be because not only is it timed to perfection but it also just picks the very best things to make you laugh too. You might beforehand and after viewing see this as a silly little movie that is really dumb, but that is the whole point, the movie doesn't make any sense and half of the fun in this is spotting the little jokes played out in nearly every character on the plane. The whole plot plays out like the old disaster movies such as Zero Hour! and Airport 1975 and really parodies them well with clich√©s in huge abundance all-round. We see ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker haunted by his past flying in the US air force as he basically buys a ticket on the flight to chase his love Elaine (Julie Hagerty). The flight becomes a farce though as food poisoning causes problems, and it may be up to Striker to help land the plane, if he can that is with all the ridiculous amount of sweat dripping down his face. Of course the plot is not as serious at all as it sounds and to be fair it's absolutely crazy, there is two guys talking Jive, a girl who needs a transplant, a pilot who takes a keen liking to children and another pilot who's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The whole cast are like some kind of perfect casting, you just can't imagine many others replacing them and it just plays out like some kind of insane pantomime thousands of feet in the air. If there is someone who really stands out it is Leslie Nielsen as Dr. Rumack who is the definition of that timed to perfection jokes part I said about, the guys behind this picked him well and they would pick him again for the Naked Gun movies and the TV show they also made. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker direct and write this as a group and oh what a job they do, they make this movie that on the cover may look not that good but within is like a comedy master class. I think they actually tried hard to create the jokes I mean they are smart and well thought up, they poke fun at people and at other movies too and they create a lovely mess of a movie that is really well, lovable. If I have ever seen slapstick comedy done this well then it's it probably not since the golden days of the silent movie, except this movie also has jokes by people talking too which makes this even better. If you're looking for good old fun in under 90 minutes this is your treat because not only does it get you laughing but also never drags, it gets it all out what it wants to say and I felt the guys behind it would have ruined this if it would been too long. I can see some not liking it because as I previously said it's silly, some might consider themselves too high-brow but in fairness no one can deny this is smart and well thought up, it's the kind of comedy I think everyone can enjoy not just certain ages etc. So overall is it the greatest comedy ever? ,well no or maybe who really knows, but one thing is for sure this has to be up there in the lists that people make when they compile the greatest comedies. On that previous point this in my opinion should be considered one the greatest, not only does it boast laughs but they are also memorable and the line And stop calling me Shirley is one of the most famous in comedy cinema history.

Watching this film at an young age I knew it was funny, but not as utterly hilarious as my parents seemed to find it. I think I liked it due to some of the adult humour in it that my parents were letting me see for some reason. Since then, I've watched this film many times, finding it funnier and funnier every time due to my age increasing. I turned 18 a couple of weeks ago and have just finished watching it for maybe the 20th time.

Seriously. As a writer who uses no exclamation points in his work, it was almost surreal typing one. The only other quality movie I know that used an explanation point is Moulin Rouge! and that movie was as overdramatic and stylish as the collective wet dream of a group of theatre majors. To say this is a weird film would be like saying that the Eiffel Tower or the Burj Khalifa are buildings. The film is the most surreal thing this side of Monty Python. And it is the funniest movie this side of Monty Python.The eighties were a strange decade. Though I never lived in them, from my exposure to movies and music TV shows and games, I know that for a fact. Many genres and mediums deteriorated in it. Comedy films did not. While 80s comedies may not be the best comedies when viewed from a purely critical lens, they are the funniest. And isn't that the first purpose of a comedy? To make people laugh? The great comedies of the 2000s like Little Miss Sunshine and 500 DOS delve into deeper issues and give more insight than this movie. But aside from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, no movie has ever made me laugh as much as this one. The jokes come a mile a minute and many of them, from the plane crashing into the window to Otto the blow-up autopilot to the poisonous fish to the old lady who translates jive to the Don't call me Shirley. bit have passed into the realms of legend. This may not be the most quoted movie of all time, though it certainly is quoted frequently, but it just might well be the most quotable move of all time. Every line is genius.And it even does what so many lesser spoof films can't; it tells a legitimately good story. You are interested in the characters and the situation. Kudos to the directors for that. What allows the few serious and many silly elements to flow together seamlessly is how straight the characters play everything that happens. Too many unfunny comedies feel the need to point out that they made a joke. But in this film, they just keep going and it is funnier for it. This is not an always-winning formula. In a bad movie with bad writing and acting, this wouldn't have worked. But in a film like this, it does. It blows you away with nonchalant absurdity.Surreal humor is something where you need to go all in. Halfhearted attempts at it fail miserably. You need to create the atmosphere for it to work. This film does that. Like Alice in Wonderland, while it is often dramatic and heartfelt, it is never quite serious. A viewer knows that another hilarious, ridiculous joke is coming down the pip in a couple minutes at most and they just wait for it with bated breath.It's like being on a roller-coaster ride; you know the rush is coming and while you don't quite know when, you want to find out. In a move that tried to be somewhat grounded, the whole bit with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing himself but pretending not to be himself would have come out of left field. But here, it just fits the film.Before, I said that this film is not trying to dive into deeper issues, like did the great comedies of the last decade. That is still true. But it is nonetheless one of the most important films of the time period. If you are of a certain age or just a film buff like me, you likely know of the late seventies disaster movie trend.While the films were not as bad as the ones made when the genre resurged in the late nineties, it is only because the first wave of films were at least kitschy while those films were overblown in every way imaginable. And no matter how much of a guilty pleasure Independence Day is to me and no matter how much strange fondness I have for the Poseidon Adventure (which I may do a review on if I ever get the time), the truth remains that both waves of movies are terrible.This film was the antidote. It took the histrionic, needlessly grandiose, hollow feel of those movies and played it perfectly straight while throwing in a whirlwind of jokes. If you want the complete effect, watch an entire stack of disaster movies before popping in. That is how the movie is meant to be seen.Not that it's not a good film on its own right, but seeing it after watching a string of disaster films that are about an hour too long and have people who would not be smart enough to function in real life, it is glorious. When they tell everyone to prepare for crash position and everyone goes wild, I laughed so hard. Those disaster movies were just begging for someone to deliver comedic payoff. This film does.It is one of the best comedies of all time. Nothing falls short, nothing feels forced. I first watched it at six o' clock in the evening on the ground in Colorado. But I recommend that you watch it on a plane while eating fish and hoping that this trip is part of the 'sometimes' that they 'get you there.' Other than that, I have no comedic or witty lines or takes on the film, so I will leave you with the film's original tagline Slower than a speeding bullet, able to crash into tall buildings with a single bound Airplane!

However I still managed to find the jokes quite refreshing and there are many quotable lines here. Just thinking about the best quotes in the movie bring a smile back to my face. The trio of directors and writers, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker, often referred to as the ZAZ team, deliver a witty and highly quotable film. They went on to direct separate films as well and they each proved to be incredibly talented. Their greatest accomplishment was taking serious actors and trusting in them to deliver dead pan humor. No one did this better than Liam Neeson who reinvented his career after this and is now remembered by everyone for his spoof films. He was a perfect fit for the material and no one could deliver the ZAZ's ridiculous lines better than he did. Airplane! is a spoof film of disaster movies that is so cleverly written and well directed that it's hard to believe that now more than 30 years later it is still leagues better than any modern spoof comedy. The film didn't have to worry about being politically correct and there were many jokes that no studio would dare to put into their films now. Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is an ex-Air Force pilot who has been afraid of flying ever since he suffered a terrible accident. His girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), has decided to end their relationship because he is not going anywhere in life. She breaks the news to him right before boarding a flight as part of the crew. Desperate to win her back, Ted faces his fears and decides to get on board the flight as well. In mid air several of the passengers begin to feel ill from food poisoning, including the pilots, Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Dr. Rumack (Liam Neeson) is in the flight as well so he is asked to treat the ill passengers. With no pilot remaining, Elaine asks Ted to save everyone on board. With the help of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) giving instructions from the control room, Ted will have to confront his fears in order to safely land the plane and save everyones lives.The film does take a while to take off as it slowly introduces some of the characters including the Ted and Elaine relationship. It's not until Neeson appears on screen that the comedy really hits on all cylinders. He has great chemistry with Bridges and Hays so getting to see the three of them deliver their serious dead pan humor was a treat. Abrahams went on to work with Bridges in the Hot Shots movies, which also ranks as one of the better examples of spoof films, while David Zucker had tremendous success working alongside Neeson in The Naked Gun franchise. Jerry Zucker didn't have the same success with comedies, but he directed the widely beloved romantic film, Ghost. So all three directors proved their worth after the huge success in Airplane! but they also have had success in their individual projects as well. However there is no doubt that their contribution for this film laid the groundworks for what was yet to come and hopefully modern spoof films can find inspiration once again from their work. The genre seems to be dead right now, but what a revival Airplane! was for the genre in the 80's and 90's. http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The Greatest Comedy Ever (Period)","Date":"24 September 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Simply the greatest comedy that was ever made, right up there with The Blues Brothers, The Great Dictator, Blazing Saddles, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, Pink Panther Strikes Again and Night at the Opera.This film beats the expression, laugh a minute by 60 seconds.

It's almost as if American humour has changed over the years and it's just not funny any more. Airplane (or Aeroplane as it's spelled in England) has a kind of European, cynical sensibility to it. After all, these were the times when American film makers were inspired by European cinema.But since then American humour has gone down-hill I'm afraid. It's become a kind of irritating, post-modern, politically correct kind of humour - and does not translate well across the pond like it used to.I highly recommend Airplane II the Sequel.

I'm a big fan of spoofs, slapstick humour and surrealism, and all of these combine in a film which is only now starting to look slightly dated. It's also a film notable for featuring numerous 'straight' actors making their comedy debuts, making their deadpanning all the more effective.The highlight, of course, is Leslie Nielsen, whose latter-day career in comedy was launched thanks to this, but the others are still effective - particularly Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges as the harassed air traffic controllers. Meanwhile, on board the plane, all of the disaster staples and gags are rolled out to amusing effect. The gag rate is extremely high, and while not all of them are successful, at least there's never a dull moment.I have to admit that I do prefer the later spoofs by this time - such as the scattershot NAKED GUN movies - but AIRPLANE! is the one that helped to start the trend, and it's a lot of fun to sit through.

Actually, it is a must-watch-multiple-times. The jokes fly at you at such an unreal pace that it is very difficult to pick up on everything the first time. Airplane! seamlessly blends all types of humor from mundane slap-stick to cultural satire that might fly (no pun intended) right over one's head if he or she is not careful. While the primary purpose of this movie was to entertain, and very successful at doing so, on a slightly deeper level it displays the directors' opinions on late 1970's culture and media by poking fun at it. I remember the first time I watched Airplane!, I was thoroughly impressed by much of the word play and enjoyed the movie, but it was not until I had watched the movie a second time that I caught some of the cultural references and fully understood the movie. Since I did not grow up in the 1970's, some of the jokes were not funny to me personally, although I cannot hold this against the movie since I was not their intended audience. However, at the same time, some cultural satire is timeless, such as when Joey recognizes Kareem Abdul Jabbar who then denies that he is Kareem Abdul Jabbar. On paper, me explaining the jokes makes the movie sound dull and lifeless, but I promise that you will be laughing all the way through the movie. Once you have seen the movie, you will not be able to stop quoting it and you will ask not to be called Shirley. While some of the language and content might be out of today's PG rating, kids and adults can enjoy this movie together because it has the non sequitur humor kids love combined with the cultural references that adults adore. Various types of humor abound in this movie, such as an airplane tail-fin swooping back and forth through the clouds to emulate the 1975 thriller Jaws, Striker's drinking problem, and the lady translating Jive for the stewardess is sure to have everybody's laugh box hurting. If you were to go back and examine popular media from the mid-1970s, you would find the disaster films that Airplane! is directly satirizing. I can only assume that these movies were like today's teen paranormal romance novels are extremely overused and tired out. Therefore, Airplane! contains an aspect I cannot judge since I never got to experience the movie in its original context.Airplane! is perhaps my favorite movie I have ever seen. I am not a film buff by any means, but that does not disqualify from being able to judge a comedy since the true merit of the movie lie not in the cinematography or the 'stunning' performance of an actor, but in the material presented. That is not to say the acting in Airplane! was sub- par, because it was not, only that the brilliant comical material presented far exceeds the importance of the actors. Actually, writing this review is reminding me how great of a movie Airplane! is, so I might just go watch it right now! "},{"Title":"Airplane!

It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty together with Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson. The film is a parody of the disaster film genre which was popular in the 1970's and it is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.It pulls out all the clich√©s as alcoholic pilot Ted Striker, who's developed a fear of flying due to wartime trauma, boards a jumbo jet in an attempt to woo back his stewardess girlfriend. Food poisoning decimates the passengers and crew, leaving it up to Striker to land the plane, with the help of a glue-sniffing air traffic controller and Striker's vengeful former captain, who must both talk him down. Along the way, we meet a clutch of stock disaster movie passengers like the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl, a frightened old lady, and two African-American travelers whose jive has to be subtitled.Although the movie is dated,it can still be enjoyable and entertaining especially with its laughs and gags as it pokes fun on disaster films.It is one of the funniest and most inspired of the madcap genre spoofs that I have ever seen in cinema.Also,the presence of Julie Hagerty elevates the film to higher status.It is definitely a timeless film ever made.

I have already seen this movie countless times and know most of it by heart already but it can still really make me laugh out loud, every time I see it. You just never grow tired of it! Also when you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably see some of the jokes coming from miles away already but this really doesn't make them any less funny or effective, in any way.There are lots of comedies like this one, that just fire jokes at you, at an almost nonstop rate but it is very rare that at least 90% of those jokes works out as well, as is the case with this movie. A truly great comical achievement, that also can be seen as the father/mother of all spoofs.I'm not sure that all new and young viewers will get this but this movie is actually being a spoof of the disaster movie genre, which was very popular, mostly during the entire '70's period. There were lots of movies as well, in which planes got in trouble, for all crazy sort of reasons. This movie pretty much follows the same sort of story and characters, only by making fun of it this time, as well as all of its clich√©s. But even when you won't 'get' this, it really doesn't matter all too much, since the story remains simply an absolute hilarious one.The comedy of the movie is actually quite absurd and you might even call it lame and childish. It's often very simplistic and can be seen as a combination of old fashioned slapstick, lots of visual jokes, comical dialog, crazy characters and a silly nonsense story. It's also the first movie to feature Leslie Nielsen in a comedic role. Quite hard to believe that he once was a serious actor, since he grew out to become the king of spoofs. And let me tell you that he is also absolutely hilarious in his role. But that pretty much goes for every actor in this movie, simply because the material they are given to work with is so great and just spot on.The timing, the buildup, the execution, it provides this movie with more than just a couple of laughs and memorable comedy moments.

The writers & directors(Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker) continued to do this in other movies, but this was their first big one and in my opinion, their funniest. The premise revolves around an old airforce pilot, played by Robert Hays, who's chasing down his old love, played by Julie Hagerty. He boards the plane where she is a stewardess, and the movie uses flashbacks to show us their history. He's facing a fear of planes -- which he's had since the war due to an unfortunate accident that killed & injured many of his buddies. He, of course, eventually has to pilot the plane after a lot of the crew and passengers get sick from the fish they had for dinner. Pretty much everyone in the movie is there for the barrage of jokes from this group as they do it in the flashbacks and the current situation. Sure, a lot of the jokes are corny and some are just planned un-called for but it keeps you laughing. You have to be perceptive to get all the jokes -- sometimes they don't make sense and sometimes they just come too fast but that's part of the fun of the movie.

The cast does a great job especially Leslie Neilson who plays the doctor on board and Lloyd Bridges who plays the air traffic controller who picked the wrong week to quit his various vices. While some jokes reference other films it isn't necessary to know all of the references to be amused and these references are never explicitly pointed out.

All you need to know is it takes place on an airplane.While the jokes and quotes seem to dominate how one remembers Airplane! a lot of credit needs to go to the actors that pull these lines off without coming off as bizarre or stupid.

In a previous review, I commented that you must see Airplane! to appreciate the humor of Airport 75. But equally important, Airplane! stands the test of time, flying on very humorous gags, some slapstick, and some clever subtleties as well. This is a movie that must be seen more than once to catch all the jokes. Some of them fall flat, but most of them are laugh-out loud funny.The story involves a neurotic pilot who was responsible for a wartime airplane accident. Haunted by his past, he tries to win back his girlfriend who is a stewardess. They end up on the same flight together, and the film takes the viewer to some romantic flashbacks with humorous twists on such films as From Here to Eternity and Saturday Night Fever. Hilarity ensures as the passengers and flight crew succumb to food poisoning and now the pilot and his girlfriend must land the plane! Created by the famous Zucker brothers, Jerry and David, who would later go on to produce The Naked Gun, there is a great comic wit about Airplane! that makes the movie a play on words.It is the little things that make the humor stand out. One scene has the air traffic controllers reading a headline about the plane's certain crash when word gets out to the press. They each pass the paper to the next person, saying things like Passengers certain to die. The next controller takes the paper and says something like, Chicago prepares for crash landing. The third air-traffic controller takes the paper, turns it over and says, There's a sale at Penny's! These types of jokes and so many more make the movie. However, it is also the talents of Robert Hayes as lead character Ted Striker, the zany stewardess, Julie Hagerty, and the comic genius of Leslie Nielsen, as a passenger doctor that make this movie so memorable. Even June Cleaver herself, Barbara Billingsly, has a wonderful cameo as the Jive Lady! The only downside of the film is that a scene involving the scummy bar with the fighting girl scouts and the Staying Alive theme from Saturday Night Fever goes on a little too long. But this detracts very little from a fine movie. Although rated PG for some very brief female nudity and sexual innuendo, the film would be OK for most pre-teens.A bonus is that there are some scenes on the commercial TV print that are not in the theatrical release, along with some new jokes! I do not have the DVD, but it would be nice if the disk were to include a composite version of Airplane! If it does not, this should be considered for a future release.Airplane! still soars high after 28 years! This is a highly recommended film!

The poster I saw did not even make clear it was a comedy. I bought a ticket expecting a rip-off of the 'Airport' disaster movies, and was astounded to find an uproarious spoof, the best film Mel Brooks never made.Loosely based on Arthur Hailey's novel 'Flight Into Danger', the film begins with an airplane crew succumbing to food poisoning mid-flight. The lives of the passengers therefore rest on two hopes a) finding someone who can fly a plane and b) did not have fish for dinner. Enter nervous pilot Ted Striker.Incorporated into this premise are hilarious flashbacks to Striker's doomed romance with stewardess Elaine, these include spoofs of 'From Here To Eternity' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. The jokes come thick and fast, some don't work but most are on target.Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker were not the first to spoof '70's disaster movies; James Frawley's 'The Big Bus' beat them to it by about five years, but both films are excellent on their own terms.Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are fine as the romantic leads, and words cannot describe the shock of seeing Leslie Nielsen sending himself up rotten as 'Dr.Rumack'. He had appeared in a real disaster picture several years before - 'The Poseidon Adventure'. Likewise those old-timers Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack throw themselves into the fun, delivering the absurd lines with commendably straight faces. I do not think Peter 'Mission Impossible' Graves' paedophile Captain Oveur would be considered amusing today! Upstaging the cast though is 'Otto The Auto-Pilot' - an inflatable doll who not only drives the plane but gets fresh with the stewardess.'Airplane!' is widely credited with having destroyed the disaster movie genre, much as 'Blazing Saddles' did with the Western. Actually, it had burnt itself out well before 1980, as anyone who saw 'Beyond The Poseidon Adventure' and 'Airport 79 The Concorde' will testify. All 'Airplane!' did was to hammer home the final nail in the coffin.With absolutely no sense of irony, B.B.C.-1 chose as its big Christmas Day movie offering that year - Charlton Heston in 'Airport 1975'. Coming only a few months after the release of 'Airplane!' it was impossible to view this turkey with a straight face.One person who could not possibly have seen 'Airplane!' was Robert Butler. His 1997 picture 'Turbulence' ( starring Ray Liotta ) was a virtual remake, minus the jokes.Funniest moment - the passengers lining up to slap a hysterical woman, many equipped with items designed to inflict maximum injury!

This is arguably where the spoof genre reached the top before it all began to decline with the Scary Movie series. Expertly parodying the endless disaster movies of the 70's as well as setting the standard for non-stop visual gags and one-liners, Airplane! is a sublime comedy filled with a host of terrific lines all delivered with perfect po-faced seriousness. It's as silly as they come but without resorting to gross-out humour that the genre relies upon these days. This is classic comedy that almost everyone will enjoy.Robert Hays plays former military pilot Ted Striker, still traumatised by his war memories and on the verge of losing his air stewardess girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty). Desperate to reclaim her, he boards a flight to Chicago that Elaine is working on but before long, the flight hits trouble. The captain (Peter Graves) and his crew fall ill with food poisoning as well as several of the passengers and there is the mother of all storms raging outside. It soon becomes apparent that Ted is the only man who can get the plane to Chicago but can he overcome his nerves, the storm outside, the fish supper and the randy inflatable autopilot to save the day?This is not the sort of film where the plot makes sense because it doesn't. What you do get is a near-constant stream of one-liners, sight gags and old-fashioned slapstick. And when you have a cast of performers like you have here, it's almost perfection. Nielsen is a revelation as the insane Dr Rumack, never putting a foot wrong and displaying a previously unseen comic genius that has been his trademark ever since. Even basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is surprisingly good as the co-pilot. Every scene contains several lines or images that aim for the funny bone and the overwhelming majority of them find their target. You'd need to watch the film several times in order to catch everything and the only problem I can think of is missing some of them. The film is much more daring than the Naked Gun movies, with several moments when it gets quite near the knuckle such as the two black passengers who nobody else understands and the scene when the auto-pilot needs to be re-inflated by the stewardess - no prizes for guessing where the valve is! Personally, I still prefer the first two Naked Gun movies but this is right up there with the best of them. Airplane! is widely acknowledged as being one of the funniest movies ever made and I'm inclined to agree. It's a riot from start to finish, even though it may lack some of the polish of the misadventures of Frank Drebin. But Airplane! is a true classic and a milestone in movie history.

Koch, then President of Paramount and President of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. Howard was one of three screenwriters of the movie Casablanca, and had produced and directed over 40 major motion pictures at that time. Howard was also a former President of Fox Studios. I was discussing the movie industry as a business. Howard laughed and said that the movie industry was not a business, but was about as much a business as playing roulette in Las Vegas. I then asked him what was the most profitable movie that he had ever made. He roared laughing and said, the movie Airplane! He said, John, the first thing you have to understand is that the average movie produced at Paramount costs forty million dollars. There came a time about 1979 or 80 that no movies were being made here for a six week period. I hated having all this overhead cost and no movie being made. I checked our budget and we only had four and half million dollars not earmarked for another movie that year. I called my key people to my office and told them that whatever actors were on the studio lot that day were going to start shooting a movie the next day. I told my writers that they had to have the script for the first day of shooting the next morning and then had to keep one day ahead of the filming for the next six weeks. I said I didn't care what the movie as about.At the end of our first studio screening of the finished movie, every member of my family begged me not to release the movie. My wife said the movie was disgusting and an embarrassment. She said that if I released this movie she would never be able to show her face in public again.We normally spend as much in advertising and promotion on a single movie as we spent to make Airplane! With no available funds left over, Airplane! was the only movie ever released by Paramount without one dollar of advertising or promotion money ever being spent. The movie was released in 1980 and at this time (1994) the movie has grossed over $440 million dollars. It is the most profitable movie ever released by Paramount or made by me. I watched Airplane this week on television for at least the 15th time in 25 years. Even though I know almost every line by heart, I still laugh throughout the entire movie.

You'll have a great time even if you haven't seen the movies which are being made fun of (in this case, the Airport series, but also, in the fantastic opening sequence, Jaws).The jokes are flawless, exactly like the actors delivering them. Every single character is granted a moment in the spotlight, and that moment is successfully exploited. Hays is pitch-perfect right from the beginning as the naive hero driven by love, a pure, wonderful love, whose birth is shown to us in the movie's best scene, a hilarious flashback which mocks Saturday Night Fever (even my mother, who doesn't usually like this kind of comedy, enjoyed that sequence). The other notable presence is ZAZ regular Leslie Nielsen, the Laurence Olivier of spoofs (Roger Ebert's words), who makes his comedy debut playing the consistently calm and witty Dr. Rumack (when he first learns the passengers got ill by eating fish, he remarks Oh yes, I had the lasagna).More than twenty years have passed, but Airplane! has aged surprisingly well, and keeps entertaining viewers all over the world. Lovers of comedy, make no mistake this is the spoof to rule them all. Watch it, and you will experience 88 minutes of non-stop, genuine fun. Arguably the funniest film of the '80s.

Then came Airplane!, which rose from the ashes of disaster like a Phoenix to define a genre that now includes so many movies that the original merely blends in, to those who don't realize how innovative and groundbreaking it was.Plot? Yeah, there's one disgraced Vietnam veteran and PTSD sufferer Ted Striker (Robert Hayes) chases his ex-girlfriend, Elaine (Julie Hagerty) onto the flight where she is a stewardess in order to convince her not to break up with him. Sure enough, the plane encounters trouble due to food poisoning of anyone who ate fish. Ted is the only one who can save the day, and will presumably win Elaine's heart back if he does. The only problem is that the last time Ted had to save lives by flying a plane, six people died...no, seven! The plot is not what carries this film, of course. It is merely used as a delivery device for rapid-fire satire of everything from American society to air travel, our pretentiousness, and the ridiculous plots of the disaster films it parodies. Overnight, Leslie Neilsen went from a moderately known veteran actor to an A-list comedy star, and he is cashing in as much now as then on the reputation he built in that film. The deadpanning and saracasm are liberally dispensed, and juxtapose brilliantly against the absurd backdrops that keep working their way into the film.A friend of mine said she didn't see what the fuss was about this film, and all I could do was call her by name and say Shirley, you can't be serious.

Robert Hays, of the television series Angie, is Ted Striker, a disillusioned war veteran who's on the flight. When the pilot and copilot become sick due to food poisoning, the flight attendant asks if there's a pilot on board. At first, Ted denies that he's a pilot, and says that he doesn't want to do it. He's finally talked into it. Leslie Nielsen, as the only doctor on the flight, has his nose grow like Pinnochio's every time he tells a lie. When a passenger says Surely, you jest!

I think the same thing can be said about comedies. What was funny in the 1980's wasn't what is considered funny now, and vice versa. Airplane! is a good example of this phenomenon. This is a movie that used to please everyone back in the 80's, but today only people with a certain sense of humor would find it funny. This proves again that many different types of humor exist. What is so special about Airplane! is that it defines a genre, a type of humor created by David Zucker. This type of brainless, completely absurd and sometimes unpolitically correct without being offensive humor is something you won't find anywhere else now. This type of parody was also something new at the time. It also clearly wasn't influenced by the other popular comedy movies of the late 70's and of 1980 such as Caddyshack. It's a very different type of humor, and that's why I think it's so great. In my opinion, it's not stupid to call it a historical movie for that reason.This is one of my favorite movies ever, because I love this type of humor. I didn't stop laughing through the whole movie, and I can honestly say that I believe this is one of the greatest comedies of all time. Maybe it created a genre that is sometimes seen as stupid or repetitive, but it's still a movie that's worth seeing in my opinion.

That line STILL cracks me up! Still the movie is a bit overrated. I like it, don't get me wrong. Anybody who doesn't like it, is probably name Joey who like movies about gladiators. That or they too lazy like Leon to give it a try. I've always wondered why Airplane! or Flying High! worked so well whereas so many other parodies of the same type were duds. Now I know it just copied a movie call Zero Hour, the 1957 movie that was semi-actually good. Zero Hour's plot is about airplane that lost control of each of its pilots due to food poisoning leaving no one left to fly the plane. A broken down war pilot is the only one with experience, but he has not flown for 10 years and has no familiarity with aircraft of this size. Can he land this plane or crash killing everybody on board? Airplane! Pretty much follows that plot line. The spoof is the essentially parasitic form of art; it has no power but what it borrows from something else. Airplane works because of Zero Hour because Zero Hour was taken as a serious film. Airplane help launched the trend of gag based comedy in comedy movies. Until then, most comedy movies depended on character based jokes to carry the humor, with a few gags thrown in like Monty Python or Mel Brooks films. But Airplane went so far around the bend with its gag a minute by minute approach that comedies ever since have not been ashamed to rely on nonsensical jokes that broke reality and continuity. The reason why Airplane works while other spoofs fail is because it's not a Shallow Parody. Shallow Parody is when the movie produces a parody that departs too much from the original. Even if there is a lot going on in the screen, at less we know the plot is from Zero Hour. It's one of the funniest movies ever, killed the '70's jumbo jet disaster movie genre dead overnight like films like Airport and Airport 77. Surprising, if the movie were released five years later it would have received a PG-13 rating or R. The reasons for why it's PG is that the MPAA was still in it's early stages. But yes, Airplane! was rated PG and all that humor that was considered okay back in 1980 was not even close to a higher level so questionable for parents today (the poop hitting the fan, drug jokes, violence, the boobs nudity shot). All the character actors are funny. Robert Hays is laughable as Ted Strikers, the pilot that must land the plane. Robert Stack, the respected dramatic actor, playing an over-dramatic Air Force captain. Peter Graves as the original pilot of the plane who has something for kids in his cockpit. Lloyd Bridges as the man who pick the worst day to quit 'blank' who works in the flight towers with his flamboyant air traffic controller Johnny. The one actor that got a new lease on his career in this film was Leslie Nielsen. Today, he is known as the King of Parody due to his countless works on a number of parodies, but at the time, he was a straight respected dramatic actor. This was his first comedic role, and his launched his comedic career. Still, some people might not like it due to the humors being so corny, cheap by today's standard. It's more stupid than funny. Due to the years since the release, the film has become a bit a narrow parody. It occurs when the movie become too old, that producers might be afraid the target audience might be too young or just too snobby to catch the expected references, and have no concept of what they are saying. To me, personally. I believe this movie will forever stand the test of time at people will laugh at the simplities. It truly is a timeless masterpiece. So check it out. Don't take it so serious, and give in to the laughs. You find yourself, sporting a smile by the end of the film.

Also starring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock, Lorna Patterson as Randy, Stephen Stucker as Johnny and Ethel Merman as Lieutenant Hurwitz. Sending up the Airport series very well, this comedy is very clever with all the stupidity, cringing and sight gags, and it also made a comedy star of Neilsen (my favourite), who followed with The Naked Gun films, a hilarious film. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. It was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (Striker Surely you can't be serious.

These terms cannot even come close to describing it. You'll just have to see it for yourself. Every time you might try to find a sequence even remotely resembling a serious moment, forget it. It just won't happen.This movie is a psychological revelation. You have four of the most talented, serious character actors performing roles that, traditionally in their careers, would have been unheard of and unthought of early on. But here you have them, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen and Peter Graves in reciprocally roles so polarized you wouldn't have recognized them twenty years ago. In other words, having acted out so many serious roles all of those years, these veterans couldn't wait to act goofy, irreverent and downright rude. Lloyd Bridges sniffing glue as his hair flairs out then jumping out a window, Peter Graves releasing gas and throwing up on his control console and Leslie Nielsen witnessing Julie Haggerty doing something with a balloon auto-pilot that...well, shouldn't be done.There is no point in my trying to review plots and scripts because there simply aren't any. Just suffice it to say that if you have a couple of spare hours to do absolutely nothing than to absorb yourself in total hilarious nonsense, you should have a great time.(Warning Although the Motion Picture Association Of America rated this motion picture PG (Parental Guidance)rather than PG-13, some material may be unsuitable for younger children.

Most of the best spoofs made are like this, making more fun of a genre than just one movie.  Top Secret and The Naked Gun are two others that do this quite well.  This one of course is making fun for the most part, airplane disaster movies.  It does it quite well as it is one joke after another.  You have to play close attention to see some of the jokes in the background, others you have to listen for or realize what is wrong with what they are saying.  The cast is great, as Peter Graves plays the pilot of the plane, Robert Hayes as a veteran pilot, and even Karim-Abdul Jabber as the co-pilot.  Leslie Nielson of Naked Gun fame is in it as well, playing the role with dead seriousness, which makes his character all the more funny.  That is one of the problems with most of his later roles is that he is trying to be goofy and he is at his best when he is serious.  All in all this one is a laugh riot and well worth checking out.

Graves and Nielsen are particularly funny, with the latter delivering his famous Don't call me Shirley line. Some of the jokes that were timely and funny when the movie was made in 1980 don't seem that funny anymore.

Writers/directors Jim Abrams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker load the movie with so many throwaway jokes that you have to watch this flick several times in order to catch them all. Moreover, the game and engaging cast all give spirited performances Robert Hays as goofy hero Ted Striker, Julie Hagerty as daffy stewardess Elaine, Leslie Nielsen as dour Dr. Rumack, Lloyd Bridges as harried airport manager McCluskey (who picked the wrong day to give up drinking booze, taking amphetamines and sniffing glue), Stack as ramrod Rex Kramer, Peter Graves as the kinky Captain Oveur, Stephen Stucker as the zany Johnny, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as co-pilot Roger Murdock.

But don't call me Shirley.","Date":"20 June 2005","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Perhaps the greatest spoof in movie history, Airplane! is a nonstop laugh riot. The main plot, such as it is, spoofs airport disaster films but the plot here is hardly relevant. The plot really only serves to place the characters in hilarious situations as the film careens from one gut-busting gag to another. While those disaster flicks come in for the most abuse anyone and anything will be ridiculed to great comic effect. Some of the humor veers towards the politically incorrect if you're actually taking this film seriously. But if you're taking this film seriously you're missing the point. The whole thing is one big joke.If you are actually concerned with the plot, it revolves around Ted Striker, as played by Robert Hays, a wartime pilot who shall we say had some bad flying experiences during the war. He is on board this flight trying to win back ex-girlfriend stewardess Elaine, played by Julie Hagerty. The pilots of the plane (one played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who must surely be the world's tallest pilot) take ill and Striker is the only person on board who can land the plane. Is he up to the task? He certainly doesn't think so. Suffice to say much hilarity ensues.Striker (with Elaine's help) tries to fly and ultimately land the plane. Meanwhile, both on board and on the ground in the control tower, all kinds of wonderfully hilarious things are going on. Hays and Hagerty, whose characters are focusing on the task at hand, are essentially the straight people here, while the jokes and gags are left in the capable hands of the likes of Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack. Nielsen plays a doctor trying to care for sick passengers while also boosting Striker's fragile confidence. Nielsen plays the role wonderfully, with the perfect blend of deadpan seriousness and subtle comic genius. Bridges' air traffic controller, funny at first, is a bit of a letdown. He's really only got one joke and it's beaten to death. The true standout is Stack as Captain Rex Kramer, who served with Striker in the military and is now called in to help talk him down to the ground. Stack brilliantly ignores all the nonsense occurring around him and plays his character with such earnest seriousness amongst all the lunacy that he turns out to be the funniest of all.Any student of popular culture will appreciate the spot-on spoofs and references throughout Airplane! Movies as diverse as Jaws, Saturday Night Fever and Knute Rockne All American are among the many films spoofed to great effect. But even if you miss some of the references (and there are so many you undoubtedly will) Airplane! will have you laughing from beginning to end. It hilariously spoofs so much of what has come before it while adding so much brilliant fresh humor of its own. A great script brought to life by some truly great performances makes Airplane! surely one of the most consistently funny films ever.

The answer differs from person to person but if you asked me what makes a comedy good, I would probably just reply with Monty Python. Although Airplane! is not Monty Python, they both follow the same style of comedy by focusing on absurd and random events and bringing humour into each scene. Airplane! followed the same structure as what I would define makes a comedy good and this particular style is the reason I enjoyed it so much.The plot was easy to follow and the characters were not complex, which allows for a smooth following of the movie. The downside to its age is that some jokes can be confusing due to the irrelevance of what era we live in today, which did cause some confusion at times. Otherwise most jokes were employed through action rather than dialogue, although the very common pun was noticeable quite often throughout majority of the film. What seemed like a sappy romance story at the start quickly changed into a suspenseful flight full of racist stereotypes, suicide and poisonous fish. The protagonist, Ted Stiker, must overcome his fear of flying and land a plane while trying to persuade the girl of his dreams to stay with him. However it's a bit hard to do any of that when most of the passengers (and crew members) get sick after eating infected fish. We watch as Ted tells his dramatic, long and emotional story of his days back in the Air Force, which leads to some rather dark humorous takes at suicide.Aside from the occasional joke that makes very little sense to this current generation, there are times when the movie did become rather slow and I just wanted it to end. The finale of the movie involves an intense landing sequence of the plane, but for me I found the last 20 minutes to be rather boring. There were still jokes in the last 20 minutes, but they were either recycled jokes from earlier in the movie or they just failed to make me laugh. The very final scene in the movie shows a flawless character, who only played a very minor role throughout the film, fly the crashed plane into the sky with his girlfriend. While Ted stays on the ground with the girl of his dreams we watch as the inflatable auto-pilot flies the plane into the sky before giving a quick wink to the people down below.The movie was full of jokes and absurd material that I thoroughly enjoyed, however for me it is not a movie that I would watch again and again. The characters were not particularly interesting and it was, sadly, only the jokes that kept me watching. The last 20 minutes dragged on and introduced characters that I felt were unnecessary. I did enjoy it for the most part and it really does capture the absurdist nature of comedy.7.1/10~Reel Time Reviews "},{"Title":"Thank God it's Only a Motion Picture!","Date":"1 October 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" As rightly noted by the authors of the previous reviews, this film is a debut of the great American trio Zucker &#x97; Abrahams &#x97; Zucker.

I'm glad to say that 'Airplane' is the exception to the rule. It's one of those 'spoof' films which sacrifices story in favour of joke after joke after joke. Nowadays, similar humour is applied to spoof movies which lampoon one or two individual films. Back in 1980 when Airplane was made it was less fashionable to make fun of just one film, instead 'disaster movies' in general are the topic of ridicule. And, luckily, the plot is pretty simple &#x96; the titular airplane loses all its pilots (and many of the passengers) to a freak food poisoning accident (just don't eat the fish!) and a former war pilot, with a questionable track record at the helm of flying machines, must step up to save the day.You need to know that 'Airplane' is hardly 'highbrow entertainment.' It never was. It never will be. And, most importantly, it was never intended to be. The film is filled with 'pratt-falls' and dumb and silly jokes. If you've watched any of the 'Naked Gun' films, or those 'Scary/Superhero/Disaster/Delete As Applicable' Movies, then you'll kind of know the drill by now. Only Airplane was basically 'the original' of this type of film, therefore it's definitely the funniest!Part of its appeal is the fact that the film-makers seemed to steer towards casting 'non-comedic' actors is as many of the lead roles as they could, meaning everyone plays their parts 'straight' and totally deadpan. Of course the main characters are great, but it's Leslie Neilson who steals every scene in what was his first comic role on screen (but definitely not his last!).Airplane isn't the kind of movie you need to think about. You just need to be in the mood for something a bit silly (and sometimes irreverent!) to get enjoyment out of this.

This film, from the minds of David Zucker and Jim Abraham, is about a pilot who is afraid to fly boarding a plane to find his former lover, Elaine. But after the crew gets sick from food poisoning, it's up to the pilot, Ted to successfully fly the plane. But don't call him Shirley!The film is well-acted and the comedic timing is spot-on. Leslie Nielsen is excellent and delivers a career-defining performance. Robert Hays delivers a good performance as Ted and likewise Julie Hagerty as Elaine. Overall, Airplane! is a comedy classic and I feel ashamed for putting this movie off. This is the perfect example on how to make a funny spoof movie. It mainly spoofs disaster films, and it does an incredibly good job. Just thinking about the movie and the gags are making my giggle right now. Nonetheless, this should be on everyone's must-see list. I rate this film 9/10.

I know, I know. The rock I was under was pretty enormous...I feel sorry for the old me. The me that had existed before seeing the movie Airplane! I thought I knew what funny was. I had no idea what-so-ever...First off all I generally HATE spoof movies. They tend to be so ridiculous that I can't find something to care about. Don't get wrong, there are very funny spoofs out there (Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Kung Fu Hustle, Monty Python's fill in the blank... just to name a few), but the vast majority of the recent spoof movies tend to... well... suck. They suck as much as that sentence sucks. As for the Cornetto films; I put them in the same ballpark as Airplane! Not the same league, but they're definitely playing the same sport.Airplane! has pretty much everything going for it. The main film they are making fun of is Airport (which felt like a soap-opera film to me...), which had a plot that was very flexible. When spoofing a film, a flexible plot is very helpful. While most people agree that Airplane! has a weak story, I disagree. Airplane! has a simple story with amazing characters in it.In a film like this the story is always less important than the jokes, but unlike other spoofs, they don't abandon the story. The story moves along, the characters learn (granted, from absurd situations), and great jokes are played out. The mood of the film never changes despite the crazy s**t that occurs in the film. No matter how many times Leslie Nielsen says, Good luck. We're all counting on you, the mood stays grounded in some semblance of reality. Sure, we're all laughing our asses off, but the reason we KEEP laughing our asses off is that we have become invested in the simple story.My ONLY gripe is the autopilot scene at the very end. It seemed out of place. Every other joke, no matter how over-the-top, was rooted in a sense of reality except for that one scene. Even when Julie Hagerty had to... um... blow up the autopilot, the film merely suggested the autopilot enjoyed it by putting a lit cigarette in its mouth. Ultimately, it was still inanimate at that point; all that could be proved was that Julie Hagerty was pretty kinky.That nit-pick aside, the film is flat out hilarious. Some jokes are dated, but the film itself is almost, by design, dated. Even if you never saw the movie Airport, the film still works. Most of the pop culture references are pretty subtle, while the word play and slapstick take center stage.If you're an idiot like me and have not seen this film treat yourself immediately. Without a film like Airplane!, disco might've lived forever.

The script of this visual and verbal comedy is so overloaded with gags that you would think that a special Oscar would have been created to honor the geniuses who wrote this, the poster child for all spoofs of all genres, and this includes those by Mel Brooks, John Waters, Tim Burton, Neil Simon, Woody Allen, Carl Reiner and Norman Lear.A cast of very serious actors crack you up just by being serious and not cracking a smile as they say their lines. There's handsome Robert Hays as a very nervous fighting pilot, back from the war, dapper Peter Graves as the airplane's pilot who befriends a young visitor to the cockpit in a rather sick way that still creates howls, deep-voiced Leslie Nielsen as a monotoned doctor who doesn't want anybody calling him Shirley, Julie Haggerty as Hays' pretty but dimwitted stewardess girlfriend, Lloyd Bridges as a substance abuser air traffic controller, Robert Stack as Hays' former commander who has a surprise under his sunglasses, Lorna Patterson as Haggerty's co-worker who has a secret, and of course, Stephen Stucker as Bridges' very flamboyant secretary. There's a passenger who lay eggs through their mouths after eating tainted fish, a frantic passenger who is violently forced to calm down, a sweet old lady who speaks jive, an ailing little girl serenaded with hysterical results by the well-meaning Patterson, and of course, all sorts of religious fanatics at the airport who get a taste of their own medicine from the disgusted Hays.Then, there are some surprise cameos, famous today, but unexpected in 1980. Ethel Merman's outrageous appearance must have delighted her upon learning what her part would be, and she tears it up as if she was still on Broadway belting an 11 O'Clock number. Fans of Leave It to Beaver will be thrilled to see Barbara Billingsley getting down and dirty as she goes totally urban, and T.V. favorite Ann Nelson (another cute little old lady) gets to show her feisty side as she deals with Hays' sob story.Jokes range from corny to disgusting, but none of them are offensive. The character of Otto is a bit too much, however, and the gag is a bit overdone. But one small flaw out of thousands of little gems is nothing to gripe about. Bits and pieces of classic airplane movies dating back to The High and the Mighty (but mainly 1957's obscure Zero Hour!) make this a must for fans of Hollywood history, and honestly, is really a must for anybody who likes a good laugh and a love of silliness.

For example, one of the titles in the newspaper read, Meteorite lands near baby. The one glaring mistake was in the bar scene during the flashback.

Every year movies like Scary Movie, Disaster Movie or Vampires Suck are released which attempt to lampoon recent film releases, but these always fail at the most simple hurdle &#x96; being funny. In order to find some genuinely funny spoof comedy, you must go back to the very roots of the genre, and there is no finer place than Airplane!, the greatest spoof of disaster movies that exists. Why does it work so well? It's not spoofing its immediate predecessors, but films made around 25 years before it. It knows all the genre tropes so well, and subverts them for our entertainment.The film follows Ted Striker (Robert Hays), an ex-fighter pilot, who is on the same plane as his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) when both pilots and many passengers are taken ill and he is forced to try and rescue the plane. They are helped by the doctor on board, played by the genius of comic timing Leslie Nielsen, and together they manage to get the plane onto the ground safely. Normally I would apologise for writing the end of the movie in my review, but honestly, it's not the thing that you care about at all in the film.What makes Airplane! so great is the constant one-liners, and endless source of comedy in the fantastic actors, and the easy mocking of common tropes. The jokes don't feel cheap for a second, but subvert your expectations and use the many passengers, crew and people working at the airport as comedy. There are so many people involved, and everyone gets a look-in. Even the airport announcers get a joke at the very beginning, which is extremely funny and sets the tone for the film well. It's not afraid, among the barrage of lines, to refer to previous jokes and make them even funnier. The original Don't call me Shirley line which is so famous isn't actually that funny, but the followup line later on is what really qualifies the gag.Everything is spoofed in the film, even the classic disaster film soundtrack. Elmer Bernstein is used for his experience in serious films and genre classics (his scores for The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape are extremely well known), and is deliberately writing serious music so that the fact that none of it is serious is even better. Airplane! is fabulously written, and doesn't give the audience a single moment to breathe through the laughter. It truly is the greatest part of the genre that it revived, and it's a shame that its legacy is not better recognised by the trash that is A Haunted House and other films of a similar vein.

Also, Sandoric (Airplane! spoofs Zero Hour Maybe, but watch 1954' The High and the Mighty, sandoric from United States, 17 July 2005) has information about the two films that Airplane directly copies from.***Airplane! (1980, Jim Abrahams, David and Jerry Zucker) is laugh-out-loud funny throughout its 88 minutes (which fly by--hehe). It is rare that film comedies endure the test of time (and still remain funny). However, Airplane holds up well even as memory of the other films it refers to fade.Two films that Airplane shamelessly borrows from are Zero Hour, and The High and the Mighty, with John Wayne. (I haven't seen either.) Hopefully, no one fails to recognize the love scene on the beach recalling From Here to Eternity. Disaster films Airport!, Airport '75, and Airport '79 are obvious influences. Jaws appears in the opening credits. A few of John TravoltaÔªø's dance moves in Saturday Night Fever return. Airplane spoofs all these and more, as the 1970s era of disaster movies gave way to the 1980s period of derivative silliness.Airplane introduces a new sub-genre of comedy. Besides being a spoof of existing culture, scenes arrive in the style of cartoons. Any crisis that happens may be instantly forgotten. So, if a passenger (listening to sad-sack Ted Striker) has hanged himself, another has committed seppuku (stabbed himself) and a third has immolated himself with gasoline and a match, the resulting explosion will have no effect on either the plane's operation or the next scene. There is no reason to justify the litany of sight-gags either. Ergo, if Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen), the doctor on board, is suddenly performing a gynecological operation; or if he, Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and Stewardess Elaine (Julie Hagerty) are all now playing musical instruments in the cabin, these gags all come by surprise.The cartoon-like comedy style works because there is still some suspense; i.e., will the food-poisoned crew and passengers be saved from a depressed, under-confident, PTSD-suffering former war pilot whose last effort at saving a plane resulted in six deaths--no, seven. There are also great deadpan performances from the entire cast, as the principal male actors (e.g., Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and Robert Stack) all make their film comedy debuts here. Nielsen, as the doctor who appears midway, is the standout. The two principal stewardesses, Elaine and Randy (Lorna Patterson), are both skilled comediennes. Hagerty is deft with comedy and is an eye-catching romantic lead. She should have had a better career in film. (Keep an out for David Leisure, playing a Krishna years before he becomes Joe Isuzu in TV commercials.) Airplane pokes fun at Blacks, gays, Jews, WASPs, et. al, but doesn't seem offensive (to this observer). When Leave it to Beaver matriarch Barbara Billingsley intervenes in a discussion because she can translate the jive talk of two Black patrons (Norman Alexander Gibbs and Al White), this will (hopefully) produce laughter no matter who is viewing. Same with Striker's flashback during his time in the Peace CorpsÔªø when he is teaching the game of basketball to an African tribe. Seconds later they are dunking with skill.There are also many sexually-based gags that seem to push the boundaries of 1980 decency. Of course a plastic doll that functions as the automatic pilot will deflate, requiring Elaine to blow it back up. (Guess where the valve is.) Also, Elaine's deadpan description of the last sexual activity between her and former beau Striker may inspire giggles and the wonder if she really said what she did with sparkling blue eyes. (However, the gay air traffic controller Stephen Stucker plays is admittedly too over-the-top in today's reformist cultural climate.) Even if you have seen Airplane many times, this gag factory is always great fun when it appears on the big screen.

But it also grabs from a much larger bag of contemporary references the movie opens with the Jaws theme, progresses to a Saturday Night Fever parody, and casts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar specifically to make jokes about his basketball career. Abdul- Jabbar's comedic timing is a little on the slow side, but it makes no difference because the joke is that he's playing himself playing someone else. Airplane! is still funny because of the kind of comedy it uses. When it goes for topical humor, it goes so big&#x97;the biggest blockbusters, the biggest athletes, the biggest politicians&#x97;that almost everyone is in on the jokes without explanation, even decades later. A few lines might send younger viewers to Wikipedia, but those lines are the exception rather than the rule. Mostly the movie eschews referential comedy in favor of basic puns and gags. As with all comedy bits, some work (the send-ups of epic movie speeches are all well-delivered), some get old (the gay jokes haven't aged great), and a lot just depends on taste (from what I understand, some people don't like puns!) Nothing pleases all of the people all of the time, but with wordplay, surrealism, and slapstick in its arsenal, Airplane! probably pleases all of the people some of the time.

A subplot involves Striker helplessly trying to win his estranged girlfriend, Elaine, back.This comedy spoofs countless of other movies including Jaws, The Poseidon Adventure, Shane, Casablanca and Saturday Night Fever, delivered in this film where slapstick comedy, deadpan delivery, dark humor and witty remarks are all in abundance. Yet, while this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, the cast of characters were calm, collected and sometimes dramatic in their roles, providing you comedy that is not overly-acted or childishly done.In addition to the actors' performances, there are absurd humor popping up all over the place, for example, a smoking/non-smoking ticket with real smoke oozing out; castle thunder inside the airplane; falling watermelons; exploding cigarettes; radar screen with a built-in microwave oven; arguing airport voice-overs, etc.All the actors were awesome in their roles, especially Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Peter Graves, Leslie Nielson and Robert Stack. They all blended in satire, wit and drama in a comedic way, delivering hilarious performances.There are too many comedic moments to be included in one review, so I recommend you give this film a watch. It is a great laugh-fest from start to finish!

Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and Leslie Neilsen shine in their roles, totally ignoring the mayhem around them. For Neilsen a man known for playing solid drama roles, it gave him a lucrative extension in his career as a slapstick comedy actor.Airplane is just plane crazy.

The springboard (or take-off point, if you like) was a 1957 drama/thriller called Zero Hour! which, in fact, wasn't too bad. Dana Andrews was the ex fighter pilot in that one. Not only was the central dilemma borrowed but the pilot's name too, Ted Stryker.The other 300 or so reviews have probably covered the plot and given away most of the gags, so I won't bother, except to say that this ranks up there alongside some of the Marx brothers' movies. It may be a bit sillier sometimes than the Marx brothers but the spirit prevails.I get a kick every time I watch the ligneous Robert Stack wearing a big pair of shades confront a subordinate. It's time to face FACTS, he declaims, and whips off his sunglasses only to reveal another, smaller pair beneath. Stack, who gave fine informal interviews, always reminded me of some kind of redwood tree on the screen. And it's by cashing in on this professional inability to act that he succeeds in the role. If Stack acted the way the others do, knowing it was a joke, it would no longer be a joke. And the writers have given him the best lines -- the climactic advice he gives to Ted Stryker after the successful landing. You know what Christmas was to me? A fall into the mud. Ever been kicked in the head? . . . by an iron boot . . .? No, that's silly. Don't answer that.

Airplane fits the bill. Its literal depictions and interpretations keep the laughter rolling. Frantic Ted purchases a plane ticket and the woman behind the counter asks whether he would like smoking or nonsmoking- he replies with the preference of smoking. The woman behind the desk proceeds to hand him a ticket with smoke rolling out of every crack as if this occurrence was as natural as waking up in the morning. Taking an everyday saying and communicating it literally through the actors and the acting effectively translates into comical media; this has enlightened me to the various phrases I often use but never really stop to think why I say them. This realization can help me develop better understandings of the world and my interactions with others.People often enjoy laughing at their life situation or habits. It can translate to the awareness of the waste of the way people live. A scene from the film even depicts people as cargo as they slide down the automatic luggage shoot and around the monotonous conveyor belt to search for their bags. The ridiculous English to Spanish translations, drug-addicted chief, and overblown stereotypes reveal the thematic element of the deconstruction of modernity. Society incessantly thrusts towards automatism and electronic functions. The film pokes fun of social realities, but effectively transforms them into comedy; the comedic qualities elicit genuine confusion yet hilarity, sort of like The Three Stooges. Society seems to progress, but not as quickly as most believe it to. Evidence of cultural tensions emerges, but Airplane executes this in a way that nearly no one would take offense. Social prejudice continually presents itself as an issue, just as the film presents the Air Israel plane as it sports a beard, scarf, and yarmulke, or the two dark-skinned men talking in Jive. Awkward moments happen, but comedy abounds as the tension relief. Comedies often utilize the technique of irony, and accordingly evidence of this bursts throughout Airplane. For example, when Ted falls madly in love with Elaine at the dance, the song Stayin' Alive breaks out of the jukebox, but people around them drop dead like flies. Also, Kareem Abdul Jabar's character's name (Roger) relates a radio conversational term, hence creating zoo-like confusion over the pilot chatter. Do you roger, Roger? The film uses flashback sequences to delineate Elaine and Ted's tale of love, but mostly when not in a flashback scene, Elaine avoids Ted. Their relationship rekindles as the story ensues. The way Ted gawks at Elaine and reminisces to the unfortunate folks nearby about his and Elaine's relationship relates that he still has feelings for her.The airplane setting presents a confined area for the action to occur, in return creating the potential for conflict. Absurdity bounces off every wall as characters act unpredictably; the situation of a disaster feels realistic but the hyperbolized actions make it jocular. What other movie would have a jumping heart ready for transplanting, an inflatable copilot, or arguing instructors at the loading zone?

This movie to me depicts everything that you hope does not happen when you get on a plane. With this movie taking place in the airport and on the plane I think the director based this movie solely so that if you were already afraid to get on a plane you now will do anything in your power to stay off of them.This movie is one of the greatest comedy/spoof movies I have ever watched. I had never even heard of it before I had to watch it for class and now I can not stop talking about it! No, it doesn't have the sad love story or the crazy action scenes, but it keeps you laughing all the way through. The one liners and spoofs do not stop from the time the opening credits begin till the movie ends. I really give credit to the writers because I feel that this is what made other movies come to existence. Without this movie I doubt we would have ever watched movies like Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie.The main character in this film is a man by the name of Ted Striker. Mr. Striker is a man that you see cry over and over again to people, which shows he is weak, but it all had to do with the love of his life and in the end he will do anything for her! It really shows us how strong love can be. The man does have some major problems though, and like already stated they all start when he doesn't want his relationship with his love to end. He not only tries to save his love life by getting a ticket on her plane that she is the steward on, but he ends up being the only one that can fly the plane when the problem arises. This movie is pure comedy, but the directors do show us what happens if you do not give up and get over your fears. I think this is the one real life thing you can get out of this movie.Airplane really showed the craziness and diversity that hops on planes everyday. I have flown many times myself and the diversity you find on a plane is crazy. In the movie there were a mom and her sick daughter, two African-American males that jived, a couple of old ladies, and the stewards. Like I've already said this movie was hilarious and without these people we wouldn't have had all of the laughs. I also like the scene changes from the cockpit to the control room at the airport. This gave us part of the storyline, while also giving us an insight of the craziness going on in both of them we would not have seen otherwise. It really cracked me up to hear one of the men talking about it being a bad day to quit smoking cigarettes, while the other man has to take amphetamines to get through the night.This film has definitely taught me to not be so eager to jump on a plane. Yes, this film is so far fetched, but I guess you never know when your pilots will eat bad fish! I'm also not so sure there could be so many problems going on in a plane and it actually land without everyone dying! I guess when you have a man that overcomes his fear and is determined to save every ones life miracles can happen! Overall, I love this movie because these are all real life scenarios that could occur, but with a little added spice to make you laugh all the way through! OK, Maybe they are not all real life scenarios!

You see, I'm not even discussing that and I already give the film an 8. I know for some hardcore fans, it's a sacrilege and I should fry in hell for not having given a 10. And any rating below 10 is an insult. I know, I know &#x85; but I still give it an 8 anyway. Shirley, I can't be serious? Well, I am serious and be serious too, it's not like my humble opinion won't change the face of the Earth, it's not like everyone would be reading this review! Gee, why am I ever wasting my time, my life for a bunch of miserable &#x85; whoops, sorry. Anyway, just allow me to make my point.Yes, Airpane! is one of the greatest American comedies, rightfully put in the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs, in the Top 10, along with Duck Soup, MASH and Blazing Saddles. But let me tell you something you probably know, most of the films' inclusions are based on pure 'classical' criteria rather than ratio of laughs-per-minute, and I believe Airplane! owes its place to its pioneering value on the spoof movies' sub-genre, but to say that this is the funniest spoof movie ever made is a stretch. For my part, I believe that Jerry and David Zucker, with their acolyte Jim Abrahams, the ZAZ trio, made the funniest comedy ever with Top Secret! and that Airplane! doesn't hold a candle to The Naked Gun or This is Spinal Tap from Rob Reiner, or a movie hysterically offensive called Man Bites Dog (a Belgian laugh riot and masterpiece of dark humor).But you know (you probably don't, and probably don't care), I used to love Airplane! whose title in French is even more hilarious because it means, Is There a Pilot in the Plane? I used to watch the film so much I could recite it by heart, then after a few years, I saw it again, and many gags fell flat. I tried to figure why I thought the film was 'slower' than the other ZAZ installments. And today, I think I can finally say 'Eureka!', I have diagnosed the problem with Airplane! and it' s a big one, believe me, the kind that can really undermine the quality and/or the overall appreciation of a film. So, the problem of Airplane! is (untenable suspense) &#x85; no, wait, there's a better way to demonstrate it. Think of all the most memorable gags, puns or slapstick jokes from Airplane! and tell me what are the ones you immediately visualize? For some, it would be Captain Oveur asking Billy if he likes movies about gladiators, the nonsensical exchange between Victor, Oveur and Roger with the operating tower, scene- stealing performances from Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges who picked the wrong week to quit smoking, drinking and sniffing glue the irritating Johnny, the little girl who takes it black like 'her men' (and the boy's priceless WTF reaction), Leslie Nielsen trying to reassure the passengers or slapping a panic-stricken woman, the jive- talking guys, the nun, the sick little girl, Leslie Nielsen having lasagna, how could I forget Otto, the automatic pilot and the 'Putana Da Seatbeltz' signal. I can go on and on, Oveur and Oveur again (yeah, I can do lousy puns, too) but didn't you notice there are two characters cruelly missing?Yep, Michael Hayes as Ted Stryker, the aviator and war-veteran and Julie Hagerty as Elaine Dickinson the flight attendant &#x85; the leads, the actors are good, don't get me wrong, but they're just good. The film features such a colorful and great gallery of supporting characters (even the passengers were funnier) that I couldn't believe it would feature such a dull romantic couple. Seriously, don't you feel like the real star is Leslie Nielsen (R.I.P), and that the directors probably remarked his comical potential? And that Hayes and Hagerty didn't make much a career in comedies after this film (I don't even want to mention the dull sequel) is a credit to my theory that Airplane! could have been better wit other actors. Am I alone who hated the flashback parts, not unfunny but too long without bringing much to the film, it distracted from the gripping atmosphere inside the plane to feature some 'meh' scenes.God, the dreadful flashbacks! As much as I loved Elmer Bernstein's opening score, I couldn't stand the romantic tune that was overplayed ad nausea. Just because Airplane! features a hilarious script and gags that sound great on the papers, I don't think it means you should take your casting for granted, some parts begged for a funny gag to work as the pay-off rewarding our patience but no. Stryker is in a bar, we hear a sax playing and it's Elaine who plays (funny?), then a bar fight is started by two big blonde girls (funny?), one of them hits the juke-box and the 'Saturday Night Fever' parody starts, too long a set-up for a too long gag. And the parts in the hospital or Africa were so painful that I wonder if the reactions of Ted's listeners were not a reflection of our thoughts, Ted was a real pain in the ass.Apart from the two leads, every single gag in Airplane! was funny or hilarious, the rest of the film, they're like the straight men of a joke they don't get but we do. The romantic aspect or the trauma in Ted's heart was overdone more than if it was a romantic comedy. Now, I feel better because I know what's wrong with Airplane! and I'm comfortable with that, and whenever I would ask someone about his favorite gag, I know it would never feature Hagerty and Hayes together, and we know that the best gags features neither of them.

I used to think that he was funny, but with bad movie after bad movie, I began to find him quite boring. In fact I did not laugh once during Spy Hard.Flying High, or Airport as it is known in America, is not the case. In fact I found that Flying High is quite witty and very funny. There are a few things that seemed too stupid, such as the comments that Johnny makes in the flight tower at the end, but the humour generally is quite consistent, and funny.The thing about Johnny is that he does not really seem to fit in with the flow of the movie. The style of Flying High is that it is farce, namely the actors are dead serious while really bizarre things are going on around them. The actors will say funny things yet be dead serious about it as if it is a natural part of life. This is what makes Hot Shots such an impressive movie because Charlie Sheen is so serious in that movie. Johnny though does not seem to fit into the mould instead he is a silly character that says silly things and is never really serious about it.Leslie Neilson, who plays the doctor, on the other hand is quite serious. He is not trying to be funny in this movie, and as such he is. The interaction between the pilots in the plane is cool. In fact Flying High has numerous word plays, Captain Oveur, and Roger the co-pilot. Then there is my favourite line printed below. Along with the word plays, which are very clever, there is also slapstick, which never really impresses me, and more blatant sexual humour, which I don't really like.The cast is quite well know as well Leslie Neilson, Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack. The main characters are actually relatively unknown, but these three are some of the old guard, memorable actors from the early eighties. Neilson is still making comedies, which I refuse to see, I don't know where Bridges is, and Stack, the last time I saw him, was hosting America's Most Wanted.Flying High is actually quite a good movie. It is one of those movies which seemed to begin a trend in the style, though there were probably some before hand. Rather Flying High is the more famous one that most people can remember.

Even after today this film still cracks me up for the countless of jokes from the get go.The crux of the story (yes there is one!) is the romantic dalliance between a cab driver and one time air force pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) who tries to reconcile with estranged girlfriend, stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). Not taking no for an answer, he follows her onboard her flight to Chicago, and in between boring passengers with flashbacks to the good ol romantic days, his lack of confidence in flight gets called upon as all the pilots get put out of action through a bout of food poisoning.And it's a tremendously busy flight with a myriad of caricatures in the passengers that do things that are plain implausible it's funny. Not only that, we also get ground crew trying to guide the plane to touchdown at the airport, and one of the inane characters Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, responsible for many of the literal comedic and nutcase moments. And of course there are famous names attached to the film such as Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the basketballer, all eyes are of course on Leslie Nielsen as the doctor on board Dr. Rumack, who immortalized the line and don't call me Shirley, with his signature deadpan reaction, and who would go on following this film to make the Naked Gun series with the filmmakers here.One thing that strikes you when watching this film in retrospect, despite its comedic intent, is how lax air travel security tend to be back then, especially when cockpit visits are now totally banned. Buying a ticket at the last minute at the counter in similar fashion as what was done in the film also doesn't raise too many alarm bells, compared to what if one is to do the same today. And barging into the control tower, well I guess the rules have changed.That aside, this film may look a little dated, but the brand of comedy the Zucker brothers and Abrahams have given to the cinematic world is priceless and extremely hard to emulate, try as hard as some hacks in today's era would in choking their film with impersonators and spoofing modern pop culture, which gets so tired after a while.

There is a doctor on the plane (Leslie Nielsen) but his intelligence level is highly questionable. When the pilots pass out, Elaine flies the plane for awhile, with the help of the chief ground control officer, Steve (Lloyd Bridges) and the auto pilot, an inflated balloon-man with his hands on the controls. Ultimately, however, Elaine and the other passengers are doomed unless they can convince Ted to take over. Will he muster the courage to land the plane safely? So far, this description does not do justice to the non-stop hilarity that this film brings. Made on the heels of the disaster film decade that started with Airport and the Poseidon Adventure, this is a masterful send-up of the genre. The casting of the mostly serious actors, Bridges, Graves, Robert Stack and, especially Nielsen, to play against type is a stroke of genius. Nielsen's career changed 180 degrees from this role, leading him to the classic and much-adored Naked Gun films. But, Bridges and Stack are also extremely funny, as are the others. Just watching the former Sea Hunt superhero chain smoke and take uppers and Stack deck every panhandler in the airport, from the Hari Krishnas to a gentleman who claims to be collecting for Jerry's kids, is fall off the couch funny. Jabbar, too, is fabulous as the co-pilot named Roger who, nevertheless, takes insults from a young kid who knows he is the basketball star. Hays and Hagerty, as the young, naive couple among veterans, do a fine job as well. As for the entire rest of the supporting cast, they are great, also. The film, naturally, looks a bit dated in setting and costumes, but who cares? Above all, the Zuckers and Mr. Abrahams, who wrote and directed the film, deserve the highest words of praise for giving this supreme mood elevator to the movie watching world. Anyone who can sit through this flick without grinning should be taken to the funeral home, immediately.

It is jam packed with gags and one liners that would make Groucho Marx proudThere really isn't anything bad to say about this film. Immature? Yeah, sure, but still funny to almost everyone regardless of taste. Its easily the best comedy of the 80s if not the best comedy ever made. It doesn't get annoying like many other films in its style, it stays hilarious the whole time, and it will be hilarious for years and years to come.

He plays one of the greatest comedy roles ever, and with the help of Robert Hays, Lloyd Bridges, Julie Hagerty, Peter Graves, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, this film becomes legendary. There is truly too many great lines to even begin picking favorites. Now, is Airplane my favorite comedy? No. I'm not going to sit here and say I love it to death.

I can still watch it 30 years later and still laugh and enjoy the slapstick. Former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hayes) is trying to mend his relationship with stewardess Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). To do that, he boards an ill-fated commercial airliner. You see, one of the main meals has food poisoning, rendering the crew sick. This leaves Striker as the only hope to land the plane. Through all this, he meets a zany cast of characters Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielson), Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges), Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) and Johnny (Steven Stucker). This was also the premiere of the Zucker/Abraham/Zucker team that gave us great comedy parodies such as The Naked Gun, Top Secret, Hot Shots ... just to name a few. With this, they threw jokes so fast that as some fell flat, most hit the target dead-on. There are sight gags, one-liners, crazy situations and hilarious scenes that have aged well and are still funny to this day. I recall having to go to the movie several times to notice peripheral jokes, and hear the lines muffled by all the laughter in the theater. Not only does Airplane make a stab at the endless annoyance of the Airport movies, the ZAZ team knew how to poke fun at other great movies From Here to Eternity, Saturday Night Fever, and the All American. Finally, what this movie did was set the standard for the parody. We have original characters, original story, and dialog laced with the lampooning and endless jokes instead of modern parodies which tend to copy characters and lines and are unable to become their own movie and find their own humor.

It's been nearly three years since I got around to watching the 1988 David Zucker/Jerry Zucker film, The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! and its two sequels, 1991's The Naked Gun 2¬Ω The Smell of Fear and 1994's Naked Gun 33 1/3 The Final Insult, neither of which lived up to the original. I didn't find the third installment in the trilogy funny at all, after finding the second one to be hit and miss. For a while now, I've known that Airplane! was another Zucker effort (I now know that Jim Abrahams was involved in the making of both movies as well), and both films are very popular parodies. I also knew that both of them featured Leslie Nielsen in the cast. It took me a while, but I was intending to watch this 1980 comedy eventually, since I found The Naked Gun so funny, and now that's finally happened. For a while, it looked like I wasn't going to find it nearly as funny as so many other viewers have, but that didn't last.Ted Striker is a former American fighter pilot who is now a cab driver. He was traumatized during his service in a certain war, so he now suffers from a fear of flying and a drinking problem (not alcoholism, but the fact that he misses his mouth when he tries to drink). At an airport filled with religious people trying to get others to make donations, Ted meets his former lover, Elaine Dickinson, who is currently a stewardess and is no longer interested in him. Determined to win her back, the ex-soldier decides to face his fear of flying and buy a ticket for the next flight Elaine will be serving on. During this flight, it isn't long before Elaine discovers that Ted is on board, but unfortunately, his attempts to save their relationship continue to fail, and this flight is headed for a lot of trouble! He sits beside various other passengers on the plane and tells them about his days as a fighter pilot, how he met Elaine, and experiences he had with her, but listening to him makes these passengers suicidal! Eventually, the vast majority of the passengers fall ill from food poisoning, and after this problem starts, the pilots soon fall ill for the same reason, meaning they can no longer operate the plane! The film begins at the airport, and there sure are some funny parts here. The first REALLY funny one might be the argument between the two announcers about the red zone and the white zone. To me, it looked promising around this time, but didn't quite stay that way. I wasn't sure what I thought of all the flashbacks and more than one romance scene with a romantic musical score. For a while, it seemed only mildly amusing to me, and not enough to carry the film, but I then found that it improved. The flashbacks get funnier, with scenes such as the male soldier who thinks he's Ethel Merman (played by the real Ethel Merman) and others. Many funny things happen on the plane as well, such as the reactions of the passengers who listen to Ted's stories, a kid named Joey in the cockpit of the plane recognizing one of the pilots, Roger Murdock as basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who plays this character), the hysterical woman being shaken and slapped by several different passengers, the automatic pilot (an inflatable pilot which is funny to look at), etc. The cast performances in general are good, and Leslie Nielsen doesn't appear for a while, but once he does, he sure helps a lot with the humour in the role of Dr. Rumack, saying funny lines such as, Don't call me Shirley (in response to Ted saying surely). Also, some very funny things happen in the scenes involving members of the control tower staff.28 years after the release of this successful comedy, a spoof film known as Disaster Movie came into theatres, which was written and directed by the mysterious and despicable Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. I don't know how many times I've said how much I hated Epic Movie, another film of theirs released the year before that, which is why I've refused to watch any other movies they've done in the past four years, since none of them seem to have a better reputation than the one I saw! So, I haven't seen 2008's Disaster Movie and don't intend to, but know that as well as receiving a lot of criticism for being atrociously unfunny, it has also been criticized for its misleading title, as some of the movies spoofed in it are certainly not disaster ones. I can most definitely believe that, but Airplane! is a REAL disaster movie spoof, even though it doesn't have the word disaster in the title, and is MUCH funnier than anything Friedberg and Seltzer could probably ever dream of doing! I can't say I agree with those who say this 1980 spoof is one of the funniest movies or the funniest movie of all time, but if comedies filled with slapstick and silliness appeal to you, it is worth watching.

It's heavy on slapstick, and while some of the humor is pretty juvenile, there are some hilarious scenes. One of my favorites is Lorna Patterson as a singing flight attendant nearly killing heart transplant candidate Jill Whelan. Patterson has another great moment - when she has to ask passengers what they ordered for dinner. Her reaction - turning away from the passengers and biting on her finger with a look of abject horror - is priceless. I also love the Saturday Night Fever takeoff when the two leads (Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty) meet.Everyone plays their parts with dead seriousness; in fact, actors not known for their comedy - Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nielsen (who started a second career with his performance) and Peter Graves, to name a few, were cast for just that reason. Great idea that works very well.Very enjoyable, with lots of funny moments and good performances.

In his wish to get her back, he follows her aboard the plane, although he has had a deep aversion against anything winged since he lost several men in the war. During flight, he tries to contact her again and again, but as the crew and many passengers get seriously ill due to a bad fish meal, he has no chance to get to her. In fact, Ted Striker seems to be the only healthy person aboard that has piloting experience.

Old pros Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack show up and pull off their roles perfectly. This is like a joke book--the jokes keep coming at you and if one doesn't work don't worry--another one will be coming in a few seconds. Also the movie is only 84 minutes--perfect for this type of movie. There are tons of funny moments but my favorite involves the singing stewardess and the sick little girl. This is also Ethel Merman's last movie and started off Nielsen's career as a comedic actor (before this he just did dramas).

For example, people under 40 may not even know that until this movie, Leslie Nielsen was strictly a serious actor in dramas both on TV and in film. Many may watch 1973'sPoseidon Adventure for the first time today and keep waiting for Nielson - as the captain of the doomed ship - to get up from the dining room table wearing just his heart-covered underwear below the waist, or for him to make that first clueless remark. He never does. But from this film onward, he was strictly a comic actor and a good one. Quite a sharp turn for age 55.Just think how tight a line you have to walk with such silliness in order to be brilliant versus inane. What could have easily been the first winner of the Razzie Worst Picture award instead was the first major film of its genre and over the last 30 years has inspired some creative as well as mundane imitators. To understand the film's success you have to look at the time in which it was made - late 70's early 80's. The sarcasm of the post-Watergate era in which everything is fair game for ridicule started on TV with Saturday Night Live, and first appeared on the big screen with Kentucky Fried Movie, but this was the first and best big-budget attempt at such material.In addition to being the beginning of an era, it is sadly the end of one - one in which we all didn't take ourselves quite so seriously. There is no way today that you could make a movie where people are speaking jive as though it were a foreign language or where an Air Israel plane is shown complete with kosher beard. There would be an outcry followed by Congressional hearings. In 1980, there was still a perspective that making fun of certain perceptions and admitting that they are there is a better approach to bringing us all together than just ignoring them and sweeping them under the rug. There's yet another good approach to bringing people together - laughs, of which this film is full.Just a word of caution - if you've never seen any of the serious airplane disaster movies that preceded this one such as the Airport movies of the 1970's or the 1950's film High and the Mighty, this film will ruin them for you. They all become comedies. Thus you might want to see them before you see Airplane - or if you want to laugh some more, see Airplane first.

The influence of this comedy is incredible and there was an influx of films inspired by it's brand of laughs, both in spoofing popular fare relevant to the audience of that time, while constantly poking fun at the English language and how to wring every ounce of silliness out of it's premise. Mostly the targets are those Airport movies, romances like From Here to Eternity, war films, and every religion and culturally significant topic that Abrahams, and the Zuckers could lambaste and parody. Nothing and no one was off-limits. I think a part of it's success was the casting. The absolute perfect choices for the parts, played wonderfully straight, selling the jokes and sight gags for all their worth.

A spoof of the 70's disaster movies or any movie and cultural reference it can get its hands on, AIRPLANE! has become a yardstick of which all movie spoofs are measured. Some label it one of the funniest comedies ever (some would argue it is THE funniest), and it's hard to disagree with that.To the uninitiated, the movie is actually a shot-by-shot remake/parody of the 50's disaster movie ZERO HOUR! (with Dana Andrews as the original Ted Stryker!) ZAZ bought the script and basically remade the film, only giving it a comedic twist. AIRPLANE! makes fun of the clich√©s, stock characters, and silly subplots of the other 70's disaster movies, not primarily ZERO HOUR! but also other disaster movies like AIRPORT 1975 (the infamous nun scene). A shot-by-shot spoof rarely works, but AIRPLANE! does the job perfectly.But whether or not you've seen any of the movies it parodies, AIRPLANE! has a lot jokes and sight gags that work in spite of itself. Surely you don't need to see any of the movies to find the Surely, you can't be serious scene. This is probably why AIRPLANE! is widely revered as one of the best comedies ever.

(1980).He stated that the Steven Spielberg project, 1941, was thought to be the sure thing hit both with the Critics and the Public (via Box Office). His reply in brief said that it was 1941 that was the part coveted by most any actor. The role in AIRPLANE! was considered as a throw-in,something to do, but little else.He further reported that he had the opportunity to invest in the modest budget for the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker shoe-stringer, but declined; settling instead for just the Part of the highly authoritarian Captain Rex Kramer.Mr. Stack admitted his mistake in missing out on what would have been super profit, with 1941's being highly disappointing returns! Sorry 'bout that, Bob! The Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker team had been part of a College Years improvisational group called Kentucky Fried Theatre. It was based in Madison, Wisconsin-home of the University of Wisconsin. Their group was no doubt, sort of patterned on Chicago/Toronto's Second City units, which are seen as the Zenith of Improv.They had a previously made film, KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE (1977), written by the Trio and directed by John Landis. So, now they were out there on their own, Writing and Directing.The story of a pair of young lovers going through a rough time, with a fatally flawed Commercial Flight from Los Angeles to Chicago as the exciting back drop. The story did all of the obligatory character studies of the various passengers, as established as a must by Howard Hawks' John Wayne Starring Vehicle, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY(Warner Bros.,1954);and followed by AIRPORT(1970) and all of its successors.The plot has the entire flight crew becoming victims of food poisoning and passenger ex-Airforce Fighter Pilot, Ted Striker(Robert Hays) into the Pilot's chair, all relying on him to save the day! This may sound familiar to you. There was this Paramount Feature Film, ZERO HOUR(1957), which the Production Team of AIRPLANE! took and fractured the script! They essentially went through the situations and the fractured them. They used the now more familiar and proved ploys of using the overly dramatic, the absurd dialog and some non-sequential happenings.A good deal of this was the exaggeration of occurrences and application of the Literal interpretation of commands or requests. I.E., or E.G., (whichever floats your boat!)Ted Striker It's a whole new ball game, all together!, Elaine(Julie Haggerty) and Dr. Rumack(Leslie Nielsen) It's a whole new ball game! In AIRPLANE! The Kentucky Fried Theatre crew proved themselves and brought in Big Buck$ for the Studio involved, Paramount Pictures. And this success led to Television's POLICE SQUAD!(1982) on ABC. Abandoned by a Network because, It demanded too much of the viewers Attention.(WHHHAAAATTTT??) But that led to the adaption of the POLICE SQUAD! idea to the Big Screen in the THE NAKED GUN FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD!(1988), and two sequelsTHE NAKED GUN 2 1/2,THE SMELL OF FEAR(1991) and THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3 THE FINAL INSULT(1994).In the end, Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker were relocated to the upper tier of the Hollywood productions pecking order and Leslie Nielsen enjoyed a new birth, as his career ascended higher than ever before!

The gags come at a rapid clip, and what sets Airplane!'s brand of humor above the more vulgar profiteers of recent years (the Farrelly brothers, for instance) is how subtly racy it feels, even today--from fellatio to cocaine to abortion to gynecology to the stereotypical way we perceive a person's manner of speaking (exhibited brilliantly in Barbara Billingsley's interaction with the jive-talking black guys), nothing is sacred (nor explicit), and that in itself is an achievement.

I thought at this point I would be watching an intelligent spoof/parody film. Boy how wrong could I be?To start with, Airplane was very repetitive and just seemed to recycle the same jokes throughout the film - this would be perhaps slightly forgivable if the jokes were funny in the first place - the gag where one person was announcing that you can drop off in White Zone areas and not red Zone and the other was saying you can in Red Zone and not White Zone wasn't particularly funny the first time, but this joke was repeated about 3 times. Ted (Robert Hays) boring everyone about his relationship with Elaine (Julie Hagerty) and each passenger he talks to wanting to kill themselves, this quickly became tired and predictable.There were also a couple of 'WTF' moments like when Captain Oveur says to the young boy 'Have you ever seen a grown man naked'? WTF why would you include that line in the script? I'm no prude, but that was just a little too weird for me and frankly I'm amazed that they got away with an old man saying that to a young boy even back in 1980. The other WTF moment was the 2 black guys talking in their own language, at the start of the flight. Later on in the film one of the stewardesses asks if one of the men is OK, the black guy shouts some incomprehensible reply which the stewardess doesn't understand. An old white lady then approaches the stewardess and says 'I can speak 'Jai' which is their language and replies back to them in the same incomprehensible way. This was painful to watch. I think if they'd have written the 2 black characters as posh people who speak in well spoken English accents and the crew wrongly assume that they can't speak English that this would have been more 'subtly' funny with positive connotations.The relationship between Ted and Elaine (which is told in flashbacks) was pretty boring to watch, but then again the whole film was pretty poor. We find out once we delve into their relationship that Ted was in charge of a raid that went wrong during the war in which 7 members of his crew were killed which Ted feels guilty for her as he says he is to blame - (this explains his reluctance to fly the plane when it turns out he is the only person who can fly the plane who hasn't eaten the fish which is what made all the crew ill) and this proves to be a problem for him in his relationship with Elaine as he can't let go of the past and she wants him to stop blaming himself and move on, but it also leads to him saving the day as Dr Rumbeck (Leslie Nielsen) tells Ted that one of his crew called Zip (who died during the war and shortly after speaking to Rumbeck) told Rumbeck that Ted wasn't to blame for the crew's death. Before this conversation, Ted had all but given up on attempting to land the plane as he had lost his confidence, but this spurs Ted on to land the plane and save the day.There were a few good moments in Airplane; Leslie Nielsen was great as Dr Rumbeck (although he was let down by a poor script). The 'Oveur' and 'Roger' scene at the start made me chuckle and the small scene where the 2 children are having tea together was also pretty funny. The acting was generally good, although Julie Hagerty was a little wooden.Unfortunately the bad far outweighs the good and Airplane is dated, largely unfunny, and repetitive. I'm at a loss as to what people find funny about it.

Basically while on a plane ride many of the passengers get sick after eating bad fish and that included the pilots. A guy on board trying to win back his lover is a military pilot but he had lots of problems that haunt him horribly and he is scared to even be on planes, yet he goes on chasing his girl. Now he is asked to fly the plane and he has to step up to the plate and face his fears. --That sounds like it could be serious, but believe me its one big wacky airplane ride.This movie has always been one that has made me laugh. I have watched those AIRPORT movies a few times and so many things about them are just too serious and too cheesy, and AIRPLANE holds no punches in making fun of them..my favorite of course is the sick girl parody.. Linda Blair plays a sick child in AIRPORT '75 and she is sung to by Helen Reddy who is a nun and plays guitar, and in here a kid is sung to and its just a hilarious spoof that cracks me up.This movie has so many one liners and speeches and puns and ad-libbed jokes and it's one of the best films out there to get quotes from. It parodies several movies including Saturday Night Fever with the staying alive number and also Jaws and so much more..Another great joke is the Autopilot being an inflatable pilot.This movie has some of the best actors too. Robert Hayes and Julie Haggarty are the leads, but thats nothing compared to the unexpected roles here.. 4 major players here are Lloyd Bridges, Leslie Nelson, Robert Stack and Peter Graves. Those 4 actors are serious actors who had never done comedy before, It's hard to believe with some of these guys that they were doing comedy for the first time because they were absolutely hilarious. Leslie Nelson is like the king of parody movies, but this was his first. All did such great jobs, so many great actors here...Kareem Abdul Jabar, James Hong, Ethel Merman, and even Jimmie Walker in a cameo, he actually played a year before in the fourth and final AIRPORT movie.The writing/directing team of The Zucker bros. and Jim Abrahams was a dandy one, and Elmer Bernsteins music is pretty good too, hes a great composer.I have always appreciated this film and had high respect for it, but it does have some boring parts to it, the Zuckers are often equally hit AND miss with their jokes and here is a good example of balance. The flashbacks were rather boring, although they lead to great parodies most time, but still left a lot to be desired.5/10 stars just because its a childhood favorite with some great actors and some great quotes and jokes.

Boy, I was going to have a good time I thought. Instead, I just sat there staring at the screen wondering how this movie could be considered one of the funniest comedies of all time. Once you figure out all the humor is based on the characters misunderstanding which part of a sentence the other person was referring to, the movie and the jokes become too predictable and obvious. Then there's the physical gags e.g. where a stewardess loans a guitar and proceeds to bang everyone's head as she moves through the aisle. And those eggs just continue to come from her mouth! Oh and black people have basketball in their genes, am I right guys? They just learn that thing when you give them a basketball. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with racist jokes but goddamn, they have to be funny! I don't know, maybe this movie was funnier during a more naive and innocent time, like when it came out. But I'm not a movie historian and I think the movie should work even now if it's that great (like 12 Angry Men, for example). These jokes are just so tired and lame. I was even a bit drunk while watching this and only had a few chuckles during the entire movie. It's not that I didn't understand the jokes or where they were going with them but I just didn't find them funny at all. It's just too silly and dumb. I even tried to watch a few funny scenes from my favorite comedies (Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, Death at a Funeral, Sex Drive, Office Space) to make sure that I just wasn't in a non-comedic mood. But I laughed my ass off at those movies just like I had before. I give this movie two points for the few chuckles I had.

On the contrary, I saw the point of every joke and why it was supposed to be funny, but I just didn't think it was humorous in the slightest.  All told, I have watched this movie three times all the way through thinking maybe I had missed something or it would just click one time, but it didn't.

That's preposterous. This may be a classic, and the original version of the entire Naked Gun and Hot Shots school of comedy movies, but this kind of humor is obvious, easy to create and utterly unclever. Sure, there are a couple of half-funny laughs in this movie, like, say, the white woman who speaks Jive, and some other stuff. But most of the so-called comedy is not only not very funny, but also understated in a kind of nervous way that further depletes this film of real humor. Intelligent people can't possibly put this movie up among the best comedies ever made. This is just dumb.I have to say that the actors pull it off very nicely, though. They play out their roles without giving anything away. That crew was one hell of a straight-faced bunch, and they deserve some kudos for that. Here, in most cases, we have actual acting, which makes this movie at least watchable, unlike its imitators.4 out of 10.

The slapstick humor seemed overly done and there were many dirty jokes that I felt did not belong in the story. Honestly, I was bored after about twenty minutes of watching this film and could not wait for it to end. Although there are a few truly amusing jokes, the story itself is boring. If anyone is looking for a better comedy watch What's Up Doc? with Barbara Streisand and Ryan O'Neal. There are no offensive jokes and the story is actually engaging. Or better yet, watch the Marx Brothers films, they are true slapstick without the filth that you get in this film. On the whole, this movie is forgettable, I doubt that I'll ever waste time watching it again.
