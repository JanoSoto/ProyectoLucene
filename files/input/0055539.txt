The soldiers' lawyer (Kirk Douglas) knows he must devastate the girl's seemingly innocent image to free his clients from the death sentence. It looks like this movie never really was produced to be a huge success at the box offices at all. It treats its story with honesty and no compromises. The acting is excellent. Douglas and Marshall give very impressive performances supported by a flawless German/ American cast. Christine Kaufmann is absolutely convincing as the victim which is raped a second, this time by the legal system. Reinhardt almost tends to a documentary style, something that probably doesn't appeal to all viewers. It's exciting, well written and very depressive. A perfect movie which leaves you speechless in the end.

The four, Frank Sutton, Richard Jaeckel, Robert Blake, and Mal Sondock, are in danger of capital punishment as prescribed by the American Code of Military Justice.As another reviewer pointed out this was taking place while Germany was still an occupied country. Allied occupation of Germany didn't officially end until 1955 when our High Commissioner to Germany, James B. Conant, became our first ambassador to the German Federal Republic. After that these four would have taken their chances in a German criminal court.The fact though that they were soldiers also meant that there was no chance for acquittal. What had to be determined was how guilty they were, even to the extent of the ultimate punishment.Kirk Douglas for the defense and E.G. Marshall for the prosecution make a good pair of adversaries. Marshall would very shortly see how the other half lived as after this film was done, he would star in the long running TV series, The Defenders.Kirk Douglas is a tiger in the courtroom as he ruthlessly puts Kaufman's own character on trial. It's his job, it's done down to the present day with victims of rape. But he's also a person with conscience, he knows exactly the character of the four men he's charged with the defense of, the character of each of them individually.Anyway there isn't a player alive who doesn't relish a good courtroom scene and Douglas made the most of his opportunity here. I don't believe Kirk got back in a courtroom until a made for TV remake of Inherit the Wind.Of the German cast and I note that several including Kaufman have had substantial careers in the German cinema, Barbara Rueting as the German reporter who narrates the film and Gerhard Lippert as Kaufman's boyfriend also stand out.Of course no discussion of Town Without Pity is complete without the title song which I remember so well blaring from the jukeboxes of 1961. This jazz/rock and roll song was very typical of what was happening in German and other foreign culture, an overwhelming Americanization of same. Gene Pitney sold a lot of records of Town Without Pity back in the day. If you've never seen the film you'll remember the song after seeing it once.And you'll also remember in terms of attitudes they really are the same. Those little minds will indeed tear you in two.It's what a Town Without Pity does.

Although sure of their guilt, the defending lawyer is also sure that they do not deserve the death penalty. He wants to plea bargain, but he'll dig up dirt and tear the girl apart on the witness stand if that's what it takes to save the men. No person or event in the story is as innocent as it seems at first - not the girl, the town, the judicial process, or even the simple brutality of the four men.The movie's weaknesses, unfortunately, are in the actual realization of this excellent story. The screenplay is very uneven, over-developing some of the complexities while short-changing others. The use of a voice-over is a clever way to avoid having to subtitle the German speaking scenes, but as implemented it is a clumsy shortcut to giving us information which should have been written into the action. Most unfortunate is the poor choice of music. It blatantly attempts to force its particular mood on the viewer in total discordance with the more subtle manner in which the story is presented. On the bright side, the acting is good and the main point of the story - the brutal treatment of the girl on the witness stand and by the town - is not diluted by any of these problems, making this a movie well worth watching.

It is far superior to better known films about rape such as The Accused. In this film, four American GI's stationed in Germany brutally gang rape a young girl named Karen.  The incident is eerily reminiscent of the gang rape by American service men that occurred in Okinawa a year or two ago.  Major Steve Garrett is assigned to defend the soldiers and he does an outstanding job of defending some  disgusting clients.  He gets lots of help from people in town who don't like Karen.  He tries desperately to plea bargain the case because he knows that his cross-examination of Karen will be brutal, but Karen's stuffy father won't hear of it.  He believes his daughter is a model of chastity and is out for vengeance.Garrett destroys Karen on cross examination and manages to avoid the death penalty for his clients.  The story ends tragically as the town casts Karen out as a harlot.  Thus the victim in a tragic rape case is victimized once again by the legal system.

A film about four soldiers stationed in Germany who gang rape a 16 year old girl and the trial that followed was pretty heavy stuff for audiences back then. I recently saw the film on Turner Classic Movies, and it still holds up very well.  It is still startling and powerful, even without nudity and foul language, which should show Hollywood it can be done.  You can be adult without being unnecessarily vulgar or obscene.  As it stands, I would still give this film an R rating today.And, of course, there is the memorable title song, sung by Gene Pitney, which accounted for the film's only (surprisingly) Oscar nomination.  Even that lost out to the syrupy Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany's.My one complaint about Turner's presentation was with the film's aspect ratio.  Instead of showing a widescreen version, they showed a full-frame version with the framing squeezed so that faces were somewhat elongated and cars appeared stubby and compacted.  This became very annoying. Even a pan & scan version would be better than this.Nonetheless, for sheer power, as well as excellent acting by Kirk Douglas, E.G.

The many tensions reach boiling point and explode. This Swiss-American co-production goes places Hollywood would never dare, it more resembles German movies like The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum.The theme song was a smash hit in 1961, and even got an Oscar nomination; the music was written by the legendary Dimitri Tiomkin, a classically trained composer.No, it isn't very pretty what a town without pity can do-oo.

I read an interview with Kirk Douglas once and he talked about all the controversy including him getting death threats from some of his fans. United Artists put a warning on the film and asked theater owners not to let anyone under 17 into the film. Several theater owners wouldn't even show the film due to its subject matter. I think all of this controversy hurt the film when it was released but I think it's about time film buffs and film historians go back and take a look at this film and include it with the greatest courtroom films out there. This film still manages to shock and be outrageous nearly forty-five years after being released.Four American soldiers (one played by Robert Blake) are stationed in a small German town where they rape a 16-year-old girl. It's obvious they are guilty and the town wants the death penalty, which the American government agrees to. A lawyer (Kirk Douglas) is called in and right from the start he hates his clients and agrees they are monsters yet he must do his job and defend them. To do this, he must at least get the death penalty dropped and the only way to do this is by putting the innocent girl on the stand and breaking her apart.I'm a huge fan of Kirk Douglas and in my opinion this very well could be the greatest performance I've seen from him. He goes through all sorts of emotions from pain to anger to humiliation and there's not one false step along the way. You could break everyone of his scenes down and it's clear there isn't a false move and this is the perfect example of an actor doing everything right. Robert Blake is very haunting in his role and E.G. Marshall is wonderful as the prosecuting attorney. Christine Kaufmann brilliantly plays the young girl. This movie sends the viewer through all sorts of emotions and doesn't hold back on any level. This is the type of film that kicks you in the gut but instead of letting you catch your breath it keeps on kicking you. The interesting thing is that the viewer agrees with Douglas and the director makes sure you hate the soldiers from start to finish. At the same time, we understand Douglas has a job to do and in some ways, we understand him attacking the young girl who did nothing wrong.The only problem with the film is some unwanted narration but after a while this didn't bother me too much. The music score by Dimitri Tiomkin perfectly captures the mood of the film and the title song by Gene Pitney is very haunting. If you look through review books this film gets rather low ratings so on that level I'd have to call this one of the greatest films I've ever seen that doesn't even get good reviews.

According to Frederic Taylor's Exorcising Hitler The Occupation and Denazification of Germany, the American military cared very little about punishing American soldiers who raped German women--in fact, about punishing American soldiers who raped women in any part of Europe after D- Day. Rapes committed in Britain were punished according to the book, but it was different in Germany. It was not the norm that the military authorities brought rapists to trial with the threat of the death penalty hanging over their heads. Most received a slap on the wrist, removal back to Britain, or nothing. There was not a single execution of an Allied soldier for rape in occupied Germany.And rape was common. Allied soldiers were not as brutal as Soviet soldiers, who were looking for revenge after the terrible atrocities committed by the Germans in the east, but attacking German women was far from unusual in the west. The Soviets had their special reasons beyond the usual macho attitude of take advantage because you can. (Not all men, of course, not all soldiers are like this, but there always seems to be a small percentage). The Soviets had much, much more to motivate them, the terrible deeds that German soldiers had subjected their country, their women, children and old people to. They were burning to wreak revenge, to rape, torture and humiliate German women. Allied soldiers had nothing on that scale to revenge, but some of them, too, looted and raped. Read Exorcising Hitler; it's an eye-opener.Town Without Pity leaves the impression that rape was rare and subject to severe punishment. Not true. Enough time has passed that we are probably ready to face some of the truth of what we did, as well as what the Germans and Soviets did. "},{"Title":"Don't try to prove your a man to me!

It's later in the movie that the distraught young man is humiliatingly slapped around by Karin's outraged father the town banker Karl Steinhof, Hans Nielsen, for allowing his daughter to be raped! As if the slim and very non-violent Frank had a chance to fight off Karin's four burly rapists which in fact he tried to do.You would expect that Karin would get all the sympathy from the townspeople in Neustadt for the unspeakable ordeal she went through! But instead she's held up to ridicule for, what almost everyone in town feels, allowing or even inviting her attackers to gang rape her!With the town's elders including Karin's father Herr Steinhof demanding the death penalty it's now up to the accused GI's US Army defender Maj. Steve Garrett, Kirk Douglas, to put Karin on the stand. It's there under Maj. Garrett's brutal and embarrassing cross-examination that Karin undergoes a far more, and in public, humiliation then she even suffered at the hands of her rapists.The film Town Without Pity is without a doubt the best movie ever to come out from a Hollywood studio about the ugly subject of rape and its even uglier consequences in how it not only effects its victim but those who know her. Karin is driven to almost insanity afraid to even leave her home in fear of being sat upon by her neighbors in calling her a whore or even worse.Just about disowned by her parents Karin and Frank, who stuck by her during the whole movie, decides to leave Neustadt and begin a new life but even that isn't in cards for the two young lovers. The very tragic ending is far too honest then you would expect in a Hollywood movie back then, in 1961, when feel good endings were a must in order not to disturb audiences who want escapism not realism in films. And it's that very tragic ending that make the film Town Without Pity the landmark movie that it is today.Powerhouse performance by Kirk Douglas as the reluctant Army defender Maj.

Pleading with Herr Steinhof to not let his daughter Karin to be forced to take the stand Maj. Barrett is then forced to bring out Karin's tendencies in exposing herself in public. This leads to Karin breaking down on the witness stand and having her attackers given long prison sentences not the death penalty that her father so much wanted.I for one could not believe that Karin's father was so naive about her flaunting her body to perfect strangers that he would let her go through the unbearable cross-examination that she was subjected to by Maj. Barrett. It was also sad on Herr Steinhof's, as well as Frank's widowed mother, part to also persecute Karin's boyfriend Frank who by far was more considerate and sympathetic toward his daughter and the horrible ordeal she was going through then anyone else, even Maj. Barrett, in the film. And it was his-Herr Steinhof's-actions that eventually lead to Karin's death at the end of the movie.***SPOILER ALERT*** Town Without Pity pulls no punches by packing a wallop in its story about rape and how it destroys not only physically but emotionally its victims. The film also shows the cold indifference towards the rape victim by, what later turns out in the movie, even her parents who treat her as an outcast because she, instead of dying, survives her terrible ordeal. Karin all alone, with only Frank standing by her side, had no other choice but to end it all which also ended her suffering. Karin in doing what she did also showed those, besides her rapists, who had so cold heartedly treated her and dove Karin to her death what unfeeling monsters they really are.P.S The film's haunting and right on target theme song Town Without Pity is preformed by the late Gene Pitney.

A key element in this story not mentioned by those reviewing it here is defeated Germany was then under U.S. military occupation and the strict rules of the U.S. Army were still in affect for the most part. To protect the conquered civilians rape committed by soldiers was punishable by the death sentence. (Dozens were hanged during World War 2.) The defense lawyer was determined to protect his clients from such punishment. In fact, he had warned the victim's family that back home he was highly successful and attempted to dissuade them from going forward with the trial. Not mentioned by him were the methods American lawyers employ to win such cases and he proceeded to do just that. Eventually the victim's father withdrew her from the case and the soldiers were allowed to walk knowing that they had gotten away with a crime without punishment. It would be helpful if there were more films made in which the occupying army executed rapists and since rape is the most difficult crime to prosecute there is the strong probability that many of those convicted may have been innocent.

Major Stephen Garrett, an Army lawyer, is assigned to defend them. Garrett holds out little hope of an acquittal- the men are too obviously guilty for that- but when his offer of a plea bargain is rejected by the prosecutor he conducts an aggressive defence in an effort to save their lives. The film's title refers to the attitude of the townspeople. One might have thought that in a situation like this they would take the girl's side and be without pity for the accused men, but in fact many of them are ready to believe the worst of the girl, Karin, largely because her father, the self-important local bank manager, is not a popular figure in the town. I watched the film when it was shown on television recently for two reasons. Firstly, because I have long been an admirer of its main star, Kirk Douglas. Secondly, because I am myself a lawyer by profession and was interested in the legal issues it raises. Indeed, it possibly raises more legal issues than can comfortably be dealt with in one film. Among these are-1. Is it right that American servicemen should enjoy the privilege of extraterritoriality, that is to say the right of being tried by an American military tribunal for crimes committed against local people, rather than having to face a normal German criminal court? The risk of such an arrangement is that local people will lack confidence in the integrity of the proceedings, believing that American soldiers will always believe the word of one of their own over that of a foreign civilian. (Contrary to what some have stated, West Germany was not occupied territory in 1960; German sovereignty was re-established in 1955, following which American forces were in the country as NATO allies rather than occupiers). 2. Conversely, is it right that a military court should have the power to pass harsher sentences than those which would be available to a civilian court trying the same crime? West Germany had abolished the death penalty, even for murder, prior to the time this film is set, 3. Should a lawyer be able to override the wishes of his client in the way Garrett does here? When one of the accused, Private Larkin, attempts to plead guilty, Garrett brusquely overrules him and insists that a not guilty plea be entered. Later, without his client's knowledge or permission, Garrett attempts to call medical evidence showing that Larkin is impotent, only for the tactic to backfire when Larkin indignantly denies his impotence to the court. (In any case, even if Larkin had not taken part in the rape himself, he could still be convicted as a secondary party if he had aided or encouraged the others to do so). 4. Most importantly, should a lawyer in a rape case be permitted to cross-examine a witness in the brutal way shown here? Garrett's strategy is to try to humiliate Karin and to destroy her reputation, not in order to vindicate his clients' innocence but to try and force her to withdraw from the trial, thus ensuring that the court cannot pass the death sentence. As we are to see, however, this strategy is also to backfire badly. This is not one of Douglas' greatest films, but he gives a competent enough performance as Garrett. He is not motivated by a belief in his clients' innocence or by any ideological opposition to the death penalty; Douglas rather plays him as a man who has been given a job to do and is determined to do it as well as he can, regardless of his own personal inclinations. (Personally, his sympathies seem to be more with Karin than with his clients). Another feature of the film is the title song, which became a hit for Gene Pitney and which serves as the main theme in Dimitri Tiomkin's jazz-style score. The main problem with the film is that it is essentially an issue move with too many issues. It is an issue move about rape, and about the way in which the court system deals with rape, but it is also an issue movie about the death penalty, and about military justice, and about American- German relations during the Cold War, but the attempt do deal with all these issues together rather middies the water and it never makes a really clear statement about any of them. 6/10 Some goofs. At the beginning of the film we are told that Karin's boyfriend Frank is 19, but near the end of the film, only a few weeks later, he talks about money given to him by his father for his 21st birthday. The design of the American flag in the courtroom (50 stars, in five rows of ten) is completely wrong. The current 50-star design was approved by Presidential proclamation in 1959 and formally adopted on 4th July 1960. Given that the novel on which this film was based was not published until 1960, which means that production of the film could not have started until after the new design was publicly known, I am at a loss to explain this error.

In the early '60s, the military was still respected. In Town Without Pity, however, three of the four GIs were depicted as brutes, the fourth (Robert Blake's character) outright insane. In addition, while television portrayed teenage girls along the lines of Gidget and our own movies used Annette Funicello as the prototypical teenager, this movie was pretty overt in discussions of teenage sexual activity (it's revealed that Karin, the plaintiff, was swimming nude and had gone away for a weekend with her boyfriend Karl, an act unknown to her father).Altogether, the issue of a rape trial was covered realistically - until recently, the past behavior of the plaintiff was used against her and the general attitude was that she was asking for it. Kirk Douglas' attempts to avoid such defamatory cross-examination is done with tact, but is thwarted by Karin's father, who is completely oblivious to his daughter's behavior. In the end, Karin's reputation is destroyed in the courtroom and is further held against her by the rest of the town. Her parents receive anonymous notes containing salacious material, and Karin is constantly mocked when she appears in public. After a guilty verdict is pronounced against the four GIs, Karin attempts to leave town with her boyfriend and start a new life, but is driven to suicide when Karl's mother has the police intervene, insisting that her son shouldn't be attached in any way to that sex-mad girl.The courtroom scenes are not peppery and flamboyant as would be expected in a legal drama and the behavior of Blake's character is inexplicable, but overall, the writing is excellent and the film is coherent and holds interest.

I lived in Germany (stationed with the US Air Force) in an area near where this film was shot. US Military in Germany were under a status of forces agreement, which is basically a treaty between two countries, to offer legal protection to military forces.In Germany, the military courts usually have dibs on crimes committed on German soil, by foreign military. The German government can waive jurisdiction, if it chooses to.In the film, the four defendants are basically scum-bags, who brutally rape a German girl. The rape is not in question. The film goes to some of the subtleties of US military law, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.What boggles my mind, is that when the crime took place, you could go to a house of prostitution, and get sex for DM40 (about 18 US dollars).During this time period, the court would put the victim on trial, and bring her past sex life up for scrutiny. Fortunately, victim shield laws have done away with this sordid practice.

Now, in Town Without Pity, he has a devil's advocate job defending American troops stationed in Germany who raped a local girl.Watching Douglas's character, I got the feeling that he was basically testing the townspeople. After seeing how angry they got upon finding out the the troops had raped the girl, they wanted the troops hanged. And then Douglas's character does everything possible to discredit the girl. Of course, we often see people blame rapes on the victim, so this should come as no surprise.But anyway, this is a really good movie. I've never heard of Gottfried Reinhardt, so I'll have to see if I can find any more of his movies. Also starring Christine Kauffmann, E.G. Marshall and Robert Blake. "},{"Title":"Discrepancy!","Date":"9 January 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" reviewer bkoganbing stated the following in an earlier review As another reviewer pointed out this was taking place while Germany was still an occupied country. Allied occupation of Germany didn't officially end until 1955 when our High Commissioner to Germany, James B. Conant, became our first ambassador to the German Federal Republic. After that these four would have taken their chances in a German criminal court. The narrator clearly states at the beginning of this picture that the occurrence happened in September of 1960, so I'm wondering why this case was, in fact, tried in a military court? Otherwise, this film, while eminently watchable, suffers from a tawdry, quick-reward based approach that keeps it from being the truly superior examination of social mores it campaigned to be.The problem is simple the incident (an alleged rape of a teen-aged German girl at the hands of four drunken American soldiers)and the trial that follows are peopled by stick-figured characters, with the exception of Major Garrett, played by Kirk Douglas in an Oscar-worthy performance.The actors are fine and the film flits by before interest can falter or common sense questions start to nag, but once the curtain goes down, you'll soon realize you've been had.Imagine this you're very hungry, starving, even. The only food available is your favorite brand of chips or candy and you gorge, feeling better with each bite until you're stuffed.Now fast-forward to an hour later; how much good did that stuffing actually do you? "},{"Title":"Courtroom drama lacks focus.","Date":"27 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" I don't know what the novel was like but it was probably tighter than the script for this movie. I'll have to lay out the plot, which is essentially this four American GIs stationed in Germany rape a teen aged German girl(Christine Kaufmann). They are charged and court martialed, defended by Kirk Douglas and prosecuted by E. G. Marshall. (How many times has E. G. Marshall played a lawyer? Sometimes I lull myself to sleep trying to remember them all.) The townspeople are bursting with animadversions aimed in one direction or another. The local whores hate Kaufmann for her superiority. Her father is a demanding local official who is all agitated because the family is involved in a scandal and he wants to see the four GIs get hanged. A gossip is happy to testify against Kaufmann. Her boyfriend, a student, loves her and wants to run away with her. A dirty old man who lives across the street from Kaufmann kind of likes her because she sometimes does morning exercises nude in front of her open window. Kirk Douglas interrogates her and he comes to like her too. She's so innocent, so young, so einbeisslich.Of course it is Douglas's job as defense counsel to attack her story if she gets on the stand. Douglas practically begs Kaufmann's father to talk her out of testifying but the old fellow is dead set on seeing GI blood. Once on the stand, she's torn apart by Douglas's questions. It's revealed that she took off her bikini -- a word that somehow emerges as some kind of infernal device -- and was nude when the soldiers raped her. Douglas shows the bathing suit to the jury, yanks on it, and it comes apart almost as easily as Kaufmann's poise. She winds up sobbing with her hands over her face and later offs herself. Despite Douglas's vicious defense, the boys don't get the death penalty Kaufmann's father wants, but they get beaucoup years in Leavenworth at hard labor.It's tragic. She loses her life. Her father loses his beloved daughter. The GI's lose their freedom. Douglas has lost the case and is ridden with guilt. But somehow it doesn't quite come together, at least for me. No individual scene flops, and there are no major errors, but neither does any character develop in any way. Nobody seems to learn any moral lesson. There's very little suspense in the trial because we don't have much doubt about how the participants will act.So what do you come away with? Well, small German towns can be as full of intrigue and empty-headed hatreds as small American towns. And those damned Yanks ought to go back home or pick on more available targets. As an old German proverb goes, Bad boys rape our young girls but Violet gives willingly. (I'm afraid only electronic technicians will get that piece of word play.) And, wow, is Christine Kaufmann a superior kind of seventeen-year-old girl. Her features are wistful and Florentine. Whew. Of course no decent guy would want to rape her but in real life it might be fun to squeeze and pinch her if she let him. Or the other way around.Overall, it's pretty depressing. The black-and-white photography is stark and edgy. The sound seems to crackle with hostility. Makeup is uninspired. All of the men have short hair, thoroughly moussed, causing them to look as if they'd been groomed to appear in a film. And while Douglas isn't bad, Christine Kaufmann gives a weak performance. And then there is that tin-pan-alley theme song, Town Without Pity, played repetitively with and without the sodden lyrics.But these are all personal judgments and, although I found the movie not very rewarding, others may find it more interesting.
