Humankind's greatest achievement?","Date":"9 December 2008","Score":"86 out of 92 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Did director Tobe Hooper, writers Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Return of the Living Dead) and Don Jakoby (Blue Thunder), in addition to some uncredited writers who presumably did rewrites of the original script, or any of the cast actually think they were making a good movie during the production of Lifeforce? The movie gets progressively wackier, more disturbingly bizarre, hilarious, over-the-top, and greater by the minute. When you think that the movie couldn't possibly become more demented, that it was already as nutty as anything could possibly be it outdoes itself. I really don't know if this was at any point supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, if anybody involved thought it was genuinely creepy or effective, or if they were just too distracted by Mathilda May's exquisite breasts and rear end to care, but the end result is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.Here are some reasons why Lifeforce is perhaps humankind's greatest achievement to date (and probably impossible to surpass) - Mathilda May is nude for the entirety of the film, and she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence you will ever see. Yes, that is a quote from the film. - Steve Railsback gives one of the most gloriously, hilariously over-the-top performances in the history of film.- It is, to quote a fellow IMDb member, 'the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet running amok in London end-of-the-world movie ever made'. Yes, that is actually the plot. - Frank Finlay, Peter Firth, and Patrick Stewart embarrass themselves.- Special effects and design that are actually good, adding to the suggestion that someone somewhere actually took this thing seriously, which is quite a disturbing thought.- Unbelievably stilted delivery of some of the finest dialogue known to man, examples of which includeShe looks perfect.

It is not an example of a film made by individuals with ambition far beyond their reach. No, it is quite simply THE most audacious, spectacular, hilarious, absurd, insane, riotous, crazy, deliriously demented science fiction film of all time. I cannot fully articulate why it is deserving of being one spot ahead of Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street on my list of favorite films, but I do know that it is. Lifeforce elevates craziness to an art form. Quite possibly the most entertaining film known to man, and perhaps our greatest achievement as a species.

Whether it's due to the nonstop nudity, the large amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema.The spaceshuttle Churchill has been sent to investigate Halley's Comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock.  A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), has been sent to search the area.  What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (Mathilda May).  They decide to take all three back with them, which results in a catastrophe.When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on.  When they dock with the Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dessicated beyond recognition.  The humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to London.After various tests, the scientists still don't know what these beings really are.  Then, late one night, a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held.  He touches her shoulder, and she awakens, stands up, and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner.  She approaches him, and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce, sucking him of all of his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy).She escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind.  Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought in to track her down.  Then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process.  The corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours, and takes the lifeforce of a doctor.  It seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim.  With the help of the Churchill's sole survivor, Carlsen, they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late.Lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment.  It has all the elements one could look for in such a movie, loads of nudity, blood/gore, and plenty of special effects.  This is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, Species, thanks in large part to a more riveting finale.The performances range from decent to terrible.  Faring the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who overacts to no end.  Much better are Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly, and the gorgeous Mathilda May (she's as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner).  May does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing, and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive.  There are times when she can be quite creepy, being simply seductive.  Most of the film manages to work because of her.

But Lifeforce really is a memorable ride.From the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist comes this massive apocalyptic science-fiction and horror epic. It's 2001 and Dawn of the Dead all rolled into one juicy little egg-roll of a movie, spiced with the beautiful naked body of Mathilda May (if she's smart she would start mathildamay.com and sell signed Lifeforce-pictures, and make a fortune of perverts like me). It's scripted by none other than Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Return of the Living Dead, Total Recall) and the cast is great. Frank Finlay looks like Peter Cushing's second cousin just escaped from a Hammer Horror movie, and it's always nice to see Michael Gothard (God rest his soul) who played creepy Emile Locque in For Your Eyes Only. Steve Railsback is good as always, and Peter Firth perfectly fits the part of the SAS-colonel who must save the day (he always reminds me of the 1980's 'Doctor Who' Colin Baker )The 25 million dollar budget looks like 50 million dollars, the f/x are first-rate but best of all a rousing score by Henry Mancini! His Lifeforce-theme should deservedly rank with the all-time great sci-fi-themes. It's almost hard to fathom that the composer of Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Pink Panther-movies, so known for his romantic music, should actually be able to produce such a bombastic score. It's like he kept it all in for 30 years and then suddenly decided to blow it all off on the soundtrack of this movie, and nobody needs to clean up after him - it's that brilliant!When history is to be counted, this is one of the movies the Cannon Group will be remembered for, together with Bloodsport, 52 Pick-Up, Hanoi Hilton and Missing in Action (come on, Chuck ruled as Braddock).

That honour belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet running amok in London end-of-the-world movie ever made. Tobe Hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. Plus it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to come out of France since Simone Simon, spending the entire movie naked. Which she does very, very well. Just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on Earth has ever encountered, she's also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous. It's a pitch meeting I'd have loved to have sat in on Astronauts from the British space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of Halley's Comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to Earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of London of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue (I've been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me. Assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter. Don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex.). Oh, and we'll get the writers of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here's $22m &#150; have fun. And they do, they do.True, there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the Go-Go boys at Cannon, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns instead to be more Plan 10 From Outer Space. It's full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it Frank Finlay's hilarious death scene (Here I go!), Peter Firth's grand entrance (I'm Colonel Caine. From the SAS? discreetly shouts Michael Gothard across a room full of reporters Gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering Mathilda May's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty Prime Minister sucking the life out of his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since Mrs Gorgo lost junior at Battersea Funfair and went on the rampage. And that's not mentioning the This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist! scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's It'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me line while a lead-stake wielding Peter Firth adopts his best Action Man voice to reply I'll do just that! In one scene alone you have a possessed Patrick Stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind, Steve I-never-got-over-playing-Charlie-Manson Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on Helta-Skelta! mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones look restrained) playing the Home Secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a Doctor Who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of John Hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. As if they needed any more in this film. It's just a shame that Frank Finlay's mad-haired scientist who isn't qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski) missed out on the action in that one.No matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist (He too needs feeding) exploding all over the Home secretary's suit, Patrick Stewart's blood and entrails forming a naked Mathilda May or the space vampires turning St Paul's Cathedral into the world's biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship. I loved every gloriously insane moment. In it's own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the UK rather than the heavily edited 101-minute US version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores Henry Mancini's score to its original glory (the US version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, Mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic Universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from Blake Edwards. Sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from Hooper's originally intended 128-minute cut from what's on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!

The film is, after all, ludicrously plotted, but that actually adds to the unique charms this movie has, which actually entertains for all the right reasons. Lifeforce is exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and always a lot of fun, thanks to the intriguing story, the first-rate special effects, the competent action sequences, and of course, the gorgeous Mathilda May wandering around in the buff.A joint British/American crew aboard the shuttle Churchill are studying Halley's Comet when they discover a giant contraption hidden within the coma's comet. Knowing this will be their only chance to board this enigma, they suit up and enter this contraption. Inside, they discover thousands of frozen, giant bat-like creatures, and just as interesting, three humanoids (one female, the other two male) encased in crystal-like containers. They decide to take the humanoids and one bat back to the ship with them.Thirty days go by and London has lost complete contact with the crew. So another shuttle is sent, and they discover the dessicated remains of the Churchill crew, but all three humanoids are still intact. Bringing them back to London for examination, the female one awakens, displaying the ability to drain the lifeforce out of a human being, and escapes out of the compound. Enter Steve Railsback and Peter Firth, who star, respectively, as the sole survivor of the Churchill and an agent out to stop this space vampiress from taking over the planet.If you've read the plot summary above and find this story interesting, then Lifeforce is most certainly the film for you. The first hour is probably the most engrossing, plot-wise. When you discover that whoever the vampiress kills will also rise to drain someone else's lifeforce, that's when the stakes grow much higher, as an epidemic becomes a possibility.The first half of the film resembles Species quite a bit, since you've got a team that's searching for a nubile alien that's on the loose (though, without a doubt, Ms. May is so much hotter than Natasha Henstridge). This same part of the plot adds another interesting aspect that makes the team's job more difficult; the vampiress has the ability to enter another person's body. Thus, they're no longer searching for a young, dark-haired beauty. She could be in anyone, which further raises the stakes.The engrossing story-telling sort of gives away to loads of special effects and action, but I found it a good transition. The effects are often terrific and the action is really quite exciting, surprising considering that director Tobe Hooper is usually incompetent at creating thrills and suspense. Judging from the all-out chaos that occurs in the last half-hour (burning buildings, thousands of zombie-like creatures stumbling around searching for nourishment), I'd say the film had a pretty big budget to work with (I've heard figures as high as 28M, which would be higher than Aliens' 18M a year later).Acting's probably what you would expect, with Peter Firth delivering a pretty good performance as Agent Caine. I like the guy's straightforward, calm attitude toward the situation and how he handles it. Steve Railsback as his partner who's being seduced by the vampiress in his dreams is much less impressive, sweating and overacting to amusing extents, but never coming across as very convincing. Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame is here, too, in a role that he's probably a bit embarrassed by these days.But the most impressive of the cast is none other than Mathilda May. Watching May stand around calmly as she seduces a victim is an interesting transition from titillation to all-out horror. She's actually frightening, and that's impressive for a nude woman. Speaking of nudity, most people must have noticed that's often the most mentioned aspect of the film. Indeed, Mathilda May is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. It's really perfect casting when you think about it. There's something exotic and alien about her looks (maybe the fact she's a foreigner helps) that adds a brilliant touch, and her perfect body helps, too, of course. Because of that exotic, alien look, I can't see any other drop-dead gorgeous actress who could pull this off quite as well (and this includes superhotties like Chasey Lain, Carmella DeCesare, and Tracy Ryan).Henry Mancini's score is a pretty enjoyable listen, though hardly as good as so many have claimed it to be. Even at 116 minutes, Lifeforce actually feels rushed. Some material could have explored a little further, but that's not too big a complaint. This is one wildly entertaining film I highly recommend.

Dan O'Bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979. Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.Rather than dismiss 'Lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer O'Bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'Queen of Blood'(1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'Alien' (1979).Granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.Neil Jordan's 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'Scream' franchise, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Final Destination'. But these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'Lifeforce' belong a canon of British sci-fi - even if this one was written by an American.In many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didn't examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade 'Solaris'...The goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.7/10 "},{"Title":"Mathilda May Makes My Day!","Date":"31 July 2002","Score":"43 out of 60 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I first saw Lifeforce back in 1985.

Somehow, despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same, it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.Loosely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires, this film from director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley's Comet.  Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet's coma.  And when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats.  Later on, the Churchill reaches Earth's orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission's home base, the Space Research Center in London.  Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill, but they find the entire ship gutted by fire--all except for the alien beings encased in glass who, far from being untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect.  The aliens are bought back to Earth...and that's where the incredible happens.These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and, instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds, suck their victims' lifeforce totally out of them.  One of them is the Space Girl, a thoroughly nude vampiress played by Mathilda May.  Railsback, the only actual survivor from Churchill, is bought in by the SRC's chief (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to track May, who is in telepathic contact with him.  Pretty soon, however, the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large.  Railsback finally catches up with May, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.Undoubtedly disjointed, unquestionably uneven, but nevertheless worth watching, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting, benefits from some drop-dead excellent special effects work by John Dykstra (STAR WARS), some of the best ever seen.  The other working element, and a surprise one it is, is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way John Williams' score for STAR WARS was--and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra, to boot!Largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre.  There had never been a film quite like it before, and there will certainly not be anything like it again.

Enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi. The only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. So that is a problem. The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship. I assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. What about all the humans killed? Do their qui forces (souls) go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? In other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars Force or even re-incarnation. This movie was over the top, kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and end were ethereal. It both began (what is happening to me) and ended as a love story. Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as being ludicrous, it all fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene. Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. Its a lover story,from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why I love it. Instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. It was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls twinkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life. Most people can't deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.

'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so I've read).The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.Thankfully the Commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls.Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off 'The Bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for here bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (Miss May&#133;.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they didn't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod.In short (yeah right 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5.   <div class=yn id=ynd_1774696>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_1774696_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_1774696_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div> <small>8 out of 10 people found the following review useful</small> <a href=/user/ur21742866/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NDEyMjYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3MDk0OQ@@._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>Boobs, Vampires, Zombies, Commandos, and CPTN PICARD</h2> <img width=102 height=12 alt=10/10 src=http//i.media-imdb.com/images/showtimes/100.gif> Author <a href=/user/ur21742866/>nathan-yeo</a> <small>from United States</small> <small>9 September 2009</small>  "},{"Title":"Boobs, Vampires, Zombies, Commandos, and CPTN PICARD","Date":"9 September 2009","Score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Gorgeous breasts and humans turned to pork rind dust!","Date":"19 November 2005","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Classics revisited...","Date":"15 November 2009","Score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"A great movie from my childhood","Date":"26 December 2009","Score":"11 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Scenes of Mathilda May naked are the only good parts of this movie.","Date":"27 August 2003","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Awesome, insane film","Date":"11 December 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""}{"Title":"A Cult SciFi Film - A Prophetic Movie Must See","Date":"19 January 2009","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" When I first seen the movie, I didn't like that nudity of Mathilda May that much but the story is very compelling. It's a blockbuster I believe, imagine a living dead, vampires, and the most prophetic of all is the concept of lifeforce, where a space vampires sucks it's energy from humans. And it controls human beings. Mind you all of this doesn't make much sense from fictional point of view, but from a real life, but I can't help but make the connection and parallels that after seeing this movie for the next 25 odd years and I constantly see links of this lifeforce far too many events such as Satanic Rituals, human sacrifice in Bohemian Grove, politicians (George Bush Sr.) secretly talking about Genocide of Katrina long before the events has happened and these events were predicted in documents by FEMA to occur of which two became true in 2001 (see wikipedia Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans), where two of the three events became true. The other is New York terrorist. It is this lifeforce and human sacrifice that makes the movie so compelling against the real events. The story was enough to get me glued throughout the movie and was one of the early movies that showed the living dead years before Living Dead, from 28 days later, 28 weeks later, and other me-too films exploded after 2000. This one movie is years ahead of its time. It makes vague references to Aliens influencing our Political leaders, long before David Icke and his Reptilian ideology became popular. It laid the groundwork for the future of Patrick Stewart (who in this movie was a psychiatrist)to become Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek and subsequent X Men series. He was more fun in this movie! The concepts of lifeforce and the idea of a space aliens eating or sucking this lifeforce is unique and it gave credence before Alex Collier or Peggy Kane made the scene about eating lifeforce and you may youtube these also. What can I say, this movie is a prophetic one that is the foundation for things to come in the next 30 odd years! If lifeforce does exist it gives credence as to why rituals were performed throughout history and cultures or is this lifeforce are a soul that can be trapped by space alien or eaten is why rituals exist. While it is indeed far-fetch, some people such as Peggy Kane, Electronic Voice Phenomenon(EVP), and reverse speech analysis believe them to be a possibility, or at least a point where a debate is brewing. Still true or not, it's prophetic that pre-dates David Icke, Alex Collier, Peggy Kane, the Living Dead series, one of the few movies to explore apocalyptic worlds before they became popular, and the concepts of lifeforce makes for an interesting movie. It's a must see movie.

This version was chopped up so much it was confusing and very disappointing. Of course, one does not know this until one views the DVD release. In the U.S. version, Hooper must have bowed to pressure that the movie was not scary enough so he had composer Henry Mancini change much of his music, go back to London, rerecord, and even then the producers or Hooper wasn't happy. Mancini said enough! and Hooper used other composers. Then he cut the film to pieces and moved bits around. Once I viewed the DVD, I realized the original release was a MESS. I much appreciated the campiness of the movie and do not see it as some sci-fi horror flick. Much of the acting is over the top (I think the leads were miscast - I like Railsback but why he was chosen as the obsessive and tormented character, I don't know and Firth was the campiest of all.) The story goes from a space sci-fi movie, to a vampire movie, then concludes as a zombie movie. Way too much but fascinating all the same. I don't think all movies have to be Golden Palm winners at Cannes and should sometimes be silly but really fun. I think the original intention was to craft a film that was more adventure than horror. But after production, they decided to go horror (for whatever reason, perhaps audience reaction to previews, which always mucks things up) and that actually made the film worse because of the last-minute amendments. I prefer the adventure version on DVD. My favorite aspect is, of course, Henry Mancini's score, which played in full, demonstrates the original intent of adventure. I also like that they restored the dialog and the original opening credits, which actually is still not complete. I remember the U.S. video and when I saw the DVD, I could not understand why they removed so much. The dumbest lines are the best! One of the grand things about DVDs, especially for us film buffs, is that they give us the opportunity to see the original vision -- as if we were denied this in the theaters. Unlike other reviewers, I would like to see even more footage added (I have a CD of all the music and listening to so many cues, it's evident that much was still cut, even on the DVD.) If I won the lottery, I'd restore everything myself... the original space sequence was supposed to be free of most dialog with the astronauts taking a look at the alien ship. Zombies don't have to be running around and bombs don't have to be going off to make a film interesting. Be patient, don't rush things.Another crappy thing about the U.S. video version is the horrid sound effects which I suppose were added to try to frighten the audience. The added miserable sound effects become quickly annoying, such as when the blood-lady forms in the helicopter and the dead bodies are screeching. Thankfully, this is toned down a lot in the DVD. When I watched the video a long time ago with some friends, their only comment was God, this movie is loud.So here's an idea. Put the completely restored version AND the U.S. released version on the DVD with commentary, behind the scenes stuff, etc. and that would satisfy all of us! Comparisons can be fun for us film buffs.

This is actually an unknown movie for there are only about 5000 people who votes on Lifeforce, so, i'm giving it a chance. The main reason i watched this movie is likely because my friend want to watch a sci-fi movie. Then i search all around in IMDb and found this one. Tobe Hooper have created good movies recently especially Texas chainsaw massacre, funhouse and some others..so i think i should try out Lifeforce.At first, the movie is full of suspense, not because of its special effect (which i think quiet cool for the 80's), but the acting, the music and how the story lines goes. Actually, it makes feel very confusing.. but i kept on watching till i found out what the hell is it all about. At the end, i still not fully understand the whole matter of Lifeforce, but it is already enough for me and my friend to conclude that this is a good movie. The only thing that i hate about this movie is the sex scene,huhu...overall, the plot line is interesting, the acting is not incredibly brilliant, but still there are good performances from the actors, surely not an Oscar material, but still a good one.I think that this movie deserves a second chance, find it and watch it. I'll rate this movie 10 out of 10..not because it was perfect, but just giving it a chance. Honestly, i don't think Lifeforce should be given rating of 5.8 out of 10. It should have been higher.

And talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history , it`s though it was written in chapters by several different people. Take for instance Carlson , he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered Brits and it`s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film . And there`s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to London in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they`re flying over it .I could go on at great length about these plot holes but LIFEFORCE is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don`t use your brain . It`s good to see a sci-fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn`t get their hands on them . The special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good , there`s lots of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl . When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with males it`s always a race to say  Seen the alien in LIFEFORCE?

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band its always guaranteed to raise a smile. I think the first time I saw it was on TV when I was very young, and with my parents. Although we only caught the last half hour of it, so the nude walkabouts and the middle section where they are roughing up the woman at the asylum had already passed us by (I don't think my parents would have allowed me to keep watching it if they hadn't), and so my parents were spared any awkward child to parent questions like whats an extreme masochist and what did that man mean when he called himself as a natural voyeur.Watching it again, I did pick up on there being an overlap in terms of content between it and Return of the Living Dead, what with both films featuring fast moving zombies and sharing a scene where a skeletal female corpse returns to life on an operating table. Obviously the direct link there is Dan O'Bannon having been the screenwriter of both movies, and Hooper having been pencilled in to direct Return of the Living Dead at one point. So I guess a couple of ideas they came up with for Return of the Living Dead also found their way into the Lifeforce script as well, especially in light of the fact that there is no zombie apocalypse in the 'Space Vampires' source novel. Ironically Lifeforce puts you in mind of so many films that came before it (Alien, Night of the Living Dead, Hammer's Quatermass films and variants like X- The Unknown) and yet one of the few significant horror films it isn't reminiscent of is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not for a second does Lifeforce feel like a film from the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, whereas you do get a TCM vibe from Hooper's Death Trap and to a lesser extent Salem's Lot. I find it interesting that the film's trailer and original advertising hypes it as being from the director of Poltergeist rather than TCM, and do suspect that had Lifeforce equalled the success of Poltergeist it would have led to a second stage in Tobe Hooper's career as a bankable director of big budget, special effects driven blockbusters, as would later happen with Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson. Whereas the box-office failure of the film and Hooper's retreat back to low-budget horror soon after, means that Lifeforce and especially Poltergeist now feel like career abnormalities, as Hooper is still strongly defined by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a way that Raimi and Jackson no longer are by The Evil Dead or Bad Taste. I think time is being kind of Hooper's career though, there seems to be allot more people fighting the corner for Lifeforce and TCM2 these days than back when those films first came out. It was once quite fashionable to knock Hooper, I remember there was an especially damning career overview published in 'Deep Red' magazine in the late 1980s that portrayed him as being a talent that had gone astray and sold out to Hollywood. There is a tendency to look more generously on his films these days though, if only because so many of his contemporaries have similarly suffered from career declines and fallen from grace with their fan-bases. Latter day Hooper films like Spontaneous Combustion and Crocodile might never measure up to his earlier work, but then again they're no worse than what Romero and Argento come up with these days.I was watching it recently mindful of there being growing rumours that a Lifeforce remake is in the works, and whether or not remaking the film is really justified. So I was a little surprised as to how much the special effects in the film hold up. Admittedly, the fake Patrick Stewart head and the burning model village doubling for London do cause you to wince, but the early scenes on-board the spaceship and Halley's Comet &#x96;which are the scenes I'd expected to date badly- wouldn't look out of place on the big screen these days. For a Cannon film there is also a real absence of period trappings, which you certainly can't say about the The Exterminator 2 or Ninja 3 The Domination with their aerobics and break dancing scenes. I do know that the original Space Vampires novel is set in the future, and while the film drops that angle, I suspect the fact that it is based on a futuristic source novel lends it a timeless feel. Of course the film does also manage to dodge the fashions of its day by virtue of the fact that the first twenty minutes or so features the majority of the cast in spacesuits and one cast member wearing nothing at all. I don't have a big downer on remakes though, and am curious as to what they'll come up with should this Lifeforce remake come to fruition, but to me there is nothing in the original that really cries out to be remade in order to bring it in line with the tastes of modern audiences. Whereas with say, An American Werewolf In London, you can imagine some Hollywood exec looking at that film nowadays and insisting it is in need of an update on account that there are aspects to it that aren't really relevant to the world of today, no one for instance goes to a cinema to watch porn anymore and the gag about there only being three television channels in Britain is meaningless today. I can't see a great deal in Lifeforce though that overly ties it to the 1980s, although it would have been hilarious if Golan-Globus has insisted that the zombies had to do a bit of break dancing at one point.

Almost. Actually, it's quite good fun. And terrible. Work that one out for yourself. It's one of those films that tries to be really great, as if it has aspirations that it's going to be the next 'Godfather' film, only to end up being more akin to 'Flash Gordon.' It kind of reminds me of 'Species' &#x96; a film about a beautiful naked alien woman running amok through a city and generally killing helpless (and horny) males. Species kind of knew it was a B-movie and played on its silly strengths. Like I say, Lifeforce thinks it's dark and mysterious and going to be the next 'Alien' movie, yet it never quite manages it.The dialogue is cheesy, the special effects not that special and its main selling point is the fact that the lead actress spends her time in a state of full undress. But it tries. And, in some way, that kind of makes up for its failings. You can't help but feel kindly towards the film because it really does its best to live up to what it wants to be. It doesn't really have the budget of Species; instead we have a British spaceship (the 'Churchill,' obviously!) encountering an alien craft which has got caught in the tail of Halley's comet. Once they board it, they unleash a trio of hungry alien vampires upon England. Now it's up to the only surviving American space pilot from the mission and an SAS colonel to hunt her down and stop her sleeping her way through the nation's men.It's the kind of film where you have to (a) know what you're getting and (b) be in the mood for. If you're expecting an epic sci-fi drama which is truly terrifying and/or you're hoping for action aplenty, then you're probably better off watch one or other of Alien or Species. However, if you're ready to overlook the slightly stilted acting (and the terrible puppet of Patrick Stewart's head) and gaping plot holes, then give it a go &#x96; you might be surprised.And, if all else fails, most guys won't mind spending a couple of hours watching Mathilda May and her ever decreasing wardrobe.

Indeed most of the advertising art for Lifeforce seems to be for a different film altogether and never appears on screen) but surely it deserved to be?What's great about it? EVERYTHING! Mathilda May is just the most beautiful woman ever, she's sexier than Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman and Eliza Dushku as the dominatrix and that's really saying something. On the whole the perversion in this mainstream film really has to be seen to be believed, Aubrey Morris as the Home Secretary seems to be constantly salivating over it all like the customer at a porno show and you feel that many in the audience will be feeling the same way. Amidst exploding zombie corpses and naked spacegirls constructed from her victim's blood the scene that really stands out to you is the heroes slapping the beautiful red-headed nurse around for information but saying that's OK because she's 'an extreme masochist' and is loving every second of it. Even in today's world of extreme gorno I don't think you'd get away with that any more in a mainstream film (interesting rewatching that scene and looking at the posters on the wall behind her, her as a little girl being hugged by her father and a sticker saying 'Head over heels in love'?). Some great performances from Peter Firth (Colonel Caine, SAS)and Frank Finlay (obstensibly a bio-chemist but his real interest is death), watching these characters dealing best they can with a situation totally beyond their control. A few great lines of dialogue and some wonderful set-pieces, absolutely love Caine heroically fighting his way through zombie infested London to Henry Mancini's amazing orchestral score to save the day and Carlsen's valiant act of self-sacrifice (again, the last thing you're expecting, you think he'll stab her but it's a shock when he impales himself too).Many questions that are never really answered. Are Carlsen and the spacegirl dead or are they preserved in the spaceship crystal coffins as before? What happened to all the human souls, did they go free, are they trapped on the ship or have they been used to revive the vampire race? Was Fallada genuinely trying to help Caine stop the vamps or was he leading him astray knowing that he was going to try to drain him? Where did he get the sword and how did he know how to use it?

And the story is rather complex, but here goes Crew from a space shuttle find a strange alien derelict in the tail of a comet somewhere in outer space. Once they board the ship, they find strange, bat-like creatures who seem to have been dead for thousands of years. They also find coffin-like crystals that contain three bodies of humanoids. The crew takes back the bodies to their ship. Weeks later, the shuttle reaches Earth. However, none of the crew survived at first glance. Something awful happened on that ship...I could go on, but it's just too much to type it all out here. Like I said, the story is very complex. The funny thing is that the movie starts out very eerie and tense. It's a giant mystery that slowly reveals itself until it bursts in a crazy finale.

As a zombie film I found LIFEFORCE to be immensely disappointing with very little of what I considered real zombie action. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of mayhem and chaos in the final reel, but the zombies run around fast and are in the gray area where they're almost more vampires than zombies. It's just too bizarre and sloppy if you go in expecting a Romero-style straight-forward action horror romp.Seeing the film as an adult, I can find a lot of new things to appreciate. For one, the cast is fantastic with Steve Railsback in full-on goofball mode only hinted at in his earlier starring roles in STUNT MAN and TURKEY SHOOT. Solid British performers Patrick Stewart, Peter Firth, Frank Finlay, and John Hallam all pop by in strong supporting roles, with relative unknown Firth pretty much replacing Railsback as hero slowly but surely as the film progresses. The special effects are excellent beyond their years and should be in bold font on John Dykstra's CV. Add to that it's got a lot of imagination and energy which you just don't see in too many scifi/horror movies... and there's just the right balance with gore and unpleasantness to keep it shocking yet not grating.LIFEFORCE is not necessarily a good film, but at least it stays entertaining. What it fails to do is really present a narrative in a way that feels like it makes proper sense. For one thing, the movie makes the odd decision about halfway through to send the two protagonists to an insane asylum where they inexplicably spend the next 20 minutes of movie. Suddenly out of nowhere we're plunged back into our main plot with London being overrun with zombies. It's like the movie just took a time-out to up the weirdness factor rather than sticking to its guns.Of the Cannon Group's many offerings this really sticks out like a sore thumb - a film of such ambition never to be attempted by them again.On a final note - LIFEFORCE is well worth watching if nothing else for the excellent use of late 70's / early 80's British Lightning Strike sound effects as heard in the pilot for Space 1999 and FLASH GORDON.

As it turned out, Cannon's $22 million investment was not money well spent, the firm subsequently releasing one low-budget bomb after another until on the verge of collapse by 1990.It is unfortunate that 'Lifeforce' had such limited success, because its themes are so far-out, its acting so over-the-top, its effects so well-done for 1985 that it could have gone down as a classic if more professionally handled on the editing floor. Nowadays, the 'Lifeforce' viewing public has cult status and breaks into two opposing groups those who find it a campy, shod attempt at major sci-fi and those who take it for what it probably is, an over-funded 'B' picture that is still endlessly entertaining.Even with their differences, both sides always remember one thing about this film Mathilda May as a lady alien, walking around buck naked for most of the time she is on-screen. But in truth, May is not on screen for very long and there is much more to this film than just eye candy. This is perhaps the last notable film directed by Tobe Hooper, who teamed with 'Star Wars' effects coordinator John Dykstra in making Lifeforce's expensive spectacle. It is one of the first films to employ laser light in movie visuals and even today, 'Lifeforce' has some impressive moments.'Lifeforce' opens with a joint US-British crew aboard the HMS Churchill, a satellite that is the first to employ simulated gravity. The Churchill staff is planning an intense look at Halley's Comet, which is passing Earth for the first time in decades. A foreign body 150 miles long is spotted in its coma, however, and Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback), commander of the mission, decides to inspect it.The crew members find remains of bat-like creatures and three intact, human-like aliens, two men and one woman, held motionless in crystal tombs. Carlsen and his staff take these quasi-humans onto the Churchill for later analysis. Soon afterward, the Space Research Center in London loses contact with the Churchill and it drifts into Earth's orbit off-course. NASA sends the space shuttle Columbia on an emergency flight to recover the satellite, which had caught fire, killing its crew and wiping out everything but the three entombed bodies.The female alien (Mathilda May) is readied for an autopsy, awakens, and busts (no pun intended) out of the SRC's labs. She has the ability to suck life out of humans, leaving her victims in a zombie-like state. This starts a chain reaction of lost energy amongst those in London, which is transported through Mathilda to the alien ship, reinvigorating her otherwise dead alien colony. Carlsen, who survived the Churchill fire, has meanwhile been recovered from an escape pod and joins with Colonel Caine (Peter Firth) of the Special Aerial Forces and Doctor Fallada (Frank Finlay) of the SRC, a vampire expert, to end the madness. Having fallen in love with the alien girl, Carlsen's mind is actually linked to hers, which allows him to communicate telepathically.What I find charming about 'Lifeforce' is that it is so overblown, yet never takes itself very seriously. Steve Railsback and Peter Firth ('Equus,' 'Mighty Joe Young') really ham up their parts, but it is reminiscent of those sci-fi movies from the 1950s and 60s, all of that laughable pomp. Considering that Tobe Hooper used such an approach in 'Invaders From Mars' one year later, I don't think it was unintentional. Also check out Patrick Stewart's short but weird appearance as Dr. Armstrong, an insane asylum director who becomes infected.Of course, we return to Mathilda May. The Paris-born actress, who was 20 when this film came out, doesn't speak very much but has an exotic look that fits her role perfectly. Points should also be given to her on courage. The original score was written for full orchestra and conducted by Henry Mancini, one of his last efforts before dying in 1994. John Dykstra's effects, after twenty years, look sharp as a tack, but there seems to be corner-cutting in the wardrobe department. There is one episode where a nurse (Nancy Paul) is shown walking through an open field in vampire-style vestment. On first sight, it looks as if she's wearing a trash bag. When Carlsen is driving through London in the movie's climax, he is gripped by a hand that is supposed to be losing skin but clearly sliding off a white rubber glove. It's a Cannon film, so we'll let it go.'Lifeforce' is available on DVD through MGM Home Entertainment in letterbox format only with three-language subtitles. Beware of the movie's differing versions Cannon Films panicked when 'Lifeforce' was in the editing phase, making substantial cuts, overdoing sound effects, and replacing Mancini's score with synthesized music. A version for American and Canadian release, with much of the nudity and zombie gore taken out, has been distributed on VHS tape and is sometimes aired on cable TV stateside. The DVD version, which includes a special booklet on the film's production, restores 15 minutes of footage not seen anywhere in cinemas and uses the Mancini score that was unceremoniously dropped. 'Lifeforce' could have been the greatest B movie of all time, but it's getting some respect twenty years too late.*** out of 4 "},{"Title":"mathilda may.

But that is part of the story. Even if you hate Zombies and stuff, but are a Sci-Fi fan, you must see this movie. Then again, maybe you must not, and would hate it. Many persons I recommended this movie to just plainly could not understand my intense empathy for this film.What it has definitely got is also a great approach on the man-woman conflict, women, sucking men's energy, and men, unable to resist them.

Behind both stories, is an intriguing premise. In both accounts, astronauts in outer space discover a massive derelict spaceship containing the perfectly preserved bodies of three humanoids, two males and one female. The humanoids later turn out to be alien vampires who possess the ability to drain the life energy - rather than blood - out of their victims, while also being able to possess them, as well. The creatures are mistakenly brought back to Earth, where they spread a plague of terror and destruction as they begin preying on the human populace. And in both instances, it is heavily suggested that these space vampires were the inspirations (or more explicitly in the film version) of many of the ancient vampire legends most of us know about today, or that these are the real vampires of ancient legend.The Space Vampires had a much more deliberate pace and focused on the scientific aspects of the story and the characters, rather than any action or horror elements - as was the case with Hooper's Lifeforce. The elements dealing with the space vampires seems more in league with vampire movies and zombie movies, rather than the book's deep meditations of energy vampirism, energy transference, and longevity - and how this has long paralleled human vampirism, criminality, and abnormal sexual fetishes. Lifeforce is admittedly an awkwardly paced film (which I think owes more to the script by Dan O'Bannon - of Alien infamy - and Don Jakoby, rather than Tobe Hooper) to sit through, but it plays up on some of the more intriguing concepts at the core of the story, namely the aforementioned suggestion that the creatures were the ancient predecessors to our ancient vampire legends, and the lead character Carlsen's (Steve Railsback) dangerous obsession with the beautiful female Space Girl (fearless, beautiful French actress Mathilda May). And the special effects by John Dykstra are actually quite amazing to look at.Both Lifeforce and The Space Vampires are deeply interesting works of science fiction/horror that are worth checking out. Both present works of a fascinating premise, but both works play up different aspects of the same premise. I'll admit that I feel I like Tobe Hooper's film version a bit more, but I won't forget the original book that inspired it.8/10 "},{"Title":"Very entertaining!","Date":"18 September 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I've been hearing about this film for years now and then one night finally broke down and bought it.

Not just a nip slip here and a bare bum there. We are talking full nudity during scenes of several minutes of length.

Her acting, although very reduced, is still superior to that of most of her colleagues. It should be mentioned that Patrick Stewart has an appearance, too (and will presumably never hear the end of it).The story is incoherent, to say the least, partly because of questionable editing choices due to time problems, partly because of the script itself. I haven't read the novel yet, but it was mentioned in other reviews that there are only some basic connections between book and script. Hilarious scenes are piled upon hilarious scenes, and the dialogues reach up to heights as Don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex. Even the special effects are good in a bad way. For example, the animatronics are awesomely made, but unlike in The Thing, they downright scream animatronic.Don't get me wrong now There are some interestingly new approaches to the vampire theme, the score is magnificent, and several scenes sport flawless surrealism.

It offers eye candy of more than one kind, slowly but surely making its way towards a spectacle of an ending.Based on Colin Wilsons' novel The Space Vampires, and scripted by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby, it comes up with its own explanation for how the vampire legend came to be. A joint American-British expedition flies into the coma of Halleys' Comet to discover a spaceship containing dead bat-like creatures and three seemingly human bodies. These bodies are taken back on board, and the female among them (French stunner Mathilda May) creates a path of destruction as she sucks the life out of various unfortunate victims, and a pattern is created as her victims claim victims of their own. An American colonel (Steve Railsback) and a British one (Peter Firth) race to find the female and try to save the world, while Railsback discovers that he has a connection to and obsession with the alluring alien.The fact that all of May's early scenes have her acting in the nude would certainly play no small part in the cult following that this film has obtained. However, that's just one enjoyable piece of the puzzle. This tale is all over the place, and in a good way. John Dykstra supplies the visual effects, Nick Maley the good and gruesome makeup. Henry Mancini gives this a wonderfully grandiose music score. Alan Hume does the impressive cinematography. The acting from the mostly British cast is a joy, right down the line. Railsback delivers an appropriately wild eyed performance, and Firth is an effectively stolid hero. Thespians such as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris, and John Hallam make up the sterling supporting cast.This was the first of a three picture deal that Hooper made with the Cannon Group, to be followed by Invaders from Mars and a belated sequel to his signature film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

Everything else is gloriously over the top, big-budget hokum of the most enjoyable kind. You might not actually like it when all's said and done, but you won't be bored. A special mention for Henry Mancini's score too. Fabulous. The music over the closing credits is simply outstanding.

What to me make's it a great movie is the fact that the storyline is original and it's also fascinating to see how the life cycle of the creature's work. The interaction between the space girl and the colonel is also fascinating to see developing. How he copes with the emotions he feels towards her and her reaction to him is intense. The only thing I wish they did was give more back story to the creature's existence and perhaps a more fitting ending. It always seems the vampire or creatures never get a good ending in my opinion, heh. I would of liked to see them get together and crush worlds under their feet lol. But then again I don't have many complaints. The special effects are still to this day very impressive and we're especially great for an 80's film. So for those who diss this movie, keep in mind movies these days have a horrible plot line and the effects aren't that hot. You actually had to work in those good ol' days to pull off an effect. I would still recommend this movie for anyone with an interest in this area to buy it.

Inside, the astronauts discover hundreds of dried up dead bat-like creatures and three humanoids encased in glass tubes. Commander Carlsen (Steve Railback) decides to take these discoveries back to the ship and return them to earth. You can guess where it goes from here. I watch this Tobe Hooper film every 5 years or so and it continues to impress me more and more. I mean, I loved it as a kid for its excess (Mathilda May!) but now I think it is a truly underrated, great film. It is a pulpy sci-fier that plays everything seriously and I can't thank Hooper enough for that. The acting is uniformly good, especially from Peter Firth as SAS agent Caine. He has to deliver some really cheesy lines (She has clothes.) but pulls it off. The script by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby wastes very little time and I like how the whole scenario unfolds with the leads actually being lead astray so the aliens can do their bidding. I will say that the end is kind of unsatisfying as the aliens just leave. I also think Hooper's handling of the chaos in London is quite influential nowadays (28 DAYS & WEEKS LATER) and he really put all of the film's $25 million dollar budget on screen. Finally, Henry Mancini delivers a fantastic score.

They discover inside the ship are dead alien species in the shape of large Vampire Bats. Then they find three aliens (Mathilda May, Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) in Cocoons cases, which they looked dead and they are human looking as well in suspending animation! Which the team are amazed of what they found. They bring the three Cocoons cases in their space shuttle. Then very slowly... trouble starts for the crew of Churchill.Months later... When the shuttle nearly in the earth atmosphere without a single ratio contact. NASA goes to the space shuttle finding the crew dead. Which the Churchill ship got caught on fire but these three Alien cases are still intact. NASA brings back the cases with them back to Earth in the UK. Which they are brought to a scientific government building in London, England. The true disaster starts, when the female alien (May) awakening from the building. She starts sucking the life of various people, she meets. Along with the two male aliens as well. While the UK Gouverment doesn't know why the aliens are doing this until an mysterious American astronaut Carlson (Steve Railsback). Who escape from the space shuttle and he has an strange connection with the female alien.Directed by Tobe Hooper (Invaders from Mars 1986, Poltergeist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) brings a stylish, sci-fi thriller, that is absolutely crazy and overpowering. Which this film is based on a novel by Colin Wilson. The original novel was titled The Space Vampires. Also that the now defecting Cannon Films nearly went with the original title. It was also their biggest budgeted film to date at $25 million. Probably the main problem with Lifeforce, it doesn't know what kind of picture, it wants to be. Which it's beings well as a adventure, then an alien-invasion thriller and a apocalyptic end of the world story! Which it's tries to have it three ways but that kind of mentally for this ambitious project doesn't always pay off. Well designed special effects by Oscar-WinnerJohn Dykstra (Spider-Man, Star Wars, Staurt Little) are one of the best things in this film.DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an fine digitally remasteredDolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which this version is the original European version that adds fifteen minutes of additional footage. DVD also has the original theatrical trailer and an collector's booklet. Probably the most memorable thing of Lifeforce is the talented people, who worked behind the camera than the movie. Like the special effects people, make-up effects crew, terrific music score by the four time Oscar-WinnerHerny Mancini (The Great Mouse Detective, The Pink Panther, Switch) and Alan Hume's excellent widescreen cinematography (A View to a Kill, Return of the Jedi, A Fish Called Wanda).Lifeforce is a very flawed movie but an fascinating one. The film beings well but once the second act kicks in, the unintentional laughs starts. The movie has an sense of humour but not always in the right moments. Railsback's performance is good but when he starts dreaming about the female alien and feeling what's she doing. It is just laugh-out silly, his dialogue doesn't help and director Hooper seems that he let his lead actor goes way over the top in several rather tense moments. Hooper's British cast are first-rate here, especially Peter Firth, Frank Finlay and Patrick Stewart. One of the reasons why Lifeforce is a cult classic is May's presence. Which she plays her alien femme fatale extremely well and her naked body is well... extraordinary to be sure.Before Lifeforce was release. The US Version got re-edited and it doesn't look as good as the European Version. The Zombie Vampires sequence is set-up earlier in the US Version and it had additional music cues of the late Michael Kamen (The Dead Zone, Event Horizon, Open Range) in the key moments of the US Theatrical Cut. The American Cut is actually shorter and it runs 101 minutes. While the European version runs 116 minutes. Tobe Hooper's original cut was 128 minutes and it will probably never see the light of day. The picture has some arresting visual effects moments and i love the final special effect shot of the movie.Lifeforce is a mess but it's aspiring entertaining film. For all it's flaws, this box-office failure is certainly worth a second chance. If Lifeforce got remade today, it would be the perfect opportunity to remake it as soon as possible. But this picture got mixed reviews, when it was first release in 1985 and probably Hooper was never satisfied with the final product. I am sure, he was happier with the European cut. Hooper's promising career was never the same after Lifeforce. Especially he made two more movies for Cannon Films Invaders from Mars remake and the wildly, outrageous black comedy/horror film The Texas Chainsaw Masscare Part 2. Although the TCM sequel was the more successful of the three movies for Cannon Films. Lifeforce is a wildly creative picture but it's just what audiences were not looking in 1985. Terry Gilliam's Brazil is probably the most Bizarre movies of the 1980's and Lifeforce is one of them for different reasons. Certainly worth a look.

They are brought back to Earth in London to be researched until they finally wake up, their seductive leader (Maitlda May) and two boyfriends start draining energy from people as they are space vampires who start turning people into zombies and vampires alike causing a plague in London. However American astronaut Carlson (Steve Railsback), a modern Van Helsing-esquire professor named Fallada (Frank Finlay) and Kaine (Peter Firth) must track down the vampires before the world is doom.A highly underrated Science Fiction horror thriller from Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and writer Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Total Recall and so much more including the famous Return of the Living Dead) is a refreshing and very different take on the vampire myth. Not quite as awesome as the book but in it's own standalone way it's very loose and not quite as enjoyable but still a fun movie. Patrick Stewart does co-star in this movie as a supporting character and Miss May does nearly steal the show nude including the special effects.But what makes this movie work is that it has an original concept as the three aliens in this movie are an ancient race of vampires who visited Earth before as they became the ancestors and origin to the vampires, zombies and succubus legends and myths possibly even Dracula. I also love that this movie doesn't portray vampires as the usual stereotypes of being the undead creatures as they have no fangs and don't drink blood but instead they suck out souls/lifeforces/energy/youth out of humans and crosses/silver/sunlight/garlic don't do squat to kill them. But these space vamps do however have Dracula-esquire themes such as sleeping in energy crystals like coffins, becoming bat-like beasts with fangs, becoming energy mist and can be killed two inches below the heart in the energy center with leaded iron.This stylish and erotic movie should teach people that not all vampires are the same creature when their has been other vampire movies to show people different vampires than the traditional kind when there is other vampires in world mythology and these vampires are similar to the Asian/Japanese psychic soul-sucking vampires of lore. The film's performances are a bit hammy and the special effects are very good but i also love how this movie shows a new twist to the vampire legend saying that what if vampires and zombies or succubuses aren't the supernatural but born from beyond the stars which is one of the brilliant concepts both the book and this movie has.If you want something different for a vampire and zombie movie then i recommend this gem even if your looking for a refreshing new take on the vampire myth.Also recommended Near Dark, Day of the Dead (1985), Armageddon, Transformers 1 & 2 plus 1986 animated, The Lost Boys, 28 Days Later, Nightmare City, The Hunger, Vampire Hunter D, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Wicked City (1987 animated), Heavy Metal, Dracula (1931 to 1979 and Bram Stoker's 1992), The Keep, Sleepwalkers, Twilight Saga, Planet of the Vampires, Not of This Earth (1957 and 1988), Fright Night 1 & 2, Vamp, Alien Saga, 2001 and 2010, Def By Temptation, 30 Days of Night, From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn of the Dead (2004), The Thing (1982), Children of The Night, Event Horizon, The Black Hole, Re-Animator, From Beyond, War of the Worlds (1953 and 2005), Barbarella, Flash Gordon, Van Helsing, Insemenoid, The Thing from Another World, The Blob (1958 and 1988), Akira, Jason X, Once Bitten, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (a.k.a.

Going outside in spacesuits Carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) & a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) all of whom they take aboard the Churchill. Thirty days later & back on Earth the Churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead. The rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to Earth where in a space research center in London they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust, things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout London...This English production was produced by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director Tobe Hooper up on a three film deal (which were this Lifeforce, the Invaders from Mars (1986) remake & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) a sequel to Hooper's own classic) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both Golan & Globus & Cannon was no more. Anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the box-office I have to say I think Lifeforce is a highly enjoyable, if rather silly sci-fi horror. When originally released into theatres back in '85 Lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV although apparently Hooper's original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere. I will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby & uncredited rewrites by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley was based on the 1976 novel 'The Space Vampires' by Colin Wilson & has many extraordinary ideas, it's scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one. It moves along like a rocket & at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle. There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce, the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female Vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic, the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart & many, many more besides. I don't know, call me weird but I just thought Lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way, from silly character's, odd dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals Lifeforce certainly isn't a film that will bore you.Director Hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has (double what he had for Poltergeist (1982) even) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen, John Dykstra the guy responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek The Motion Picture (1979) & more recently Spider-Man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous. The sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great, there's also some really good visual effects back on Earth including the destruction of London as 100's of blue souls fly around everywhere. There's some nudity but not much gore, there are some withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, the skin on someones hand peels off, blood spurts from someones eyes, nose & ears & there's a severed arm as well as some zombies. The special make-up effects are also generally very good. I wouldn't say Lifeforce is scary as such as it's more of a sci-fi film than horror, I loved the way Hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no 'solid' floor as it were.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run & hasn't set the world alight on video or DVD either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch. Shot on location in England. Well filmed in 2351 widescreen, the 43 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen, this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. The acting is OK in a very silly film, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski while Anthony Hopkins turned the role of Caine down.Lifeforce is a bizarre film, no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give Lifeforce a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects & it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means.

In a way its silly, but it's a lot of fun. My main issue is that there's a good 25 or 30 minutes (possibly more) in the middle of the film that kind of drag. It's a shame because the first act is really interesting, the third act of the film kinda goes all out, but a lot of the second act just kinda goes on. I think this film would have got a higher score from me with a more engaging 2nd act.As I said, this film can be pretty cheesy, and the acting is certainly part of that. A lot of the performances are hammy and odd, but it kinda gives the film a charm. There's also a performance by Mathilda May that is quite... revealing. (i.e. she is naked the whole time and is extremely attractive) This is certainly not a film for people who want to see Oscar winning performances, but they can still be quite enjoyable in their own way.Probably the best thing about this film is the visuals. There's a lot of great special effects that make the film pop. One scene in particular is a dream sequence that is really colorfully lit.

Then by accident I discovered it was Lifeforce and directed by none other then Tobe Hooper (to my shock).Lifeforce is a movie based on a novel by Colin Wilson, that got screenplay treatment by Dan O'Bannon, fresh from his success of Alien (and heavily underrated Dead & Buried). Directed by Tobe Hooper, maker of legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Lifeforce is a very different take then your usual Tobe, who often made low budget horror movies that usually had dirty and gritty tone (TCM, Eaten Alive), and some less glossy movies like The Funhouse, usually involving around serial killers at the time (excluding high budget supernatural Poltergeist)I found this movie interesting simply because of that. It's rather glossy, with wide range of special effects which fairly hold up even by today standards (some outdated of course, but still descent). Color pallet is switched to colorful instead of usual brownish\gray in other Tobe Hooper's movies (like two mentioned above).Story itself? While it's a silly, and even absurd at times, movie still has lot of fun and heart in it, because while Tobe might have silly script, he was still trying to make a proper horror film. Not lot of suspense, but it's likable that movie tries to generate some sense of upcoming doom for it's character and citizen of England. Some nice looking and nightmarish visual imagery, especially toward the end.Don't think too much about it, just let yourself and enjoy. It's a silly fun and entertaining movie. It's kinda like something that was suppose to be made in '50s but instead ended up being made in '80s. At first I thought it had to be remake of some '50s forgotten classic, but nope, it wasn't.Acting ranges from good to bad (funny bad), depending on actors, but who can say no to naked Mathilda May in every scene she's in? She's totally gorgeous... and naked!

Clearly nobody was in their right mind when this was greenlit or filmed and the results are gloriously loopy. Line readings usually range from wooden to unhinged, sometimes within seconds of each other - and dialogue is not so much terrible, as it is head scratchingly insane. Mathilda May spends most of the running time with an aversion to clothing and may never be topped as the best naked space vampire girl. The last act of London going up in flames is off the charts ridiculous and amazingly entertaining. If there's anything you can fault Lifeforce for, it's not for being predictable.

The lead alien is as beautiful as the movie is bad, I mean she's gorgeous. And the action doesn't let up for a second. Slam bang from start to finish.

Truly this is my favorite Sci Fi, films with actors I respect and love, plus one beautiful babe, with some nice bouncing goodies. The story is great too. Three perfectly preserved bodies, where hiding within their forms are vampires, kept in glass coffins, are found in outer space by some astronauts, headed by the great Railsback, where admittedly this was the first film I saw this great, serious, and conscientious actor in. Suddenly their naked forms come to life and they all escape. What they do, is draw energy from an unwitting being, where that infected being instantly becomes a skeletal form, and within many hours, he or she it explodes where they just becomes one big pile of crumbling dirt. In this case, with her whopping features, the babe (Mathilda May) becomes great eye candy, and certainly has an affect on Railsback, in many ways. Things get better when enter the great Firth as an Agent trying to get to the bottom of problem ends up working with Railsback, totally smitten of course by that babe on the loose, as remember we've get this plague, which you'll never guess where it spreads from London. As though may'be, you're expecting more action and gore, though one shocking moment in a helicopter will paralyze and mesmerize you, that's what I felt too with this film, but for me, it's the story and those two great leads, that somehow made up for it. I'm talking too, especially Firth, such a friggin' versatile and underestimated acting talent, deserved of much more respect and notice. The effects are great and there's some humor too, where hey, there are bits that get bogged down with the business instead of the action, but here's a different sort of sci fi, which I must say, stands unique, to all it's others, and does have some style. And too, like I said, you've got two great leads, with performances that will, definitely hold your attention. Director Tobe 'chainsaw' Hooper has definitely pulled off something special and different here, in this '85 outing.

But as far as I can tell, this is not a parody, this is just a bad movie notable only for having one pretty girl who never puts on any clothes.When Poltergeist came out, it seemed so Spielbergian that it was hard to believe it was directed by Tobe Hooper rather than producer Spielberg. According to wikipedia, there is controversy regarding how much Hooper had to do with Poltergeist.

The script is smart and the direction solid. The cast is fine, although Steve Railsback is a little wooden. Obviously the movie is most famous for Mathilda May walking around nude for almost the entire film. Which is a shame, as it's a quality sci-fi film. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't averting my eyes whenever Miss May was on screen anymore than the next guy. She's certainly gorgeous. But it's caused this movie's reputation to suffer and now it's mostly known as that sci-fi movie where the chick walks around naked the whole time.This was the first of three films that Tobe Hooper did for Cannon. He was a big get for them at the time and they gave him a huge budget for this film. Unfortunately all three of Hooper's Cannon films flopped at the box office and played a part in Cannon falling apart in the late '80s. It also meant the end of Hooper's career as an A-list director. He would never make anything great or even very good again.

Rediscovering it on Blu-ray disc a quarter of a century later is however like watching it for the first time. Not only does HD a lot more justice to a 70mm movie than a tape did, but also the Director's Cut runs a quarter of an hour longer than the old cinema version. Most cuts happened during the first third of the movie the opening scenes in space are shortened considerably, much taking place during the titles now, not after them, and also when the SAS agent begins to investigate what has happened on the spacecraft, the dialogs were cut by several minutes. These are obviously no censorship cuts (I mean, what do you think could have been cut for that reason if the zombies and the full frontal nudity remained?), but nevertheless I'm really opposed to the short version since I watched the longer version, because the extended scenes in space are impressive, and the investigation contains more mystery and suspense if it is not over too quickly. Mind you, the second half of the movie is a bit rushed even in the extended version, take the scene when they visit the Prime Minister for instance, blink and you missed it. No tea, thanks, got to go now...The ambition of the expensive production is admittedly hampered somewhat by the ludicrous story, but 'Lifeforce' deserves to be a cult movie for a simple reason Nobody can make a movie like that - nevertheless they did. 25 million dollar movies usually are well calculated factory products, carefully balanced and adjusted to the taste of a major audience with many test screenings. You can't do 'Bloodsucking Zombies Meet My Girlfriend From Mars' with a huge budget, any reasonable Hollywood producer would think you are insane. 'Lifeforce' just pulls it off, though.

Although it's far from his best film, Hooper clearly had big visions for Lifeforce and, with some confidant support from the film's producers, it looks visually impressive. Starting out as essentially an Alien (1979) rip-off (didn't they all around this era?), the film moves on to vampire movie, action movie, zombie movie and then disaster movie. It's an insane trip, but, if you can forgive its many, many flaws, this is actually a lot of fun.The crew of space shuttle Churchill locate an alien craft inside the corona of Halley's Comet, and inside they find hundreds of dead alien bodies, as well as three humanoids, suspended and frozen inside glass pods. On their return journey, all contact is lost with mission control. The rescue mission find the entire crew dead from a fire, but the humanoids intact. The aliens are taken back to a research centre in London, watched over by Dr. Fallada (Frank Finlay). While there, the female alien awakens and sucks the 'life force' out of a guard, turning him into a shrivelled zombie. She escapes, and S.A.S. operative Col. Caine (Peter Firth) and Col. Carlsen (Steve Railsback) - whose escape pod from Churchill is found in Texas - start trying to track down the mysterious alien vampire.If the movie has one trump card, it is in the form of Mathilda May, who plays the female vampire. She is a woman of such staggering beauty that you can understand Carlsen's relentless pursuit of her, and the storyline that she has placed a kind of a love spell on him seems that little bit less ridiculous. Special mention must also go to John Dykstra (winner of the Academy Award for Star Wars (1977)), whose special- effects are still impressive to this day. The problems are that the plot is too convoluted, the acting is awkward, and Tobe Hooper over-reaches himself. It seems like his vision was so big, that he forgot to make it small enough to fit into 116 minutes and make a coherent movie. Still, it's a million times better than most sci-fi B-pictures of its era, and if you let it simply wash over you, Lifeforce is a bonkers hoot.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Wild Science Fiction/Horror.","Date":"2 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A spaceship crew on a mission to investigate Halley's comet instead discover a spaceship with three people; one woman, two men, and loads of giant(but dead) bats.

(Today the British author Charles Stross comes to mind.) Lovecraft himself tried that precisely once. I recommend his novel At the Mountains of Madness for the same reason.You can't fault the producers for trying. Realizing that hybridization on the big screen with (then) state-of-the-art FX had to appeal. It may not have been tried before though certainly tried since. The producers spent a lot to get there, and you see every penny on-screen. The production credits are impeccable.Directing and acting through all this is another matter. Oddly, the mostly British cast and settings help prevent a total breakdown in believability when otherworldly creatures appear in the same shot and all must deal with the end of London as we knew it.Even the most banal if not outright goofy dialogue adds resonance when uttered by the likes of Frank Finlay, Peter Firth, Aubrey Morris and Patrick Stewart with utmost seriousness. There's a bit of The Bard in all of it, and the exit of Finlay's character is one for the books.If you expect Steve Railsback to portray a square-jawed stretch limo Space Shuttle commander you'll be disappointed, but if you expect him to portray someone driven to near-madness on just about every level by an alien vampire seductress you'll be at least kept curious as to what could possibly happen next...And I agree with many users who observe that without Mathilda May's sheer physical presence the drive to find, capture and better understand the Space Girl would fall roundly upon its tokhes.The musical score by Henry Mancini, himself no stranger to the horror-sci-fi mix, is just as driven, and if you think you've heard the main theme elsewhere you're probably correct.Finally, after all these years I viewed the longer international cut. I'd always thought the version I'd viewed on Stateside television a tad rushed even with relentless commercial interruptions, though also thought that reflected Tobe Hooper's drive to wrap things as coherently as allowed under budgetary and scheduling constraints.Now I'm not so sure of that. The longer version is somewhat more erotic, carnal and visceral but not appreciably more coherent. Still, that doesn't appear for want of trying.

An alien spacecraft is discovered in the midst of Halley's Comet by astronauts sent to investigate. Upon entering the ship, they find three humanoids which are in a type of sleep state. They bring the bodies aboard their vessel and discover too quickly that was a mistake. The aliens take over the Earthbound craft by killing everyone on board. Led by their seductively beautiful leader, they arrive on Earth and begin draining the life out of everyone they encounter.I would say that Lifeforce is probably Tobe Hooper's biggest film in regards to production and budget besides Poltergeist. The special effects quality for the time was top notch thanks to John Dykstra (Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica). To be honest, this is an impressive film altogether which was worked on by many great genre talents of the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond. Besides the strong presence of Hooper and Dykstra, it also included Dan O'Bannon's touch on the screenplay. O'Bannon is known for his writing work on Alien, The Return of the Living Dead, Heavy Metal, and Total Recall. We also can't ignore a pre-Jean-Luc Picard Patrick Stewart playing a doctor possessed to kiss another man by an alien force.Lifeforce is a successful blend of modern vampire, sci-fi disaster, and post-Night of the Living Dead zombie films. I know it sounds like a lot of different sub-genres to shove into one movie, but it works. The different elements are all so well mixed together and make sense thanks to a great script by O'Bannon and Don Jakoby.To say there's an abundance of full-frontal nudity in Lifeforce would be an understatement. Director Hooper and actress Mathilda May would like you to believe it isn't done with the intention of being erotic. They might not have intended it to be taken that way, but let's be honest. A woman and man naked kissing and pawing all over each other passionately in an embrace can only be taken one way.Lifeforce is an entertaining marriage of sci-fi and horror that will bring to mind Alien, The Return of the Living Dead, and other similar films of those decades. It's pacing might be a little slow at points for a modern audience, but it more than makes up for that with it's technically beautiful 2001 A Space Odyssey-influenced cinematography.

Take five to ten minutes off this one and it's golden, if it would've bothered to answer several rather important questions within that would've helped make this one more enjoyable, one of which is even voiced by a character in the film which is never a good sign. There's still a lot to like here with plenty of exciting, grandiose action scenes that really work well, including the vampires' initial escape from the facility, a dash across the English countryside to corral the creature and some high-scale scenes of city destruction in the finale that offers more of a science-fiction spectacle that horror-based thrills.

After viewing LIFEFORCE and the downright awful Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2, the idea that POLTERGEIST was Steven Spielberg's show has never been more present. LIFEFORCE is not a really bad movie but it wants to address many things and it never quites succeeds at any. It's the story of a space crew who finds a derelict spaceship with what looks like the remains of some alien life form and 3 human beings encased in what looks like clear plastic or glass. One of the 3 humans is a beautiful young girl, a real show stopper since she is practically naked through out the entire movie. The crew take back the 3 human beings but something terribly happens and everybody on board die, leaving the crew's captain as the sole survivor. It's here where the story falls apart; you never really now who is the lead character at first, you think it's the crew's captain. Then you think it's either Michael Gothard's character (THE DEVILS) or some guy named Fallada. Then, it's a colonel (Peter Firth). You don't have a strong character to root for, so whatever happens to them never matters to me. Also, the premise of a spaceship finding another spaceship with alien life forms sounds extremely familiar to ALIEN. It's a case of self-plagiarism since Dan O'Bannon (ALIEN) was responsible for this screenplay. The Effects and horror make up are sometimes hit or miss; LIFEFORCE does have a big budget gleam to it, but it wears off in the end. Also, before the movie's over, you get the impression you're watching a George Romero movie, with London becoming a hotbed for crazed Zombies. The highlight for me was Mathilda May as the extremely sensual Alien vampire. Her dialog parts are scarce, but it's her overwhelming beauty (and she's totally naked!!!) that was the main box office draw for this movie. I love Tobe Hooper and I'm really sorry his career did not take off to the big leagues after POLTERGEIST. He is a talented filmmaker and Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (the original 1974 movie) is in my top of the tops list.

He is a classically trained stage actor and shows up here bleeding out of his facial orifices. Just goes to show how much more Hollywood pays than the London stage.

I have read how other viewers were less than impressed by the acting. I can understand this. Railback was frequently over the top and Finlay seemed frequently laid back to the point of coma. Then again, Mathilda May, playing the female space vampire, was able to be very distracting, and all she had to do was walk around completely naked. Knowing about nudity and American TV, I was wondering how they were going to get around this situation without editing the death out of the movie. What did they do?.... when she was on the screen, wearing only a far-away look in her eyes, they showed her in extreme closeup, head and shoulders. The only problem I had with the movie, plot wise, was that it seemed to change plot lines in mid stream. It went from detective story to London vs. body snatchers. The special effects were quite good and I wish I knew what ever happened to the very, VERY lovely Ms. May. Maybe I've seen her and just didn't recognize her with her clothes on.

Lifeforce is a wild farrago which requires the viewer to be in a certain frame of mind if it is to be enjoyed. While most viewers would be quick to admit that the plot is imaginative, they might equally be quick to describe it as absurd, exploitative, ludicrous and wacky. Therefore you need to forgive the film's absurdity, exploitativeness, ludicrousness and wackiness before you can settle down and judge it on its merits. For some, this might be too big an ask. Others, though, might find much that is endearing about this oddball and refreshingly different sci-fi shocker.A joint British-American space venture is sent to find out more information about Halley's Comet. The spacecraft Churchill unexpectedly discovers an alien spaceship in the tail of the comet, and upon entering it they find loads of bat-like creatures that are either dead or in hibernation, plus three apparently human creatures in suspended animation within strange capsules. Soon after, Earth loses contact with the Churchill and later, after a rescue teams blasts off to investigate, it is discovered that the whole spacecraft has been destroyed by fire and inside its blackened hulk only the three encapsulated beings are to be found. The three creatures are taken to Earth and a research centre in London, where - true to horror movie tradition - they come to life and begin to kill everyone they come into contact with by sucking the life out of them. Not long after, an escape pod from the Churchill crash-lands on Earth and surviving astronaut Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) emerges from it with the truth behind what really happened back on the Churchill. It seems that the bat-like creatures are actually sophisticated alien beings which can take any shape they desire - including human form. Carlsen heads for London, now in the grip of a virulent disease that has been brought by the aliens, where he joins Dr. Bukovsky (Michael Gothard), Professor Fallada (Frank Finlay), and secret agent Colin Caine (Peter Firth) in their effort to track down and destroy the aliens.Lifeforce is wacky, as mentioned, and even a cursory glance at the plot summary confirms that. The special effects are pretty decent, though, and some of the gore is convincingly unpleasant for those who like that sort of thing. Henry Mancini provides a nice, pacy, exciting score which adds to the film's appeal. The performances are enthusiastic - indeed, everyone seems to approach their role with a level of seriousness that you might not expect from such a bizarre plot - with noteworthy contributions from Firth as the hero and Mathilda May as one of the creatures (she spends the entire film naked, too, if you're interested!!!) Lifeforce is a guilty pleasure if ever there was one, but if you MUST spend a hundred minutes watching the decimation of London and a gorgeous naked alien killing people, then there's probably no better starting point than here!

It feels very much as if there was genuine thought and intelligence behind the project, but that the superabundance of material overwhelmed the director a classic example of this is where Carlsen reveals to the unfortunately-named Doctor Fallada that he is in psychic contact with the vampire; Fallada responds with Then you may be able to lead us to her...if I were to hypnotise you, whereupon a cursory secondary character chimes in with He's tired - perhaps in the morning. Two seconds later, before the scene even fades out? It's morning, and hey, who'd have guessed it, there's Carlsen and Doctor Fallada with some kind of shiny oscillating mirror - You are feeling sleepy. I defy anybody not to laugh at that transition.Other unintentionally funny scenes do crop up - Steve Railsbeck's over-acting in some places lowers the tone beautifully, most notably in a scene with Patrick Stewart, where the camera juxtaposes the latter with Mathilda May and Railsbeck protesting hysterically Let me go! Let me go! before the inevitably comic kiss arrives. Frank Finlay is also quite terrible in much of this film, and hams it up with the best of them.Yet all this is besides the point - this is a tremendous film in places. The opening shots of the approach to Halley's Comet are terrific; Mathilda May is as beautiful as she is convincing and enigmatic; Railsbeck's awfulness is more than compensated for his brilliance in the scenes on board the Churchill; the dystopian shots of London in chaos as the terrible spreading form of the alien ship deploys above it...all amazing. This is a film it is all too easy to dismiss - it might have been better, true, but in places it is unsurpassably good.

WARNING!!!! -- This film review contains SPOILERS!!!! -- DANGER!!!! DANGER!!!! -- Contains SPOILERS!!!! -- ALERT!!!! ALERT!!!!Tobe Hooper's LIFEFORCE is so bad that it's good. I'll admit this right up front for me, LIFEFORCE is a guilty pleasure. The script is terrible, some of the acting performances are incredibly over-the-top, the derivative plot is so blatantly full of inconsistencies and illogic, and it is all capped by a overly bombastic Henry Mancini musical score. But this mess of a movie is forgiven by me because of the film's one true highlight Mathilda May! Mathilda May portrays the Space Girl and she is absolutely perfect for this role! Mathilda is one incredibly beautiful woman and her performance is easily the best in the film because it is the only one that is convincing. For in the context of this Vampires from Outer Space film, her beauty is not only extremely seductive, it is truly eerie as well. Mathilda had just turned 19 years old at the start of this film's production ( Feb. 1984 ), but at the same time she actually seems to be the alien beauty that is much, much older and is merely mimicking Colonel Carlsen's mental image of the ideal fantasy woman. Despite the fact that Mathilda is totally nude throughout most of the picture, her acting completely compensates and her Space Girl life-energy vampire comes across as both erotic and creepy at the same time. In my very humble opinion, Mathilda May's performance is the only one that totally succeeds here.It is a pity that almost all of the other actors are not up to the task of going above and beyond the shoddy script material they are given by the hack writing duo of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. But it is here where all of the film's problems lie the complete lack of a coherent screenplay. The script for LIFEFORCE is based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires. Wilson's book is rather dull as far as a direct adaptation to the silver screen would be concerned, but it is chock full of fascinating science-fiction and vampire type concepts. Even though Colin Wilson's novel is lackluster as far as action, it is intellectually stimulating with its ideas of an ancient alien race that nurtures other civilizations, only later to see them destroyed by a renegade faction of mutated vampire-like creatures from their own world. In the novel, not only are the human protagonists hunting down these alien vampires, so are the ancient out-worlders from which these life-energy criminals first spawned. Both the good and evil out-worlders have either influenced or interfered with human history with numerous visitations. The novel does, however, present an anti-Christian view of the Universe in Wilson's view, the Cosmos is a living intelligence itself and, in a gestalt-type philosophy, all of us are a part of this grand entity within our life-energy or spirit. Yeah, Colin..... whatever.But what do the screenwriters do with this fascinating novel? They dumb it down for mass audience consumption by presenting filmgoers with only the evil alien's encounter with Earth and then adding a gratuitous and derivative living dead - zombie corpses subplot. None of this walking dead idiocy can be found in Colin Wilson's novel. The only parts of the novel that surface in this screen adaptation are the initial discovery of the alien ship and the retrieval of a alien trio from crystalline sarcophagi, the initial episodes involving the vampiress at the Space Research Center, and the hypnotic trance sequence involving the discovery of Nurse Ellen and the subsequent scenes inside Dr. Armstrong's asylum. Everything else is warmed over SF and horror cliches strung end to end with a heaping helping of ridiculous dialogue. The only good thing I can say about the film's zombie subplot is that we get some wonderful animatronic and prosthetic work from Nick Maley. Nick and his crew dubbed these animatronic corpses as the walking shriveled and these things are kind of fun to watch. However, I fail to understand the hypnotic power one of these walking shriveled corpses has over that pathologist that gets sucked dry of his lifeforce. An exquisitely beautiful alien vampiress wielding hypnotic power over helpless men is one thing, but a dried up corpse having this ability makes no sense, especially when said corpse is just an earthling!Confusing matters even further, the script for LIFEFORCE plays fast and loose within its own diegesis. We are told that the shriveled victims reanimate after two hours and go in search of a lifeforce feeding of their own. However, none of the astronaut victims onboard the space shuttle Churchill adhere to this rule in a series of flashback sequences later in the film. Why? In a few quick lines of dialogue, we are told that Dr. Hans Fallada is a thanatologist, but where does his knowledge of life-energy vampire lore come from, especially that bit about killing them with leaded iron spikes? But one doesn't drive a leaded iron spike ( as opposed to the traditional wooden stake ) directly into the heart; oh no, Dr. Fallada explains that one must thrust the leaded iron spike through the energy center located two inches below the heart. Huh? What in the Sam Hill does this mean? When one of the male vampires is killed in this fashion, he reverts to his original form, but the other male alien doesn't and no explanation is given. We are told in one scene that a leaded iron spike is to be used, yet in a later scene a simple bullet suffices when this energy center is hit. Why doesn't this leaded iron nonsense work at the film's climax? That leaded iron sword kills the two male vampires, but it doesn't destroy the female alien. She gets back to her ship along with the vast amount of stolen lifeforce from various earthmen and then the giant alien ship appears to head back to Halley's comet. Huh? For what purpose? There are no other surviving vampire aliens onboard this spacecraft! Colin Wilson must have puked buckets when confronted with all of this LIFEFORCE film script nonsense that was grafted onto his original story.As I mentioned earlier, this film is a guilty pleasure of mine. That means I enjoy it for all the wrong reasons the film's story is a incoherent mess filled with ridiculous characters, but it is sure a lot of fun to watch. I sit there while viewing my DVD copy of LIFEFORCE and say to myself, Grown men made this wacky movie and they were absolutely dead serious about making a Sci-Fi thriller! Needless to say, Tobe Hooper and company failed miserably. What they actually made is a unintentionally funny Sci-Fi horror show. But all of the special effects work is classically cool to experience in our current CGI era and Mathilda May alone is worth the price of admission. Frank Finlay as Dr. Hans Fallada puts in a fine performance as well. Alas, Steve Railsback and Peter Firth appear to be out of their element and phone in totally overwrought and irritatingly smarmy performances, respectively. Aubrey Morris as Sir Percy Hestlestine is a real pain and a real hoot at the same time Morris seems to be gravitating towards Renfield-type lunacy in his portrayal of the Home Secretary, but only succeeds in coming across as a sniveling rat-faced git. Appropriately, he gets killed off while visiting a madhouse. The scenes involving Patrick Stewart as Dr. Armstrong have to be seen to be believed! It is a wonder how he kept a straight face while acting alongside Steve Railsback as Duane Barry ..... ummm, errr ..... I mean as Commander Carlsen.The MGM DVD edition of LIFEFORCE contains a fine quality print transfer of the European cut of the film ( at 116 min. ). It is most unfortunate that the original American release ( at 101 minutes ) isn't provided, because it is vastly superior in pacing, due to a few of the more ridiculous scenes being cut or shortened. The original release also has additional music cues by film composer Michael Kamen that are far more atmospheric than Mancini's. Perhaps a deluxe DVD release is in order here -- one containing both film versions and a host of extras ( please! ). But all in all, LIFEFORCE is a wonderfully awful movie and it is still morbidly fascinating to watch again and again in either release version. So just have some fun with it late at night with a group of friends and laugh out loud at this film's inanity. You'll be glad that you did!

In fact, I would even go as far as to say if they had made the entire film about the astronauts finding and exploring the alien vessel, then bringing the lifeforms onboard to study and examine, the concluding results would have been ten fold more effective and a hundred fold more intriguing.However, the film is actually about space vampires wreaking havoc on London. After the disappointingly brief opening space sequence, in which space vampires are brought back to Earth, the film centers on the efforts of British military and scientific intelligence trying to track and contain the vampires. The film reminded me of John Carpenter's masterpiece The Thing because the soul of the Vampires can transfer into different bodies and assume the identity of the host body, so there is an element of paranoia (though not nearly as effective as The Thing) about who exactly is who.The film's merits include the very attractive lead vampriess (Matilda May), who is effectively spooky (despite having has practically no lines) as she struts around nude sucking the life out of those who may attempt to stand in her way. Special effects are decent and interesting throughout. Patrick Stewart also turns in a gruesome performance. The movie's downfall comes from its poor pacing and incorrect focus. It should have been focusing more on the adventures of the space vampires and their connection to mythological vampires. This would be fresh and exciting. Instead the film focuses on the investigation of officials, which is drab and pretty standard. Also, the rules are annoyingly never made clear as to exactly how a vampire can possess someone, what happens to the vampire's body, and what happens to the victim exactly...seems they turn to dust sometimes and others times not... This film just didn't know what to do with itself or its premise.Not the worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen, but definitely nowhere near the best. The story could have been much, much better.

Now, I'm not saying that this is a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. I still enjoy watching it time and time again.  One thing that bothers me about viewing many sci-fi and horror films (especially at movie theatres) is that a lot of people tend to laugh throughout the movie.  This film is no exception.  Some scenes, in which there was supposed to be suspense and horror, people began laughing.  This is why I prefer to watch these type of films in the relaxing environment of my home.  No one to bother me.  I have two copies of this film of video.  The first copy is the original and the second is the Director's Cut.

It has so many strange and interesting ideas in it that you can't help but have fun while watching it. Tobe Hooper and Dan O'Bannon jammed this movie full of all kinds wild set-pieces, decent characters, amazing special effects, and nifty subplots, that sometimes the movie overpowers itself. There so much happening that sometimes it's a tad difficult to keep track of what the heck is going on! But that only happens once or twice. I think some of the plot points could have been slimmed down, most notably the scene at Thurstone Penitentiary, which I didn't like very much. There is also a lack of humor present, which only adds to the film's appeal. I don't want to laugh when I can see some poor guy getting the lifeforce sucked out of him! The actors are good. Steve Railsback overacts occasionally, but that's what he's good at! Peter Firth was my favorite character, acting like Van Helsing, hunting down all of these nasty, rotting soul suckers. He's got a serious, take-no-crap attitude and is pretty intimidating at the end when he kicks some undead butt. Frank Finlay as Dr. Fallada was great. His character is sensible with a hint of madness. He makes an excellent mad scientist-type person. Mathilda May is very attractive as the lead vampire, but she doesn't say much and lets her body do the talking. I was really surprised to find Patrick Stewart in here. His character is decent, but like I said, the whole subplot with him is unneeded. The one character I would have liked to seen more of was the second male vampire at the end, whose presence was very intense. Everyone else does a good job.The effects were absolutely astonishing. The design and look of the alien needleship was really cool. I loved the interiors with all of the dead winged aliens. The design of the vampire's coffins was neat. Hanging them upside down which was a nice touch. The draining of the vampire's victims was amazing. Done entirely with animatronic puppets and fantastic make-up, the results are extraordinary! Everything appears so life-like, especially the scene when they do the autopsy on the guard. Wow! The overuse of CGI today makes me crave stuff like this more and more.I have to note the ending. The entire city of London overrun by zombie-vampires and in complete and utter chaos was incredibly well done. I love anything apocalyptic and the fact that it was infested with zombies only made it cooler. It reminded me of the beginning of Day of the Dead, with the world completely deserted and in shambles. This was by far my favorite part of the film.The Bottom Line This is a very entertaining movie that is just meant to fun, exciting, and enjoyable. The effects really make the movie stand out. I recommend it to anyone who likes Romero's Dead films, anyone who likes vampire movies, and anyone who enjoys science fiction.

Well friends...that couldn't be farther from the truth. At two hours, Lifeforce is a chore to sit through. While all the key plot points delivered above do happen, some of them happen off screen and they're reported to us by some bored British character actors. There's a lot of drab office settings where haggard looking Brits and Steve Railsback sweat a lot and yell.

The perpetually naked May actually proves to be the film's one saving grace, at least providing some welcome eye candy amidst all the chaotic nonsense.Rather unsurprisingly, the film was nothing short of a box office disaster, but seems to have developed a bit of a cult following over the years due to its sheer ridiculousness.

It takes the idea of the space vampire girl from one movie, and the style from QUARTERMASS AND THE PIT, which is sort of a cult classic British style film.Two males emerge as the problem solvers, and fight the threat to Earth as sort of frenemies. One is the long arm of the law. The other is the sole survivor of a space voyage gone awry.The two actors do well, and they carry the film. Their characters aren't that interesting, but the director and actors do a lot to make you forget that.The style of the film is so much like the Pit film that once has to believe it was a tribute in some ways. The similarities are undeniable.So, one can't say it is an original style. It is a bit depressing throughout, and like the movies it is a remake of, based on hate and ill well.

Therein lies its problem; Hope Hooper has no shortage of ambitious ideas, but none of them are truly explored in depth. The film lurches from one plot point to another, never really focusing on anything. It seems as if director Tobe Hooper put his ideas in a blender and gave us whatever came out. The result is an overlong, ponderous mess. Although the opening scenes do generate an eerie atmosphere, Hooper doesn't really have a handle on his material, and after a while, he more or less sits back and lets the special effects take over. As a whole, it makes little sense, but I suppose the filmmakers deserve credit for having the nerve to carry out such an insane project.I wasn't particularly impressed with the cast. Steve Railsback gives his best as the tormented survivor, but he really overdoes it. Peter Firth is okay, but the part would have benefited from a much more charismatic performer. However, I liked Patrick Stewart as a psychologist who becomes possessed by the alien intelligence. Of course, my favorite, and everyone else's, is Mathilda May as the naked space babe. Almost all her scenes are spent in the nude, which is fine by me.There are individual moments and images that are worth looking at. The alien spacecraft is appropriately bizarre and nightmarish. Stewart's scenes are reasonably well-done. The special effects are competent; perhaps the best bit is the glob of blood that forms itself into a human face. Perhaps the outrageous plot could have worked had the main focus remained on the monster ship, which could have provided a mecca of discovery and sheer terror. Dan O'Bannon wrote the genre classic Alien. He would certainly know how to make such a film, therefore he has no excuse for not realizing the potential of the material. Surely he could have helped Hooper hone his concepts into a leaner, tighter film? It has been seventeen years since its initial release.

This film is truly underrated by most. The special effects are stupendous and the action unrelenting. There is honestly not a 2 minute period where you will be bored. Golan-Globus found their calling with this film, which was a departure from their usual action/war pictures. Considering all the crap movies that have been made that got sequels, I can't understand for the life of me why no sequels were done. The premise revolves around a weird race of space aliens that are found in a ship in the tail of Hailey's Comet. The aliens turn out to be vampires that can assume any form they choose. After inadvertently bringing them to Earth, they break loose to wreak havoc that could destroy the whole human race! If you don't see this movie, you will have really missed out. Steve Railsback's stoic performance as the captain of the space shuttle Churchill is great and Mathilda May has to be the sexiest space alien of all time. Not a movie for kids, as Mathilda is nude for most of the flick. What ever happened to her??? If you are a fan of sci-fi, this movie is a must-have. Don't bother renting it, just buy it. It can be found on DVD for only $10 at most stores. I am hesitant to give any film a 10 rating, which is similar to saying that is perfect, but I honestly can't think of anything they could have done to make this film any better. It's THAT good.

It's almost unutterably bizarre, with a naked Mathilda May wandering through the streets of London, Patrick Stewart talking in a girl's voice and then dissolving into a welter of blood, Frank Finlay doing his standard loony performance, Steve Railsbeck in full on shouty mode, Michael Gothard looking lost and Peter Firth wandering around in a nasty trenchcoat and being the world's least convincing SAS soldier ever. The plot, such as it is, concerns vampiric beings from space who drain the lifeforce of humans, but that's all lost in the mix of dodgy 80's visuals and a schlockily enjoyable Henry Mancini score (hard to believe it's the Pink Panther man). It's a typically incomprehensible sci-fi horror of the type that emerged in the wake of Alien, but as a British version of such things, it probably explains why we stuck to grim social films about housing estates in the years that followed.

The atmosphere is incredible, and we keep waiting for something real bad to happen, during the whole thing. Then the movie almost completely changes it´s style and becomes one of those old english sci-fi mysteries for a while, then suddenly hell breaks loose and it changes into a doomsday apocaliptic scenario where everything can happen.

It's a safe bet that Stewart has never been called a girl, in any other movie before or since.The movie that has it all science fiction, vampires, demons, zombies, and the best pair of breasts in quite a while, all rolled into one strange concoction. Starts off as sci-fi, but eventually becomes an end-of-the-world zombie-takeover apocalypse flick. The truly nerdy film fans (i.e. the ones who take movies far too seriously, the kind with large bellies, in their 20s and 30s, living with their parents, and with a copy of Das Kapital under their pillow) might debate for days on end whether people in LF were turned into zombies or vampires. I suppose if were to call them zombires (or vampombies) we could settle that quickly and get the nerds to focus on some other irrelevant detail in movie-land.The way Mathilda May escapes from the research facility is rather silly. Cameras are filming her, and yet the only one to notice that she is sucking the life out of the man who had just been examining her is a sleepy scientist. One would think that a bloody NAKED FEMALE ALIEN BROUGHT FROM A SPACE-SHUTTLE would be under observation 24/7, by a dozen people at any given time. Not to mention that nearly all the people involved in the project are heterosexual males (then again, this is London, so I may be wrong), so really there should never have been a single solitary second during which Mathilda wasn't under very very very careful scrutiny.Speaking of which, Mathilda May couldn't have been surpassed by a better choice for the role. What a body, what a face. It was key for LF to find a woman of such perfection (literally) so that we could identify with or at least understand Railsback's perspective, and believe the notion that the vampires constructed the perfect woman from his lust-filled sub-consciousness.What if Laura Dern had been picked to play the vampiress? Well, veni vidi vomit is all that I'd have said to that, had that been the case. Somehow I can't imagine that the alien vampires could have ever managed to get any of their master-invasion-plan going had they made their head-chicka look like Laura Dern or Jeniffer Aniston.As far as I am concerned LF should have been a watershed film, not just in the horror and sci-fi genres, but all the others as well. I have no idea why the notion of a perfectly built woman walking around naked through streets and buildings never caught on. I would like to see this in every movie, especially dull turds such as Pride & Prejudice.We aren't really told why exactly it is that the aliens had left Earth when they had been there beforehand, eons ago. Nor is the ending quite clear. Who's dead and who isn't? Did anyone leave London and join the vampire spaceship? But those are minor points, LF is a little mad, and fun.

It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. I'm glad Hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made for the U.S. version that make Lifeforce that much better and I wished the DVD had the U.S. version. The editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the U.S. version are even more boring on the DVD version because of added scenes.

We have space ships (which are the cheesiest ones I've ever seen in a film) vampires, walking dead, telepathy, graveyards, an insane asylum, explosions, car wrecks, the military, stupid looking aliens; all that he left out was werewolves, Frankenstein, The Creature From the Black Lagoon and the kitchen sink.

The movie starts in space on one of the most ridiculous looking ships I've ever seen in a film. The ship picks up three bodies from an alien planet and they are brought back to earth. Three guesses what's going to happen next. The bodies are space vampires who travel into people by riding on a blue light (another totally cheesy special effect) and turn them into prunes by sucking all the lifeforce from them. The main vampire is a chick who appears nude in most of the film. It seems she has the hots for Steve Railsback who was one of the astronauts. She wants to mate with him for some reason because of destiny or some such crap. The film suddenly jumps to Patrick Stewart in an insane asylum for no reason at all. He is an alien too but they manage to kill him. Don't ask me how the film got from space to the insane asylum. I don't have a clue.The film then inexplicably jumps again to the military because all of London is being invaded by vampires who look like rejects from Night Of the Living Dead. There are explosions and car wrecks for no reason at all because London is in chaos, like this film is. The ending shows a black alien spaceship that appears for no reason and disappears accompanied by swelling music. The End. The effects are cheesy, the main one being a blue stream of light accompanied by swelling music on a warbling soundtrack which is supposed to be the lifeforce as it travels into and out of bodies.

However; it's lots of fun to watch, which allows audience members such as myself to forgive the film for shortcomings in other areas. The film starts off with a very unconvincing space sequence, and from there we are propelled into a film that is as high on camp value, as it is on experimenting. The real story follows the 'space vampires' that come down with the spaceship, and we follow a couple of officials as they try to stop all of London being turned into zombies (pseudo-vampires turn people into zombies, you know). However, the female space vampire has a connection with one of the space men...Once we leave space, the film starts getting quite good. As director Tobe Hooper shows his audience just what the aliens are, we are treated to several interesting scenes; including one on an operating table that is genuinely unsettling. The special effects look dated; but I'd still rather see effects like than this than all that CGI rubbish. The way that the film isn't quite a zombie, vampire or alien film is put to good use; as there always seems to be enough in reserve to ensure that it never becomes boring; which is quite an achievement since the movie is at least a quarter too long. Tobe Hooper does a decent job of directing the film; but as usual, his direction is nothing to write home about. The post-production leaves a lot to be desired also, especially where the sound is concerned. Sometimes, the volume of the score gets so high that the dialogue is almost impossible to hear; which doesn't do the film any favours. Anyway, Lifeforce is guaranteed to annoy people that take their films seriously; but if you enjoy a good brainless romp; it doesn't get much more brainless than this.

In it, Haley's Comet is explored by astronauts and discover three naked human-looking aliens, all of them in good shape. The aliens are brought to Earth to study. Well, before you know it, the aliens come to life. And one of them (Mathilda May), a beautiful brunette with a big rack, escapes into the population sustains herself by sucking out the life energy from humans. And the human corpses must drain the life force out of other humans, similar to vampires, or they explode. Seriously. And before long, all of London is overrun by these zombies, this plague has spread to other cities, and the entire human race is in danger. The key is to get to the original alien, who is nude throughout the movie and doesn't speak or change her facial expression while the rest of the actors overact like they're on crack.

I identified elements of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Poltergeist, Dracula, Omen, and Alien in LifeForce.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it's cheesey.  The special effects are, on the whole, good.  But the plot quickly begins to fall apart after you realize it settles with a formulaic hollywood alien invasion route.

Where Hooper and company go wrong, I think, is with a completely wrong approach to the material.  While Wilson's novel was pulpy, Hooper treats it reverentially, like he's directing a Philip K. Dick story or remaking 2001.  What this material needed was a fast, loose, comic book touch with a spirit of fun.  What we get instead is an often plodding treatment with tin-ear dialogue and risible elements.  Come on now, it's got a beautiful naked space vampire, for goshsakes!  This is not serious science fiction cinema.This movie essentially killed Hooper's career forever, sending him to the low depths of Grade Z and direct-to-video trash.

These creatures turn out to be vampires that suck the life force out of humans and need to feed so often that they'll eat through the population in a week or two, tops.Mathilda May, the lead vampire, spends most of the film nude, and observing her melons and tufted bush from every angle is probably the movie's highlight. Once Space Girl gets loose and begins wreaking havoc on the British countryside the movie gets increasingly bizarre, as the storyline becomes more and more abstract. The movie plays in part as a parody of the British stiff upper lip, and some of the lines dare you not to laugh - This woman is a masochist, an EXTREME masochist! - I'm Col. Cane. From the SAS? - She was the most overwhelmingly feminine presence I've ever seen.- Don't worry, a naked woman will not get out of this complex.It's impossible to determine whether the filmmakers were going for laughable camp or were merely clueless, but the dialogue is never good enough to be taken seriously or funny enough to earn an intentional laugh.

The golden goose they shelled out $25m to produce? Thank god they did. If a b-grade studio like Cannon had to go bankrupt for our cheesy enjoyment, then so be it. On the other hand it might explain why the movie goes completely apesh#t after a relatively sensible first hour. They probably realized a movie about a foxy space vampire who is the most feminine presence the protagonist has ever met and who spends most of the movie buck naked and generally being as foxy and feminine as possible, stopping only to speak through Patrick Stewart's mouth and suck the 'lifeforce' out of her hapless victims, wasn't really going to be the new JAWS, so they decided to throw inside everything $22m could buy them and hope for the best.What does $22m buy you? A lot. And since this is the eighties we're talking about, it buys you a lot of coke and amphetamines for one thing. Did the catering service provide nothing but drugs and caffeine? I can't explain the acting otherwise. Steve Railsback for example spends all of his time on screen yelling like a psychotic *beep* at people. Hilarious, nonsensical, dialogue fills the cracks. This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist! should have won an award for something. Don't worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex is so good it should've won an Oscar for best screenplay all by itself.Hooper seems to be making four movies all in the same time. After the POLTERGEIST debacle and his ongoing drug problems (refer to the cantine above), the guy probably thought it was his last time directing a movie. So why not make a zombie flick, a space sci-fi horror flick, a paranoid psychological thriller and an apocalyptic action movie all in one? Can you imagine the amount of clunkers this pioneering technique would have saved us? Ulli Lommel's entire filmography condensed in 120 minutes would at last allow world powers to concentrate their efforts on finding a solution for third world poverty.LIFEFORCE starts out somewhere between clinical 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY interiors and sweeping space shots (also, giant wormlike passages into the space vampire spaceship that make the protagonist think he's been there before), scifi/NASA mumbo jumbo about a Nerva engine that saves you that zero-gravity soundstage you'd have to build and ALIEN-esquire let's explore that mysterious thing that is probably full of deadly space monsters escapades. Before the end credits roll however, London has turned into an apocalyptic battlefield, vampire zombies running amok all over the place while a space vampire adonis that looks like he missed his way to an after shave commercial is sucking blue lasers out of the people of London, funneling them into his umbrella-shaped spaceship orbiting around Earth. These blue lasers are the souls of people. When the vampire adonis is injured the blue lasers turn red. And I didn't even mention anything about the Prime Minister sucking the lifeforce out of his secretary. Or exploding zombie vampires.

The thing that stands out is that there are usually elements that are completely brilliant, marred by surrounding material that is just so silly and shoddily put-together that it brings down the whole.For me, the brilliant stuff in this film is all in the first 20 mintes. I found it scary! The alien ship design is brilliant, looking like some bizarre thistle, and the design inside the ship is wonderful, with all those organic-looking shapes and orifices, taking the organic-looking design from ALIEN in a different direction. I liked the whole camera-spinning in the first section, giving you an uneasy feeling, and I loved all the floating bat-aliens on the inside. I was expecting them to come to life and grab the astronauts, but alas, no. The direction and editing of the first scenes was also tense and tight.Alas, it's downhill from there, but as other reviewers have noted, it's still tremendous sclocky fun.

Director Tobe Hooper simply cannot overcome cheesy special effects and prosthetics, overdramatic music, a miscast lead and, worst, a misguided, choppy and talky script. With all these negatives, WHY do I consider Lifeforce to be an ESSENTIAL element in my fantasy/science fiction collection? Because Lifeforce tackles some abstract concepts of the vampire legend in scientifically plausible and, some would say, prophetic ways.WARNING SPOILERSIt is impossible to critique Lifeforce fairly without explaining the plot. This should be especially helpful to those who saw the at times incomprehensible US release version.As Halley's Comet approaches earth, the space shuttle Churchill flies an interception course. The commander of the international crew is a US colonel (Steve Railsback). When the Churchill comes within 9,000 miles of the comet, its radar detects a 150 mile long spaceship traveling within the comet. Railsback and several other crewmembers perform a spacewalk and enter the spaceship. Within the ship are the dessicated bodies of thousands of dead bats, which are at least twice the size of humans. Somehow, Railsback and his team trip some kind of silent alarm, because the spaceship deploys an enormous umbrella, while simultaneously opening a huge chamber. Railsback and his team enter the chamber and discover three perfectly preserved human-like bodies, two male and one female, inside transparent coffins. The males are handsome and the female is beautiful and all three are naked. (As is usually the case, the male's genitals are discretly covered, though not so with the female.) Immediately upon discovering the the coffin-clad bodies, one of the crewmembers experiences weakness. However, Railsback says he feels exhilarated (though Railsback thinks voiceover that somehow he is losing control of his mind. Railsback and his team return to the Churchill with the coffins and one of the dessicated bat bodies. Flash forward 30 days later, a radio-silent Churchill enters earth orbit. The shuttle Columbia is sent to investigate and finds the ship gutted by fire, the crew is bu shriveled, burned corpses. However, the three coffins containing the sleeping humanoids are intact inside the burned out cargo bay and the ship's escape pod is missing.The coffins and there contents are delivered to the Space Research Center (SRC) in London. Upon analysis, the scientists discovers the coffins are actually force field enclosures and the females coffin pops open. Since the female's body is available for autopsy, she is moved into a forensic lab. A guard watches the female's body while she awaits dissection. He is enchanted with her incredible beauty, and as he approaches the body, the female's eyes open. Stunned, the guard watches as the female alien rises confidently, seductively and tries to kiss him. Suddenly bolts of blue energy transfer between the female alien and the guard. The guard collapses, shriveled, lifeless. The female alien leaves the lab and, after nonfatally attacking a scientist and another guard, uses telekinetic energy to break free of the SRC and escape into the darkness. At this point, `Dr. Death' (A researcher specializing is the study of  death' and a colonel from the SAS (Think Navy SEALs) is called in to investigate; also the two male aliens are guarded by military equipped with automatic weapons and explosives. The two male aliens awaken and leave their coffins. They attack the military guards using telekinesis and are peppered with automatic weapons fire before being blown to pieces with explosives. As `Dr. Death' and the SAS colonel observe, an autopsy team prepares to dissect the shriveled body of the dead guard. Dr. Death tells the SAS colonel that the guard's lifeforce was literally sucked out of him.by the female alien. (Since people don't shrivel up, when they die, this seems a rather silly explanation; it does seem somehow that the body fluids are also taken.) Anyway, the shriveled up guard suddenly awakens, kills one of the scientists by taking his lifeforce and is rejuvenated. `Dr. Death' realizes the guard was attacked two hours before, so he and the colonel understand the threat as long as the female is at large. Think about it within two days, there would be 2 to the 24th or 16,777,216 of these monsters! Anyway, a nude, shriveled female is discovered in Hyde Park, a victim of the female alien. The shriveled female body is returned to the SRC laboratory and the guard and the shriveled scientist's body are placed in separate cells. Two hours after the guard's revival, he dies in agonizing spasms, his body is again reduced to a shriveled corpse, but this time it also crumbles into dust. The shrivelled scientist attempts to attack the colonel and the death scientist, and he, too is reduced to dust, as is the female corpse in the laboratory. About this time, the Churchill's escape pod containing Steve Railsback, lands in the US. The SAS Colonel (Peter Firth) orders Railsback delivered to England immediately. In what is almost laughable continuity, Railsback, previously disheveled and bearded, now clean shaven and in dress uniform, enters Firth's office just as Firth is seemingly getting off the phone from ordering him to England (!!!) Railsback may have been a classic Charles Manson (Helter Skelter), but he looks TERRIBLE in a dress uniform (reminds me of Mike Dukakis riding around in that tank during the 1988 presidential campaign). Anyway, Manson (err. Railsback) tells them about the Churchill fateful return to earth and the mysterious death of his crew. Railsback unsuccessfully attempted to destroy the Churchill and the space vampires along with it. Railsback has a erotic dream / nightmare of the female space vampire visiting him and making love to him, stealing his lifeforce in the process, and leaving part of her own. Railsback has a telepathic connection with the female vampire and learns she has hidden her body and has entered the body of a nurse at a hospital for the criminally insane. This is where the film REALLY loses focus, since the mind transfer is never shown and one must follow Railsback's voiceover. (Railsback, to be kind, is not the most inspiring of narrators). Railsback, Firth and the Minister of Defence visit the psychiatric hospital. Meanwhile, `Dr. Death' examines tissue from the dead male vampires as one of the military guards who destroyed the aliens looks on in a very suspicious manner. Also, the huge spaceship leaves Halley's Comet and establishes a geosynchronous orbit above London. Railsback and Firth interview the nurse and Railsback determines the female vampire has moved on to another body, that of the hospital director. Railsback seizes the director and communicates with the female vampire. He then tells Firth that they have failed; the two male vampires jumped bodies and took over those of the two guards. When Firth calls, `Dr. Death' tells Firth he has killed one of the male vampires with a leaded iron sword by jamming the sword into the energy center of the body about two inches below the heart. However, the other male vampire has spread the lifeforce epidemic throughout London and that millions may be infected. Railsback and Firth return to a burning London via helicopter, but are routed to the outer containment perimeter. There they learn that the male vampire is channeling the lifeforce of dead souls of London to the female vampire, who is then sending it to the collector umbrella on the spaceship. She contacts Railsback telepathically, compelling him to come to her to return the part of her lifeforce she shared with him. Railsback departs to find the female vampire while Firth returns to the SRC. There he learns that `Dr. Death' has become infected, and kills him, but not before he discovers that the female alien's body is in the great cathedral. Railsback and Firth make their separate paths across London through the dead and dieing, including zombies who have obtained enough life energy to be mobile but are decaying very rapidly. Railsback finds the female vampire, who reveals she wants to have sex with Railsback and create a new genesis for my species. She tells Railsback he is one of them.(Oh, REALLY? How so?) Railsback attempts to resist, but is seduced by her.  Firth reaches the entrance of the cathedral only to be blocked by the surviving male vampire. He throws the lead iron broadsword into the  male vampire's chest. The male vampire tranforms into a giant bat, then explodes. Firth grabs the  sword, then heads into the cathedral. Finding Railsback and the female vampire having sex, Firth calls to Railsback. Railsback reaches up for the sword and Firth tosses it to him. Railsback stabs the sword through both his and the female vampire's energy centers. Their soul bodies enter the energy stream to the spaceship collector and are sucked into the ship. Retracting the collector, the spaceship returns to Halley's comet.GOT IT?  Fine, explain it to me&#133;A FEW MODEST QUESTIONS &#133;1.  When Churchill crewmembers began to die off, why didn't SOMEBODY jettison the `evil cargo'. If I had been ship's JANITOR, I would have done so, even if it had meant jettisoning the ship's commander in the process.2.  Since the female was the only alien that sought a mate, WHY were the males such perfectly handsome specimens and from whose mind(s) did they come?3.  Since the aliens could `jump bodies,' WHY was the female aliens original body so important, since those of the male aliens weren't?4. When was `Dr. Death' infected, since he would have been lifeless for two hours?5. How did `Dr. Death' prevent himself from being attacked in the SRC after he revived?6. When the sword was removed from the 1st male alien, his body exploded into dust. When the sword struck the 2nd male alien, he transformed into a giant bat, then exploded.  However, when Railsback jammed the sword through himself and the female alien, their energy bodies remained intact and they migrated to the ship?  Besides, why was lifeforce STILL being channeled through the female AFTER the death of the male alien, since he was the earthly collector and she the transmitter?7. What happened to the souls that migrated aboard the spaceship, since all the aliens were supposed to be dead?THE PLUSES1. Matilda May, as the female alien, was the best vamp since Barbara Steele. May managed to be sexy, innocent, scary and vulnerable, and did this all while performing fully nude.   Even the most jaded adult film stars seem to have difficulty doing that, and May was only 19 or 20 at the time of filming.2. Frank Finlay, as Dr. Death, was charming and ambiguously heroic / wicked. Had the film focused on him and his character, it would have been a MUCH better movie.3. The art direction and sound were execellent.THE MINUSES1. John Dykstra's space effects were unconvincing, MUCH closer to his slipshod work in `Star Trek The Motion Picture' than `Star Wars, Episode 4'.   His use of scale was TERRIBLE.  The alien ship never appeared to be more than a few dozen times larger than the Churchill, rather than a few THOUSAND times.  The `spacewalk' looked like mediocre Disney animation from the 1950s `Men Into Space' segment of `Disneyland'.2.  Prostetics  Maybe shriveled bodies DO look like that, but the shriveled body of the guard and Patrick Stewart's head (the hospital director) were laughable.3. Steve Railsback was horribly miscast.  He carries NONE of the bearing and demeanor of a USAF colonel.4. The inplausible, inconsistent and sometimes unintelligible script.SUMMARY`Lifeforce' is worthwhile ONLY because it attempts to tackle the origins of four legends (vampires, zombies, demons and `evil' comets).  In these, it may even be prophetic.  There are those who believe much of what took place in `Lifeforce' might actually happen sometime within the next two decades. For THAT reason, `Lifeforce' is an essential part of my collection.

Also every time I listened to the wonderful Henry Mancini overblown musical score, I though about this movie as a great one and did so with nostalgic feelings. So I knew I already loved this movie but on my recent second viewing I actually realized how much I loved it. The movie wasn't that much different as I had remembered and now that I finally fully understood what the story was about, I totally loved the movie. This is definitely one of my favorite movies but please note that favorite as not the same as best.This movie is a rare case of a great movie without really being a great one. Of course Lifeforce is pulp. The acting is B-movie like, the movie is filled with implausibilities and continuity errors, and the character treatment isn't the best. But yet I love the movie for all of this. It make Lifeforce an extreme guilty pleasure to watch, that you never grow tired of watching. I'm not sure if the movie entirely was trying to be a serious one or merely an entertaining one. At moments I feel that the makers tried to create a realistic, haunting horror/science-fiction movie but at others it gets so ridicules that it's hard to imaging that they tried to make a fully serious movie. Either way, this movie remains an unique mix of horror and science-fiction elements that blend in extremely well, with as a result that this movie is an highly enjoyable and original one that deserves a better reputation.This movie begins as a thriller with horror elements, sort of like the Alien movies. The movie is tense and mysterious for most part during the first halve of the movie, which is mainly thanks to Tobe Hooper, who knows how to handle the genre. In the second halve all gloves are of. The movie goes berserk and total chaos erupts, when the space vampire/zombies have completely taken over London. The movie gets fast paced and doesn't stop being so, till the satisfactory ending. As the movie progresses less and less things start to make sense and often all logic is abandoned. What really what else did you expect from an '80's science-fiction flick. If you watch this movie expecting a tense well constructed thriller about an alien invasion you shouldn't even think about watching this movie.Still the build up of the movie is good. It makes all of the thriller and horror elements work out and provides the movie with some great and memorable moments. Especially the more horror themed elements of this movie are great. It shows that director Tobe Hooper can really handle this genre. It's a sort of a shame that he and his style has always been sort of stuck somewhere in the '70's. Also Lifeforce looks as if it was made in the early '70's. Also the way of storytelling and the character treatment (or the lack of it) is typically '70's like. That perhaps is also the reason why Hooper hasn't made any decent movie since this one and these days only works on B-horror movies nobody has ever heard of. He relies too much on elements, style and tricks from the '70's. A shame, since he has some impressive and well know genre movies after his name; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist.The movie as a whole might perhaps feel a bit campy, since its story is overdone and filled with some implausibilities, to put it mildly. Its style however is very good looking. For 1985 standards, this movie has some excellent and convincing looking special effects. Also the make-up effects are good for the vampire/zombies and the movie is filled with some gross looking stuff like you could expect from an horror movie. Also the movie has an overly present sense of eroticism. Vampire movies always have been sensual and filled with some subtle sense of eroticism. Lifeforce might perhaps not so subtle, since it features a main 'villain' who is a beautiful young girl (Mathilda May), who walks around naked in basically all of her sequences.The fact that the movie has a naked space vampire as a main villain adds to the cult value of this movie, as do some multiple sequences, which mainly features the Mathilda May character but also the 'kiss' sequence between the Steve Railsback and Patrick Stewart is one of those moments. The movie is filled with some silly and overdone sequences which add to the overall feeling and atmosphere of the movie, which in return all add to the cult value of the movie. Also certainly the overblown and brilliant musical score by Henry Mancini, which is in contrast with the rest of the movie, adds to this.It's probably due to my weird, unusual, wide taste of movie but I just love this movie and can't get enough of it, even though I admit that it's a far from brilliant one. But to me it's just a perfect movie, without being a real perfect one.

The results varied from the very good to the downright abysmal, and more often than not efforts were much closer to the latter. But with Tobe Hooper's pedigree including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist, expectations for Lifeforce would have been generally optimistic. However, hopes would soon have been dashed.The fairly standard plot takes elements from both the sci-fi and horror classic film staples - creature from outer space and vampires - to produce this latest entry into what would become the Sci-Fi channel's catalogue. A space shuttle investigates a ship that is discovered floating inside the core of Hailey's Comet, and discover 3 human-looking life forms in suspended animation, two male and one female - naked obviously! Ignoring every horror cliché in the book, the crew decide to bring them back to the ship. Inevitably, the ship returns to earth - but is now apparently abandoned - and the life forms are brought in for study. The female - played by Mathilda May - escapes and proceeds to wander around London -still naked of course - sucking the life force out of victims rather than blood (perhaps too cliché even for this work?) and chaos, death and zombies ensue. The story then plods along diligently, joining all the dots but seemingly devoid of any actual life force of its own.The cast is a veritable who's who of B- and C-list actors, with the interesting exception of a pre-Star Trek Patrick Stewart in an extended cameo, which perhaps makes this film valuable as a historical curiosity if nothing else. Unfortunately, with the vast number of sci-fi, horror and combination films that filled cinemas in the late 70s and into the 80s, something special would be needed to make a film such as this stand out, and Lifeforce doesn't have it, and it merely comes across as a cheap exploitation flick - which is ironic considering it was at one point shut down for running out of money, and was nearly named 'Space Vampires'! The cast in general seem devoid of inspiration, and stage and small-screen stalwarts such as Frank Finlay and Peter Firth appear to be merely there for the pay cheque.Next to films such as Star Wars and Alien, Lifeforce looks exactly what it was intended not to be - a cheap exploitation flick. The space scenes in particular (many of which were cut before release) look positively dated when placed next to the works of George Lucas and Ridley Scott, and Henry Mancini's score (which was partially re-edited and replaced with another composer's work upon US release) certainly doesn't measure up to his previous work, filled with toneless cues and un-atmospheric phrases that don't come close to his iconic work on films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Pink Panther.Wooden acting, lousy special effects, a dull story and atonal music combine to make this nothing more than just another sci-fi cash-in from the mid 1980s. Seeing a young French actress spend an entire film naked may be a novelty for a scene or two, but this crass exploitation gimmick is certainly not enough to save Lifeforce from, at best, mediocrity. Perhaps it could only be 'enjoyed' in the way films such as 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and films of that ilk are enjoyed today - with a large dose of irony.

(That's what IMDb says, I looked it up to find her name.) The rest of the flick is forgettable at best, formulaic at other times and generally woeful the rest.I had never heard of Lifeforce until someone one day compared it favourably with Event Horizon, one of my guilty pleasures made in the mid 90s.Having watched it I can say there should be no comparison as this is lousy.A joint mission is underway between the UK and US to study Halley's comet in space (need I say deep space, I think being in space is deep enough). During the mission the astronauts have no direct contact with Earth due to electrical currents, or static or something, who cares? They soon spot a ship in the tail of the comet and decide to investigate further, sending in a search team to check it out.Sound familiar yet? No. (So that's the Alien rip out of the way.)Anyway when near the ship they see 1000s of giant space bats, all dried and dessicated, and later on even more amazingly three human figures, naked and encased in glass pods. Cut to30 days laterA shuttle freewheels into the Earth's orbit, and even though it is intercepted before crashing all occupants are already dead. The black box is recovered for investigation. The passengers include our three naked space-buddies and no-one else, and it might save me a few paragraphs to cut to the chase and say they are&#x85; SPAAAAAACE VAMMMMMPIRRRRRES!!!Now the director intelligently decides to focus all attention on the hot brunette chickie space vampire, and my is she a fine specimen indeed - really the only reason to sit through this crap, even though there is a fair bit of Austin Powers' style rude bits concealment, (too much if you ask me).This is sorta like Species but without&#x85; well this is just like Species really, a series of scenes with a hot half naked alien chick and precious little else.The vampires manipulate through emotion, although the Space Girl's main power appears her hotness, and they literally suck the life out of those they come into contact with, they can also emit stuff through their palms to stun and freeze an enemy.Once bitten or drained by a vampire the infected becomes a lesser version after about 2 hours, and must feed on the living every 2 hours themselves, much like a bloodier version of diabetics.Army scienticians work out that unless they are stopped the world will be overrun with the infected, but apparently they are at a loss as to how to stop them.So here comes our hero, a shuttle escape pod conveniently drops in with the lone astronaut survivor Colonel Carlsen, who thanks to an earlier liaison can see what the space-chickie is doing. A complication arises in that the space chickie can inhabit different bodies that she comes into contact with. This presents two different problems 1. It makes it more difficult for the army to find her. 2. She is no longer the hot brunette naked chick for a lot of the movie.They ultimately track her/it down to an asylum where old Star Trek Captain Picard himself (Patrick Stewart) is running the show, where they discover something about the virus&#x85; You waiting for it?They can be killed through a metal stake 2 inches below the heart, and everyone infected can be released from the virus if the original space-chickie host is killed! (Hadn't anyone in 1985 even seen a vampire movie?)Even if this might sound like an OK basis on which to build a film it somehow isn't, the virus breaks out and infects London, and the director goes for the BIG ending and misses horribly.This movie really reminded me of Prince Of Darkness, a John Carpenter film which was all mood and style, but had no substance and ended up boring me to death - only not my preferred death by hot naked space vampire chickie.Final Rating &#x96; 4 / 10. 2 points for the one cool special effect that I can remember, two more for the film's real co-stars.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "},{"Title":"Dr Who Meets Plan 9 and startreck next generation....","Date":"12 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I was a bit curious after getting this film as to whether it was capable of being as good as the review made it sound.

I viewed the 116-minute Europeon version, which has all the nudity and gore intact but apparently Hooper has an even longer version that has never been released. The film has a group of astronauts going into space to get a closer look at Halley's Comet but they come across three bodies including a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) who they don't know is actually a space vampire. Back in London the woman ends up breaking free and terrorizing the city by using her sexuality to suck the life out of people and turning them into zombies. LIFEFORCE certainly splits fans of the genre because many will call it a masterpiece while others call it a vile piece of trash that deserved to crash and burn at the box office. I'm somewhere in the middle because the film is certainly a head-scratcher but then again we are talking about Cannon here. From what I've read, the studio and the director thought they were making a serious science fiction movie that they were hoping would become a hit. Did any of them actually read the screenplay? We're dealing with a film about a nude female vampire who uses her beautiful naked body to force men to fall all over her and then she sucks the life out of them. Then we go a step further by having the victims turn into zombies. I think what really hurts the film is that everyone involved took such a silly, B movie idea and decided to try and pretend it was A quality material. The level of seriousness throughout this film just slows the film down so much and I really can't help but think the movie would have been so much better had Hopper not taken everything so serious and instead worked with the good elements and delivered a fast, fun movie. May does a terrific job with the space vampire because, obviously, she's quite beautiful and seeing her walking around fully nude the entire movie certainly takes care of the sexual aspect of the film. The actress did a very good job at being very luring and I thought she delivered a fine performance. You even have other respectable actors such as Steve Railsback, Peter Firth and Patrick Stewart. You even have fun zombies that just add to the camp factor of the film and one of the greatest moments happens when one of the zombies runs towards a jail cell and just explodes into dust when he hits it. I thought the special effects were extremely good for this type of movie with the zombie design very effective and I'd say that the mutated bodies are some of the best you're going to see. Hooper actually makes a very good film to look at because on a technical level I'd probably say this is his best film. However, sadly it's all taken way too serious and goes on for way too long and in the end LIFEFORCE is an interesting failure but not a good film.

I think he's a wonderful actor who takes on any genre from sci-fi to comedy to Shakespeare and is able to work with it. I watched this largely because his name is in the credits. Unfortunately, Stewart's role is quite limited, and the rest of the time we're treated to a rather silly movie with bad dialogue and poor acting. The story is not bad. A team of British and American astronauts happen upon a spaceship in the tail of Halley's Comet and discover three apparently human beings in some kind of suspended animation. Those creatures are brought back to earth and disaster ensues.It sounds like pretty standard sci-fi stuff. The truth, though, is that it wasn't very well done. In addition to the above problems that I noted, the pacing of the movie seemed off to me; it didn't seem to flow very well. Now, I will give credit that Mathilda May (who played one of the humans discovered on the spaceship) is extremely beautiful and watching her parade around naked for much of the movie had a certain appealing quality to it! It didn't add to the overall quality of the movie mind you nor did it make me take this any more seriously (and it came across as - shall we say - somewhat exploitative?) but it's not an unpleasant adjunct to the viewing experience! These three humanoids apparently only survive by sucking the life force (thus the title of the movie) out of others. They're a bit like vampires (and one of the scientist characters speculates that earlier visits by these beings may be the source of our vampire legends.) Their victims appear dead at first but they return to life in a dried out, emaciated form exactly two hours later, looking for their own victims - thus giving this a kind of Night of the Living Dead feel at times.It all adds up to a disappointingly silly sci-fi adventure with very few redeeming qualities, aside from a beautiful naked girl.

Then I recollected that, although many of The Critics seem to have awarded the accolade for writing bizarre and incoherent scripts to Kaufman, there have been many others equally strange such as Boorman's 'Zardoz', Greenaway's 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover', or ...... ........ and I suddenly thought of Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce'. My recollections of this 1985 melodrama were principally of a totally incoherent script, a sound track loud enough to damage normal hearing and video sequences perversely designed to force viewer's to close their eyes if they wished to avoid a headache. The only thing I could remember about its story was that vampires originate in outer space (where it seems it is very difficult to get any clothes) and are BAD. Perhaps, I thought. these limited memories are unfair, or maybe my appreciation of unusual scripts has matured. So I decided to watch it again (on DVD with the volume turned down to a safe level!). The experiment was not a success. Its script seemed no more coherent - whilst a Kaufman's script challenges viewers to think, that of 'Lifeforce' seemed to dare them to do so. Deprived of any touch of logic, I wanted to reach for the on-off switch..Part of my problem is that I am used to employing the word 'Lifeforce' in the sense in which George Bernard Shaw used it in the prefaces to so many of his plays. GBS was an agnostic, but never an atheist, he was a firm believer in the gradual evolutionary improvement of the human species which could be attributed to a natural progression based on the cumulative experiences of mankind since our species first evolved. and which is manifested in the almost universal desire of parents for their offspring to have a 'better' life. He always described this guiding process, which is perhaps similar to the Eastern concept of Kama, as due to the lifeforce. This is a much more sophisticated meaning that that used in the film where it has been reduced to just the potential energy stored in every living body to sustain essential life processes such as breathing, blood circulation, and mental control of bodily functions when we are tired or asleep (SPOILER - In this film it also became a target to be acquired by the space vampires who have presumably run out of other energy supplies from their own planet. There could be a challenging theme here for a film looking at a coherent situation where external energy supplies gradually dwindle to almost nothing, but 'Lifeforce' was not interested in any of this - only in exploiting the maximum shock effect it could achieve within its running time.) Mostly it was inherently boring, often distasteful and sometimes downright unpleasant. All this could be forgiven for the right story but here any intended story line was contemptuously disregarded.A few sequences were visually imaginative and challenging, so I did consider awarding 'Lifeforce' 2 stars, but what the heck - If I go out and shoot a visually stimulating movie in the grounds where I live, this could not warrant 2 stars in the absence of any coherent film-script. I recognise that tastes differ and not all IMDb users will agree with me in my assessment, but if I am to try to provide some honest guidance to my readers, it has to be one star.
