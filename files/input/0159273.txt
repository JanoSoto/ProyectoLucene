[{"Title":"Absolute Garbage","Date":"16 January 2004","Score":"105 out of 153 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  Possible spoilers, if it's even possible to spoil a film like BEL. This is by far one of the worst war movies I have ever seen, especially in terms of realism. As a former Naval Flight Officer who was stationed on a carrier in the Adriatic in the early 90's, I can say with absolute certainty that this story, the dialogue and just about everything else was complete hogwash. It pains me to think that some hack writer actually got paid big bucks for this script, probably much more than I ever made in full year in the Navy. Anyway, I could obviously point out a million things wrong with this picture, but I'll limit to a few laughersFirst, I flew EA-6B's, not F-18's, but apparently nobody else did. Every EA-6B (and non-F-18) shown in the film was tied down to the flight deck. In fact, I don't recall any other jet being launched or recovered in this film from that carrier deck other than that 2-seat F-18. Back then, the Hornet squadrons on my boat (yes it's a boat not a ship. Only blackshoes called it a ship. Even had a 'shoe Senior Chief correct me (a lieutenant) in that regard once. Get real.) only had one seat, one pilot and no navigators/rios. Only Marines flew those D-models. At least they could have used an F-14.-Some Master Chief running around the boat chastizing an Admiral and telling him what to do/not do. Yeah, right.-The bad guys are shooting SAM's at our heroes who survive quite a while before getting bagged. Only after getting safely on the ground with their big, bright, colorful (!) parachute canopies, do they decide to interrupt the Admiral's meal to tell him a jet's been engaged. Oh, I better get up and see what's going on! That boat would be at General Quarters the minute the first missile was in the air. And missiles, which normally travel at many times the speed of a Hornet in burners, would either hit or miss, not follow you all around the sky. And a search & rescue mission would be in place IMMEDIATELY regardless of what some pseudo-Italian knucklehead who thinks he's in charge says.-Guys walking around the flight deck with no head/ear protection immediately before, during, and after flight ops? Uh, no. At not playing football either.-Flight crew (officers) eating meals on the enlisted men's mess decks rather than the dirty-shirt wardroom? I suppose it's technically possible, but are they out of their minds?-A Navigator/NFO threatening to leave the Navy to go fly for the airlines? Sorry, even if one had a civilian pilot's license (most do NOT) all those backseat hours in the Hornet count for squat in the eyes of the FAA. There are way too many military PILOTS that compete for commercial pilot jobs, that a navigator sure as heck wouldn't get one.-A downed pilot sitting there in an open field in enemy territory not even making an attempt to hide/evade. The other guy just leaving him there to find higher ground? Didn't you guys learn anything in SERE school? Also, a single fighter going feet dry in potentially hostile territory with no other escort, support aircraft, or SARCAP? Hah!you get the picture...

Suddenly he can dodge automatic fire from assaults rifles, 20mm cannons, and grenade launchers?  He runs in the daytime, stops to transmit in open territory, and suddenly knows the area better then they people who are chasing him?  His commanders are unwilling/unable to help him.  The end is the worst, he's running around in between crossfire of his rescuers and his pursuers without ever getting hit?  Grabs some disk of pictures that would have been transmitted automatically to base as soon as he took them anyway?  Then runs and jumps off a cliff to someone hanging from a helicopter rather than having the stupid helicopter land for 3 seconds to pick him up.

Now, if this had been a spoof of American War movies, it would've been great. Only problem is that it isn't a spoof; it's dead serious. The huge number of goofs and mistakes aside, this movie offers little in the ways of storyline and character development. You really couldn't care less if Wilson's character lives or dies, and Hackman doesn't really get anything done until the end of the movie (which is ridiculous to say the least!).Now, the thing that really breaks this movie, is the aforementioned goofs and mistakes. As I mentioned, if this movie had been a parody on American war/action movies I would've loved it, because all of the goofs actually make you think that it IS a parody! But considering the fact that it's a glorified, super-patriotic, default American war hero running around facing all kinds of problems, it all seems like a moral boost for the newly attacked America (my sympathies for all who were affected by 9/11 by the way...) The hero is a handsome, blond, all-American guy (they could've added that he was a star quarterback and we'd have the complete package) who faces irredeemably evil Serbs/Bosnians/Whatevers (we never really get to know...) and has to face the hazards of traversing unknown territories. It all seems the typical Hollywood action/war...HOWEVER... *SPOILERS!!!!!*The fact that the entire navy administration doesn't send in a rescue team until the very end is a bit silly. Also, scenes like the minefield where Wilson's character is chased by two soldiers and runs straight through the trip-mines (where he is unhurt by the explosions, one of the soldiers step on a mine that kills both him AND his buddy standing 10 feet away!), And the ending in which he's shot at by a HUGE amount of soldiers (including tanks...) and manages to get out unhurt (note also that three half-as*ed choppers take out a lot of that army without getting shot down...). And let's not forget when he runs up a hill while being shot at, and the bullets keep on following him while he's running down the other side!*SPOILERS!!!!!*So, all in all, as a war movie it's horrible Hollywood junk that falls flat on bad acting, terrible script and major goofs! As a parody on action/war movies though, this could go far! If they'd only put those weaknesses to good use...Many will try to save the movie by claiming that It's not supposed to be realistic!. I, however, feel that war is bad enough to be taken seriously, and not turned into a stupid glorification like this, where one man can beat an entire army (and considering how incompetent the Serbs/Bosnians/Whatevers are portrayed as in this movie, I'm surprised that no one took offense!). Just like Titanic, it undermines the very issue at hand, and deserves to be forgotten for that.1/10 "},{"Title":"Incomprehensibly bad","Date":"2 July 2003","Score":"48 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  I'm sure there have been worse movies made.

I can't believe that Gene Hackman participated in this garbage.  Is fame and stardom a bore for him?  Does he yearn for oblivion? It seems that he's deliberately trying to end his career.  Well anyway, this movie is about a NAVY pilot Chris Burnell (Owen Wilson) who is shot down over Bosnia and must get to the border to be rescued.  <SPOILER> As soon as he parachutes to the ground he witnesses how his navigator is executed by a chain-smoking, Adidas-clad, unshaven Serb soldier of fortune.  Not waiting any longer Burnett activates the GOD MODE cheat code and takes off running uphill while being shot at by assault rifles and large caliber machine guns, and as you might have guessed he escapes, for now.  In fact the cheat code stays on for the rest of the film and is also used by Admiral Reigard (Gene Hackman) in the helicopter rescue scene at the end where the Serb platoon consisting of over 50 infantry men, tanks, and large caliber weapons, is eradicated by a two Hueuey helicopters. <END OF SPOILER> After watching this film I learned that 1). SAM's are very slow but have unlimited range and fuel 2.) Serb soldiers do not need food, water, nor sleep 3.)An American NAVY pilot can withstand tremendous G-forces 4.) Thin ice that cracks under a human can really support a tank.   Holy crap, who wrote the script?  He should be hanged.  Can this movie get any lamer or dumber you ask?  Yes it can! There's a part where Burnett is picked up by refugees and a kid (wearing an Ice Cube T-shirt) gives him a clean bottle of Coca-Cola (label to the camera) and after a sip Burnett says `good'.  So basically the bad guys, including the Adidas wearing bounty hunter, smoke cigarettes and the good guys drink Coke.  Oh my, my!!!  Who's responsible for this?  However, this movie does have some pluses such as props and camerawork, but it's all overweighed by lack of realism, exaggeration, political correctness, and Owen Wilson's crocked nose.

Burnett dances his way through mine-fields, dodges sniper bullets, and climbs to the top of mountains and back while most of the Serbian army tries to eliminate him. What might have been a tense psychological combat between Burnett and his assailants is thwarted by caricatures of brutish and stupid  bad guys stumbling over themselves, followed closely by America's inept NATO allies.And as for the ending... puhleeze!!

Politically ambiguous military situation?  Che &#150; what?  That doesn't make sense.  I mean, we're America... (Don't worry &#150; We're the good guys.  It's all the rest that's ambiguous.)See, Behind Enemy Lines is set in Bosnia during the &#145;last' days of the civil war in Serbia/Yugoslavia/Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Chris Burnett (Wilson) is stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea.  The ship is commanded by Admiral Leslie Reigart (Hackman), who in turn is under the command of NATO, represented by Admiral Piquet (de Almeida).  Now, Burnett is a bit of a maverick.  Not like the Tom Cruise type &#150; Burnett is tired of being in the Navy.  He signed on to be a fighter pilot, not a sitting around on the ship pilot.  In fact, he's handed in his resignation papers.  Of course, you can't just leave in the middle of a mission.  When the ship returns to port, Burnett is done.  Reigart doesn't really care for Burnett &#150; he used to have potential, but now he's just dead weight.  So, in a bit of vindictiveness, Reigart assigns Burnett (a navigator) and his pilot, Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), on a recon mission on Christmas.  The recon?  A lake.  Lovely. But, radar picks up some activity.  Activity OFF OF THE ASSIGNED COURSE.  Now, we've established that Burnett is a maverick, so, naturally they do recon over there.  They take pictures of mass graves.  Then, they get shot down. BEHIND ENEMY LINES.  This is not good.  See, NATO planes were not supposed to be making fly-bys in that area.  A peace treaty has just been signed, and things could fall apart at any moment.  So, Reigart has a choice to make &#150; does he risk the lives of thousands of people to get one man?  Does he ensure peace and leave a man behind?  We all know the answer to that.Behind Enemy Lines is slick.  It is very, very slick.  Teflon.  It looks like a video game.  A really cool video game.  Shifty frame-rates, cool filters, Matrix-style special effects, Saving Private Ryan-camera-effects, it looks way cool.  It's not universally realistic, but, stylistically it works very well.The acting is also good.  No one is going to win any acting awards in this picture, but, no one stinks.  If you don't know who Gene Hackman is, turn off your computer right now.  You have some serious catching up to do.  If you don't know who Owen Wilson is, start paying attention.  This guy is good.  Very, very good.  You may have seen him in Zoolander (he was the blonde model).  You may have seen him in Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan. You may have seen an underrated comedy called Rushmore &#150; he co-wrote that. He's just beginning to get recognition, and he deserves it.  While I think he's better in comedies, he's no slouch as a leading-man-action-hero. Joaquim de Almeida doesn't stand out, but you've seen him before.  (He played Bucho (the bad guy) in Desperado)So, that leaves us with the story.  It must be tough to make a war movie now.  WWII was easy &#150; the bad guys were easy to spot.  But, to make a movie based on any war post-1970 must be tricky.  Things like finding &#145;bad guys' aren't easy anymore.  Even in something like the Gulf War.  To paraphrase Mark Wahlberg from Three Kings `I forget... Are we shooting people anymore?'  The Balkan conflict was really, really tricky.  First of all, there were three sides.  Secondly, there was a huge history of racial strife in the area.  Thirdly, NATO stepped in to prevent the war from spreading into Macedonia, which would have brought Greece (a NATO member) and Turkey (another NATO member) into the war against each other.  Fourthly, keeping all the factions straight was very, very hard unless you studied political science.  Behind Enemy Lines doesn't get too bogged down in the details, which is good.  Nor does it name real names.  Slobodan Milosovic is not mentioned, but he is implied.  The story is about an American airman in the middle of the conflict, but it's not based on the story of Lt. Scott O'Grady.What we have here is a slick, mostly non-political (there are some references to landmines being bad for children and other living things) war movie.

The premise is as simple as that, and so is the story. Don't expect much character development for anyone you see in this film because you will be disappointed. But, and it's a big one, if you want to be entertained and are willing to sit through an hour and a half of rehashed storylines, then you'll probably actually find yourself liking this movie. Owen Wilson (Shanghai Noon, Bottle Rocket) plays the pilot whom is in severe danger throughout the film. There is absolutely no doubt that had this movie actually been written to take place in the real world, or even follow basic proper storytelling, his character would not have lived to see the last 50 minutes of this film, but that is not the point here. The point is strictly to keep the audience interested for it's full length and it succeeds. I can't say that I recommend this film but I definitely was not bored while watching it. Wilson did a great job here in making his character sympathetic, all the while forcing us to not ask so many questions about the plot since really the story (if you want to call it that) doesn't allow much time to stop. He is on the run. The film begins with a cliche setup of a hotshot Navy flier who has had enough of his 7 years doing nothing onboard the Navy Aircraft. He has done no more than routine checks and excersises and was hoping to see and serve for the real deal...war. The scene would have been laughable, but is reduced to mere smirks while watching Gene Hackman (Admiral Reigart) delivers his lines. Shortly after, and right in time for X-mas dinner, Owen and his partner must do one of those routine checks. Owen, having been given permission to be dismissed in 2 weeks, feels he has nothing to lose so decides to break the rules and fly over a restricted area which is supposed be empty anyway. Well I couldn't believe it when they found trouble lurking there (I'm being sarcastic). So now the plane is shot down in Bosnia, Owen's partner is the one injured when they land from having ejected from the plane. Moments after, Owen leaves to get to higher ground where his communication devices work. I don't know why I even bothered explaining this much of this so called plot, frankly it doesn't matter. Here's my advice, don't go see this film if you want a story that will amaze. It's all about action; it's about close calls, and unbelievable plot twists and outcomes. It's about good and bad, and the American hero. And its first time director, John Moore, delivers in a close, but no cigar level of Bruckheimer Films (Armageddon, Top Gun). That's not really a good thing. So if your a regular movie goer and have little taste for a challenging film experience, then by all means go see this. It serves its purpose as fluff and filler.

Gene Hackman, as always, is excellent as the guilt-ridden admiral, and both Joaquin De Almeida and David (whatever happened to his career?) Keith are very good at their supporting roles.No, it is not any of these things.  The problem with this movie is that the actual actions of the person we are supposed to be rooting for (Burnett) are so extremely stupid, that even a person who has never gone through basic training will be snickering at his movements.  In real life, anyone behaving this carelessly would have been dead before clearing the first mile of his long journey through enemy territory.While being tracked by the enemy (both their army and a lone assassin who has 48 hours to bring his body back) Wilson's character walks through miles of open space (whatever happened to the use of natural cover to aid your travels?), lets out a scream within the enemy's earshot when he sees his friend getting shot (without which the soldiers would have thought him dead, thus no real point to the movie, granted - but you can do this a number of other ways that would not have seemed this ridiculous for a trained soldier), and after successfully escaping a virtual gauntlet of enemy troops and tanks by getting rid of his uniform and wearing a sky mask, goes ahead and takes off his mask right by the enemy tank and turns  towards them, so that we can take a full look at his face and notice his cleverness!  Was the writer (and Director, for that matter) so eager to show us his (their?) ingenuity that they couldn't wait a few frames until he was out of the soldier's line-sight?   I mean, the music played during this last scene makes you think they believe this to be a particular clever moment.  Sorry guys, it just looked stupid.Overall, I can not say I was happy watching this film.  It does have a couple of good moments (mentioned above), but not enough for me to feel satisfied with a film.  If I had watched it on DVD, or maybe HBO, maybe I would have been a little less disappointed.As it was, as a movie experience, BEHIND ENEMY LINES deserved being shot down. "},{"Title":"Undemanding War Film.","Date":"1 May 2010","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":" Owen Wilson survives a shoot-down of his reconnaissance airplane over Serb-controlled Bosnia. He's discovered evidence of a massacre of Moslems so the Serbs are determined to track him down and kill him. They've already captured, tortured, and executed his pilot. Meanwhile, back on Wilson's ship, his handler, Gene Hackman, is in touch by handy talky and is eager to launch a rescue mission but he's always being reined in by The Suits in the person of a French officer in charge of peace negotiations.This was released in 2001 and so antedates the attacks on 9/11 of that year, otherwise this movie is so compliant regarding the presumed desires of its intended audience that it's safe to assume that, had it been made a year later, the Moslems would have been the mass murderers, not the victims, although The Suits might have remained French.The plot is lifted wholesale from the successful Bat 21 of 1988 but is far less challenging. In the earlier film, Gene Hackman is the aviator stranded behind enemy lines and is forced to kill a hostile civilian who is the father of several scarred children. It fills him with chagrin.There is no such ambiguity here. Owen Wilson is the only blond in sight. All the natives are swarthy and the villainous ones are ugly to boot. They sneer and scowl and bark orders and leave each other to die without a qualm, the way the Nazis used to in World War II movies.Not all the incidents are lifted from Bat 21, although the tale sticks pretty close to the template, even down to the golf lingo used to disguise the messages between Wilson and Hackman. In Bat 21, the story, including the fairway references, was based more or less on a true historical event. This one is entirely made up. Crawling through the sea of decomposing bodies that are left over from a massacre is lifted from The Killing Fields. It differs from the original model, too, in being dumbed down. Wilson is obliged to run an obstacle course similar to Hackman's but zapped up with myriad CGIs and extreme slow-motion visuals of guys and their equipment being blown apart.Poor Wilson is subject to all sorts of travails. He slides all the way down the wall of a vast dam; he's shot at; he's almost disintegrated by the explosion of more land mines than can be counted; he's hunted by a professional killer with a telescopic sight on his rifle; he pursued by hordes of mustachioed Serbs; tanks blow holes in the walls he hides behind; he burrows under rotting corpses; his hair gets mussed; he gets all dirty but never gives up hope.Wilson isn't a bad-looking actor. I kind of liked his nose, aquiline in profile, lumpy in frontal view. He doesn't seem suited for dramatic roles, though. He might do well in light comedy. Gene Hackman is his professionally competent self, looking older, and he and his staff are bathed in a bright, irritating, neon-blue light that serves no purpose.If you enjoy action movies filmed with devices borrowed from MTV or TV commercials, a plot borrowed from the much better Bat 21, and a satisfactory bundle of binary oppositions between good and evil, lacking in any mature values, provoking nothing more than an arousal jag, this is for you. Otherwise, you might want to see the more imaginative Bat 21 and The Killing Fields. In any case, you've seen this before.

Bored with routine in the Navy and fed up flying uneventful missions to survey the peace, Burnett annoys his CO one last time by putting in his notice to quit and return to civilian life. Of course his reward is to be put on a mission on Christmas Day doing routine reconnaissance. An error in the intelligence data leads them over an no-fly zone where they see a convoy of Bosnian soldiers who should not be there and, in the process of recording them, they are attacked and shot down. Separated form Burnett, the pilot is captured and killed, leaving Burnett to evade capture for as long as he can until he can be rescued. First of all, lets make it clear that this is not the film to come to if you are expecting anything intelligent or worthwhile about the conflict in Bosnia; if that is your aim then I would suggest maybe Saviour as a starting point but certainly not this film. However if you want a standard action movie that happens to use the bleak washed out colours of a war zone to add character as well as using the war to make lots of things go bang then this should do you &#150; as long as you can stop your brain from thinking about the morals of using such a conflict to make a flag-waving, simplistic piece of Saturday night entertainment. The plot aspires to being some sort of serious piece about the conflict based around an action movie but it is nothing of the sort. Instead the conflict is very simplified for the purposes of leaving our brains free enough of worry and moral concern for our fellow man to be able to just enjoy things going bang. The plot sees an American soldier evade the bad guys with the aim of defeating them against the odds &#150; it doesn't matter who the bad guys are because they are a device rather than real people &#150; they could have been black (Black Hawk Down), Muslim (The Siege) or French (SWAT) but here they happen to be Bosnian. We don't need to worry too much about this because the film doesn't really do anything with them other than use them as the baddies to the blonde and clean cut Burnett's goodie. I'm sure I'll get bashed as anti-American for saying things like that but that is not my intention and I'd like to think I'm just being objective; lets be honest, this is just an action movie and shouldn't be looked on as anything more. However even judged on the standards of action movies this is only an average affair, with a plot that destroys its own tension by making Burnett increasingly bullet-proof as the film goes on, leading to a climax that reminded me of the laughable ending to Rambo 3. It does have tension early on but it has blown it by the ending, and the simplistic approach to a real war is hardly helpful. The direction tries to cover the gaps by using advertising gimmicks of jump cuts and freeze frames &#150; they aren't a replacement for content but at least they make the film a bit more interesting. Ignoring the morals of it, the use of the frozen war zone does create atmosphere really easily and it was used well.With Hackman too old to be repeating his Bat-21 role, Wilson steps up and, aside from his usual comic stuff at the start, plays it pretty straight and has clearly aimed to be nothing more than an all-American kid just doing his duty. He aims for this and this is all he does which, in an action movie, is fine &#150; however I kept thinking of Denis Quaid and thought how much braver he was in his choices. Hackman must have done about 2 or 3 weeks work on this film given 95% of his scenes are in one main location; he is OK but really just phones this in. The support cast is interesting in regards the Americans (people like Keith and 24's Almeida) but no effort is made on the side of the 'enemy' who are simply goons and baddies from the get go. Again it all works fine in a dumb action movie but the real setting in such a terrible conflict made me hope for more than just action fodder.Overall this is an average action movie with a bullet-proof hero taking on baddies who look different (black, Eastern European, Muslim, whatever) to bring good to the world of evil. On this level it is nothing special although it has some nice touches of style along the way but gets silly as it comes to the end. However morally it had a responsibility to really use this stage to do more with the conflict than just use it as a backdrop. Sadly it just paints everyone as the baddies and only looks for the emotion of cheering 'our guys' on rather than feeling anything for the real people or real country. Saviour may be bleak and depressing as a film but my god it is easier to stomach at times than this was. If you want things going bang then it should do you but you'd best try to switch off your brain, morals and heart before you start watching it.

Unbelivable really, when they do almost every mistake they could do in that movie when it comes to military tactics and common sense. When you have a whole army looking for you, you don't go to the biggest clearing in the forest or sit on a big rock on a high mountain top. And you don't clear mines by walking up to them and shoot them with your gun standing 5 meters away. Those mines have a kill radius of 40-50 meters..and the hero runs through probably the stupidest made mine field ever btw. He's at best 10 meters away from them, and runs through them all without even a scratch. Okay, this is nitpicking, but still a little serious when you think about it.

I jumped out of my seat screaming  The whaaaat ? . It`s the Dayton peace accord you bloody fool  . But I realised this was a complete work of fiction even though it`s set against the background of the aftermath of the early 90s Balkans conflict . Or is it ? Is it set before the signing of the Dayton peace accord of 1995 or after it ? Is it set before the Kosovo campaign of 1999 or after it ? This vagueness of chronology is irritating as are the politics . Why is the Serb faction so anti- Mladic ? Despite his unforgivable behaviour against Bosniak ( Bosnian Muslims )  and Croat civilians during the conflict Mladic was by far the most popular Bosian Serb leader amongst the Bosnian Serb population , and once again I`ve got to ask when BEHIND ENEMY LINES is set ? If it`s after 1995 Slobodan Milosevic should be the hate figure for these Serb rebels for signing the Dayton peace agreement . Another thing that annoyed me was the false picture painted of the NATO command structure which has always been commanded by Americans . There is exceptions to the rule such as NATO`s ground offensive in Kosovo in 1999 being led by British general Mike Jackson but NATO has nearly always been an entirely American run show and there`s no way Uncle Sam would allow an entire NATO task force to be run by a French admiral as seen here . And another unforgivable error that shows the screenwriters don`t have a clue what they`re writing about is the line  The F-18 was shot down over southern Bosnia  ! Even when the Bosnian Serb army made its greatest gains in the summer/autumn of 1992 they never reached as far as southern Bosnia , this area remained in the hands of the Bosnian Croats before , during and after the war while most of central Bosnia was held by the Bosniaks while the rest of Bosnia was held by the Serbs so if the hero was shot down over  Southern Bosnia  how come he`s being chased by Serb militia and tanks . Oh and if there`s a peace deal how come everyone is fighting again ? Wasn`t there a large UN presence before NATO arrived ? Wasn`t there a large NATO ground force ( I-For it was called ) sent into the country to implement the Dayton peace accord ? So how come we don`t see any NATO ground forces stopping the fighting between the factions ?  I might be accused of nit picking but I wish to say that I think it`s absolutely obscene that Hollywood has made a movie set against the back drop of a conflict that killed 278,000 human beings and not once do I get the impression that the production team know what they`re talking about . It`s not too difficult to check a few facts if only to show a little respect to the victims of this brutal conflict . I`ve never been to the former Yugoslavia but I obviously know more about the conflict than the people who produced and wrote the screenplay .

(The Haunting is an exception; Wilson cannot be charming if he's cast as a complete dolt.)  Surely Wilson, who has co-written some good scripts himself, must have known that this script was awful - yet he really TRIES with it, doing what he can to bring out humour where there isn't any and feeling where, on paper, there's only schmaltz. Full marks to him. A pity the film still stinks.Gene Hackman, on the other hand, clearly knows how bad the script is, and doesn't try at all. He just stands there and barks; on occasion he even half-fluffs a line, and it makes the final cut, and why not? He'll still ultimately be as convincing as any of the other actors, so long as he remembers not to sigh in impatience as a clueless young director asks him to recite witless clich√©s, one after the other.You would have thought the premise was foolproof a stranger in a strange land, not speaking the language, running for his life from partisan forces he's not sure he can even identify. It takes more than mere hackwork to screw up this surefire action scenario as thoroughly as John Moore does. It takes a director who's used to making music videos (or television ads; it comes to the same thing), who thinks editing means cutting the celluloid into four-frame pieces and serving it up as a salad, whose idea of creative camerawork is spinning the camera wildly around two people who are simply having a chat, making them look as though they're at the centre of a merry-go-round.Special mention, in this film in which everything except Owen Wilson is bad, should go to the musical score, which is worst of all. It consists of EVERYTHING - lame pump-up-the-volume-and-leave-out-the-tune rock songs, drums, strings, trumpets, horns, and and an etherial (or so the composer supposes) choir - none of it bearable, all of it aggressively loud.Insults to our intelligence include (1) Chris escaping capture by swapping uniforms with a dead body and walking away from the battleground with a balaklava over his head, and then, because the director thinks we're too dense to work out that the guy in the balaklava is him, TAKING OFF the balaklava and TURNING AROUND so that we (and the enemy soldiers who are trying to kill him) can get a good look at his face, and then, for good measure, RUNNING AWAY at a speed fast enough to be suspicious but not fast enough to get away should anyone happen to run after him; (2) bad guys' machine-gun bullets and bazooka missiles INVARIABLY missing their target at close range - I mean, really, why not just re-write the script so that the hero is further away or harder to hit; and (3) the suggestion that American forces are not free to do whatever they please because they are ultimately held in check by their NATO allies.

In fact, the KLA provoked Milosevic to overreact precisely in order to trick the international community into taking sides in a highly complex conflict which had been going on for hundreds of years--with atrocities committed by all sides against all sides. Yes, there were mass graves produced by the Serbs, but also by all of their foes. The NATO campaign painted Milosevic as the new Hitler in order to justify the need for the continuation of NATO after the end of the Cold War. Clinton was in the midst of scrutiny about a blue dress, which came to a sudden halt upon U.S. involvement in Kosovo. Albright had mentioned to Colin Powell that she really wanted to try out the big toys of the DoD...

What does reign in this movie is the typical yankee mind-set of being a world cop that maintains all good in the world. What I don't understand is how the NATO general that's higher ranking than Gene Hackman gets to be a bad guy. Supposing the Serbian situation was really as depicted in the movie, he's the only intelligent one out of the group...Somehow him trying to stop Hackman from sending in troops to save one piddly soldier because it could shatter the entire peace process is a bad thing. If Hackman's character had anymore brains then a ton of lead (which he apparently doesn't) he would realize that one soldier isn't worth the peace of a entire country. Who really cares, uh? Too bad for Wilson's character, he shouldn't have been flying in a demilitarized zone anyway, he can walk to a refugee camp or Red cross station like everyone else...Though watching Wilson's character running from a dark, unshaven Serbian bad guy was enough entertainment to keep my brain running in neutral, I found the bullet-dodging talents of Wilson quite amusing. In the first dodging sequence it was engaging, in the second less, by the third it was standard and after that the only thing to keep you awake was your own eye-movement (Yes, there was more than three bullet/mine/missile sequences..far more). The film got so utterly and disgustingly red white and blue at the end I almost vomited. One of the only pro's of the movie was that the main character wasn't some buff, rippling heart throb but rather a crooked nosed, casual everyday guy. Relating back to NATO, a scarily ironic point my husband bought up is that that destroyed town in the mine sequence was more likely victim to NATO's bombs than anything else.Anyway, its a good movie if you like watching the Hollywood film industry play with people's perceptions of the American government and military as world cops and righteous heroes.

And because they killed a bus of civilians which was happening in Bosnian war every day (yes, this is called WAR) they are terribly afraid that the good Americans would find it out and beam them to the Hague tribunal for war crimes so they must kill every American they can find on Serbian territory. On the other hand, in the scene in Hach they massacre the entire city and nobody cares. As Owen Wilson would put it as he did about 35 times in the film Goddamit! Around 100.000 people were killed during Bosnian war but this doesn't matter to Hollywood producers to whom the Serbs are evil because they shot an American pilot. In the head!!! (But first the Lord of Evil by a very uncommon Serbian name of MIROSLAV LOKAR talked to him and poisoned him with the tobacco smoke from his cigarettes.) It is also completely unrealistic that the Chetniks would actually want to kill two insignificant American pilots instead of selling them for ransom because their forces were always in a bad need for money.

Having seen it this afternoon I feel like bathing. There are so many flaws, it is impossible to include them all, or even to know where to start for the Highlights of Horror. Plot holes so huge you could drive a Yugo through them. Just plain bad editing, scripting, filming.One example-- in the final chase scene the characters are shown running through snow in the forest. In a few frames, the snow is gone and it's suddenly autumn in a glade. Then a few seconds later they're back on a mountain top of snow and ice, with thick flakes in the air. Then back to autumn in the glade, etc. The hero, in the autumnal scene, glances 200 yards over to a statue on a bluff. Walking to the statue, not only is it deep winter all of a sudden, but they actually show him walking on pond ice, hinting that he's about to crash through the ice into a huge, dangerous pond hidden under the snow. Pond ice high up on a hillside, with the large pond going right to the edge of the bluff? The amateurish design of this movie is beyond comprehension. And to paint it all with a thick, clumsy patriotic brush, given 9/11 is patently offensive.Gene Hackman has been a hero of mine for years-- he is a true grand master of acting. Even his previous bad movie, Enemy of the State, was watchable and enjoyable on a certain level. Gene, Gene, Gene-- what happened dood?Owen Wilson is a young up-and-coming writer, producer, actor. I love his previous work, and have anticipated his rise to super-stardom. However it happened, this sure wasn't the vehicle. He is clearly a master-in-the-making, and Behind Enemy Lines isn't powerful enough to derail his career. But still-- I predict he will cringe whilst on dates, hanging out with friends, and during on-set recreational breaks for YEARS to come as his friends remind him of this loaf of a movie.If there is only one movie theater within 50 miles of your town, and this is the only movie playing-- please stay home. Please save your money and your eyeballs. And, if you're like me, save yourself the embarrassment of sitting through this dreck. Hey, just sit on your porch for 2 hours.

Imagine my surprise when I realized that almost nothing was portrayed correctly. First of all, THE WAR IN BOSNIA IS OVER! That is something that many movie makers fail to understand. They obviously need a warlike setting and than they chose the most recent war they can remember. Lt. Chris Burnett's mentioning Britney Spears in the beginning of the movie indicates the fact that the story took place in last few years. One would think that the movie makers should take that into consideration. Another major mistake is the fact that they say in the news report that the serbs occupy southern Bosnia, when they actually occupied northern Bosnia (quite logical if you should look at the map). I mean if you chose to make a movie about a recent event, you could at least consult some experts and concentrate on details, if not because of the quality of the movie than because of the respect for the people who suffered. I have to give the movie some credit because they at least used existing yugoslavian names (and didn't try to make up some name that sound foreign as many other films and series do) and didn't portray the people as primitive long bearded lunatics on horse, even though they were portrayed only as mad killers. Overall the movie is quite exiting which makes it acceptable, but it is not at all realistic which totally undermines any quality it can possibly have.

From what I recall the Bosnian Serb military were not nice people, and this film reminding us of that, I believe, is a perfectly valid point.There is a lack of realism at times in the film, especially toward the end, where Wilson seems to dodge a million bullets emerging from an entire brigade, including armour vehicles etc., but don't let this detract.

Disobey them in such a way as to get your best friend killed. But that's OK, because no matter what happens when you disobey orders, it all comes out good in the end. You feel better about yourself and you'll bring the bad guys to book. So don't worry about your best friend. He was only a plot device anyway.One thing is certain, though. As long as there is conflict in the world, there will be a Hollywood movie to glorify it and vilify the enemy.And just who were the enemy? The Bosnians? The Serbs? The Croats? The film didn't seem very certain itself and neither was I, even at the end.Particularly laughable (and somewhat disturbing) in this no brainer action film was the dreadful end sequence, where we get to find out (via the wonder of the subtitled explanation) what happens to the main characters.Now, call me old-fashioned, but such final scene what they did next stuff in my book is reserved for two types of film - comedy spoofs and documentaries. This film is certainly no comedy, so the appearance of these notes, to me, would seem to imply that the movie was in part based in reality. I find this disturbing simply because there are any number of extremely dumb people out there that would see such final comments and assume the film was, after all, based on true events.

It was a time when the combatant forces were supposed to be non-aggressive, but the pilot spots illegal troop movements of Serbian forces when he flies over an area outside his authorized zone. He gets shot down by an anti-aircraft missile.I give this film six stars solely for the action, however unrealistic it may seem. And, because of the message that the Navy admiral was not going to abandon one of his men. In this day and age, that's a message that our military need to know, especially if the U.S. is going to rely solely on a volunteer, professional armed forces.My rating is probably stretching it, on the basis of accuracy. I don't know fighter aircraft or Navy operations, but I could see basic mistakes in several portrayals.

He befriends a youth at one point and I was half expecting this kid to return in the final scene and save Wilson or something, but that did not happen and that is a good thing, as that would have been almost expected and way to happy. The movie is not perfect though as it is not particularly memorable in certain areas of the film, I remember the rather explosive finale, the scene where Wilson gives the soldiers the slip and the boy and a scene involving a football and a plane launcher, but a lot of the other scenes I draw a bit of a blank.

In this case the always solid Owen Wilson. Also different to those Reagan-era-MIA-movies is the fact that Behind Enemy Lines doesn't focus on the rescuer (Gene Hackman) alone but even more so on the missing guy. Therefore we see Wilson running through Bosnia, hunted by half the Serbian army. I don't know how that soldier survived one second. He screams, he walks on open ground, he dodges thousands of bullets - well, he's an American!To be fair, Behind Enemy Lines isn't the same reactionary crap as its predecessors, mainly because it takes the politics slightly more serious. The single most impressive line was the NATO general's You might have saved one man, but you risked thousands others. This rings true - even if it is left unanswered and finally ignored by Hackman. He's no hero, he's an idiot who risks war for one stupid soldier who entered a de-militarized zone. The moral seems to be Well let those Yugoslavs kill each other, as long as our boy gets back home save. Does that sum up America's foreign politics? Anyway, to make the whole quest more honorable, the Serbs are not only unshaved and chain-smoking, they're also sadistic and don't fit a film that wants to be more realistic than Rambo. Oh and they can't shoot of course. This is one of those movies where 100 enemies with tanks and MG's aren't able to hit a single target.So what is Behind Enemy Lines?

Their appearance is not coincidental &#150; it reflects a wish, post the horror of the World Trade Center attack, to show America at its most heroic. Certainly `Behind Enemy Lines' deliver an adrenalin rush, but the style is too gung-ho for it to last long.The plot concerns the shooting down of an American jet which is &#145;off mission' over Serb-occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina. The American military has co-operated fully with the hardware, so &#150; in a return to `Top Gun' territory - there are terrificly atmospheric shots of the aircraft carrier that is the crew's base and some really exciting film of the F-18 Hornet that is their &#145;mount'.  Slovakia stands in for Bosnia but fits the bill convincingly. It was a shrewd move not to cast a star in the lead role, but instead the newcomer, blond-haired, pinched-nosed Owen Wilson. In fact, the only really well-known actor in the movie is Gene Hackman, playing a characteristically gruff role as the admiral of the carrier, but he is sadly under-used, even when stupidly he is shown leading the helicopter rescue operation (`Let's go get our boy!'). First time director John Moore deploys some flashy camera-work and provides plenty of pyrotechnics but, besides the fact that it has been done before (in the more intelligent `Bat 21'), the whole thing is just too formulaic and simplistic to make a lasting impression.

I work in the defence industry and this is probably a problem of knowing too much, but a mate of mine who does not also picked this up. (And why does that 'hard drive' look awfully like a minidisc taped to a bit of card? - This prop looked even more tacky because the rest of the film was clearly polished and high budget).A sniper, again proficient in the use of his weapon from years of war, manages to miss our hero from a couple of hundred metres when the target is sitting down, not moving and the weather conditions are perfect.The missile evasion shots are excellent but are marred by the explosions of the fuel tanks which look awful - again, after seeing such excellent aerial and c.g. shots these poor quality effects really jar.You find your pilot injured (a leg wound) in open, hostile terrain. Do you a) Leave him where he is so that when the bad guys come they can't fail to spot him in his green uniform against the white snow and next to his brightly coloured parachute, or b) move him to the excellent cover less than 100 metres away? Our man chose a) and, surprise, surprise, sees his pilot gunned down. Not even the American military is that badly trained.There is a minefield in a destroyed industrial complex. There are a number of tripwires running accross an open space. Our hero starts picking his way through, when three bad guys turn up behind him. He starts to run and trips a wire. The mine to which the wire is attached is 90 degrees to his right or left, the bad guys are about 20m behind him. Yet the explosion knocks them off their aim while our hero is unharmed. Even worse the secondary explosions from other mines all over the place and ones that our hero trips as he runs through manage to kill the three soldiers (who never entered the area) yet leave our hero unscathed!Our sniper who has been tracking the hero looks through his sight at the camera - the sight is large with no obvious adjustment mechanism and we can see his magnified eye (we wouldn't in a normal sniper sight). Next shot, a few seconds later, the sight has metamorphasised back into a standard, much smaller sniper rifle sight with the adjustments clearly visable. The magnified eye shot was completely unnecessary to the plot, but meant that a deliberate continuity error was introduced that could not fail to be spotted. This is simply bad directing.You may think that I am just picking holes but all these things and more contributed to make sure that I for one, my mate sitting next to me, and a number of people we overheard when walking out of the cinema, could not suspend belief.

But to me, it smacks of amateurish research and attention to detail. Its not that it ruins the picture, its simply that it slaps you in the face with a reminder that hey, this is only a film.  The attention to detail is what sets apart really well-done military films, like Saving Private Ryan.I will highlight several glaring inaccuracies1. Aerial photo reconnaissance is not performed at low level, as is depicted in the film. In several scenes, the plane is flying between mountain peaks and through valleys. Furthermore, you would never recon anything by flying directly over it. Recon missions are supposed to be covert.2. Thermal imagery, from satellites, is not capable of the real-time, sub one-meter resolution that is often depicted in thriller films..like the Tom Clancy films.3. SAM missiles are not capable of tracking an aircraft in the manner shown (ie, repeated turn-on-a-dime maneuvering over a period of several minutes) Even a medium range SAM might only have a range of up to 10 km, which is about the distance covered in less than 30 seconds at mach 1, a speed the F18A can easily achieve in much less than that period of time. Granted SAM's get up to Mach1+ quicker than the average aircraft, like maybe just 4-6 seconds, but they cant turn on a dime at Mach 1, and they have limited range. If you were fired on by a SAM, chances are its either gonna hit you right away, or miss you entirely, not chase you around.3. In the scenes dealing with extracting the downed aviator from behind enemy lines, the helicopters leave from the USS Carl Vinson, which is presumedly somewhere in the Adriatic off the coast of Croatia. They travel to a pick-up point, near the town of Hac. (this is probably based on the real life city of Bihac, in northern Bosnia, near the border with Croatia). However, travel time is about 10 minutes. This is a distance of at least 100 miles, and would probably take about 45 minutes.4.  Also in the helo scene, we see Gene Hackman's character sitting in the second pilot position of the aircraft. This would never be done..an Admiral would never be flying a helo. A combat helicopter is always manned by two fully functional, active pilots. In case the aircraft commander gets hit, you have to have another pilot on the stick to fly the aircraft.Granted, all the inaccuracies contribute in small measure to the consistency of the story line. Without Gene Hackman in the final rescue scene, there could be no climactic resolution of the conflict that Owen Wilson's character introduced in the early part of the film.

When his plane is shot down by the Serbian military, it is up to Reigart to try to get his man safely back home.Gene Hackman gives one of his best performances of his career in this film, and Owen Wilson is fantastic in his first serious role. Never being a fan of Wilson, I was alittle skeptical on how his performance would be in this film...but the man does deliver!!! Fantastic battle scenes add to the suspense as we follow him through the hills of Bosnia, avoiding the persuing Serbian forces.Do yourself a favour and check out Behind Enemy Lines.

All he had to do in thisfilm was run from guys shooting at him, and while he does thateffectively, what's the point?  I wish that he had been given thefreedom to do more with the role.  Meanwhile Gene Hackman essentially reprised the same role thathe had in Crimson Tide, then as a sub captain, now a shipadmiral.  Though it is a role his fills well, it's not as interestinganymore.Also, Enemy Lines strains plausibility more than even the mostunbelievable flag-waving war film...the scene where he hides in agraveyard of corpses with the enemy literally walking over him wasespecially ludicrous.And I found myself annoyed by much of director John Moore'scamera work.

The plot revolves around a rescue over enemy territory and gets even more vague as it goes along. The viewer never finds out too many plot details but are expected to let their eyes glaze over, enjoy their popcorn, and ask no questions. There are no unpredictable moments and nothing about the film that makes you want to talk about it afterwards. Although the film does contain a solid performance by Gene Hackman, he cannot carry the movie being a supporting actor alone. It is left to Owen Wilson, who is by no means an action superhero or leading man.There are a lot of slow motion action sequences that become a little boring after a while. It almost makes you want to look for the remote with the fast forward button. It's like watching a music video with the sound off.The film was supposed to come out early next year but was pushed due to the studio thinking that everyone would want to see an American soldier rescued from the foreign enemies in their war-torn country. They're probably right, too. It screen tested well nationally and locally, so why not $trike while the iron is hot?I wouldn't recommend this to too many movie buffs.

After watching that 80's classic, I went into `Enemy Lines' with raised expectations. In the fifteen or so years since `Top Gun,' there have certainly been some technical improvements in moviemaking, so `Enemy Lines' must be a new millenium visual treat. And it was. The film starts out with our main character, navigator-bombardier, Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) preparing to take off on a mission over the former republic of Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, an engine flames out. Burnett, after some seven years in the navy has grown disillusioned and wants out. One thing stands in Burnett's way-his tough, demanding commanding officer, Adm. Riegart (Gene Hackman). As a punishment, he and his pilot are assigned a Christmas-day recon mission. While flying, they take pictures of a mass grave being filled in by the Serbs who had recently signed a peace accord. To cover up their deed, the Serbs shoot down Burnett's plane. Both Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), the pilot, and Burnett land safely, but the Serbs catch up with Stackhouse and kill him. Now the race begins. The Serbs, naturally, are afraid of NATO retribution, so the set out to kill Burnett before he can be rescued. Meanwhile, Riegart sets a rescue plan into motion. While Riegart plans, the French NATO commander, Adm. Piquet (Joachim de Almeida), is trying to preserve the peace by setting exacting standards for Burnett's rescue. Pursued by Sasha (Vladimir Mashkov), a Serbian master tracker, Burnett must find his way through Serbian army units, mined warehouses, sniper-filled woods, and a truck full of Elvis impersonators to get to his rescue point. I was genuinely entertained by this movie. Although it does not have a world-class script (the plot is more transparent than Casper the Ghost on diet pills), Owen Wilson is able to come across as a fairly normal guy, frustrated by the system that he seems to be trapped in and now questioning his ethical standards. Gene Hackman is also entertaining as the stereotypical tough-as-nails-but-with-a-soft-heart-type of commander. But all is not well. `Behind Enemy Lines' really needed only one thing to be a great film-attention to reality. Am I really supposed to buy Burnett time after time avoiding massive volleys of gunfire directed at him? Come on! The Balkan people have been constantly at war for the past decade. I would assume that most of the soldiers left would be able to accurately fire a gun at a target. And after Burnett runs through a mine field with explosions right and left, is he wounded, if only with a superficial scratch that looks like it might have come from a shaving accident? The answer for those of you playing at home is a resounding NO. Another thing that annoyed me was the over-exaggeration of technology. Now I know that the United States has some pretty good satellites, but can one really be expected to pick up a single man running through hostile terrain? Uh&#133;no. Now that I got that little rant out of the way, let me give a little bit more praise. The jet scenes were absolutely awesome. It looked so real, in fact, that I almost thought that it came from actual footage, but in retrospect, no plane could have stayed with an F-16 so closely for that long. The camera work was a bit unusual; combining both slow- and fast-motion shots of both the chase scenes and the jet scenes. And one other thing, the music was perfect. Don Davis's (`The Matrix) scoring was over-the-top, which was a nice touch to this patriotic movie. One other thing lacked in this movie when compared to `Top Gun.' In `Top Gun,' you actually begin feeling for the characters, urging them on or yelling at them not to do this or that. Of course, that might just be my thoughts&#133;Anyway, `Enemy Lines,' while well-executed, I could not see myself silently urging Burnett on because it just wouldn't fit the film. On a side note, before you go see this movie, be up-to-date on the Balkan situation. Know who's fighting who and where (I would like to thank my World Geo teacher, Mr. Decker, for giving us loads of copies on the Balkans-great research material).

The director uses every cinematographic trick from the bag without scrutiny, creating such an awareness that this is only a movie with actors filmed by a director and a cinematographer, that it was entirely distracting.

However, Owen Wilson...this film's only ongoing bright spot. In a film full of cliched dialogue, story and scene representation, every one of Wilson's reactions, spoken lines...everything, has a nuance that removes itself from the rest of the drivel. He's such an unlikely casting selection for this role that's better suited for the likes of Stephen Baldwin or Casper Van Dien, and his unwillingness to play an action hero here works so well that this film confuses me.

I've read more than a few movie magazines this year, and knew when and what to expect among films due out this year.  I do not remember reading anything about Behind Enemy Lines.  My first exposure to it was a preview seen a few weeks ago.  The PG 13 rating also scared me a bit, as most serious action movies usually depict enough material to merit the R rating.  Toss in the fact that I saw the excellent Spy Game the day earlier, and I must admit that I really didn't go into this movie expecting a blockbuster.  My intuition was correct.  Behind Enemy Lines has the look to me of a movie that was just sort of thrown together.  It isn't so much that it is uneven, poorly acted, or excessively unrealistic.  It is just that its...well, nothing special.  As a previous viewer stated earlier, the film is very very predictable; if ever there was a paint by numbers plot, this is it.  The characters (and there are really only 3 that you know much of anything about) are pretty stereotypical, especially Gene Hackman's character.  He could very easily have been played by the same Carrier Commander from Top Gun and you wouldn't have noticed the difference.  Owen Wilson does a better job than expected here, and I have no problem with his casting in this role.  The villains are standard garden variety goons.  I feel that the movie would have been better if it had provided more of an insight into the sniper character, but you basically know nothing more about the character at the end of the film than you do at the beginning, other than he was interned in a prison camp somewhere at some time.  The action is fairly well done, especially the F/A-18 segment.  When I think back to the films I saw for the first time in 2001, Behind Enemy Lines is going to fall into the just another flick category.  I'm not sorry I saw it, nor will I make any special effort to see it again in the next year or so.  It is pretty much an average movie, and one that might be more appealing to those that didn't see Bat 21 (starring Gene Hackman of all people) or Flight of the Intruder, two Vietnam Era movies from the early 1990's with similar subject matter that I consider superior to this film.

What does Burnett do?  He stands up for a while, joking with his pilot, then walks away in search of something- leaving his pilot in plain sight of any advancing party.  Hello?  If enemy forces just shot your butt down, don't you think they'll have enough motivation to search for you?So Burnett spends the whole movie running away miraculously dodging tank shells and running through minefields, while Gene Hackman's admiral character spends the whole movie being a yes-man to a NATO admiral.  Then the ending sees Burnett turn into a Rambo character while Hackman suddenly has the balls to do what he should have done from the beginning- rescue his damn pilot.Many flaws with the relationship between U.S. forces and NATO.  American forces rescue American servicemen, simply put.  European NATO forces do not go in to do our job, we're often doing their job.  No American admiral would be that willing to sacrifice an American serviceman over the fishy orders of a NATO admiral.  What cause the NATO admiral would have to be in cahoots with Serb forces was never even hinted at.  Also, the jet originally took a picture of a Serb convoy, but this somehow gets changed to a picture of an open genocide grave at the end.

But since I have a newly realized sense of patriotism, I happened to like that Hollywood finally made a modern military film that depicts The American Spirit in a positive way.Hollywood has made plenty of films about the U.S. military. But the bulk of them tends to portray the U.S. as a big bully or a satirical icon. Or they simply choose to make films like Crimson Tide or A Few Good Men that depict the dark side of the military. When Hollywood does make military movies that show the U.S. Military in a positive light, they usually center on events that occurred during World War II (Saving Private Ryan, The Big Red One, Band Of Brothers, Pearl Harbor). We really haven't had a war as legendary as World War II, and let's face it, there are maybe a couple of movies that portray Vietnam as anything other than dark and nightmarish(Operation Dumbo Drop, Good Morning Vietnam, scenes in Forrest Gump). The Gulf War is now being adapted to movies (In The Army Now...to some extent, Courage Under Fire, Three Kings). I was afraid that our military efforts in Bosnia would be overlooked by Hollywood.On to the movie...Owen Wilson was perfectly cast as Lieutenant Chris Burnett, the everyman main character who rose to the occasion despite his past. His performance redefined the concept of the American Hero. In the past, Wilson has chosen parts that emphasize his comedic talents (Meet The Parents, Bottle Rocket, Zoolander), and he brings elements of his comedic timing into his performance in Behind Enemy Lines. Which is not to say that he was comedic in his portrayal of LT Burnett, but it added depth to his character as a whole, especially since a lesser actor would have played his part as shallow as a puddle. At times, we see Wilson's Burnett as scared, other times he is laid back, and other times he is as determined to get the job done as any other action hero. Plus, Wilson had to do most his major lines by himself. It is that multilayered performance that I believe saved this movie.As far as the supporting cast goes, Gene Hackman works the material to the best of his ability. But he gets the worst lines in the movie. It is unfortunate because Hackman is so good at playing the career military officer with a touch of roguish charm as he did in Crimson Tide. Joaquim De Almeida gives a minimal performance as the NATO Chief with his own agenda, and is the sole voice of opposition again Hackman's character. Almeida holds his own against Hackman, but we just don't see enough of him. Rent Desperado if you want to see Almeida in action. David Keith has done Naval movies in the past (Men Of Honor, U-571), and his performance in this one was solid. Olek Krupa also gives a fine performance as the leader of the renegade Serb troops that are after LT Burnett. He has little to do but scowl and bark orders, but he does it in a realistic way, with plenty of emotion to back it up. Gabriel Macht's performance as LT Stackhouse (Burnett's pilot) was very convincing and he plays off of Wilson's character very well. The friendship between Burnett and Stackhouse is one of the high points of the film. I only wish that we were given more scenes where the two friends get to interact more often and show more levels of their relationship.People may call this Top Gun In Bosnia, and I admit, the first quarter does seem like that. But after Burnett and Stackhouse crash, it becomes a different story altogether. What started as a film about young Navy pilots horsing around on an aircraft carrier a la Top Gun, it becomes a cat-and-mouse game a la Enemy At The Gates. There are many unbelievable moments, such as the few times that Burnett evades hails of bullets and mortars fired by Serb troops and emerges unharmed. The final battle scene with Marine Hilos firing grenade launchers and miniguns upon Serb troops(who are also firing their own weapons), and with Burnett caught in the middle of it all while managing to emerge unscathed yet again, caused me to roll my eyes a bit. But the film was fast paced and beautifully photographed, the film did make war-torn Bosnia seem picturesque in its own way. Some camera techniques seemed to be lifted directly from the Omaha Beach scene in Saving Private Ryan, but it is used effectively in this case as well. As in Saving Private Ryan, the technique is used to show the hectic pace by which battles are fought. The movie also uses freeze frames and close-ups effectively. John Moore's direction was technically flawless, using gorgeous cinematography to move the narrative along as well as establishing an overall theme of movement in the film; this film never slows down.Overall, this film is exciting. With action scenes as mesmorizing as they are impossible, great acting by Owen Wilson and decent acting from the supporting cast, this film finally shows the modern American military in a positive light. If you see this movie, you will have a newfound faith in the American spirit, even if you do have to suspend your disbelief.I give this movie an 7, on a scale of 1 to 10.

The story is loosely based on the true events surrounding Lt. Scott O'Grady-a U.S. pilot shot down over enemy territory and recovered by American forces. The similarities to real historical events begin and end there.Owen Wilson plays Lt. Burnett, who, while flying a standard recon mission, crosses into hostile territory to photograph suspicious military activity. A rebel group shoots down his plane, and subsequently hunts him down. He must now escape these hostile forces, traverse harsh terrain, and weather foggy politics to find his way to safety. Guiding him via radio is his commanding officer, played by Gene Hackman.What one first notices about this film is that it's definitely aimed at the MTV generation. Quick cuts, variable film speeds, CG effects, hyper-real photography and heavy use of filters give the film a music video feel at times. Thankfully, this never overpowers the story, and in some cases, it adds to the drama. (Two great scenes involve the effect of a land mine on a soldier, and the inner workings of an ejection seat firing.) Some viewers will feel these techniques are overused-it all depends on your tolerance for stylishness.Needless to say, the action scenes are stars of this film. While they aren't wholly original, they are presented in such a way that they seem fresh and exciting. The opening sequence when Burnett's plane is shot down is truly amazing, and there's a scene involving an abandoned minefield that's fantastic-a highly memorable set piece. Many of the combat scenes also feel reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan-frenetic yet crisply photographed.An interesting point regarding the action Some viewers have cited scenes where Burnett seems to be in danger, and in the next scene he is shown to be in relative safety-the scenes depicting his explicit escape missing. While this is a valid point, there really isn't any jarring lack of continuity here. These missing scenes are directly related to the danger level of Burnett's situation. In other words, the filmmaker NEVER presents us with a scene in which Burnett triggers a land mine, and then cuts to him having a sandwich. The director simply omits scenes in which Burnett is not in any imminent danger. It's assumed he finds his way to temporary safe haven.Some have also commented that the action here seems far-fetched. True, yet the action is no more far-fetched than in any film in the genre. If you can stomach Die Hard, Goldeneye, Mission Impossible 1, or any GOOD action film in the past 25 years, you shouldn't have a problem with this one.As far as the performances go, there's much to like. Owen Wilson does a great job as an amiable everyman. He gives us a refreshingly low-key performance, and presents us with a new take on the typical soldier character.  Gene Hackman proves once again that subtlety is what acting is about. Many actors-especially in war films-feel that yelling and chewing scenery equals talent. Hackman continues to put actors like DeNiro and Pacino to shame in this area.Unfortunately, these likeable performances are squandered on semi-flat characters. There isn't much depth or back story to Burnett or his commanding officer. The feeble attempts to show Burnett's home life are just that feeble. There really isn't much for us to latch onto and care about, and that's a shame. In short, there's little more to these characters than what happens to them in the 2 hours we see them.The film also stumbles in it's presentation of the overall conflict. One would think the filmmaker would attempt to present the confusing Bosnian theater in a simple, filmgoer-friendly manner, but he does not. While one can excuse that for the sake of drama, one can't ignore the loose ends left hanging when the director does decide to present a heavy political issue. *SPOILER* When Hackman's character leaks information to the press to expedite Burnett's rescue, a fellow admiral points out a flaw in his logic He may save his pilot, but in doing so, he has endangered the peace process, which may result in thousands of deaths.  Unfortunately, we never see how this point plays out. *END SPOILER*In the end, the film never quite rises to the dramatic pinnacle it aspires to. It comes close, and many will undoubtedly clap when its over, but it seems a bit forced and flat. (Due to the flat characters.) It would not be surprising if many viewers forget this film days after seeing it. The filmmakers should have taken a page from Crimson Tide or even Sniper--military films that stay with the viewer.Flaws aside, Behind Enemy Lines still manages to entertain.  It's an effective action film that gives us a fresh style of action and a new type of soldier (thanks to Owen Wilson), and it's worth seeing. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a solid 6.5 out of 10.

No, this is not a great film, the way The Elephant Man or Citizen Kane is, but it is a well done movie.  The plot is fairly conventional, the execution was really good.  This was the directors first film, and he does well.  I felt that his use of special effects enhanced the film, though I know some felt it detracted.  The use of slow motion and sound after explosions fits into what soldiers have said about what they feel at that moment.  The director knows how to ratchet up the suspense, and though in the back of my mind I knew how it would end, I still felt suspense at what would happen.The performance by Owen Wilson was great.  I have liked what he has done in the past, and this was totally different.  Here, he is an action hero, but then again, he isn't.  He seemed to come across as a regular guy, even a bit cynical about being a soldier, who is thrust into a situation that needs extraordinary courage and reflexes to get out of.  He aquit himself very well.Gene Hackman did a great job, as usuall, as Wilson's commander.  Hackman can take any role and make you believe that it is a real person.All in all, this is worth watching if you want to see a fun war related film, that is patriotic.

It's true to the genre and it delivers the goods.Owen Wilson stars as a hot shot Navy flier named Burnett. Him and his partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are assigned to a recon mission. They pick up some activity on their radar and check it out using their shiny new digital camera. What they see are mass graves and illegal troop movements. Not good at all. The Serbians have signed a peace treaty and they are now breaking it. The Serbs fire two missiles at Burnett and Stackhouse. This leads to a heart-pumping, visual masterpiece of a scene. The best part in the movie, by far. One of the missiles hits the plane and the two pilots eject, landing in God knows where. Burnett goes to higher ground to get his radio to work and leaves Stackhouse there. Troops arrive including Tracker (Vladimir Mashkov) and his commander Lokar (Olek Krupa). They shoot Stackhouse in the head. Burnett is trying to make it out of there alive but Tracker just keep coming after him. Back on the navy ship, Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman) is trying his all to save this kid. We wants to go in and rescue him, but his superior, Amdiral Piquet (Joaquim de Almeida), won't let him. Throughout the movie, Burnett dodges bullets, missiles, and works his way around land mines.BEHIND ENEMY LINES is not without flaw, though. It uses and reuses the tired clich√© where the entire Serbian army shoots thousands of bullets at him, yet every one conveniently misses him. He shoots back and hits them right between the eyes. This has been used since the early Bond films and annoys me every time. Wilson does a fine job as Burnett. He's the goof around type, but when it comes time to get serious, boy he gets serious. Hackman, as always, is great as Reigart. Hackman has made a career of playing these guys and in this one he exceeds admirably. One thing that did bug the snot of out me, was the camera. It was neat in the beginning and slowly worked its way up to obnoxious. Director John Moore has only had experience in commercials and that kind of camera movement works well in thirty second commercials, not in two hour movies.BEHIND ENEMY LINES is tired and choppy, but gee-whiz, does it ever entertain.

It is hokey; it is over-the-top exciting.  It is stirring; it is jingoistic hogwash with good market timing. It is not believable; it is a film you have to work with (i.e. don't be so literal-minded). Because it is THE big Hollywood patriotic/military roll-out for that gulf between September 11 and January 1, I wanted to like this film. --A lot. Undeniably, it is at times one of the most exhilerating films I have ever seen. (The early scene of the flyers trying to evade heat seeking missiles will not allow you to draw a breath. A certified rouser!) There are three areas where I take exception 1) The male lead is dislikable. I realize this is subjective as anything else I will say, but after establishing himself as a care-nothing smart ass early on, it is hard for us to overcome our calloused reaction, when trouble arrives, that The jerk is on his own. Of course we do care, as we would to see anyone in his situation. But with a better chosen lead, we would have cared more. (See Hitchcock on the subject of the death-kiss an unlikable lead plants on a film.) 2) The Rambo III level of incredible narrow escapes. By the 4th time I saw our boy running through a dense hailstorm of hot lead, I wanted to grab a rifle, commandeer a tank, and say Let ME show you how it's done. Hair-breadth escape is exciting once. The 4th or 5th time, you know you are being worked, and further, that everything will turn out OK, even when physics says it couldn't. Being able to relax as to the outcome of a serious drama is what series TV has always been about. 3) In the end, the navigator who has been through hell on earth retrieves his letter of resignation and wads it up as the music swells. His gesture could have been made credible with more careful writing. But coming as it does before he has had a shower, indeed before the sweat and blood are even dried on his skin, this moment rings so forced, so Hollywood. If you crave a feel-good, lightweight patriotic movie for the holiday, this might be it. 7.5 stars-- Mainly because even trash can be exciting at time.

We've seen it all before--Uncommon Valour, another Gene Hackman device comes to mind--but I thought the choice of Owen Wilson was not a bad one--he is not physically menacing like a Schwarzenegger so he draws quite a bit of empathy as a Mr. Everyman thrown into heroic circumstances.

I would have liked a little fleshing out of the politics of the conflict, but let's face it--the bad guys are really bad, the higher-up politicos are slime, and the good guys must win in the end.

He effectively resigns and hand his notice in to his commanding officer Admiral Leslie Reigert (Gene Hackman). Reigert informs him that he'll allow Burnett to stay on for a further two weeks after which time he will be relieved of duty. Following this, Burnett along with his colleague pilot Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are sent out on a holiday mission, but things take a turn for the worse when they enter an unauthorised area and find themselves under attack from Serbian militants. Their plane gets shot down, Stackhouse gets killed and Burnett finds himself on the run from the militants. Reigert does everything in his power to rescue his navigator, but his superiors refuse to authorise a rescue. With Burnett battling against impossible odds, will he survive this nightmare ordeal? One major problem this film has is that it's very weak in terms of story telling- we have a very sketchy narrative about the war in Bosnia, the genocide that occurred in Bosnia is almost completely glossed over (there are one or two flashbacks, but the film doesn't do much to emotionally engage the viewer - which is quite poor when you think about the atrocities that occurred and how much of an impact could have been made on the viewer). It's also clear that no-one is likely to accuse the writers of being objective in their story telling -there definitely seems to be a lot of bias and 'flag waving' going on from what I saw.The positives that can be drawn from this film are that, despite its misgivings, it is actually a suspenseful and engaging film. When watching this film, I was reminded of The Naked Prey which was basically one man's survival against a large number of people against all odds with limited resources. Burnett's rather elaborate escapes were clever and entertaining and therefore I did enjoy this aspect of the film (albeit from a somewhat superficial perspective). The visuals and cinematography were also impressive. In some ways, these things are great as they do make the film enjoyable and great to look at, but in some ways they also have the opposite effect by over powering the film and limiting the story - evidently I see good and bad here.As far as acting goes, Hackman was as solid and reliable as ever. Wilson was also fairly good. The ending was a little overblown and 'Hollywood' and it wasn't helped by a somewhat cheesy final line from Burnett.This is a fairly enjoyable film if you look at it as a suspenseful 'one man against the odds film' but outside of this it's a film that should have had a much stronger narrative and it should have had more of an emotive core. It's OK as far as action and suspense go, but it's weak in its story telling.

Whereas in the former outing it's Hackman who is downed behind enemy lines and being talked through his dilemma and inexperience by 'angel' Danny Glover; in 'Behind Enemy Lines' it's Owen Wilson's turn to be the shot-down schmuck, whilst Gene Hackman - now a generation older, and way beyond his action-man days - plays the navy Admiral responsible for his recovery.From Vietnam we have moved to Bosia. In the intervening years, filming has become more lavish, music and sound-scores slicker, but otherwise it's business as usual. There's no point griping about all the clich√©s; without them the movie would be half its length. Once off the carrier and over the Caucasian hills, we enter a world that is so curiously monochrome that the whole movie could have been shot in black and white. Add in plenty of mist and an overcast sky and we have the sort of otherworldly presentation that Hollywood seems to employ in order to convey mystery and strangeness. It's a place where fire-breathing dragons or gut-busting aliens could just as easily be encountered as mass-murdering commies. Once you see the style for what it is, the effect becomes wearisome and shallow.Everyone is cast to type. The Americans are clean-shaven well-intentioned simpletons - educated God-fearin' farmboys out to protect the Christian way in a world of dubious international politics too complicated to be resolved by just a good bombing. The Serbians are grubby, ugly savages, who delight in that time-honoured east-European tradition of Slaughter-Thy-Neighbour.Live with the clich√©s and the first three-quarters of the plot are a half-decent actioner. But then it quickly deteriorates into one of those utterly implausible scenarios that is hard to distinguish from a computer game. Two hovering helicopters annihilate an armoured brigade. The Serbs can't hit the broad-side of a barn. The yanks can't miss. Our airforce hero knocks out more Kalashnikov toting combatants by means of a handgun, whilst sliding along some ice on his bum, than the entire Serbian brigade. And he's not even a marksman; he's a navigator.Towards the end, the whole movie seems to be little more than a recruiting advertisement for the US navy. Which I suppose is the price you pay for having so much unrestricted access to one of its aircraft carriers. One thing that does concern me regarding this and other movies of the genre, is the readiness with which senior officers are depicted as going off the rails, breaking the law, or disobeying orders. It really does make you wonder what sort of people are working in the high-command.

They often do this while saving the world, etc. Behind Enemy Lines is different in that it's more realistic than, say, any James Bond movie.Behind Enemy Lines' follows a naval pilot (Owen Wilson - I'd like to see him in some more serious roles like this one) as he's shot down over Bosnia and forced to run from a local militia that wants him dead. Rather than following a typical, formulaic kill all the bad guys in cool ways course, Wilson instead chooses flight over fight for most of the movie, which adds much needed credibility. Sure, there may be a few instances where in all likelihood, one of the many bullets fired at him would find its target, but if you can get over that mentality (and it's way better than most over-the-top action movies in this sense), you should thoroughly enjoy Behind Enemy Lines.The movie is shot with a blue filter that gives a sort of cold, unforgiving, warzone vibe that further adds to the experience. Owen Wilson is fantastic in the downed-pilot position, with little touches of dark humor here and there that are appropriate, and other times that are grim and unsettling.The war-torn landscape adds tons of credibility to the film. Mines, tanks, guns, mass graves, wreckage, destroyed buildings, booby traps... they are all invaluable in setting the scene where our story takes place.Let us quickly examine the action of Behind Enemy Lines before this review comes to a finish. Take MI 2, first. We see Tom Cruise killing scores of guys in massive gunfights, flashy hand-to-hand combat, motorcycle/car chases, diving from helicopters, etc (this is your typical action outing). Behind Enemy Lines, instead, (minor spoilers) shows Owen Wilson's downed-pilot recovering photos taken from his plane of local atrocities (the reason the militia wants him dead), running from gunfire, traveling through minefields (including a road filled with mines on either side with trip-wires connecting them in the center, and our hero is forced to run through this, at one point tripping...), hiding in a mass grave, etc. The action is both spectacular and (mostly) *BELEIVEABLE*, and we could sure use more of that from Hollywood.This is a great action-drama flick.

The action was acceptable, and this alone justifies many a goofy plot, and poor acting, but in this case, I must say, there is no redemption to be found in a couple of decent action scenes! Sure the prospect of a lone soldier fleeing a horde of enemy forces in hostile territory, might sound okay, but certainly not when the overly patriotic element becomes the axis around which the story evolves. Admittedly the patriotic element is almost always apparent in American war movies, but it goes way to far in this movie. It is the usual story The American army takes care of its own, and no one, not even the ridiculously pacifistic Europeans are going to interfere! It think it is praiseworthy that the movie attempts to create a little attention around a forgotten war in Bosnia/herzegowina but all it really does it to let American troops advertise their supremacy and shows us the inevitable defeat of a stereotyped eastern European military group. This is by the way *not* a spoiler, because it is so perfectly obvious from the beginning what is going to happen. The acting is almost acceptable. Owen Wilson clearly tries hard to portray the soldier in terrible distress, that finds courage in the love for his country, and Hackman is almost convincing as Owen's senior officer, but both of these reasonable performances are overshadowed by the BAD plot, and terrible stereotypes we are presented with. 5/10     "},{"Title":"good movie","Date":"1 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  I thought this was a pretty good movie.

After being shot down, he becomes the target of obsessed Serbian rebels and is forced to go on the run to safety.  Meanwhile, another battle is being fought on board the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.  Burnett's commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is fighting to get him back, even at the risk of loosing his rank.First of all, I've heard that this film is loosely based on the true story of Captain Scott O'Grady, a Navy air force pilot who had been shot down over Bosnia and was forced to make his way to safety.  I do not know how closely this film follows those events and frankly I don't care.  Second, this film has an extremely high body count, even for a PG-13 action film.  The PG-13 rating was a mistake and severely I doubt that a war film could ever be this light-hearted.  Third, I'm an American.  I sure like to see the flag waving in certain scenes, but too much of that will often get in the way of story-telling, thus making anything that occurs very laughable.Owen Wilson is an extremely gifted actor and writer who is already on his way to Oscar stardom.  With his Oscar-nomination for Best Original Screenplay for last year's The Royal Tenenbaums (which he cowrote with Wes Anderson), you can see that he's obviously gifted.  But he will not get there any sooner if he keeps making films like Behind Enemy Lines.  He is extremely miscast here and he does not make a very believable action hero.As for Gene Hackman, an accomplished actor and Oscar-winner, he is what probably keeps this film on its feet and from becoming total crap.  I know that he has had his fair share of bad films, but his presence here is this films saving grace.Now the action scenes.  Many of the action scenes in Behind Enemy Lines are very chaotic and move at a rapid pace.  Camera techniques that were first pioneered in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan are put to use here, but are very poorly shot.  In fact, because of that, the action scenes come off as being very cheesy and not even realistic.As I stated above, many of the action scenes are poorly thought out and are badly edited.  One scene has Owen Wilson running through a mine field. This scene stands out in particular as being the worst because he's running through it and doesn't get a single scratch, even though there are mines exploding and that there is debris everywhere.  It's ridiculous because this makes him come off as being some sort of superhero or something.There's also another scene where Wilson is forced to switch uniforms with a dead soldier.  As he's walking away from the soldiers disguised as one their own, he removes his hat to reveal to the audience of what had just happened. PLEASE!!!I remember all the hype that been surrounding this movie about a day prior to its release on VHS and DVD.  I remember that one of the ads said that the film was a celebration of the American spirit.  Hardly.  All Behind Enemy Lines is an action film masquerading as a war film.  If anything, this film is a mere celebration of the fact that they think we are all idiots and do not have any common sense.Very poor action film.

Halfway into it I had enough, and decided that my time would be better spent having elective surgery or something like that.  So maybe it got better in the second half, but I doubt it.

Owen Wilson is miscast as an action hero.  The dialogue is inane, the action scenes unrealistic, the soundtrack annoying.  Why in the world would a guy like Hackman appear in a movie like this?

Adequate for a five-minute music promo, but TOTALLY the wrong stylistic choice for what is ostensibly a stealth-led quest for survival behind enemy lines.  The unbearably glib and showy style poorly serves the action sequences, and more critically distances us from Owen Wilson's Burnett character everything moves too quickly, and as viewers we simply do not spend enough quiet moments with him.  By extension, his growing resourcefulness in the face of near-impossible odds is glossed over.  To witness and empathise with his struggle was surely one of the main thrusts of the film, was it not?Counterbalancing Burnett's primordial struggle for survival are the `cerebral', political machinations embroiling Gene Hackman's Admiral Reigart, but it will come as no surprise to discover that this wider angle is equally botched.  The warning repeatedly given to Reigart is stark any attempt to intervene and rescue Burnett risks severely undermining an already brittle peace process.  But beyond such rhetoric, the precise implications of US intervention are not examined.  The media's role in the Balkans conflict is also hinted at, but disappointingly we get no intelligent examination of its potentially inflammatory impact.   Historical and political elusiveness feels particularly disingenuous here, since the fate of Burnett, and by consequence the driving force of the narrative, is directly anchored in the political gamesmanship of the US, UN and Balkan states.  BEHIND ENEMY LINES is not a good stand-alone action film, and it certainly has nothing intelligent to say about the Balkans conflict and the external peacekeeping mission. Avoid.

Having been to Bosnia I am fully aware that it is rock solid to try and work out who did what to who and who was the worst bad guy out there. But Hollywood has decided that the Serbs are the bad ones and portray them as ruthless killers with a very weak motive.The story is very simplistic, trying to prove itself by bringing the Serbs to justice via the escaping pilot. He runs, they chase.What I liked There was signs of suspense in parts, and the scenery was nice. At times (the ejection scene) there was an attempt to film things in detail which I liked.What I didnt like The out of place music that just ruined the film. The ability of the navigator, who was trying to escape, to dodge countless number of bullets and mine shrapnel. Not to mention his ability to not be affected by the weather at all, despite not eating at all. The very Corny america is great plot.

But my 29-year-old son, a pilot and photographer, loves this film, and last night with me was perhaps his 3rd or 4th viewing and it still excites him. Because he doesn't care so much that it is a dumb movie. It has planes flying, missles chasing them, slow-motion shots of an enemy getting blown away, thrilling sound effects, great bass in the subwoofer during explosions, interesting camera work, and the good guys prevail in the end. For my son, this film is a 10. For me, it is probably a 3 for story and believability, and maybe a 9 for action and sound.  So a real rating of 5 to 7 by most of us would be about right.The setting is Bosnia, although it was filmed in Slovakia. Pilots are photographing a mass grave and other war crimes when a couple of clever missles finally get to them (I didn't realize those missles had so much fuel!!), they eject, one survives, and the chase is on to see if he can both retrieve the hard drive with the photos (in the ejection seat), evade the enemy firepower, and get to a safe zone for a rescue. The climactic scene is a great battle among enemy ground troops with lots of guns and tanks, and three friendly helicopters with lots of guns and launch missles.Owen Wilson of crooked nose and deviated septum fame is the star, the pilot who survives against all odds and 20 million rounds of gunfire at point-blank range. Gene Hackman is the carrier commander who takes almost all of the 100 minutes of the movie to do the right thing and rescue his man against orders, even though it means losing his command.

I actually enjoyed this movie. This movie is basically about a Lt. Pilot named Burnett (Owen Wilson) where he's about to be honarably discharged in 20 days. It takes place in a carrier in the ardiatic sea supposedly in the war with the Serbs. Burnetts Gerneral Reigart (Gene Hackman) dosn't like the idea of Burnett leaving so he sends him on a Holiday Recon misson to p**s him off. Burnett and his partner Stackhouse end up getting lost in Bosnian territory but find Serb soldiers in a demilitarized zone. Burnett takes pictures of the soldiers and mass graves of muslims whom the serbs massacared. The serbian soldiers shot down the plane and all heck breaks loss. With Burnett despartely running from the serbian army, he'll encounter trip mines, muslim rebels, rough terrain, mass graves. No one can help him from the carrier because the general is being outruled by the NATO admiral. Burnett is then on his own for one wild ride.Pros Good acting by almost all the cast. It had a good story (i don't know if the story stayed true to the real Burnett who acutally was in the conflict). Realsim on politcal correctness. Good cinematography where it made you feel like you where in this heart-pumping and exciting conflict. I loved the terrain and it's view of Slovakia. Shooting in Bosnia whoulda been too dangerous. I liked how it kept somewhat to realism because they never portrayed this pilot as Rambo gunning down 50 people. The pilot had to run, not gun. The Scene where the Jet is trying to out manuever the Sam missles is a spectaulur site.Cons The ending seemed anti-climatic and way too unbelieveable. Never really explained the conflict in bosnia or the US's stance. Acition was decent but nothing spectacular.Overall This is a decent action flick worth a rent on DVD. It's good a likeable where (owen wilson, whom is a likeable guy) hes not too handsome, not too buff, not too anything. Not really worth buying unless your a big fan of owen wilson or just enjoyed the action in this movie.

Just regular blokes doing their day-job and not the square-jawed all-American hero types at all. Which is why I though that Owen Wilson was actually very well cast in this role. He was so, well &#150; ordinary!!! The movie itself is standard Hollywood action fare. Pretty predictable stuff really, but fairly entertaining escapism nonetheless. As usual the bad guys (in this case the Serbs) are portrayed as one-dimensional thugs and all of them are lousy shots with a gun. Another reviewer on this page has said that he hasn't seen any action movie hero dodge as many bullets and rockets since Rambo back in the &#145;80s, and that just about sums it up perfectly. And the American cause is (quite naturally because this is Hollywood) a noble one. The film has its share of powerful scenes &#150; the F18 shoot-down scene and Wilson's discovery of the mass grave in the forest in particular. But it also has its share of silliness too, the rescue scene in particular being implausibly over-the-top, incorporating as it does a mixture of Rambo-style bullet-dodging, 007-style cliff-leaping stunt work, and the inability of several BMP armored vehicles and massed Serb gunmen to shoot down (or even hit) three hovering American helicopters at very close range.The supposedly `clever' fast-zoom and CGI camera work is also headache-inducing at times, and really should have been toned down a bit. Unfortunately, this style of filming seems to be becoming increasingly fashionable and is often done just for the sake of it. And this film is no exception.Overall I'd rate this movie as a good 6 out of 10. I won't be rushing out to add the DVD to my collection, but I might watch it again if and when it appears on satellite TV.

After all, was I not made to sit for two hours watching a work so devoid of passion, truth and entertainment value? The film is predictable down to the very last detail. It is a work processed straight out of the Hollywood Money Making Machine with no touch of humanity anywhere to be found. I think it would be more appropriately titled Run Owen, Run! (Brought to you by Coca-Cola, Chevrolet and Ice Cube). If you've seen the film you know exactly what I'm talking about.If you must know, the plot involves Owen Wilson as Chris Burnett, a Navy lieutenant running away from his Serbian foes. Gene Hackman is Admiral Reigart, the one trying to pick Burnett up and bring him back home. The trouble is, a peace treaty was recently signed between America and those chasing Burnett, so if Admiral Reigart dares and goes after him, his entire command is at stake. War is a complex subject, and a good war film should never be able to be summarized in three sentences. But this isn't a good war film, and I just did it, didn't I?I probably don't need to tell you how unrealistic this whole affair is. Am I supposed to believe that with an entire section of the Serbian army on his tail, Burnett gets out completely unscathed? Are these guys really such bad shots that out of all of them, not one can even hit Burnett in the leg? With the carelessness Burnett shows, he's pretty damn lucky that Hollywood magic can pull him out of a jam whenever he needs. I say Burnett is careless, let me elaborate. If I were in his position, and had a chance to escape by blending in with the opponent, there is no way I would take off a ski mask that was concealing my identity (even if I did get rewarded by hearing that triumphant music in the background).I am also sick of directors coming into Hollywood, placing a bunch of radical camera tricks in their film and thinking that makes them Orson Welles. POV, 360 degree rotation, Slow-Motion (one of the inventions the film world would be a better place without), lightning-quick montages, it's all here, and ALL the time. Director John Moore never gives it a rest. English should be a required course in film school so directors can forget about the lenses and the camera speeds for at least a minute and focus on the point they're trying to get across.Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman do their worst in this film. Owen Wilson is a generally good actor who somehow lets all his acting skills go to waste and create a completely bland, stupid character. And Gene Hackman? It would be a huge understatement to call him a fantastic actor who's had some classic performances, but he is scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. I can safely say that this is one of the worst performances of his fruitful career, and I am in shock that such a smart actor as him would choose such an empty project. However, Gene Hackman at his worst is better than Ben Affleck trying his hardest. The one reason Behind Enemy Lines is on a level slightly above dreck like Pearl Harbor is because it is graced with his presence.Behind Enemy Lines is the kind of film built to suck in money, and maybe grab a few awards along the way. Unfortunately, this is becoming the norm for war movies these days, but trust me, people aren't being fooled. If you want a surge of post 9/11 patriotism or inspiration, save your nine bucks and rent something with real emotion like Casablanca or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington; something that aims to do more than nab the top spot at the weekend box office.

Referring to the Balkans, Burnett adds, I certainly didn't want to be a cop in a neighborhood nobody cares about. Predictably, Lt. Burnett's attitude takes a 180 degree whirl after he finds himself up to his neck in the worst disaster of his life with an army of murderous, trigger-happy Serbs closing in for the kill.Surprisingly, the Pentagon approved the improbable David (Natural Born Killers) Veloz and Zac (Last Action Hero) Penn screenplay based on an original story by Jim & Jack Thomas of Executive Decision and Predator 2. Basically, Behind Enemy Lines qualifies as a patriotic, flag-waving recruiting exercise for the U.S. Navy. Filmed aboard the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, this slickly produced but thoroughly derivative airborne actioneer takes advantage of its authentic setting. While our guys are flying a reconnaissance mission, Burnett activates their fancy new digital camera. Stackhouse agrees to cruise over a no-fly zone. Incredibly, our heroes catch Serbian troops on camera in the act of burying Muslim victims in a mass grave. Evil Serb Commander Lokar (Olek Krupa) orders his diabolical henchman Sasha (Vladimir Mashkov of 15 Minutes) to fire their SAM missiles. In the most adrenalin-laced episode, a SAM missile blows their jet apart, but Stackhouse and Burnett catapult to safety. Stackhouse injures his leg on the way down, so Burnett hoofs it off to a high place to radio the ship. No sooner has Burnett left Stackhouse than the entire Serbian Army encircles him. Wicked Sasha shoots Stackhouse execution-style in the back of the head at point blank range. Afterward, Sasha embarks on his relentless pursuit of Burnett. Meanwhile, back on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, Admiral Reigart finds his hands tied by a meddlesome NATO superior Admiral Piquet (Joaquim de Almedia of Desperado) who refuses to let him rescue Burnett. Piquet worries more about the fragile cease-fire and a treaty due to take effect in a couple of days than about Burnett's survival. Behind Enemy Lines passes muster on a wing and a prayer. War movie aficionados should find it serviceable despite its clich√©s and stereotypes.

I guess it shows how bad directing can ruin the tasteful use of music. There were too many points where the music was trying to force the emotional response out of the audience, instead of  complementing the underlying emotion of the scene. Also there were a number of big dramatic hits in the soundtrack that were utterly unjustified as what they were underscoring was either not worthy of a big dramatic revelation or was so predictable that when the revelation did come, the music made it seem like a joke.So, all in all, if  you want a good lesson in how to make a bad movie, then I recommend this film.

The story concerns Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson, with hair that's pretty long even by Navy aviator standards), an F-18 jockey on the USS Carl Vinson off the Bosnian coast.  He wants to fight a war, to punch a Nazi in the face, and is frustrated by the NATO leash, and the lack of a real war to fight (seems almost quaint now, doesn't it?).  He gets shot down when he strays off course during a photo recon, and has to dodge marauding Serb forces to survive while the allies try, with varying levels of enthusiasm, to rescue him.Naturally, there is a dual conflict here while Wilson is battling unshaven war criminals, his warhorse CO dukes it out with NATO brass, in the form of a scowling Spanish naval officer, less concerned about the downed pilot than the fate of the Cincinnati Accords (a deft play on the real-life Dayton Accords, and a reference, perhaps, to Cincinnatus, a philosopher who urged civil control of military forces).  As Rear Adm. Riegert, Gene Hackman cuts a familiar figure in Navy khaki.  Marine veteran Hackman carries with him a certain martial authority, and he is able to use it without conscious effort.  Here, his battle-weary face reveals more of his character than his battle-weary dialogue.  Joaquim de Almeida does what he can with the NATO officer; to his credit, he maintains credibility, even while delivering the inevitable speech about how little Wilson matters next to the prospect of peace.  While this is a classic war-movie boo-hiss moment, de Almeida lends it such sincerity that you think, gee whiz, the guy's kinda got a point. As Burnett, Owen Wilson is fine, though the part isn't too far removed from the breezy, callow types he has played in the past (also, for a downed pilot on the run, he doesn't sneak around very much; at times he looks like a jogger who's gotten a bit lost).The movie is at its best as a portrait of the mutagenic madness of the Yugoslav civil war, and wisely, the movie avoids a lot of speechifying on the subject.  It prefers to paint a visual picture using images and vignettes, which are striking enough to raise the movie above its modest action-flick ambitions.  The color scheme on the ground is all black mud and shattered concrete pallor even the snow is gray.  The landscape (the Slovak Republic, standing in for southern Bosnia) is shown with all the weirdness that makes this the most sadly surreal of modern wars refugees sipping Coke and hiding out in strip malls, while hard-faced men in track suits prowl among blasted religious statuary, and plant trees atop mass graves.  In one of the movie's most poignant moments, Wilson watches as a man and a little girl seem to be playing a sort of odd skipping game, and when we see what they're doing and why, it is quietly devastating.The photography is impressive as well the scenes of whiz-bang American technology are shown in frenetic stop-motion and fast-motion, and by contrast, there is a nifty slow-mo shot of the effects of a land mine, which, in a more self-indulgent movie, we would have seen several times in a Matrix-style rotating pan.  Here, first-time director John Moore plays it like a ballet.  On the speed side of things, we get a cool scene where Wilson's F-18 engages in a lethal pas de deux with a pair of streaking Serbian SAMs while warning lights flash all around.Unfortunately, the movie starts to shudder near the end.  We get characters and situations that might develop into something promising, but don't. There is a half-hearted half-plot involving evidence of genocide that is flip and unconvincing.  Much like Three Kings, Behind Enemy Lines underplays its strengths and gambles its credibility on a big corny climactic action scene.  Hackman and a Marine Recon platoon (using the wrong machine guns, dammit, Hollywood!) throw together what MEUSOC officers like to call a hasty TRAP, involving far too much footage of Wilson sprinting across an open field while half a company of Serb mech infantry unloads behind him.  The scene is well filmed, and I have nothing against a little GI triumphalism, indeed it's one of my very favorite things it's just a shame to see a movie start so well and finish so cheaply.  Behind Enemy Lines is not a bad movie (except for that lousy direct-to-video title; too bad Rules of Engagement was already taken).  But it isn't quite the surprise gem it could have been.

In fact the film has a minimalist style, preferring to keep things low key, as a sole man - played by Owen Wilson - must try and make it to safe ground before the stereotypical bad guys shoot him dead. BEHIND ENEMY LINES may not be a work of art, but as an action film it exceeds all of our expectations. The pacing never flags for a second and the action is plentiful and exciting.The highlight of the movie is undoubtedly the super-impressive airborne chase between our heroes in their Navy jet and two surface-to-air missiles sent to destroy it. Utilising modern digital effects, this air battle is portrayed as never before and extremely entertaining. From then on, the rest of the action is surface-based and concentrates on massive amounts of gunfire, explosions, tanks and even a sniper or two sent to obliterate our American hero before he can escape. Critics complain about the clich√©d nature of the plot and the patriotic flag-waving from the US, but when the action is this good such trappings don't really matter. Watch out for an ambush in a minefield which is also a highlight of the movie.Stylistically, director John Moore is one of those MTV graduates desperate to pack the movie with as many camera styles, pans, tricks, sweeps and spins as possible. The widely contrasting methods of filming do become a little too frenetic and overwhelming but on a whole they're adequate and add to the realistic feel of the action. Owen Wilson has now matured from lame comedy and bad acting in THE HAUNTING into becoming an adequate leading man and the viewer gets to engage with his good-natured character as he narrowly avoids the enemy time after time. Gene Hackman is there for name value as a gruff admiral back at the base, who barks orders like there's no tomorrow and eventually proves to be a good chap after all (I told you this was clich√©d). Despite whatever shortcomings, BEHIND ENEMY LINES is a fine piece of light-hearted cinema, an old-fashioned adventure with little or no moralising to get in the way. Shallow but very entertaining.

A young, gauche curate was given an egg for breakfast by the vicar's wife which was not just no fresh, it was unmistakably off. But when asked how his egg was, the curate was mortified that he should appear rude if he told her the truth, so 'it's good in parts', he told the vicar's wife. So is Behind Enemy Lines. Unfortunately, those parts which don't stink do not do enough to rescue this film. Were they to do so, it might well have been far better than similar fare, but sadly - and understandably, being produced on American cash - Beyond Enemy Lines chose to follow the formula to the nth degree it has a 'happy ending' in which our hero naval jet navigator Owen Wilson is saved at the last minute and returned to his ship in one piece. I'm obliged to put quote marks around the phrase 'happy ending' because given the number of 'enemy' killed to enable Wilson's rescue, that ending is not all that happy for some. And when will Hollywood accept that one of 'their boys' is not necessarily one of 'our boys' in that we don't get too dewy-eyed when an American is saved. In my case a Brit perhaps (although personally the schmaltz always involved in that kind of adventure leaves this Brit cold). There are some good things in Beyond Enemy Lines the special effects, the cinematography, the editing, much of the acting is the good side of average. On the minus side, of course, are aspects of the plot Wilson manages to get from one spot to another with remarkable ease, whether it is from the mountains into an abandoned and mined lowland factory site, back into the woods, then back into the mountains. The chap (in a tracksuit, why no uniform?) who is hunting him down also has the most remarkable luck in finding young Wilson again and again. And exactly how, in the heat and anarchy of battle, did Wilson manage to undress and swap uniforms with a corpse, giving the film its plot twist when the rescue mission is called off because the Serbs claim Wilson has been killed? One interesting potential theme is completely thrown away, and had it been developed far more might have redeemed the film somewhat Gene Hackman is ordered by his superior to call of the rescue of Wilson so that peace negotiations are not jeopardised. In essence, one life is to be sacrificed for the very real possibility of saving thousands, as the superior, not unreasonably, points out to Hackman. Such tragic dilemmas surely face commanders all too often. But dammit, this isn't the real world, this is a Hollywood adventure, and Hackman sticks two figures up to authority and rescues his boy anyway, even though doing so ends his career when as a result he is relieved of his command. Perhaps my initial judgment of 'curate's egg' is a little harsh given that when measured against films of this kind, Beyond Enemy Lines does rather better than some of the rubbish I've sat through, most recently The Day After Tomorrow which I couldn't even finish watching after it took a left turn down Schmaltz Alley halfway through and was never going to come back. And though I didn't see the second half of that film, I just knew Dennis Quaid was going to rescue his son even while thousands of other were dying horrible deaths. But back to John Moore's effort I should like to see him make similar films away from the pressure to follow a formula, because whatever else this film did or did not deliver, it is, at least, certain that Moore has what it takes.

I was really impressed with the scene where Burnett hid himself in the grave pit under the corpse to evade the Serbians (or Croatians? Can't remember). Everyone on his team knows where he is. They can see that the gunmen are passing by him when he is clearly under their feet. But even they don't know quite if he's alive or not. Nothing is sure until the sigh of relief when he appears alive under the dead man. It's shocking and relieving at the same time.Not to mention, this is the first drama I've ever seen Owen Wilson do. I never really took him seriously as an actor, but after watching Cars, I was interested. Watching this, I noticed that he's good at making expressions. He knows when to look angry, when to look unsure, when to look smitten, and when to look cool. He's actually quite good at drama. Wonder why he stopped, hmm.However, this film could have been equal to Platoon had it had a better script and cinematography. I didn't mind the camera shaking so much, but honestly, the monotonous and unchanging lighting kind of made the situations and moods in the film less enjoyable. And the script! The script was really what made it a disappointment. It went too fast and it was just ... unmoving. It's as if they tried to make this so clear that they just spilled it all out so there's nothing left to think about.And ugh, the soundtrack! They played heavy metal rock at all the wrong moments (as if they're were any other type of music.)Overall, this film was very entertaining and action-packed. If only the script was a lot better ...

Now you are flying Mach 3 trying to get away from 2 SAM's (GTAM'S) and they are right behind you at Mach 3.2 LMAO! Thats intense right there.And thats just the 1st part of the movie.

Simple; it's much like a film version of the type of tough-guy, military themed comic books popular when I was growing up in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It has excitement, drama, pathos and demonstrates true human weaknesses and strengths within the confines of its cartoon-like world. The special effects are very well done, and the surround sound mix is excellent. So, it's a simplistic, unrealistic action flick that does offer two hours of entertainment. While the young and impressionable may be seduced by its two-dimensional propaganda, others should see it for what it is, a Hollywood fantasy film. Nothing more, nothing less.

I don't like war movies full of fake heroism and unrealistic situations, with the only intent to be 'cheap' entertainment. And that's exactly where this movie misses its target by a mile or two... This is not only a movie that doesn't show much of what happened during the civil war in Yugoslavia in the 1990's, it also never tries to be anything else but entertainment for the popcorn munching brain dead people who don't know anything about history and don't care about accuracy and realism.It has to be said, this could have been a good movie with an exiting story line. A reconnaissance plane of the US Navy has been shot down over enemy territory after it has taken pictures of mass graves. Now the pilot and his navigator have to try to stay out of the hands of the enemy (in this case the Serbs) and make it to the save part of the country. One of them, the pilot, is wounded and stays behind while the other one, the navigator, will try to call for help. The Serbs find the wounded pilot, execute him and start chasing the navigator... This would have been good on its own, but of course they had to add some extra dramatic, though far from realistic things to the story. Just to give you an example The admiral of the ship, on which the men were stationed, will personally lead the rescue mission, but is countered by the NATO-allies. But don't be afraid, our dear admiral will rescue the navigator personally...I have to admit that not everything in this movie was bad. Some action scenes were certainly more than just worth a watch. And of course it's also a good thing that it shows some of the atrocities committed by the Serbs. But overall this movie really annoyed me too much to make me enjoy it. The fact that an entire army of Serbs can't catch one man, that the admiral himself will fly to the rescue zone, that the navigator doesn't jump into the helicopter right away, but first returns, under a gigantic barrage of enemy fire, to the crash site because he wants to recover the photographs... really made me dislike this movie.This is just some cheap entertainment, a fictional story that has been loosely based on some actual facts. It has some good action scenes, but if you are looking for a realistic movie on the Yugoslavian civil war, than you'll have to look somewhere else. That's why I give it a 5.5/10.

The character he portrayed was weak; he was a slow decision maker, morally lacking in resolve (what's right and how to accomplish that).

Apparently director John Moore believes that grainy, textured cinematography, shaky camera shots, random, music-video style cuts, and interminable slow-mo sequences of achingly dramatic moments are supposed to cover up a hackneyed, totally implausible scenario.The film is most off-putting in its portrayal of the function of the US Navy. Sure, movies are meant to be fantastical, and action movies in particular tend to be unrealistic. But the audience for war movies also tends to bring some knowledge of how the US military functions. You don't have to watch the news or read military histories to know that 'Behind Enemy Lines' bears no realistic resemblance whatsoever to the function of a USN aircraft carrier.The film starts off, preposterously enough, with Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) mouthing off at his commanding officer, Admiral Reigart (Hackman), about how ineffective their mission (meant to resemble the recent genocidal conflicts in eastern Europe)is and how he intends to resign.Far cry from Top Gun, let me tell you. Anyone who knows anything about Navy fighter jet pilots can tell you that such a scenario is utterly impossible. There are few jobs in the military more sought after or demanding than that of a naval aviator. Most people can't really grip how incredibly difficult and dangerous it is to land a jet on an aircraft carrier--particularly at night. These men are not the cocky flyboys of old--they are highly trained, highly motivated, and well-disciplined, and they are also always at risk of losing their jobs. Navy pilots--or most other military personnel, for that matter--don't lecture their commanding officers about politics. They follow the chain of command. The training they go through is as the most exhaustive and thorough in the US Military, because their responsibilities are so huge. No man who could ever consider doing what Lt. Burnett does--over and over again--would ever make it through the battery of psych. evaluations these guys have to pass to get into the cockpit of a fighter. The men who do survive the training are True Believers. If, in some strange world, a Navy pilot did decide to vent his dissatisfaction to a superior, his ass would be out of the flight rotation instantaneously. There are literally hundreds of young pilots salivating to get a chance to fly jets, so the military has no need to risk lives or the millions of dollars it costs to replace a fighter jet on anyone who thinks their personal politics justify insubordination. Orders are orders, and men who seem uncomfortable with following them get sacked, not placated. Instead, our guy Burnett is up the next day, ready to go screw up and create an international incident.Burnett, of course--cocky, rebellious flyboy that he is--decides to disobey direct orders and steer into a no-fly zone. We're being asked to believe that a Navy pilot would willingly violate international law on a whim, potentially screwing up peace negotiations or even sending his country to war. Yeah, right.The plane crashes, of course, and Burnett's much more likable pilot (Gabriel Macht) gets killed by the ambiguous eastern Europeans, who then dispatch their stereotypical merciless contract killer, a creepy-looking guy in soccer warm-ups, to play the stereotypical Fearsome Bad Guy stalking Burnett.We're then told to believe that the American military would abandon poor Chris to his imminent fate rather than spoil the 'peacemaking process.' Yeah, right--that's the good ole USA, ditching its soldiers when they're in trouble (not that he doesn't deserve it). No, only rough-n-tuff old-school Navy guys like Admiral Reigart really know what it takes to be a patriot. This man, who is able to run his carrier based on the absolute loyalty of his crew and their adherence to the chain of command, decides to say 'to hell with orders' to save the ass of a guy who defied a direct order--from the Admiral himself. Yup. This sort of thing happens every day in the USN, I'm sure.'Behind Enemy Lines' came out only a few weeks after 'Black Hawk Down,' and while that film also deviates in certain aspects from total realism and accuracy, its representation of military life is much more faithful to the truth, and the comparison of the two reveals just how ludicrous 'Behind Enemy Lines' actually is. Only rent or buy this film for comedic purposes. It is easily among the worst war movies in recent memory.

I have seen this movie several times, but never with the eye that I have now. If I were to put a theme to this movie, it would be `No matter how we try, there will never be world peace.'One thing that helps me established this was how Moore continued showing the angel on a cliff in the middle of nowhere. For example, when Burnett and Stackhouse where getting ready to crash they nipped the angel on the wing. In addition, when Burnett was coming down on the parachute he went by the angel, and had a mid-shot view of the statue. Moore wanted to show that there is no peace in the world, as we continue to put ourselves in situations. All the scenes that involved the statue displayed a variety of reasons why we cannot be at peace in our country and the world.Another key example was as he headed towards there was a long shot of the same angel which was where his ejection seat had landed. When he arrived back at the site there was a long shot showing how far he was really away from the ejection seat that held the film.The key about war movies or those that deal with soldiers is that you must look for the key. For example, in Full Metal Jacket directed by Stanley Kubrick you may recall the photo of Louis Armstrong. When we think war, we think blues because the whole idea is so depressing.  So the connection of a jazz great with this entire scene is key to the connection of war and blues. This brought me to the conclusion about the angel, and how relevance it was to the theme. John Moore did an excellent job at directing and illustrating the theme in Behind Enemy Lines.

American policy is to never, never, never pass command of US troops to non-US officers.  Thus, the actions of the French Admiral would be impossible in reality.2.  Universal military doctrine is Leave no one behind.  There is no way that a US Rear Admiral would allow anyone to tell him not to move heaven and earth to bring his man home, dead or alive.3.  Hackman is too old to be a Rear Admiral.  He looks about 60, maybe 65. This means he would have had to be passed over at least a dozen times, which also means he would not have command of a battle group.4.  As is usual with war movies, there are not anywhere near enough people in the scenes aboard ship or where decisions are made.  The people in the Combat Command Center, about 10, would probably be just enough to be his staff.  Where are the Commanders, Lt. Commanders, etc.? Instead, we have one of each.  It's as if we have his own private group.5.  Where is the line to the Pentagon?  In a situation like this, there would be close coordination with the Pentagon, if not the White House.6.  A Rear Admiral going on a rescue mission?  Please.  One of the things about elite forces, of all nations, is that they are highly trained TOGETHER to perform a mission.  No one is allowed to insert new people into the unit on the fly for a mission, especially someone of flag rank.  A leader's place in a situation like this is in the CCC, running the show.  These missions are typically conducted with senior enlisted personnel running the show.7.  To those who say the US is the bad guys, I say, anything we have to do to bring our man back is justified.

The only exception in this film goes to Joaquim de Almeida who is given a thankless role as an admiral trying to hold together a fragile peace process that is put in danger by owen wilson being shot down and gene hackmans attempts to rescue him. While im not trying to bash these two actor whom I have great respect for, the script really gives them nothing to do except go on autopilot in an action film.Another problem with the film is the rating. In my opinion it isnt fair to any serious conflict to make a film about it and rate it PG13. The point of violence in war movies is to show just how brutal it is and that isnt reached with a PG13 rating.Hollywood likes to take serious issues and turn them into popcorn ficks. Another good example is a film like Tears of the Sun which had more depth but never fleshed out its character very well.  One must wonder how good this film could have been in light of a superior example being Black Hawk Down. Despite all the negative qualities of the film, there are some redeeming aspects of it.As an action film, this film works pretty good. It has an amazing sequence where a jet tries to evade an incoming missile.  Another great sequence is one were some soldiers activate a series of mines. These are all capped by the final shootout atop a mountain clifftop. It takes a great deal of suspension of disbelief to believe that so many men could miss owen wilson but as the audience, by this point in the film you have to go along with it for the simple entertainment value.All in all, we have an entertaining action film that could have been so much more if a director like oliver stone had become involved.In the end though, see this film for yourself "},{"Title":"this film reminds me how great it is being American","Date":"8 April 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  Amazing film, I watched it over and over when I first bought it on DVD.

From then on there is a struggle between the military and the peacekeepers as to how to go about getting the pilots back.One theme, or central insight, that can be seen from this movie is how all branches of the United States military come together as a family when one of their own is in danger.  This makes the audience feel more involved as well because we feel we are riding along with the military.Gene Hackman acts as Admiral Leslie Reigart in the film.  As good of an actor as Hackman is, I felt that his role in the film was too constrained. For an Admiral, they did not give him much power or control.  Owen Wilson stars as Chris Burnett, one of the pilots that was shot down.  With only seeing Wilson in comedies, I felt that he did a great job in playing the role as a fighter pilot.One scene that supports the theme mentioned is when Christmas dinner is being held.  This scene gives us a family atmosphere among the military. Although it may seem boring, the soldiers are eating with their new family members, since they cannot be with their actual families.Another scene that I found touching was when the crew fear that both pilots are dead.  Nothing but silence fills the room.  All of a sudden, one of the soldiers punches a hole in the wall and screams that they did nothing to save them.  Afterwards, silence again fills the room as the rest of the crew, including Hackman, are overcome with the fear of death to their pilots.Although not nearly as elaborately done by far, one can liken the film to something like `Saving Private Ryan.'  They share the same principle of getting one of their own out of harms way.  `Saving Private Ryan' was more combative and more gruesome with the ground war scenes.  `Behind Enemy Lines' did everything by aerial assaults.Music helps set the mood and tempo of the movie.  I enjoyed some of the freeze framing aspects of the movie when the pilots are about to get hit by the gunfire.  Everything freezes before impact and you can hear the pilots breathing and see the fear in their eyes.They also did a good job with some different angles.  I like the aerial shot of the Americans and the Bosnians when they are engaged in battle. They also have a good tilted shot of Hackman with his ship and it's men behind him.  This supports the family theme as Hackman looks like the father, and the men look like his children.Overall I really enjoyed watching this film.  After watching it a second time, you come to realize it's just the same cat and mouse chase movie. Seeing the closeness of the military units gives the audience some peace of mind, however that they would do anything for one another. "},{"Title":"Saving Private Burnett.","Date":"30 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  Behind Enemy Lines is a classic example of a story that was told in order to be made into a neatly packaged action film. Owen Wilson plays the part of Lt. Chris Burnett, a fighter pilot in the Navy who, after seven years of service, has yet to see a single day of the kind of thing that he has been trained for. In a memorable scene with his superior, Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman), Burnett defiantly states that he joined the military to be a fighter pilot, not a cop, especially not a cop walking a beat that no one cares about. This scene sets up all the cutesy emotional hoo-hah during the rest of the film as Reigart acts like saving Brunett is just as important as if Burnett was his own son. I like that the old American adage of never leaving a man behind is so strictly defended, but it's done by turning Reigart into a sort of reluctant but total father figure, the same way that Detective Gerard was at the end of The Fugitive. But in that movie it was okay because it didn't pervade the entire film, and Gerard had reasons developed throughout the story for acting that way towards Kimble.Burnett and his pilot, curiously named Stackhouse, are flying a typical mission, which is more of a flying exercise than a recon mission, when they spot some unusual activity on their radar and, both bored out of their skulls at the routine of their time in the Navy, decide to fly over it and test out their `shiny new digital camera.' When they fly over, they capture a lot of pictures of Serbs engaged in illegal military activity, in violation with a recently established peace treaty. I am not an expert in political matters, because most of the time I prefer to lose myself in the world of movies than watch the news, but something tells me that there are a few countries that are not going to be entirely thrilled with the way they're portrayed in this film, such as Bosnia and Serbia and France, given the antagonistic Admiral Piquet, played by Joaquim de Almeida.Speaking of Joaquim de Almeida, you may remember him from his role as Bucho in Desperado, where he played an evil mob boss in Mexico, in charge of a lot of startlingly moronic henchmen, the stupidity and incompetence of whom is only matched by the Serbians chasing after Burnett for the majority of this film. Roger Ebert mentions that Burnett is a guy begging to get shot and the Serbs are a lot of guys who couldn't hit the side of a Serbian barn. Pretty good observation, since there are numerous scenes in the film where Burnett is in a wide open space literally being shot at by every enemy soldier that ever shows up on screen in the film, and doesn't even get a scratch. Makes you wonder if they've ever shot a gun before.There is one man who asks to be the only one allowed to go after Burnett, obviously hungry for killing since he's an evil Serb, and then can't hit Burnett even when he's sitting still on a concrete outcropping and the sniper has a perfectly clear shot. Back on the ship, meanwhile, Reigart is struggling to get permission to send a rescue mission out to pick him up, but in probably the only interesting part of the film that is not superficial action, he is unable to because even though they proved that the Serbs were involved in illegal activity, Burnett and Stackhouse also violated their mission course and so shouldn't have been there in the first place. Passing over the border into Serbia could cause some serious warfare that could potentially cause a lot more killing than just of Stackhouse and Burnett. This is an interesting dilemma that Reigart must face, and the way he gets through this and on to the obligatory happy ending where everyone flies off happily ever after into the sunset is probably the only thing in the film that's not completely predictable.(spoilers) As far as an straight up action film, Behind Enemy Lines succeeds. There is plenty of fast action and lots of explosions and shooting and killing and a thrilling plane sequence near the beginning where Burnett and Stackhouse suddenly find themselves trying to evade two heat seeking missiles, but this is about as far as the movie goes. There is tons of sappy crap, like when Burnett is sleeping in the woods and hears Stackhouse whisper his name in a dream, waking him up just in time to flee from the sniper and thereby saving his life from the grave, and even worse than that, there is a slow motion sequence late in the film where Burnett is facing the helicopters finally there to pick him up, but shakes his head no and runs back to retrieve the digital pictures so that Stackhouse would not have died in vain.It was a smart thing to do not to have had Stackhouse die for nothing, but having Burnett do it smack in the middle of a hail of gunfire from both sides (evidently the Serbs can't hit hovering helicopters, either, even at close range) was just too much. The end of the film is a massive copout, ending with nice slow motion shots of each character as we're given text explaining what they all do after the end of the movie, pretending that this was based on real events. This is the weakest way that action movies can end, and is only used when there is a good reason to know what the characters did after the movie but no good reason to show it, if it's a cheesy comedy and these last lines just provide one more cheesy laugh, or if there is just not enough money to film it. Either way, in this film it is just done so that they can tell us what we already know, such as that Burnett stayed in the Navy and Admiral Reigart did, indeed, lose his command for his decision to go after Burnett behind enemy lines.It surprises me that this movie is not a Jerry Bruckheimer production in the sense that all the goofy sentimental crap of a Bruckheimer film has been thrown in, such as Burnett hearing his dead pilot whisper his name in a dream just in time to save his life, and all the fast-paced, sugar-coated action, but on the other hand, there is no cheeseball romance thrown into the movie to dumb it down, and that is one of the few things that we can be thankful for. The imaginary satellite that allows Reigart and his crew to watch as the enemy soldiers approach Burnett's motionless body was interesting in that they are all watching this but don't have a clue how they can be that close and not see him, but it cancels itself out because it is so fake that it's almost funny. Even if there were satellites that could show what is happening with that much detail, there's no way it could stay in one place long enough to create a perfectly still image like that. Interesting to watch, but like the rest of the movie, there's really not much going on underneath.

Usual rock music over the plane-taking-off sequence.  Y'know.  Yawn.It's virtues?  Well, it's fun.  Not sure that's necessarily a good thing in a war film with a subplot about mass-murder of civilians.  Hackman is Hackman, hurrah.  It's quite stirring, probably.It's faults?  Hm.  There are many, but here are my two favourites.1. It appears to propound the questionable and dangerous philosophy that it's important to rescue a pilot, even if it restarts a war in which thousands of civilians will die - and worse, that anybody who says different is a coward or a bureaucrat.2. And this is a biggy.  When Wilson finds the huge stack of bodies (which is quite a good scene in action-movie terms, even if we've seen it before), we see a flashback to a bunch of 'Evil Serbs' massacring civilians.  This ought hardly be controversial - after all, it's a matter of record that such crimes were committed by Serb soldiers.However, the film shows us Croat Paramilitaries doing the killing and appears to assume that we will just see them as Serbs because they're committing a crime.  This 'flashback' footage is ripped out of Peter Antonijevic's conspicuously superior film, 'Savior', and I find this kind of 'shorthand' rather worrying.  True, most people who have not seen Savior will not see this, but in a way that's the problem.  The expectation appears to be that if we see murderers, we will therefore see Serbs - whatever the uniform.  I find that a little disturbing.

The stop-amd-go sequences added a lot to the movie too.  It was really not your typical John Wayne/Audie Murphy war movie. When they landed they just laid out there in the open like, ok, the US will be here to get us any minute now, instead of hiding in a covered area. But it made u realize that these guys really DID NOT know what war was (even though the US was not in a war, which was a crucial fact in the movie).   When the first guy was killed, Owen screamed which made you feel like this could really happen. He was just a kid/man in the armed services doing his job of flying a plane. Since WE (the US) were not at war, he didn't feel threatened. But the underlying fact is that Bosnia WAS at war and we were getting involved so to the Bosnians, the US was at war with them too.  The pictures of the bombed out cities and ragged people really made you SEE what war does.  We haven't had that happen to us in the US so some of the people who thought the movie was terrible, probably take the freedoms that we have for granted. My son is 18 and I thought about him being in a situation like that.  It made me want to cry.  It made me respect the men and women that are in the armed services because they chose to do this; when they could be at home, in a nice cozy family room, eating popcorn and watching a movie. Yeah, the shooting was unrealistic and Owen going BACK for the film was insane but HEY, it's the stuff all movies are made of.

The scenes towards the beginning do a good job of conveying these feelings of aimlessness that pervaded the lives of so many.The imagery borders on cliche with the close-ups, but could still be considered effective nonetheless.Overall, the entertainment value is moderate to high.

In the opening scene of `Behind Enemy Lines,' Navy pilot Chris Burnett and his flight buddy - affectionately known as `Stackhouse' - indulge in a little pre&#150;flight gallows humor as they recall various famous rock performers who have met their ends in plane crashes.  Is it any surprise, then, that these two jocular jocks will face the prospect of a similar fate before too many more scenes have played themselves out?Indeed, it turns out that, not long afterwards, both Burnett and Stackhouse are shot down by the Serbians while flying a reconnaissance mission over what is supposed to be a de-militarized zone in Bosnia.  Only Burnett survives and he is forced to hot foot it over miles of difficult and unfamiliar terrain while being pursued by sniper forces bent on his annihilation.  Gene Hackman co-stars as Burnett's hardnosed - but actually soft-hearted - commanding officer who is forced to decide between keeping the terms of a fragile NATO-imposed peace agreement, thereby leaving Burnett to fend for himself in the wild, or saying to hell with the treaty and rescuing one of his own men as his gut instincts tell him to do.If `Behind Enemy Lines' turns out to be a fairly decent action picture, it is attributable almost entirely to the likeability factor emanating, as always, from actor Owen Wilson.  With his Average Joe persona, Wilson takes Burnett out of the realm of superhero and makes him a character we can identify with &#150; this despite the fact that the number of hairbreadth escapes that Burnett manages to pull off strain our credulity far beyond the breaking point.  Wilson is also aided by the flashy visual technique employed by director John Moore, which helps to cover up the fact that the screenplay has really very little character development taking place under its action-movie surface.  We might also object to the fact that the script never even attempts to come to terms with the complex nature of the Bosnian conflict, choosing instead to reduce the issue to as simplistic a sociopolitical level as possible.  The film also suffers from a sort of built-in monotony factor, endemic to most man-on-the-run narratives.  This is especially aggravated &#150; as it is in this film - when the chase is taking place in a foreign country with very few of the people our hero encounters able to communicate with him much beyond simple phrases and gestures.The cinematography does a tremendous job capturing the stark beauty of the film's bleak, wintertime setting.  Unfortunately, the adrenaline-pumping rock music soundtrack tends to not only undercut the sense of realism created by the photography, but to cheapen the serious and tragic real life events that define the film's historical context.  Perhaps the bitter war in Bosnia is simply too recent and too fresh in our minds to serve as an excuse for yet another rah-rah tale of American ingenuity and virtue.

Spielberg put the reality into war on the silver screen, and since then nothing less has been acceptable.  Not to say that `reality' alone makes for a successful film; other elements must be factored in, and in the final analysis, each film will succeed or fail on it's own individual merits, reality aside.  One that does succeed, and for a number of reasons, is `Behind Enemy Lines,' directed by John Moore, which delivers that expected reality, but offers a lot more along the way, as well.On a Christmas Day routine recon flight over Bosnia, Navy pilot Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), and his navigator, Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), notice some activity in one of the `demilitarized' zones (which also happens to be a `no-flight' zone), and summarily take it upon themselves to investigate.  Their efforts immediately cause more than a little consternation in certain quarters, however, and very quickly their mission goes south with dire results.  Having seen (and photographed, no less) things not meant for their eyes, they find themselves on the wrong end of hostile missile, and their plane goes down.Having ejected in time, Burnett finds himself on the ground, alone, and in hostile territory.  He manages to call in his position, but due to the muddled and convoluted politics of the moment, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is prevented from sending help in straight away, which leaves Burnett for a time to his own devices for survival in unknown terrain while in harm's way.  But Burnett, a seven year veteran, is determined to make it, and to make this mission mean something-- which it will, if only he can get the proof of what he's seen back safely.  And that means beating the enemy at their own game, and on their turf.Initially, Moore's film seems destined to become just one more of the brutally realistic and action packed war stories that have evolved since Spielberg's `Ryan,' albeit a good one, from all indications early on.  The story is solid and there's plenty of action, all of which is carried off nicely by star Owen Wilson, but by the half-way point there's nothing much that sets it apart from the usual action/drama survival film.  It plays out, in fact, like a cross between `Enemy At the Gates' and `Black Hawk Down.'  Then something happens-- and it takes a turn that kicks it up a notch and takes it beyond anything those other films offered and/or delivered. Once the action surrounding Burnett's dilemma is established, Moore sharpens his focus on the more personal aspects of the story, and it suddenly becomes more than just a quest for survival; it becomes the study of a man on a mission, a man with a goal and a purpose, an individual against whom the odds are decidedly stacked.  And by infusing that decisive human element into the story, it elevates the film to a higher level and achieves the kind of success never realized by either of the aforementioned films, in part because of their failure to effect that very same level of human drama that sets this film apart.As Burnett, Owen Wilson is very effective, turning in a performance that is quite natural and affecting.  Wilson has something of a quirky appearance and a rather mesmerizing tone and manner of speaking that gives him a charismatic screen presence and makes him extremely accessible and convincing.  He manages to avoid the trappings of the stereotypical `fly-boy' character, checking his ego and machismo at the door, and it makes Burnett very real and believable.  It also makes the development of his character-- his actions, reactions and attitudes-- convincing as the story progresses, as well as lending credibility to the overall film.Hackman, on the other hand, falls directly into stereotype with his portrayal of Reigart; this is a character we've seen time and time again in just about every war film to come down the pike.  But to his credit, Hackman does it extremely well, which is the beauty of watching an actor of his caliber perform.  He's the consummate professional, and even when covering familiar ground, he has the ability to make it seem fresh and, most importantly, entertaining.  Hackman is a gifted actor with a tremendous range; this character-- by it's inherent nature-- simply has nothing to offer by way of a challenge.  Reigart is merely a character that serves a purpose, and Hackman realizes that intent to the fullest.The supporting cast includes Charles Mark Whitfield (Rodway), Joaquim de Almeida (Piquet), David Keith (O'Malley), Olek Krupa (Lokar), Vladimir Mashkov (Tracker) and Marko Igonda (Bazda).  A film that offers some insights into politics, as well as the human condition, it manages to be thought provoking while delivering some terrific action, drama and solid entertainment.  Worthy to be called one of `Ryan's ` more successful offspring, `Behind Enemy Lines' is the watermelon of war films; it takes some doing to get through the rind, but once you get to the good part, it's pretty sweet, and more than worth the effort.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

I found the movie to be riveting and highly entertaining.  YES, it is ridiculous that the main character is able to survive all that he did.  However, how often do you ever see a REALISTIC action movie?!?!  (Schwarzenegger's True Lies was FAR MORE ridiculous and did not get the bad feedback that this movie received.)  Other reviewers complain incessantly of the unrealistic events, but I found it no less believable than any other action film out of Hollywood - in fact, it was more believable since the guns and explosions were in a military context.  If you like action, then you'll like this movie - just don't expect it to be a realistic portrayal of war.

Probably about 20 minutes into the movie my friend and I started naming other movies certain shots were taken out of, since nearly everything seemed copy. Things that mimicked Saving Private Ryan (slow motion scenes with no sound, shaky camera moves in action scenes), camera shots and movements that copied anything done by Michael Bay (anything involving slow camera movements circling the actors while they intently look at something in the distance).

We are asked to swallow so many events that just wouldn't happen that the film loses a good deal of credibility.Who could possibly believe that the U.S. would sit still while N.A.T.O. dictated that we must not attempt the rescue of a downed pilot becaue it might upset the peace process in Bosnia?  That is utter nonsense.  And are we to believe that an entire platoon of soldiers with automatic weapons all firing simultaneously could not hit the constantly dodging Burnett?  Not likely.  There are numerous other plot contrivances that require extraordinary suspension of disbelief, but most of them are critical plot elements so I will refrain from possible spoilers.John Moore is a rookie director that does a terrific job with the technical elements of the film.  He presents a very realistic look and feel in the carrier scenes and the air combat scene is first rate.  Actually, all the action sequences are outstanding, no doubt in large part due to the work of twenty year stunt veteran Steve Davison (`End of Days', `Batman and Robin'), who was the second unit director and stunt coordinator.  This film also blends stunt photography seamlessly with visual effects to produce extremely realistic action scenes.  However, when it comes to managing the screenplay, Moore seems to just assume that the writers are the best judge of how the plot is presented, or he doesn't connect with the concepts plot and character believability.  This is Owen Wilson's first film in the lead and while he does a good job, he just isn't serious action-hero material.  Wilson projects a naturally sarcastic, smart aleck personality that works in some of the scenes in this film, but when it gets to the macho action sequences, he just can't carry it.  He was terrific in Shanghai Noon, where the action was all tongue-in-cheek.  In that film, his wisecracking humor was a perfect fit.  However, this film gives him little opportunity to display his fabulous comedic talents and he is adrift trying to play the survivor.Gene Hackman plays a supporting role and as always gives us a solid performance as Admiral Reigart.  I can't keep track of how many military movies (mostly naval) David Keith has been in since `An Officer and A Gentleman'.  He must be on only one call list.  He always gives a credible performance in these roles and this one is no different.  Joaquim de Almeida is dreadful as Admiral Piquet of N.A.T.O. command.If you like action films and you are not too fussy about implausible stories, this film delivers.  I rated it a 7/10 based on the marvelous stunt work and visual effects and the realistic military look and feel.

But it is the style in which Behind Enemy Lines executes its plot that makes it stand out. Although in retrospect the script isn't really spectacular, you don't even notice it while watching the film because it's so much fun. It has a fast-paced story -- which has become a must-have for movies nowadays due to the ADHD-society we live in -- and the action is cool and relatively realistic. Owen Wilson is, as always, smooth and charming, and Gene Hackman is, as always, phenomenal. During the film you will definitely question the believability of the events it depicts, but once you really get into it, you won't even care. You will be on the edge of your seat as the lead character runs through an exploding minefield, falls down the side of a concrete dam, and hides in a pile of dead bodies with the enemy just inches away from him. Okay maybe it's a little predictable and trite, but comparing it to stuff like The Scorpion King and Spider-Man, it's an action masterpiece.Overall rating 7/10 "}{"Title":"Lame Ass piece of crap!!!!!","Date":"12 May 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  Do I have to explain that my One Line Summary doesn't??

The trailer made it seem interesting, it had actors I respected, and lets face it I wanted to see some good old American's triumphing over evildoers. Now if that sounds like I enjoy stupid action flick, trust me I do. Cliffhanger and Broken Arrow sit on top of my guilty pleasures list. But there comes a time when I just have to draw a line at how much stupidity I can take, and Behind Enemy Lines takes the cake in that department. It is without the doubt the stupidest, loudest, lamest excuse for a popcorn flick I've ever seen. The story which at first seems to want to make a serious statement on American intervention in foreign wars slowly degrades into a chase film of the lamest kind. Not only do you get the tried and true villians suffering from can'thitthebroadsideofabarnitis, but the film ramps up the morallizing in the last half where most of the time is spent disobeying orders and flying illegaly into a foreign land and rescuing Wilson. Theres even another annoying subplot involving said character wanting to resign from the navy because he feels that he isn't doing enough good to make a difference? Can you guess what happens in the end. For those with the eyes of hawks who have seen the Dennis Quaid film Savior, look closely at the massacre flashback scene and tell me if those people or the footage itself looks vaguely familiar. Next annoyance are the action sequences themselves, which are cranked up so much, and over edited to be mind boggling. Its not enough that the action is sped up but the director seems to think that shaking the camera alot will add to the suspense. Shall I even go into the scene where Wilson having donned the garb of an enemy soldier valliantly walks past the enemy soldiers, then not ten feet away unmasks and starts to run away. No wonder none of those guys can shoot him if they don't see his unmasked persona running from them. And dont even let me go into the scene where Wilson runs through a mine field setting off explosions left and right without a recieving a scratch while three soldiers are blown to smithereens. Does the movie have a redeeming quality? I do think so. If anything is good its the performances by Owen Wilson and Vladimir Mashkov. Wilson seems to have this every man way that suits his character more than if he had been played by a muscular action film hero. And Mashkov's tracker seems to be one of the cooler action villians I've seen. He speaks when he needs to, but most of the time is quiet and remorseless which sets his character apart from the usual loud obnoxious villians we're used to seeing in films like these. Folks do yourself a favor. Theres a film out on video and DVD now called No Mans Land. Its a thousand times better, with great characters, and story that depresses the viewer only because the subject isn't one for a happy ending.

There are situations that scream, Yeah Right! and situations that have HOLLYWOOD written all over them.  However, with all that aside, this was probably the most entertaining film that I saw in 2001.  This is a film that grabs you by the edge of your seat, and takes you away from the stresses of life for two hours, all the while giving you an explosive good time.Owen Wilson plays Chris Burnett, kind of a whiny pretty boy pilot who questions his current duties as a Navy Recon pilot.  He basically wants more action in his tour of duty, and after disobeying orders and being shot down, he sure gets it.  The special effects are top notch in this film, in addition to the wonderful FX which even has the whizzing of bullets hitting rock before you hear the gunshot.  However, most of the action scenes after he gets shot down either have a hint of unrealisticness, or reek of it, however, this is the kind of movie we pay to see for heartstopping thrills and excitement, not historical or real life accuracy.  On that plane (no pun intended), it succeeds very well.  Owen Wilson, a great, everyday guy actor does an excellent job as Burnett, and Gene Hackman is great as his typical role of a commander in charge.  The movie's plot is also surprisingly intelligent, though, in Capt. O'Grady's book, he says the first thing they teach you is never to wave a weapon in the air when a rescue craft is hovering to pick you up.  (Though, O'Grady jokes that he does this while being rescued from Bosnia,) Burnett, clad in enemy fatigues fires a full magazine in the air when an allied helicopter arrives, that kinda thing will get you friendly fire in a heartbeat.  There are at least three other scenes that imply that Burnett was not paying attention in survival training 101, or that maybe Hollywood needs some new technical advisors.

He even jokes about the spriling cost of peacekeeping over the war-torn region of Bosnia.Wilson, who wants out, is drafted into a fly-over the neutral zone (no, we haven't wandered into an episode of Star Trek, though you wish you had), and notices some bad serbs committing genocide, and is prompty shot down.With political nonsense on a battleship with the we don't care what happens, so long as we get our 'boy' back attitude of the American commander played by Hackman - Wilson is left to fend for himself - whilst being chased by BMPs, and enemy soldiers.Whilst this could have been good, it soon turns into a rekindle to an 80s film - big explosions, gunfire and the hero doesn't even get shot - regardless of how close the enemy are to him.The greasy haired sniper is quite good to watch, but he doesn't move like a sniper, stamping on every twig or ditch, making a noise as he moves along, chasing Wilson down.Whilst the notion of genocide and war crimes are well highlighted, the holes in the plot and the film make it forgettable and unmemorable.Rating 4/10 "},{"Title":"Above average action-thriller","Date":"9 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, War, Drama","Review":"  Good action scenes and suspense-filled climaxes make this movie quite enjoyable.

And that sniper (the bad guy) needs to get a new job since he can't hit anybody that's more than five feet away from him. He should probably get himself a jeep too since the 50 guys that always show up two minutes after he gets somewhere on foot never let him ride in their vehicles.If this had been a comedy, or a Bond-like action movie, then okay.

You've got Owen Wilson as Lieutenant Chris Burnett, a navigator struck down over Bosnia...who resorts to living among the dead and running a gauntlet of land mines to keep himself alive.  And between Burnett's amazing crash sequence and the thrilling end, we're introduced to Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman), who is forced to choose between rescuing his downed pilot or preserving a peace process that doesn't seem worth saving.  Put it all together and you've got a showcase that screams the all-American military theme- Leave No Man Behind- and wraps it into an outstandingly patriotic package.Yes, it can be argued that Behind Enemy Lines is your standard, run-of-the-mill action adventure movie involving the United States military.  It also has Navy jargon that might leave some confused.  (One movie-goer behind me in the theatre continually questioned the meaning of feet dry and was flustered, it seemed, by the use of the Phonetic alphabet) The directing was irritating, to say the least.But Behind Enemy Lines was a great movie.  Wanna know why?  Because it doesn't star Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger...and Owen Wilson will never be confused for Tom Cruise.  (I certainly could never picture him as a superhero out to save the world)  So as Wilson spends much of the movie running for his life, and looking angry, concerned, scared and very much alone, it made it that much easier to digest. And we don't know whether to root for Lt. Burnett, at first, when it appears that he has lost faith in his purpose as a Naval aviator.  You might get to see a lot more of me soon, he tells his father on ship-to-shore call just before Christmas.  Burnett, of course, is  contemplating leaving the Navy because of a lack of things to do. (The pilots aren't logging many flight hours, and eating jello and launching footballs off catapaults on the flight deck appear to fail at holding his interest)  I'm proud of you, is his father's only reply- 7 years into his son's tour.So with that fact and the Admiral's refusal to hand in his resignation letter, Burnett sits in as the navigator on a mission over the Bosnian countryside...and that's how the mayhem begins.  And the movie, while short of a masterpiece, uniquely brings to light a conflict that has gone virtually unnoticed by American citizens.  We get lots of neat ground and air combat, some insight into the military's chain of command, and legal jargon that would fit nicely on an episode of CBS's JAG.  And while Behind Enemy Lines doesn't answer every question, it works nicely as an education tool.  It also serves as comfort food...to know that we have highly-skilled and well-trained men and women on the highest alert possible to protect our country and snuff out the bad guys.

I need not even comment on the outrageous stereotyping of the Bosnian bad guys.  When Moore clears his head of cliches, he'll be a commendable action director.However Cinematographer Brendan Galvin, who has 3 TV credits and 2 other small films, does impressive work here-he bends the color into black, white, and gray in ways that reflect my own impression of the bleak, desolate, and ravaged landscape revived by television today in our Afghan conflict.Like Hackman's recent `Heist' and Redford's `Spy Game,' `Behind Enemy Lines' is another `B' film enjoyable enough on a dark winter day but not great enough to outlast the endless conflict in an inscrutable Mid-East.

Hackman plays an admiral who is the battle group commander for USS Carl Vinson.While flying a routine reconnaissance mission, Burnett and his pilot (LT Stackhouse) see something they're not supposed to see and do something they're not supposed to do (as something like this would probably get you court-martialed).  As a result, the enemy (in this case an Eastern European rebel group), shoot them down with a surface-to-air missile.  The flying scene where their plane is being chased by the SAM is intense, riveting and heart-stopping and probably one of the best in the movie.  They eject and find themselves deep inside enemy territory, struggling to survive.  Once on the ground, it becomes a game of cat and mouse between them and two rebels who want to make sure the Americans are dead.Meanwhile, back on the aircraft carrier, the control room has lost radio contact with the pilots and realize something is wrong.  Hackman wants to send in a rescue team, but his efforts are thwarted by political reasons and a foreign embarked admiral who makes it clear that no rescue will take place.  The interesting parts are the relationships between the two admirals, the two rebels and the two pilots.Wilson does a fine job in an action film, as most of his previous films have been light comedy.  As a result, he comes off as an all-around normal guy thrust in an unusual situation, and not some muscular action-hero that would have no problem in a situation like this.Although somewhat predictable, the action was non-stop and suspenseful.

Hackman was pretty good in Crimson Tide but I thought he was even better in Behind Enemy Lines. I really liked how he stayed by one of his men even though the man (Wilson) did something he wasn't supposed to do and that's fly over enemy territory. There wasn't even much that should have been re-done or corrected. I'm not sure how Wilson switched uniforms with a Bosnian soldier at the end. When the 'victim' was shown to the Bosnian General near the end, it was revealed that the victim had a stamp on his hand which proved that he was not American. Meanwhile Wilson was able to escape and eventually set himself up for rescue. One thing I like about Wilson is that he is proved at playing all sorts of different roles. Among them are Wedding Crashers, BEL, Starsky and Hutch, Shanghai Knights and Zoolander, You, Me and Dupree, The Big Bounce, I Spy. He strikes me as one of those guys who can be involved in a movie about just about anything. If you haven't seen BELs yet and can appreciate Wilson as an actor, you should definitely enjoy this one.

Plot Spoilers Ahead!**Behind Enemy Lines is a loose retelling of former POW Scott O'Grady's survival, ahem, behind enemy lines in the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.  As a military adventure story, this movie has to be separated from such recent ultra-realistic films such as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan.  If you're expecting something like that, you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking for an enjoyable way to blow a couple hours, you'll find this flick to your liking.When I first saw the trailer for Behind Enemy Lines, I couldn't help but laugh at the thought of Owen Wilson as a serious dramatic action-hero role.  And initially it is difficult, as we are introduced to his Maverick-like character through a series of jokes.  Once the movie takes a serious turn though, Wilson properly tones down the humor, proving his versatility and allowing us to accept him in this departure from his norm.  The always good Gene Hackman provides the other primary character, a part similar to his Crimson Tide military man, and a role he can do with ease.  He and the rest of the cast fulfill their assignments, presenting the standard list of military characters.  No character is developed particularly well, but in this sort of movie, audience familiarity suffices where that is absent. Much of this flick resonates with Spy Game, from earlier in the same year.  The music choices, pacing, and the various editing techniques are reminiscent of Tony Scott's methods.  The arsenal of jump cuts, zooms, and other edits that director John Moore employs border on the annoying, but since the pace of the movie never relents, the quick-hit editing is acceptable.  The overall production value is beyond acceptable, actually quite good.  All of the sets are fully realistic, from the aircraft carrier to the forested terrain.  In many movies of this ilk, the art design is largely overlooked, but nothing here distracts from the movie, as the look is arguably the highlight of the pic.  I particularly liked the movie's solidly effective cinematography, which featured a washed-out blue hue.The special effects are good too.  An early fighter jet sequence is surprisingly enjoyable, and the various military action are told well.  Yes, Wilson probably would have been hit by one of the million ammo rounds fired at him; but like I said, this isn't a movie to be commended for its realism.  It is to be commended for quality production, without which this movie could easily have fallen apart.  The all-around good work contributes to the effective patriotic manipulation of this movie.  Nothing in the formulaic plot is all that surprising to anyone who has either followed the strife in the Balkans or ever seen a movie of this genre; but in this post-9/11 era, a simple and decently told heroic American tale such as this is a welcome source of entertainment.  Those outside the United States might have a different take on this flick, but to its target American audience, Behind Enemy Lines fits our ideals of a military adventure movie.   Bottom Line Despite being unabashedly American, very good production value and solid efforts from all involved make this military popcorn movie (a strange combination indeed) worth a viewing. 6 of 10.

The only part that I truly loved was the beginning sequence in which the pilot and navigator's aircraft was being pursued by missiles.  Although a bit unrealistic in how it was carried out, it was still very, very awesome and memorable.  For that alone, the movie was worth watching.  As soon as the navigator started being pursued by Serbian forces, the movie took a dive.  It was still viewable, but only because you wanted to know how things would turn out.  My god, this movie was so stereotypical and downright ignorant in the portrayal of the opposition, that it makes me wonder how anyone could praise it.  I mean, if you're going to make a movie, at least get your facts straight.  How hard can that be??  The Serbian soldiers had on uniforms w/ Croatian insignia, for god's sake! There's a lot of similar mistakes throughout the film. Anyhow, by the middle of the film, you start to lose interest in the welfare of the navigator and also start to wonder how long it will take before they rescue him in some uneducated, valiant attempt that probably puts many, many more lives at risk than necessary.  You also begin to wonder when the climax will occur, and then you realize that it already happened, right at the beginning during that whole missile sequence!  Yes, that would have to be the most exciting moment, even though the climax is technically supposed to be when he's rescued.  Sad, isn't it?

Not only that but he gets work with Gene Hackman, that can't be a bad thing.Overall, I thought this film was excellent, the story is very good and well done.  The action sequences are exquisite, particularly when the jet gets shot down, a true adrenaline rush!I think a few minor tweaks here and there would have made this film truly excellent.  There are FAR too many of the spinning around the character(s) type of shots, very dizzying and used WAY WAY too much.  Why would Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) take off his ski-mask type disguise thing (whatever it's called) while still a few feet away from the enemy?  I know what the director was doing and trying to show the audience, but don't insult our intelligence, we darn well know that's Chris Burnett.  The only other problem I had with the film is some of the strange editing and camera work.  Sometimes is looked cool but I feel it sort of took away from the realism of the film, but there were times where I really liked the quick camera shots or jump cuts.The cast was fairly small, or at least there is a short list of truly important characters.  Owen Wilson pulls off a very nice performance for a first-time action star, no complaints there, he even throws in a little comedy here and there.  Gene Hackman is great as always, there are a few lines of his I would have changed, but nonetheless, a great role.  David Keith plays a somewhat small role, but fairly important, and does it quite well.  I recognized Gabriel Macht (Stackhouse) in the film, but couldn't place where I'd seen him until I looked him up on this site.

Behind Enemy Lines recalls John Woo movies in terms of style in action scenes, but it is much more better than some John Woo movies in fact (you know, he has started to be disappointing) Behind Enemy Lines is a special movie, if you ask me besides being very very enjoyable and stylish, because it is not just fun, it is very well shot. Firstly, I want to talk about some scenes. There are some scenes that I just love and think that some of the best action scenes ever made! The jet fall scene is the best one, there is no better one. Even if some moments (special effects) look superficial, a great action sequence and a great demo scene too. The mine scene is my favorite, not only in the movie, this action scene is one of the bests ever made too. Each time, I am amazed and impressed. I cannot describe this scene. Then, the shooter comes to the scene and we say wow! This is a cat and mouse game also, even if it is weak in comparison with other cat and mouse games. The scene takes place in front of the ramshackle building is another astonishing action scene, but there is much more than that. The only thing disappointing is the entrapment in the final part. I had expected an interesting or smart or something big, but disappointed. As for Owen Wilson, many people agree that he is not appropriate for an action movie and they say that the movie would have been better without him. I absolutely disagree. He was perfect. He proved that a comedy actor can be better than some action stars. To me, he is better than Mark Wahlberg or better than cold Vin Diesel. Now, it is time for the reviews, the reviews of some people including critics. The extremely frustrating and sometimes ridiculous reviews. This is a movie that critics would give maximum 6. They say that Behind Enemy Lines is an ideological movie, it is a propaganda movie, it is one sided, it shows Serbians as evil and so on... You see, always the same stuff. They say the movie brainwashes us, I ask who brainwashes who? I hate this. And there is one more ridiculous comment from a critic. The movie advertises cola. It says don't drink water, drink cola. Hmm, really? How do those critics's brains work? What about cinema? Do directors who want to make a war movie have to make two movies for each front? No. If there won't be any bad guy, how can you make a movie that is about a pilot whose aircraft is fallen and tries to survive behind enemy lines? Recently I have seen a few action movies like Shooter. It was a very slow paced action movie and also action was mild besides being very less.

It is a rehash of almost every action/war movie filmed in the last decade.The movie starts out very well.  The typical rebel pilot team (ripped from Top Gun) is in trouble with the Admiral of the aircraft carrier and punished with a Christmas day recon flight in their big fast airplane.  During their routine flight they deviate from their flight plan (because they're rebellious, of course) and end up seeing (and photographing) something that the Serbian army doesn't want NATO to see.   They get shot down - probably the best action sequence in the entire movie - then one of the team (I won't tell you, but it's not hard to predict) gets shot and the bulk of the movie sees our lone survivor evading tank and booby traps and men with big guns trying to kill him so he can get back to the ship to get this information to the proper people and make up with his commanding officer.The problem I have with the movie is not in the acting (although Gene Hackman had a much better role as a commanding officer in Crimson Tide),  it's the fact that the plot is utterly unbelievable and disjointed. For example, it's always amazing to see in movies how thousands of bullets miss our hero, but a well placed pistol round saves the day,  land mines and trip wires seem to have an artificial intelligence on who the bad guys are and, as always, even the good guys conspire to get rid the hero.Owen Wilson is a funny actor and did his best to make this movie worth the money I spent to see it, but one would be better off renting Top Gun, Bat 21, Platoon, or catching Black Hawk Down in the theater.

But two things did bother me in this experience. One is that shot of the helos rising from below the horizon. Please, it's just too tired, and led to a set of ending shots that must have been dictated from the financier's playbook. With such a promising beginning, to become so trite is a shame.The other thing is a biggie. There is enough drama in the way war is really fought. The truth is much better than what we see here.Carriers are monstrous machines. We didn't get that. We didn't get the sense of a whole city on board, nor life with planes constantly in the air, patrolling hundreds of miles out just as an umbrella, and the thousands of miles covered with collaboration through control and spy aircraft. We didn't get the sense of the whole battlegroup, 12-20 ships and subs with their own, various lethalities that could have been used. To reduce the whole thing to 3 (invincible) marine helos is pretty lame, and probably shows more pennypinching on the part of Hollywood than the Pentagon ever would have.The chain of communication and command is far, far cooler than what you see here, as is intel. For instance, every cell phone conversation would have been monitored and reported to the field command even as far back as Bosnia/Kosovo, which it should be noted was the saving of Muslim skins.Since so much of the world seems caught up in conspiracies involving the US military, I fully expect someone to claim that pictures like this are part of a disinformation campaign.

But lets face it, he stars in BEHIND ENEMY LINES, a fast-paced cold war thriller which is not new in formula, but is very competent when it comes to action. Even if Wilson isn't exactly the most reliable action hero, he does a fine job looking good in the military uniform and getting mud all over his face. Director John Moore uses dozens of fancy shots, death traps and daredevil jet scenes to elevate the predictable plot, and manages to pull it off. Although some of the slow-mo shots are corny and some of escapes are expected, the film is competent enough to have me entertained. You might too, depending on how much ridiculousness you can handle for a serviceable 1-and-a-half hour or so. Wilson plays Chris Burnett, a Navy navigator who is shot down by enemy troops during a reconnaissance mission over Bosnia. The pilot is shot, and now their after him (and guess who gets away). While he (repeatedly) escapes his pursuers, his commanding officer (Gene Hackman) tries desperately to bring his boy back. Tracking him down is a ruthless enforcer (played by Vladimir Mashkov) and a dozen other soldiers who happen to be foolish enough to miss him more than once.There are dozens of overused clich√©s in BEHIND ENEMY LINES, and I don't have to count for you. They are visible and evident enough for the frequent movie-goer who have seen dozens of other escapist movies. But there are still dozens of other really good stuff here. The action is competent and the the pace moves in crackling speed. The aerial sequences were pretty good and the location is very appropriate to the films war-tor atmosphere. Mr. Moore has overdone some of the films cinematography thinking it's cool; perhaps knowing exactly what happens in these cool action sequences couldn't have been too much to ask for. BEHIND ENEMY LINES is pure Hollywood hokum. It's ridiculous and almot laughable in spots (especially when Wilson's character nearly cheats death several times), but amusing enough not to be boring.Rating *** out 5.

His commanding officer works to get his man back in one piece.Action war movies have this weird thing about them. Action movies are meant to be fun, war movies meant to be serious, so how do you take this hybrid genre? The best answer is just as an action movie. Like Die Hard is not a cop movie, it is an action movie with a cop backdrop for the hero since the hero has gotta know how to use guns. Here the military backdrop serves mainly to cook up some nice pyrotechnics and action scenes. And that's fine, but it has to be understood that way. If you take this film seriously, then you'll seriously think this film is a piece of super corny patriotic crap. But as an action movie it works well. Tense action, good special effects, and a likable hero. Basically place it on the shelf next to 'Where Eagles Dare' (which is a favorite of mine) and 'The Guns of Navarone.' It is not as good as those classics, but it is that type of movie.The one real problematic scene is when the hero hides in a ditch which he soon finds out is really a mass grave and the film gets this serious moment of how awful the Balkan War was, which has no place in an action adventure. But other than that, the action is solid especially when you consider John Moore as a first time feature director. --- 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action. Ages 13+.

I've had a gut full of this crap, so I've decided to throw it back in your faces. Let's review just some of the accomplishments of the Greatest Nation on Earth, shall we? 1. Established a representative Republic unparalleled in the history of mankind. Did this by fighting off the most powerful military force in the world at the time with a ragtag, underfunded, and badly trained army. Wrote the greatest document ever written establishing the rights and liberties of its citizens.2. Survived possibly the bloodiest civil war in human history, remaining intact as a nation afterward.3. Beformentioned war brought about a new age of invention and the industrial revolution.4. Fought in two world wars, always on the right side. Without its presence, either of these wars would have been won by a fascist regime, thereby changing the course of history. No, Britain could NOT have defeated Hitler (see Dunkirk) without US help. IN FACT, Britain would have ended up a German protectorate. Any of you clowns from Britain, France, Luxembourg, Norway, Finland, Italy, Denmark, Germany, Japan, China, Australia (yes, you too), Indonesia, Greece, Malta, Belgium, etc who can't face that fact are just deluding yourselves. And that's just too damned bad. By the way, Europeans, when you're tempted to crow about how damned great you are, remember the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan. And British military prowess? Google the words Operation Market Garden and see what comes up.5. Developed vaccines which have rid the world of most of the deadly diseases which killed off humans for thousands of years. Other inventions/developments include the internet, the microchip, an automobile that people actually wanted, an airplane that actually flew, a half dozen moon landings, and countless others.6. While being led by a B-movie actor and amiable dunce, ended the threat of nuclear annihilation by a dictatorial, evil communist state.If you don't like any of what I've said here, I don't give a rat's ass.

BEL is like Black Hawk Down and Rambo 1 and 3 ( the second was too unrealistic to enjoy), exposing the harsh realities of war and genocide. While I don't care for many of Owen's movies like the extremely historically inaccurate Karate/Cowboy movies,I liked this one a lot. Two American pilots go on a reconnaisse mission on Christmas Day.  Son of a b*&^h. Do you see this? He put us on holiday mission. God D$%m it. Well look at the bright side, at least we get to fly. Yeah, during the one good meal of the year. It's almost like he doesn't us. No, No, Not Me,you. Not me, You. I'm an Marine. We handle the serious stuff. You, You're a Navy pilot. Your role is to eat Jell-o. You don't get to pick your fights , they come to you. I get it, but at least give me a fight I understand.... I mean it's a joke. Everyone gets to think they will punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy and those days are long gone. Now I realize I'm going be eating Jell-o. Are you going to eat that by the way? First you complain about the jell-o and now you want to eat everybody's Jell-o. Due to a malfunction in their intelligence read-out, They fly over an unauthorized De-Militarized zone that is Military active. The area was deemed off limit because Nazi-like Serb forces are using the area to hide their genocidal victims. Unknown to the American pilots, the pictures they take are of graves the Serbs didn't want America or NATO to find out about. Before long, the Serbs fire two SAMs at the pilots's jet and the Americans know they are under attack. After ejecting, one American is killed execution style, the other must survive a genocidal army and a genocidal sniper and recover the photo evidence he took. While the ending scence was kind of far fetched, the movie is semi-based on a true story. Althrough even the typical Hollywood ending didn't make this movie too-unrealistic to enjoy. Besides, most movies have much more unbelievable scenes than when Owen is bullet proof at the end. While not Oscar material, it is a Red,White and Blue American classic. "},{"Title":"Art vs Action?

Others have called this movie propaganda. Eh. Not really. Its a money maker. The Government makes nothing off this directly, but Fox makes the green.Lets get down to it. This movie is good. I love it and can watch it every week. Its just good action! Film is supposed to entertain, and this does. Lots of shooting, lots of explosions - thats what we all want sometimes. The movie is good fun action, the way i feel about SWAT and Terminator 3. They're not great movies, but they are great fun.As for the politics of this movie, please. They needed a conflict to set the story in. This is not trying to make a point. Its trying to entertain.Someone talked about Black Hawk Down showing Americans just fighting someone who looks different. Uh. Black Hawk Down was an accurate account of what really happened. A bunch of Americans (a lot of us are white!) went down in Somalia (a lot of them are black!) and the Somalians under command of the local warlord were sent to kill the Americans. The director did not decide to make them black to make it different. They were black. Most of the rangers were white. Thats how it was in the actual battle.As for Serbs vs Croats and their respective accents, I can't tell the difference, thats my ignorance.The ending. The ending is fun! He is not being chased by 70 snipers. There is 1 sniper. And yes, there is a tank and a perhaps 2 or 3 platoons of men (between 60 and 90 or so). But its not like he is running and they are shooting at him and missing. (Yes that does happen) But lets not forget the American task force! There are a bunch of Huey's cruising around laying down heavy fire, the Serbs are under constant attack, your aim breaks down. In war, its not like you hit someone every 5 shots. They have statistics that show its more like 1 casualty per 400,000 rounds or something. I thought the end was entertaining and fun.Patriotism? OK, it is patriotic. Yay America. But this film isn't like oo America is the best ever. Well, maybe at war. But it isn't saying that America is some peace loving god country. Heck, part of the beginning dialog is about how they want to fight. Also, the US Naval Commander ignores all sorts of orders and NATO opposition. It just shows what America has proved over and over again. We will not leave our people behind NO MATTER WHAT. Time and time again, America proves that. No matter who tries to stop us, we get our men back.(Ok, maybe some exceptions, ie, USS Pueblo incident and USS Liberty. Look them up, very interesting) Closing point. This movie is fun and entertaining. 8/10 entertainment value. Re-Watchable!

He would have ruined even a good action movie, and this is not a good action movie.  I can't think of any living actor more totally lacking in charisma or more irritating to listen to (where does he GET that nasal whine?).  He's a godsend to his supporting cast; my eyes naturally long to go somewhere, anywhere rather than settle on Wilson, so the bit players get a lot more attention than they otherwise would.  Unfortunately, a lot of this film shows Wilson out in the wild by himself, so my eyes cannot escape this thing, this sorry excuse for an actor, that is on the screen.But the converse applies also; if Wilson would have ruined even a good action movie, not even a strong leading man (say, Joaquin Phoenix) could have saved this movie.  There is only one good action set-piece, the missile attack against the Hornet fighter-bomber.  For the entire remainder of the movie, we are subjected to Wilson stumbling through one stupid situation after another.  Wilson skylines himself while trying to communicate with the carrier crew; a sniper misses him even though he is a perfect, stationary target; at another point a whole freakin' ARMORED COMPANY misses him with everything from small arms to 20mm cannons at a range of about 250 yards -and he isn't even taking cover!  These stupidities are important even for a lowbrow action movie from which you expect no brains the action scenes need to make you think, `Wow, isn't he good!' not `Wow, God looks out for fools and drunkards.'Even the redoubtable Gene Hackman can't contribute much to this movie. With the best will in the world, it's impossible to miss the fact that Hackman is too old to lead young, strong men into combat.  He belongs behind a desk, where his mind can save their lives; behind the controls of a chopper, he's apt to cost them their lives.Worst of all, John Moore invests the military men he intends to glorify with a large dose of that most unmilitary of traits self-pity.  Every character gets his turn to whine - and yes, I'm afraid `whine' is the word - about the political rules that make their lives tougher and more dangerous. Get this, warriors WARS ARE FOUGHT FOR POLITICAL GOALS.  A war without political goals is mere pointless murder.  No warrior has the right to expect the country to which he pledges his life to let him endanger GOOD policies (stopping genocide in Bosnia, for instance, or destroying al-Qaeda) in order to save his own skin or his comrades'.Only one thing in BEHIND ENEMY LINES is consistently good.  I have never seen a clearer portrayal of the immense devastation that civil war wreaked on the Balkans.  Nathan Crowley presents us with a bizarre, surreal moonscape of broken, twisted metal, wrecked vehicles, destroyed buildings and ruined works of art.  The sets hauntingly render the sheer waste and sense of loss.Militarism is not merely the exaltation of the military virtues courage, honor, loyalty, discipline, and teamwork.  If it were, militarism would be a good thing.  But true militarism is more than this.  It is the belief that the nation exists to serve the professional military forces, rather than the other way around.  And in this sense, BEHIND ENEMY LINES is a militarist movie in the worst sense of the word.Rating ** (an extra half star for the sets)Recommendation  Watch on TV, but only if you appreciate fine production design.

Owen Wilson has not been a favorite actor of ours, but here, he's very effective, perhaps goaded by playing opposite of one of the American cinema icons, the great Gene Hackman. It shows that with a good director, like John Moore, a story such as this takes epic proportions where a milquetoast navigator like Wilson, turns into a man of integrity, and since he has seen war right in front of him, his concept of the US Navy changes and he becomes a better man from this experience.

Acting and storyline should not be taken to seriously, but some of the story and facts were spot on (Serbian massacres).The best thing about the film is that is full of action, naive (as most of other Hollywood war films),shocking, and it feels like it lasts 60 minutes, not 2 hours.

An evil faction of the Serbian Army who participated in the genocide of Bosnian people attacks an American aircraft which was patrolling the air space.The great American actor Owen Wilson, playing a courageous American fighter pilot is shot down after a realistic and truly efficient set of special effects that will leave you speechless.And what a brilliant soundtrack all the time. It is not a secret that the movie alone is a clear example of what an American fighter pilot can do take care of local people, give signal calls to friendly troops and take photograph evidence of the Bosnian genocide. It was heart-breaking to see the mass-murderers Serbians killing all that innocent people. Thank God the Americans stopped that terrible war and Milosevic's Hitler-style plans. This movie reminds us how important is to keep freedom and the real cost of it. Gene Hackman plays the Admiral who has to take the most important decisions in the most difficult moments. As a great US NAVY commander he will do what it needs to finish the job. The UN, as usually is irrelevant and unable to take any simple decision, even if thousands of civilians' lives are pending on it. If it wasn't for American leadership, the war wouldn't have finished.All in all it is a must-see movie for everyone who is intelligent and wants to learn some history. Of course, only serious and intelligent people will understand this superb movie. "},{"Title":"Aren't films made to be entertaining?

The pilot gets killed, and the navigator is forced to take all measures necessary to escape Serb troops that are looking for him.Of course, there are some parts in the film that sound completely out of the ordinary, such as when Burnett (the main protagonist) is able to dodge hundreds of bullets chasing him.However, in the film, there are many scenes that show grim events that have occurred in the Bosnian war that devastated that nation in the early 1990's, and they show them in pretty good detail in most cases, such as a scene which shows a mass grave and Serb troops who spot it look appalled at what they see. Another is when an abandoned factory was booby trapped with mines. In real life, Bosnia still contains large numbers of mines left over from the war, even though the war ended 15 years ago.Bottom line, the movie is really good in my opinion and it is worth your time to watch. Like I said, the movie isn't perfect. But you won't be disappointed.

Not only did I learn a great deal about the conflict in Bosnia, but I witnessed the interaction of one of the great acting masters (Gene Hackman) with a young actor who continues to surprise with his depth (Owen Wilson).  The asymmetrical directing style works brilliantly in this movie; it is never staid, and is always inventive.  Behind Enemy Lines was somewhat reminiscent of Run Lola Run in that once the story gets going, it simply does not stop. A deceptively simple script that manages to push all emotional buttons. Tell me that you're not moved by the developing bond between Wilson and Hackman.  Tell me you're not gripping your seat when the F-18 is shot down.

Of course, it was funny that Lt. Chris Burnett was so lucky and didn't get shot or hurt. This was the only minus of the movie.

Luke Wilson, he's alright kind of annoying, is a navy pilot along with his friend goes on a holiday mission and gets bombed. Then the story actually starts. The scenes with the planes taking off and landing were fascinating. The parts when they were on the ship were kind of cool too. The parts with the plane getting chased by the missile and before that just them cruising along in the skies just looking around were fascinating to me. The cinematography and battle sequences were pretty cool. It was intense at some parts. The main villain was awesome, he played his part perfectly, and his ferocity in finding Luke Wilson and killing him was intense as well. This movie was really good and I really recommend it. It is old, but still not a bad watch.MPAA rated this PG-13, and I also rate it PG-13 as well, but my opinion why it is rated that is because of battle sequences and language.

The film is a non-stop action flick built around a thin story about a Navy F-18 navigator (Wilson) who ejects behind enemy lines somewhere in war torn Yugoslavia and is pursued by a rogue force of Serbs. Most of the flick is dedicated to the pursuit while the carrier battle group commander (Hackman) finds himself embroiled in politics which prevent him from effecting an extraction of his downed pilot. The film is a good action shoot with lots of pyro, firefights, stunts, effects, etc. which is built around a lukewarm dramatic thread and laminated with the trappings of Hollywood action flix. The film is just good old fashioned entertainment in spite of the many naysayers who seem to think it's everything from a documentary to a CIA propaganda plot.

Basically naval flight navigator Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is bored of reconnaissance missions, and while flying with co-pilot Stackhouse (Bad Company's Gabriel Macht) they head off course over Bosnia, and they inadvertently film evidence of war crimes. They also end up being shot down, and while injured Stackhouse is executed in cold blood, Burnett manages to get away before this, and he is now on the run from the army trying to get to a safe pick-up point. Admiral Leslie McMahon Reigart (Gene Hackman) is the man determined to help him get out alive with directions over the radio, Reigart risks losing his command if he keeps going, but he does not care. Also starring Charles Malik Whitfield as Capt. Rodway, Joaquim De Almeida as Admiral Piquet, David Keith as Master Chief Tom O'Malley, Olek Krupa as Miroslav Lokar, Vladimir Mashkov as Tracker Sasha and Marko Igonda as Bazda. Wilson seemed a bit of odd choice, since he normally does more comedy, but he does do okay, while Hackman I can agree is a little two-dimensional, and maybe if the script has been as interesting as a few of the action moments, this could have been a more admired wartime drama. Okay! "}]
