Repeat comedy. Some people might not like this movie but I thought it was good. If you like movies in general and can deal or like the 1980's and early 1990's era movies you'll enjoy this.If you like the Breakfast Club or any of the Brat Pack era movies you'll like this. It also has some good football scenes but only a few short ones so those that hate football can manage through them.Basically this movie is about college recruiting of a star high school football quarterback. He struggles with the moral question of does he go to the flashy money schools or the one where he might get an education. In the mean time his family, coach and friends all fall victim to college recruiters.Not a good movie for young children due to sexual overtones, drinking, etc. Men and women should both enjoy this movie.My favorite scene is early in the movie with Johnny in his room playing the drums with the TV and stereo going. I could really relate to this scene from my high school years. I measure movies by the question of, would I be disappointed if I had paid $10 to see it at the movie theater.

And I'm an idiot for having bought this garbage. In short, the story goes like this. Senior football player is the highlight of recruiters all over, and they all want Johnny to play for their school. He spends time, though, going to two schools who promise the most crap--money, girls, beer, whatever he wants. His coach, on the other hand, is going to blackball him if Johnny doesn't go to the school that his coach tells him because he's expecting a coaching job out of it. Meanwhile, there's an NCAA investigation going on into recruitment procedures. Blah...blah...blah...Johnny realizes what a jerk he's been (in reality, I don't think a guy like that would ever say no to incredulous amounts of material pampering) and says no way. Then, he gets some sense. The end. First of all, we have the lame story of some stud high school football player enjoying the cut throat recruitment of some hot shot colleges who promises every kind of material incentive to get him to go to school. Perhaps the film is making a valid point about the disgusting lengths colleges go to to get players on their team (a cost allocated to the rest of the students, no less). However, the movie, which plays out like a baffling unrealistic boyish fantasy of wild romps and beer busts, absorbs any sort of validity the story might have.And my copy of the video is sure to notify viewers that more sexually suggestive footage had been added than was in the original release, like any of it is worth watching anyways. Not only is the story boring watching Johnny Walker go from school to school to be pampered, but the hero of the story is unbearably obnoxious. It figures. Somewhere after his great performances in John Hughes's movies, Anthony Michael Hall seemed to turn into an unlikeable teenager, and one that never really looked like he enjoyed acting in any of the movies he was in (see Out of Bounds). Johnny Walker is some jerk kid who expects everyone to just fall in love with him. One of those characters where, no matter what he does, everything will work out his way. (Just look at the sequence where he takes revenge on his coach--what the hell are we supposed to make of that? Especially when everyone's attitude is so apathetic). Robert Downey, Jr. is an even bigger waste, and also a confusion, babbling the most idiotic lines throughout the movie. He's hardly interesting, much less funny. And, Uma Thurman, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, Georgia, doesn't seem to get anything but crap from her boyfriend.Johnny Walker epitomizes the kind of kids I hated in high school. Jocks who always got a free ride, and walked around with a holier than thou attitude like the rest of the world should kiss their feet because they knew how to toss around a football. And he's supposed to be our hero? I can learn to like 80s teen trash, but this movie is just god awful.

Sometimes they're real obvious, while others are more obscure and look to have their viewers find the deeper meaning themselves. It's also hard to say how significant a coming of age film can be when it is a Rated R comedy. Some have worked brilliantly - The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) is one. This on the other hand is a strange mix of elements that plays its cards right in some respects, while at other moments it's questionable to what the crew was thinking here. This is the story of Johnny Walker (Anthony Michael Hall), a high school athlete who has quite a fan club. After winning the last football game of the season (by cheating no less), Walker is approached by recruiter upon recruiter to play for their college team.There are also other people who want Johnny to go with their opinion. Wayne Hisler (Paul Gleason), the high school coach wants him to attend a college of his choice so he can acquire special benefits and he'll do anything to make sure it happens. Johnny's mom and grandpa want him to get an education more than a sports scholarship and his girlfriend Georgia (Uma Thurman) wants him to attend State with her. So many opinions, which one will he choose?! Well, Johnny ends up attending mostly all of their open houses. This ends up having him being bribed with things that seem almost unrealistic or things that have nothing to do with getting an education or playing football. Of course fame grants several of these things but at a high school level? The kid and his team didn't even play fairly winning the last game so how does that even qualify? Are the refs that blind?Plus, what's even more shocking is to how this production was able to gather now famous actors when they were starting off and the chemistry feels almost nonexistent. And, the screenplay was completed by three writers, all of which worked on Revenge of the Nerds (1984). How is that barely any charm are given to these characters? There are only a couple of moments that Johnny goes through that actually develop him as a character. Other than that he's placed in silly events that should trigger his conscience saying he shouldn't be there. The best parts of the film are when Johnny's family is on screen. Somehow they seem to have the best lines and character arcs. My favorite family member was the grandfather (George Hall). Such a nice old man.Uma Thurman's character has a very typical character arc, loves her boyfriend - finds him as a jerk briefly - then resorts back to him. Possibly the strangest of all is Robert Downey Jr.'s character. Either he tries too hard to be funny or his jokes don't make any sense. It's baffling, I guess Downey Jr. didn't realize how much funnier he is when he says his lines deadpan than actually trying to be comical. Fans might also get a kick out of actor Marshal Bell's performance as Uma Thurman's dad, also the chief of police. He has some funny one liners at times too. All right enough of the characters. Jay Ferguson's music to the film is appropriately set but doesn't have anything to remember about it. Was it a comedy that had laughs galore? Not so much. Does it feel like a coming of age movie? Not really.The cast contains famous actors of today in their youth and has a moral somewhere in its story but its delivery is overshadowed by hit and miss comedy. Much of the events that take place feel impossible too, decreasing its believability.

It aims to achieve the irreverent humor of a film like Stripes combined with the titillation of Porky's. Almost every character in this film is a caricature. You can tell a lot of people put a lot of work into this film, so where does it go wrong?First, the film's primary story--about a football phenom who is unscrupulously recruited by every powerhouse program in the country--is a serious drag on the humor. There is nothing funny about the sacrifice of educational values to the football money machine.Secondly, the film tries to include every standard feature of every youth comedy film--the clueless adults, the topless scenes, the humor centering on sex and alcohol--and in so doing, becomes a parody of itself.I am deducting one point just for the colossal waste of talent.Robert Downey Jr. is wasted here, playing the wacky sidekick. Uma Thurman's performance as the hometown girlfriend is lost in the silliness. The entire film is predictable, sometimes cringe-worthy, and boring.In a scene near the end of the film Hall, Downey and Thurman drive off in a convertible to begin their post-high school lives and there is a sense of what this film could have been an interesting exploration of the lives of three kids who have issues to face and things to learn.

What makes this young man so incredibly special? Judging from Hall's extra-bland demeanor, he certainly isn't capable of arousing a large crowd with his enthusiasm for the sport. The three screenwriters (who also served as co-producers!) do charmless work; they cannot wait to get the leading character out of town in order to incorporate wild parties and strip-joints into the mix. The raunch is most likely what sold the movie to Orion Pictures, who were obviously hoping to tap into the then-popular John Hughes market (the company later added more sex to the home-video version after the film did modest business in theaters). Unfortunately, writers Steve Zacharias, Jeff Buhai, and David Obst show absolutely none of Hughes' comic sensibility or sensitivity, and director Bud Smith directs with a leaden touch. True to form in '80s teen flicks, all the adults are ignorant, money-grubbing whores while our well-scrubbed hero stands head-and-shoulders above the chaos.

I can imagine others getting more out of this noisy and ridiculous flick about a high-school football hero being courted by various colleges who offer him money, bribes, margaritas, and of course sexy women.I can imagine most of those others being adolescents because the film illustrates and endorses all the adolescent virtues. That wouldn't in itself be the kiss of death. Some very amusing movies have been made about adolescence.But -- well, let me give two examples of humor in this movie. You're supposed to laugh at both of them.The story opens with a football game. One of the cheer leaders on our side has removed her pants. The two rival teams line up. The quarterback on our team shouts, Hey, that cheerleader has no pants on! The rival team glances over and our side bursts through their line.Example number two. The happy family of the hero is seated around the family dinner table and chatting away. Even the little daughter with the missing front teeth asks impudent questions. The scene closes with the family members and the guest throwing pieces of food at each other and laughing.If you find this funny, if you like loud electronic guitars and pounding percussion, if you find raunchy comments about genitals amusing in themselves, you will enjoy this movie.I don't know how it ended because I couldn't watch it all the way through, but I imagine that Johnny the football hero gives up money, celebrity, beer, and girls, joins a monastery and becomes a contemplative monk.

The filmmakers proved me wrong each time.The script was clunky, the photography is badly framed and poorly shot, and much of the film just doesn't make any sense. Also, there isn't a single sequence the conclusion of which you can't see coming from a mile away- come on, of COURSE Johhny's side was going to win the impromptu football game when he has one hand shackled behind his back- and his girl is the prize!

He really acts as if he didn't really want to do this film, in spite of the fact that he DID want a vehicle that would break his Brat Pack Geek-in-Chief image. I felt sorry for him. He was really cute, but that was it. His character, Johnny Walker, speaks to a crowd of having embarrassed himself towards the end of the picture. To me, it seemed that Hall delivered those lines with utter conviction, and I'm not surprised. If this were on my resume, I'd deny it. Hall has, of course, gone on to a viable and even admirable career. I guess it's really true that you can't keep a good man down, even if he makes such a potentially suicidal career choice as this film. It's a testament to the man's drive and determination to succeed that he left trash like this far behind him and kept working.Another gripe I have screenwriters Zacharias and Buhai wrote the original Revenge of the Nerds, so they ought to have known what would work in a Youth comedy. Apparently they forgot.The two worst aspects of this film, however, were these first, it was unbelievably boring (and a bad movie that is boring is the worst bad movie of all); secondly, the lampooning of corruption in collegiate football is a viable topic and it could have worked if the script had been decent, the story been told in a logically plotted arc, Bud Smith hadn't directed and Hall had acted like he cared (and not mumbled his lines as if he were auditioning for the first time at a Junior High School's offering of Romeo and Juliet.)

Characters come in and out of that scene without rhyme or reason--continuity errors abound. There are also many scenes in which weird dialog was looped in during post-production to bridge awkward narrative gaps. This is a sure sign that the director didn't really know what he was doing, and just failed to capture footage that made sense on its own.Also, Robert Downey, Jr. is unbelievably obnoxious in this movie.

Yes it's your typical 80's cheese with all the clichés, but it's fun cheese, and Anthony Michael Hall performed very well actually as Johnnie Walker, plus It's got your typical awesome 80's music as well!. I actually had never heard of this film, until I came across it in the rental section, so I decided to rent it, it wasn't bad at all, and This was Uma's 1st major role, and she did alright, and was great eye candy, plus while the ending cheesy as hell, it put a smile on my face. OK so it has a mediocre script, so what it was still fairly enjoyable to watch, and Paul Gleason plays a great asshole as always, plus I don't have a foot fetish or anything but Uma's feet are gorgeous!. Put your brain at the door and you probably will get some amusement out of it, though it is predictable, and I thought all the characters were quite likable for the most part ,plus It's rather well made too for the most part. This is surprisingly rather decent actually, as it managed to amuse me throughout, with a watchable story, and solid performances in my opinion,worth the watch. The Direction is decent. Bud S. Smith does a decent job here with good camera work, and just keeping the film amusing throughout. The acting is surprisingly fun. Anthony Michael Hall is actually really good as Johnnie Walker and was the main reason I was able to enjoy this film,he was cocky, but charismatic and funny just the same, he also had good chemistry with Thurman and Downey.Jr, and was just very entertaining to watch, it's sad this guy's career never really took off because he's awesome!. Robert Downey Jr. is pretty funny here as the best friend, he shared good chemistry with hall, and seemed to be having fun his role, I liked him lots. Paul Gleason as always plays a great asshole, and here is no different. Uma Thurman is incredibly gorgeous and does just fine in her 1st major role, she was likable and had good chemistry with Hall!., just wish they gave her more screen time. Steve James is rather wasted here but was cool as always when on screen. Marshall Bell is amusing as the chief father. Jennifer Tilly is amusing in her role as Gleason's wife. Rest of the cast are OK. Overall worth the watch. **1/2 out of 5(almost ***) "},{"Title":"Great Movie","Date":"24 October 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sport","Review":" This movie was made to be a comedy and not some kind of great documentary. If you didn't play quarterback in high school then you might not like this movie or understand it. Soundtrack was great and Paul Gleason as the coach is flat out the best high school football coach ever in a movie period! His pregame speech before the state championship game at the beginning of the movie is classic. It ranks just ahead of John Goodman in Revenge of the Nerds. Watch this classic over and over again and remember how unimportant high school football coaches really are in life! There are way worse movies out there than Johnny Be Good! This movie is not even close to being as cheesy as Varsity Blues, even though I quite enjoyed that movie as well. Obviously neither one of these movies are going to win an Oscar, but not all movies are made to win an Oscar. This movie is way better than Eyes Wide Shut and you could watch Johnny Be Good twice and go out to dinner before Eyes Wide Shut is over.

(It's a toss-up between this and Mixed Nuts). It embodies everything that was wrong with movies during the 80s, the worst decade for cinema ever. MTV film technique, vapid scripts, no story depth, cornball happy endings and the typical, irresponsible Let's pander to teens by portraying the parents as wrong when they're really not all wrong attitude. I hate this movie.

The fact that Hall is not exactly built like a football player at this stage of his career doesn't prevent one from enjoying this Brat Pack film which does actually have some serious things to say about college athletic recruiting.Hall plays a rather likable young kid who has the world by the short hairs of the scrotum with every college bidding for his services. Some of them go to some rather extravagant lengths as a school in Texas and California wine and dine him with just about everything any 18 year old could want in this world.Brat Pack films have a special place in the career of actor Paul Gleason who made a career of playing authority figures that Brat Pack kids would flout with impunity. No exception here in Johnny Be Good. Gleason plays Hall's high school coach and he's also in on the payola if there's any to be had. Gleason's one saving grace is that he has a lovely daughter Jennifer Tilly who is really in love with Hall. She has to get the sincerity from her mother's side.And there's a special part in her for Uma Thurman, wife of the head of Texas boosters who picks out a special boy in every class for her favorite. Talk about a cougar stalking prey.Even Howard Cossell makes an appearance here, lending some sports authenticity to the film. Cossell playing himself as no one else ever could is doing some investigative journalism into the whole recruiting mania surrounding Hall.Johnny Be Good is a likable Brat Pack comedy, as likable as its star. And this film is dedicated to Steven 'Kip' Loney who looked and sounded just like Anthony Michael Hall and who unfortunately died way too young. Kip this one's for you.

I normally like Uma Thurman, but her role in this is small and dispensable. There are so many implausible scenes which are so bad that they become funny. It is so bad that it becomes entertaining. For example, where did the well dressed cheerleaders come from in the spontaneous game in front of Georgia's house? And that flamboyant outfit Johnny goes home with is ridiculously bad. Leo Wiggins, played by Robert Downey Jr., has very little screen time, but he is memorable role in a bad way. He is so crazy that he is painful to look at.Maybe it was a good film by 80's standards, but watching it 20 years down the line, it has become an embarrassing joke.

I thought this movie could be good having Uma Thurman, and Robert Downey Jr, but boy was i wrong. Luckily this was on HBO during a lazy saturday afternoon where i had nothing to do so i wouldn't feel so bad having wasted an hour and a half of my life on this bad movie. They really could have found someone better than Anthony Michael Hall in the role of the star football player choosing a school to go to. "}]
