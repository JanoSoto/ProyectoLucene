[{"Title":"A must-see for fans of campy, cheesy horror","Date":"12 January 2005","Score":"28 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" As an infant, Jonathan Graves is absconded from his father, Malcolm (Michael Des Barres), the leader of a black magic cult, when Malcolm almost sacrifices Jonathan in a ritual. 25 years later, Jonathan (Peter Liapis) learns that his father has passed away and he has inherited his estate, including a large home that is now in disrepair. He moves there with Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan), and soon after begins acting strangely, instinctively following his father's footsteps.If you're a fan of campy, cheesy horror films, as I am, Ghoulies is a must see. Everyone else should probably avoid this film. This is a Charles Band production. Charles Band means Empire/Full Moon, and Empire/Full Moon is almost a guarantee of some campiness/cheesiness. Not many of Band's films, however, approach the sublime ridiculousness of Ghoulies. We're almost in Troma territory here, but Ghoulies is played much more seriously than the typical Troma production, and in this case, it works to increase the entertainment value.Since Ghoulies was made in 1984, it features most of the mid-80s horror film clich√©s. Shortly after moving in, Graves throws a party, so we get big hair, tight miniskirts, skinny ties, recreational drug use, and so on. We also get our eventual fodder for our body count, although in this case, it is worth noting that writer/director Luca Bercovici introduces a twist near the end that significantly decreases the body count.Liapis is the focus of the film, though, and without him, Ghoulies might be more boring than campy. His absurd overacting, often in solo scenes, takes up a majority of screen time. Still, just the brief presence of two demonic minions, Grizzel and Greedigut, would alone make Ghoulies a must see, especially given how everyone continues their attempt to play the film seriously when they appear. And I haven't even mentioned the other ridiculous minions, which are obviously puppets and dead props (Band seems to love puppets), and were the beginning of a horror industry attempt to cash in on the success of Gremlins (also seen later in such films as the Critters series and Munchies). We also get zombies, a Star Wars-like battle of wizards, sunglasses as a major plot device, an evil doll, an attack with a 5 foot long tongue, and some probably unintentional homoerotic subtext. Who could pass all of that up? The film gets a 7 out of 10 from me--an 8 out of 10 would have been in order, except for the inexplicable absence of gratuitous nudity.Note that while Ghoulies is tagged comedy/horror, it's very unlikely that it was intended to be a comedy in any way. Even if Band applied the label to the film prior to release, it was probably because even he realized how ludicrous the film turned out. At any rate, it would be misguided to watch it expecting intentional humor.

The Ghoulies themselves looked incredibly life-like with grossed-out slobber and nasty sharp teeth. However, I thought the battle between good and evil could have been played out over a longer period of time. This monk comes from nowhere and saves the day in a matter of minutes. The evil guy's son was also drawn to the dark-side too quickly. He moves into his new mansion and begins practicing the dark arts in the same evening during the first party. How uncool. He yells at his guests and quits school the very next day. He should have at least heard voices for a few days first.

In GHOULIES, a young man moves into an old mansion and before you know it, he is attempting to conjure up a bunch of hellish critters to do his bidding. Soon enough, he has them going after his enemies. The ghoulies themselves are hand puppets that look pretty ferocious for hand puppets. The conjurer, played by an insufferable actor named Peter Liapus, has been possessed by a dark spirit that resides in the old house. A little too much time is spent on the guy and his conjuring, but once the ghoulies get going, watch out! This comedy horror film stands out among many similar flicks from that era. It was obviously inspired by GREMLINS, but in the end it in no way resembles that now-forgotten classic. Worth a look if you can buy the idea of puppet monsters. PUPPETMASTER had the same theme and look, and was also an Empire Pictures job, if I am not mistaken.

It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic. A young man and his girlfriend move into an man's old mansion home, where he becomes possessed by a need to control ancient demons. This does remind me a lot of Ghoulies II. The comparisons are obvious, and just like that film, I like it enough, but I don't think it's great or all that really good. I happen to know places and people, some that might pass for the world in Ghoulies. That said, the directing, music, editing, etc. are not focused on at all. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $7, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated.

Having just recently revisited the world of Ghoulies, and just about to embark on my fortieth year on this earth, I have hand on heart began to realise that what I liked when I was a teenager, has not remained the case as I've gotten older.No matter what the detractors think of Charles Band's riff on Gremlins, the movie does have more plus points than negatives. The overall acting is pretty spot on, Peter Liapis as Jonathan Graves truly devours his part as Jonathan Graves, heir apparent to the supernatural throne left to him by his late demented father Malcolm, Michael Des Barres.Des Barres has never been an actor that I've been to keen on, maybe it's his accent that I find somewhat off putting, but then again if you've ever watched him in Diary Of A Sex Addict, the title pretty much summed that movie up, but let us not forget his turn in Nightflyers.You know when your a teenager, and you just watch copious amounts of nonsense, you tens to forget what you've watched and just who was in it, back in 85, I had no idea who Jack Nance was, but then I still hadn't watched Eraserhead, but Nance participation was a bit of a shock to me, I did find myself doing a double take when I spotted him hiding behind that fake beard, but you never forget that crazy eyed stare.But what about the movie itself. Like I've mentioned previously, viewing the movie as an adult, you still sensed the atmosphere, those pesky Ghoulies, still look as cheap and cheerful and not quite scary as ever, but Luca Bercovici does capture some pretty good stuff on camera.Of particular mention was the scene when Malcolm rises from his grave, quite striking and very well lit.Ghoulies was my first introduction to Charles Band, but it wasn't until I watched Trancers, that my interest in Band's output truly took hold of my teenage years, and throughout the next two decades.Ghoulies 2 was a smart little follow up three years later, ignore the next two sequels, as really you can't hold a candle to the original.My rating is 6/10 "},{"Title":"Bait and Switch","Date":"4 February 2006","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Ghoulies kinda threw me for a loop.

But I finally caught it, and found nothing like I expected. Not that that turned out to be a terribly good thing, but at least it gave me a moment of hope.Jonathan Graves inherits the old ancestral mansion, and discovers that he apparently comes from a long line of satanic occultists. Of course, he can't help but pick up the old family tradition. His friends think this is eccentric, and his girlfriend Rebbecca thinks he's a worthless slacker who's wasting time he could be spending fixing up the house. But he gets results, and soon the mansion is populated with a startling number of tiny demon puppets and two helpful midgets that only Jonathan can see.Rebecca finally puts her foot down and demands an end to all the Satanism, so what does Jonathan do? He mind-controls her, which not only ends her criticism, but allows him to dress her up in slutty outfits. (This is where any remaining sympathy I had for Jonathan went out the window.) Then he invites all his friends up so that he can use them in an occult ritual which he believes will grant him vast power, but which actually resurrects his dead, Satanist ancestor (dad? gramps? I was never really sure), who shows up spoiling for a fight.The puppets go (mildly) berserk, everyone dies, and Jonathan and Gramps have their showdown. Of course, good triumphs (if you can consider a guy who's been summoning demons, bargaining for occult power, and mind-controlling his girlfriend, the good guy). Then, everybody comes back to life in one of the biggest cheats in all slasherdom. Have they no shame?

In his rituals he manages to conjure up personifications of the demons; Vepar, Procell and Astaroth in the form of bogus-looking, puppet-like goblins. This is hopelessly contrived and laughable as the ghastly dwarfs hang around and wreck havoc on a group of unlikable, snobbish idiots after Liapis fulfills his final master ritual. Its typical Charles Band stuff as the cast takes the ridiculousness seriously, and one can only suspect that the idea was loosely ripped off from the incomparable hit, 'Gremlins' Its fun if you like to watch slimy, rubbery toys attack people, and some will get a laugh out of the most absurd and incoherent of plot-lines.

Critters, which most consider the better film, came out a year later and made a lot less than this one.  Then there was the famous scene of the creature coming out of the toilet.  It made it look like a Gremlin type movie...funny with a bit of charm to it.  It fooled my parents and we saw this dog in the theater when I was ten.  We knew it wasn't quite what it was advertised as though as soon as it started as it has a scene where a guy rips out a woman's heart.  It isn't all bad though as there are some scenes here and there that are good, but overall this one is just bad as it is not just about little creatures, but a bunch of other satanic stuff as well as this guy throws a party and does rituals and accidentally raises this one evil guy.  Sounds better than it is though as there are no stars in this one and none of the actors in this one can act.  You do though get to see the little person who played ET.

I was waiting the entire movie for a puppet to pop out of a toilet, and never got it! Aside from that this movie is still pretty bad. The main actor has some weird green eyes that glow when he invokes them (I guess). I don't really know, because they don't explain it, and they show up when he is more menacing than he normally is. I also didn't understand why they had to wear sunglasses towards the end. He could turn his weird green eyes off when he wanted. He didn't need the sun glasses. I also didn't get why the main character decided he had to quit school to clean up a house. Why wouldn't you just clean up the house after school??? It didn't make any sense. The movie is filled with pretty subpar acting. For some reason a female costar that seems like she was already in her fifties, but her actual age hadn't caught up to her yet. The ghoulies were the best part, but you only see them for maybe, maybe, 10 minutes out of the whole movie. There were also these two dwarfs that showed up for no real reason except to drink some liquid, and fight against their original master (maybe?)

As a representative of the 80's teenage puppet horror schlock genre, it has no equal. Plus it has -- in addition to the most gratuitous midgets to appear on screen in the entire history of midget cinema, and I'm including The Terror of Tiny Town in that generalization -- a fabulous, frothing, scenery-gnawing performance by Michael Des Barres, who fancied himself an actor for quite awhile despite being continually proved wrong.The movie opens with a group of robed satanists preparing to sacrifice a baby in the basement of a mansion. As the head satanist raises his knife, a woman darts out of the crowd and shrieks No! Not our child! thus revealing the head satanist, Malcolm (Michael Des Barres) as the baby's father. Malcolm gives the woman a poisonous look with his glowing green eyes and summons puppet demons to eat her for her intransigence; in the m√™l√©e, no one notices as Wolfgang (Jack Nance, the artist formerly known as Eraserhead) gathers up the baby and spirits him away.Fast forward 20-something years. The baby has grown up to be Jonathan (Peter Liapis) and has inherited the mansion where he was once almost killed on an altar and where, presumably, his mother was eaten by evil puppets. He must not know the history of the place, though, because he moves right on in with his girlfriend Rebecca (the cat-faced Lisa Pelikan) and begins to clean the place up. They appear to be college students with the usual quota of wacky friends without whom no 80's movie would be complete the slutty girl, the nerd, the stupid hunk, etc.During the cleanup, Jonathan discovers a pentagram on the basement floor and opens a trunk full of his father's satanist regalia. This frees his spirit to leap headlong into the wholesale worship of evil, despite the fact that he has never shown a tendency toward black magic before in his life and was, up to this moment, known as a pretty decent chap.At a housewarming party, Jonathan shows his friends the basement set-up and, having ascertained that he needs seven people to actually do any useful evil, he chants a spell in front of them. They make fun of him and he takes it badly, but the end result -- unknown to his friends -- is the summoning of a dozen ugly little demons of the sort who ate his mother. Oedipus? Can you hear me calling you, son? When Rebecca catches him swanning around the basement in satin robes, she stomps off in disgust. He woos her back, only to scare the crap out of her with some impromptu satanistic S&M action in the bedroom. When she leaves again, he decides the only way to get this party started is to get him some minions. Accordingly, he zaps Rebecca with Satan mind control, invites all his friends to dinner, hypnotizes them so they won't notice the puppet monsters drooling in the soup, and completes the circle. When next we see his friends, they are wearing long white robes and sitting around the pentagram in the basement. For an amateur, Jonathan is pretty good.Suddenly there is a flash! and a bang! and two tiny, ugly creatures appear in front of Jonathan, ready to do his bidding. Thus do we meet Grizzel and Greedigut, surely the worst movie roles ever essayed by midget actors (Peter Risch and the enchantingly-named Tamara De Treaux). They promise everlasting devotion and gambol off to do Jonathan's bidding, while his friends, freed from their spell, wander around the house smoking doobies and screwing in the bushes as the demons pick them off one at a time.Unfortunately, Johnathan reckoned without Malcolm. As the ghoulies happily disembowel his friends, each sacrifice gives the spirit of the Decadent Marquis a little more strength. Eventually he bursts out of his grave on the mansion grounds and strides into the house -- rotting as he goes -- to do battle with the punk kid he should have dispatched years ago in the basement. Hijinks ensue, Jonathan defeats Malcolm at his own game (much to the detriment of poor Wolfgang), his dead friends come back to life, and everyone flees the mansion at a run. Predictably (because there were sequels) the back seat of Jonathan's car is revealed to be full of puppet ghoulies.A couple of things. First, who was Peter Liapis and why didn't I know about him before? He's really hot. I mean, really, really hot. Second, Lisa Pelikan has a place in my heart because she appeared in the schlockiest ever Movie of the Week, I Want To Keep My Baby! with Mariel Hemingway. Third, Michael Des Barres was NOT an actor, and should never have let his wife write I'm With The Band because the whole time I was watching Ghoulies I was thinking, you slept with a Plaster Caster? The Hell? On second thought, maybe this movie wasn't so great after all.

They're mere window dressing for a strange and complicated story, and the ones that do appear are laughable! They look like s****y old diseased sock puppets, and that's not easy for me to say because the sequel is one of my all-time favourite horror movies, I'd strongly urge you to check out that one it you wanna see a Ghoulies movie done right. It's so horribly in-your-face and dead to-the-max 80s! From the wardrobe to the attitudes and practically everything, particularly when it comes to some of the more cartoony and obnoxious smaller characters, like that old guy who's constantly wearing shades.. What the hell was that asshole on at the time!? Break dancing scene, what the f**k!?! I really can't stand the red-headed Lisa Pelican as Rebecca, she's so embarrassingly melodramatic with all of her lines and whenever the camera's focusing on her face she's always off in a fog and terribly posing as if like Sophia Loren! Awful actress. I also didn't like the two dwarf characters. Now I've nothing against those kinds of people, in fact to me their performances were actually very good, but they weren't monsters, and in my opinion to jerk around with the audience that they are when there's already supposed to be little monsters running around is just bogus. It's the same cheap gag that they would later base the entire rotten fourth 'Ghoulies' movie around. I positively adored the spirited performance of Michael Des Barnes as the delightfully fiendish Malcolm Graves. He really gives it his all and even though he goes ridiculously grandiose with it, it sure works. I can't recall ever seeing another horror movie villain quite like him. I love all of his charmingly bizarre inflections, how he goes from softly-spoken to roaring in a second! And it's so awesomely wrong when he demands to kiss his son to steal his soul!! I thought he was far more charismatic than the guy who played his son, I just found iy plain cringe-worthy whenever he was trying to be commanding. They also should've ditched the silly and unnecessary narrating. It was like I was watching Troll 2 all over again.. I think that I may have liked this better if they'd have just done away with any pretence of it being about little monsters and made it a straight-up story of resurrected sorcerous evil battling against its estranged offspring it could've stood on its own merit surely! I mean they certainly should have kept the ghoulies in it, just not made it out as if the entire movie was about them.. And you know, I'm wrong in a way because the marketing did pay off big time for the studio, and if I don't quite get it then I'm still very glad because it allowed them to create some later gems that I do wholeheartedly love and regard as classics. It's such a weird little mish-mash of a flick. By degrees it's a crazy party horror movie, then a domestic drama, then it's an epic magical fight of good vs evil - it's everything except a solid horror that knows what it wants to be, and that's a bit of a shame. I'm not saying it isn't fun, but it's a mess. It's a fun mess! Everything about it is extremely tacky and rough but that could perhaps only add to the appeal for some fans. It's certainly not lacking in creativity. It's a fun and entertaining piece of horror trash if you're in the right frame of mind and is worthy of a watch every now and then. Shut up, goddammit!

This means combining comedy (which, in this case, is never really that funny) and horror (although the movie sure ain't scary at all) and trying to go for a playful approach. The result is a movie that does have some fun moments, but nothing special enough to make it compare to its inspiration.Eric Roberts lookalike Peter Liapis stars as Jonathan Graves, who moves with his girlfriend Rebecca (pretty Lisa Pelikan of the Carrie ripoff Jennifer) into the mansion he's just inherited. Turns out his dad Malcolm (pop singer Michael Des Barres, in a hilariously unsubtle turn) was one of a group of Satan worshippers, and the mansion has been home to demons in the past. As any moron character in this type of genre movie would do, Jonathan lets his curiosity get the better of him, and he becomes obsessed with wearing robes and performing rituals. The title creatures show up to create mayhem, followed by an endearing pair of little people (Peter Risch, Tamara De Treaux).The Ghoulies themselves don't get to do all that much; they would be brought more to the forefront for the sequels. The human cast - including Scott Thomson (Police Academy), Ralph Seymour (Just Before Dawn), Keith Joe Dick, and Mariska Hargitay in her film debut - is amusing, but it's the Ghoulies who are the most fun. Jack Nance of Eraserhead fame is wasted as the wise old caretaker of the mansion. Bobbie Bresee (Mausoleum) has a bit as a temptress. Special effects and makeup by John Carl Buechler and his company are generally pretty good.

However rather than giving him supernatural knowledge, Johnathan soon finds out he's been tricked & it was instead a supernatural ritual to bring back his long dead father, a serious practitioner of the black arts determined to live again! Once resurrected from his earthly grave, he dispatches the creatures, who would rather listen to him & turn their back on Johnathan, to dispatch all of Johnathan's friends. Bringing his son to him, where he will attempt to sacrifice his son to the devil, something he failed to do eighteen years prior.GHOULIES is a pretty fun horror/comedy that has been cited by many genre fans as a rip-off of GREMLINS while I can understand them saying this, since it arrived after GREMILINS, I strongly disagree with that statement. GHOULIES was an idea thought up in 1982 by B movie Producer CHARLES BAND (who planned to direct the film himself) & the late special effects wizard STAN WINSTON called BEASTIES. One of the things that made GHOULIES a box office success (minus coming right after GREMLINS) was the films box art, which featured one of the creatures popping up out of a toilet bowl. Minus one blink & you'll miss it sequence, the Ghoulies are not birthed in a toilet, nor do the creatures have anything whatsoever to do with toilets. The poster was such a success, that the next two sequels that followed it also contained the same poster art. What's funny (maybe it was unintentional?) is the name Ghoulies or goolies is a vernacular expression for testicles. Despite it's cheesiness, GHOULIES is reasonably well acted & has some fun characters on hand. MICHAEL DES BARRES is perfection as Johnathan's witchcraft meddling father, a real spooky individual who makes for a really fun horror movie villain & it's a shame he didn't appear in any of the sequels or even get a horror film on his own. Despite the title & the creature on the box art, the Ghoulies really don't serve the plot much at all, at least until the last fifteen minutes of the movie, when they are dispatched to start picking off the house guests. The Ghoulies are mere window dressing to help sell the film, who's real story concerns Johnathan getting over his head in the dark arts & becoming more evil & his fight with his evil dad, who the caretaker (in narration) has mentioned he died a horrible death, but the film never does tell us what happened to him or how long he has been dead for. ERASERHEAD'S own the late JACK NANCE, stars as the creepy withdrawn caretaker & former member of the old cult, who saved Johnathan from being sacrificed as an infant. Yet despite top billing, Nance's spends a total of five minutes tops, with his role spread evenly throughout the film's beginning & ending. The films comedy is pretty funny at times & some of the dispatches are great. The film is a tad sluggish at times & really does get a little hokey in areas, but overall it remains a pretty fun movie. In the end, maybe it's because I saw this movie when I was little that I have a better appreciation for it than most people, since the majority of reviews from fans & critics clearly outweigh the positive ones. Maybe if I saw it when I was much older, I'd feel the same way as others do, who knows? but as is, I highly enjoyed GHOULIES. Some have come to prefer the next two sequels (not counting Part 4) because the Ghoulies were featured more, the effects were better & they fit the story lines better as the main bad guys & not supporting villains on the sidelines like they are here, but I think I will always prefer the first one. It has some good comedy, I liked the slimy dead serious Ghoulies (they got jokier in the sequels) there was a few nice moments of suspense & tension (Loved the life sized clown doll, who kept popping up all over the house, he was really creepy!) I loved the villain Malcolm & the film mystical qualities helped give it an extra creepy feel. To be truthful, I think many people who hated it, were upset that the film really wasn't anything like GREMLINS, or a film that at the very least surpassed it. If you can look past some of it's short comings, GHOULIES remains a highly entertaining B movie popcorn flick. Followed by three sequels starting with GHOULIES II **** stars "},{"Title":"A Film From Charles Band's Golden Age","Date":"5 October 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" A young man (Peter Liapis) and his girlfriend (Lisa Pelikan) move into an man's old mansion home, where he becomes possessed by a need to control ancient demons.This comes from the golden age of Charles Band's producing, despite the film's incredibly low ranking.

Among its best, and worst, qualities here is that ever-present cheese on display which coincides with the whole atmosphere and appearance of the creatures, the house and the incredibly obvious attitudes here showcasing the eras quite well, yet also making it really hard to take the action seriously in here because these make the film quite goofy against the serious subject matter. No matter how badly they try otherwise, the creature nothing more than puppets, which never really convinces all too often yet makes this so fun here by making the attacks quite enjoyable and cheesy. That carries into this one with some incredibly fun moments from the creatures starting with the resurrection in the basement during the glorious Satanic rituals, the continuous disappearing clown doll around the house and fine graveyard sequence where they interact with the guests in some thrilling scenes here to take advantage of the great warped, cuddly look of the creatures. While this is quite fun and full of cheesy charms, there's still a few other flaws here in this one. The other big flaw beyond the cheese is the rather short length of this, never really getting a chance to have the creatures themselves involved much in the film as it spends a large portion of time with them wandering around the house, which takes up a lot of time that could've been used for the creatures. This also manages to hold off the later half here where, once out and about in the story, are pretty much rendered an afterthought in their own movies all due to the short length and diversions away from the central figures. This is really the biggest issue at work against the film outright, even though the film's cheese is another big factor here to overcome with the goofy look and atmosphere being something to get over. These are the film's good points.Rated PG-13 Violence, Language and a mild Sex Scene.

Apparently this thing started off as a higher-budget R-rated horror film but then the budget was slashed and they decided to aim at the kid market. Well, this here was obviously a mistake because what remains in the film is a semi-horror film that's too tame to go all the way yet at the same time there's really nothing here that would appeal to children. I think the producers forgot that they were trying to aim this at kids and instead us poor viewers were left to suffer. The story itself is a pretty silly one that takes way too long to get going. At just 82-minutes this film seems twice as long and this might be due to the fact that the actual ghoulies don't appear until around the forty-minute mark. Even when they do arrive they don't exactly bring any excitement with them as they're just not scary enough to have any impact. A lot of the violence is also off screen so gore fans aren't going to get any of that here. Even worse is that there are a couple sexual scenes here that have been toned down and in this condition they just really don't serve any purpose to the film. Of course, in a R-rated film they might have at least been used just to show off some cheap nudity. The performances are pretty much what you'd expect from a film like this. John Carl Buechler does a fine job with the special effects but sadly they're not used nearly enough. GHOULIES might appeal to those who enjoy bad 80s movies but the rest should just stay clear.

But for some reason, this really became a cult favourite, and for the life of me, I cannot begin to think why.The effects are awful, the acting is very bad, and the story, just doesn't excite or stimulate.It's trying to be Gremlins, and that movie is a bona-fide cult favourite, because it's actually brilliant and highly original.This is just bad..

This however doesn't mean that the movie can just get away with everything, especially not when it throws away most of its fun and decides to turn into an occult horror movie, in which just nothing interesting ever happens.What are even Ghoulies? And what do they want? This movie its story is so bad that it doesn't even bother to explain anything. Besides, it isn't being very original in any way and it 'borrows' a lot from different horror movies. But the foremost problem remains the story. It just doesn't seem to have a point in it and it isn't really ever heading anywhere.As an horror flick it also is definitely lacking in some good horror. The movie isn't providing any scares and even though it has a decent atmosphere, it doesn't ever make the movie a tense, mysterious or exciting one to watch. Perhaps they could had spiced things up a little bit more with some good gore but the movie mostly remains on the clean and safe side. The special effects, make-up and puppets and all also aren't always too convincing looking, which adds to the camp-level of the movie but also is a killer for the movie its horror and just story in general.The movie must had done something right though. It became quite a big box office success. It only had a 1 million dollar budget but the profit was 35 times that amount. After this they also made 3 more sequels, which supposedly are all even worse than this establishment, which is a real accomplishment on its own.

Sporting several of the same crew members who would later be reteamed for TROLL (1986; see my comments above), it deals with the Satanic goings-on in an abandoned Italian villa perpetrated by the long-lost son of a Cult leader (whose demise occurs at the film‚Äôs very start) to the eventual indifference of his goofy, pot-headed group of friends (including Mariska Hargitay, the daughter of Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield, who had escaped unscathed in the freak car accident which took the life of her actress mum).Unfortunately, unlike the preceding Gremlins or the later Trolls, the titular creeps don‚Äôt have much of a personality; they are the handiwork of John Carl Buechler who later stepped behind the camera to inflict on an unsuspecting world such works of dubious artistry as TROLL (which, actually, wasn‚Äôt half-bad), Friday THE 13TH PART VII THE NEW BLOOD (1988; which has already receded irretrievably into my subconscious) and even GHOULIES III GHOULIES GO TO COLLEGE (1991)!!

I remember seeing this one as a teenager and thinking even way back then that it wasn't much good, but when it came on Turner Classic Movies this past weekend, I couldn't help myself and gave it a whirl, figuring that I could use a blast of '80s cheez nostalgia.Unfortunately, even nostalgia can't save this dog of a movie. The script is absolutely nonsensical (and appears to have been made up as the filmmakers went along), the acting's terrible, and the creatures, though cool looking, don't really get to do much once we finally see'em.Our story (such as it is) twenty something Jonathan has inherited a big ole mansion that belonged to his parents, who were bigwigs in the local Satanic cult. Jonathan starts messing with the leftover black magic stuff in the basement and boom, conjures up a bunch of nasty looking little creatures who begin snacking on his idiot friends. Unfortunately, Jonathan's too busy trying to patch things up with his girlfriend to notice this or the fact that he's accidentally resurrected his dead father (played by rocker Michael Des Barres), who happens to be conveniently buried on the property. Thus, a battle for supreme power ensues, via lots of cheap special effects, yelling and screaming. The ending is not really an ending, it's just one more shock scene to set up the inevitable sequel (of which there were three, if memory serves).Ghoulies has some cool looking (for its time) creature and puppet effects (a trademark of most Charles Band/Empire productions) and Band's combo of Gothic Horror and high camp would serve the studio well in their seemingly dozens of creature features that followed this one (see Doctor Mordrid, the Puppet Master series, Demonic Toys, SubSpecies, etc.), most of which were way better than (and most likely paid for by the success of) Ghoulies. The PG-13 rating for Ghoulies is puzzling, as it's pretty dark stuff. I can just imagine a 1985 theatre full of parents taking their 12 year olds to this sickie, thinking it's going to be another action packed cute-critter flick like Gremlins ... until the Satanic Black Mass in the opening scene! Added trivia notes, apparently one of the midgets in this flick was the guy inside the E.T. suit, and a very young, very hot Mariska Hargitay (of future Law & Order fame) makes her film debut here as one of the teenybopper victims.Worth a look for '80s trash devotees but otherwise there are far better options.

These dwarfs basically hold the key to all knowledge & power or something like that & eventually Jonathan's dead Father rises from his grave, which happens to be located in the garden...Co-written & directed by Luca Bercovici I pretty much hated this cheap, unappealing & throughly rotten attempt at a Gremlins (184) rip-off. The script by Bercovici & Jefery Levy is real bottom-of-the-barrel stuff from start to finish, it's incredibly slow & boring, despite being called Ghoulies the said little creatures hardly do anything until the very end, they just sort of stand there because the terrible special effects won't allow them to do anything else. The entire film never leaves the confines of the same house which consists of a couple of bedrooms, a kitchen & dining room, it becomes very monotonous & dull. The character's are awful, why would anyone want to conduct a Satanic ritual for 'fun' & where are you going to find people stupid enough to join in? There's hardly any exploitation, there's no gore or any decent horror elements. Apparently Ghoulies is meant to be a horror comedy, well besides there being zero horror it's about as funny as haemorrhoid's. I can't think of one positive thing to say about it, I can't believe there's any people out there who actually like this.Director Bercovici ruins anything the film could have had going for it with some truly awful special effects & puppet shots. Ther's no scares, there's no atmosphere & zero tension as a few lame brain retards are killed off at the end but to add insult to injury Bercovici has them all return from the dead in a hideous 'happy' ending that made me cringe. Also where did the slimy monster that came from the clown outfit go? Anyone whose seen it will know what I'm talking about. Forget about any gore as this is family friendly PG stuff all the way, it says on he IMDb that 12 minutes were cut to secure this rating & while I can't quite believe it's that much it's painfully obvious that it's cut & that this was probably intended to be stronger.With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Ghoulies apparently did very well on VHS, I honestly can't think why as it's crap but there you go there's no accounting for taste. The acting is terrible which means it suits the film in general right down to the ground.Ghoulies is crap, watch Gremlins again instead. This film has absolutely nothing going for it, definitely one to avoid folks. Followed by three further sequels, Ghoulies II (1987), Ghoulies III Ghoulies go to College (1991) & Ghoulies IV (1994). Thankfully the series now appears to be dead, there is a god after all. "}]
