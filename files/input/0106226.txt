The Age Of Innocence This is what happens with great artists, you can always re visit them and you'll come out of the experience with something new, something valuable. Transported by the sublime voice of Joanne Woodward I took the trip again to discover that everything in this extraordinary universe that Martin Scorsese, based on Edith Wharton work, is not what it appears. Conventions out of the window, breaking every imaginable rule. Just as the characters get off their trucks, swimming against the tide of the times. Scorsese breaks cinematic rules with such artistry that we're allow to inspect, re live and enjoy a story as old as the world from a completely new perspective. Is as if Luchino Visconti had suddenly woken up with a new contemporary sight to look back with. Daniel Day Lewis is so marvelous that the pain of his predicament becomes more than visual, becomes visceral. For Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder this was the zenith of their careers. They are sensational. The casting, as usual in a Scorsese film, is superb even in the smallest roles. Glimpses of Sian Phillips, Alexis Smith and Geraldine Chaplin add to the pleasures, making this overwhelming banquet of a film one of the most rewarding film experiences I've ever had.

Of course I was 22, and the workings of that late-1800's New York society really didn't make much sense or have much relevance.I think the film may have been ignored at its release because of the slew of other period pieces which were so popular (an eventually common) in the late 80's/early 90's... But watching it again 10 years later, this film is anything but common.The true intensity is Scorcese's detached presentation of a hypocritical & hateful society which holds its members as prisoners.Not to mention impeccable art direction & beautiful cinematography by the legendary Michael Ballhaus. The film looks as impressionistic as the paintings that line the walls of the characters' homes.Scorsese is always acute in his casting decisions, and this is one of the films many virtuesLewis is perfect as a man who's struggle between his passion & his duty are constantly on the verge of devouring him  (yet somehow he thrives on his torture).Ryder is the seemingly innocent & naive girl who is completely manipulative & cunning underneath her exterior (gee, who would have thought?!) -- notice the arching scene.In a sense, this was one of Pfeiffer's defining roles. Pfeiffer herself (in a sense) is an outcast who has never truly been accepted as a serious actress by her peers in the acting community. Watching this film again, it amazes me how this role somehow reflects her personal position in the current social structure of Hollywood, similar to her character existing in 1800's New York society.Wow...What an amazing pic. I completely missed it the first time around. Great observance of high society. Many of those codes are strangely applicable today.Not recommended for those who like fast paced movies, or those who are looking for the usual Scorcese.  I would couple this with Last Temptation of Christ as Scorsese's most brave, artistic, demanding & abstract films to date.

That movie, Barry Lyndon, was met with much critical acclaim, but also a litany of derision from fans and critics alike who called it too slow, too ponderous and too boring.  Nearly 20 years later, the world's leading director of that time, Martin Scorcese took the same steps and met with much of the same criticism.These two movies are not for everyone.  If you want to see action and fast-paced filmmaking, you will find them boring.  However, if you want to see the pinnacles of the careers of the two greatest directors of the second half of the 20th century, you will find them here.Enough has been said about the plot and the acting in The Age of Innocence.  The bottom line is that for pure cinematic luster and beauty, the 90's offers only a single movie that can match Barry Lyndon.  Don't watch the clock, watch the film, and enjoy a departure and a triumph that proves the depth and confidence of Scorcese's skills.Lastly, don't let anyone spoil the ending for you, and don't jump to conclusions.  Think about it after you've seen the movie, savour it for a while and the understanding will come to you.  This movie quite simply has the finest ending of any movie I have ever seen.  The Age of Innocence is the 10 that rises just above Scorcese's string of 9 1/2s.  See it.

Scorsese is at his most brilliant in this film; it is all the more exquisite as it does not rely on an overloaded plot but prefers to be constructed of lights and half lights, shades and nuances. All the more appropriate as this is exactly what Scorsese wants us to see in the world of end of XIX th century New York- a society brimming with peace and innocence in which nothing appears to ever happen but under the surface of which gossip and intrigue work relentlessly and destinies are decided over the small talk of the dinner table.

There is guilt, desire, obsessed passion and the weakness to satisfy that passion.The story takes place in New York, around 1880. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) must choose between his current fiancee May Welland (Winona Ryder) and her cousin who has just arrived from Poland and is recently divorced, Helen Ollenska (Michelle Pfeiffer). May is the symbol of a world he's familiar with, and Helen represents the world he's dreaming of.Living in a conservative world full of compromises, Newland is as much trapped by his social circle as the Italian-American heroes of Mean Streets and GoodFellas. However, the Mafia here is called New York aristocracy and kills with words, with a gesture or with a look of contempt and rejection, instead of using guns. Scorsese fans who expect to see psychotic characters, violence or De Niro-style performances, will be disappointed. Everything in this movie is based on the observation and recording of the social behaviour codes, the unexpressed feelings and of things  which are not not said but implied. Scorsese portrayed with absolute preciseness, almost paragraph to paragraph, Edith Wharton's classic novel. However, he managed to give the film his own unique personal view, proving his gigantic talent and that he's capable of creating masterpieces, whatever the heroes, the story or the genre of the film. Winona Ryder should definitely have won the Oscar for her wonderful performance, but Lewis and Pfeiffer are marvellous as well. What's left to say? The Age of Innocence is an un-excusably underrated all time classic.

Period films are not for everyone, and if you lack an appreciation for subtlety then maybe something like Joe Dirt may be better suited for you. But what lies beneath this wonderful movie is a priceless ode to individuality.Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ellen Olenska, a proto-feminist who flees from her failing European marriage to the home of her blood relatives in 1870's New York Society. She's been away for most of her life and the States are foreign to her, but she quickly realizes that she is viewed as threat, a black sheep ---and Society reacts to her as it would to a dirty black spot on a carpet or on one of their tuxedo shirts. Harmony could be shattered by a whisper, as well narrated by Joanne Woodward.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer, an up-and-rising patriarch who sees something in her that no one else in his rich circle could offer him an independent viewpoint to life. As a lawyer and a powerful member of his family, he bravely tries to protect Ellen from basically everyone, esp. members of their own family. Despite all of her difficulties, Countess Olenska refuses to part from her individuality she smokes in front of Newland, does not hide from men in social situations, and criticizes her surroundings. Archer doesn't necessarily fall in love with her as a person but with what she represents Romanticism and escape.There is a lot to love about this film, which is more like a piece of art than a movie. Every scene and every bit of dialogue denotes elegance and brutality simultaneously. All of the leading and supporting characters are so believable and well formed that they trump anything Hollywood has been throwing at us in recent months. And the setting for this film is very unconventional, at least for the 90's. Through excellent film-making, I can see why Society felt the need to operate in such a ruthless fashion, in order to protect itself from Ellen and what she represented to Newland, its newly crowned prince.Over the past few months, I have also grown an appreciation for Winona Ryder's performance as May. She is a shrewd politician, who uses her bright blindness as a megaphone for Society's rules of conduct, a weapon of manipulation against her destined husband Newland, and as a way to continue plotting without easily being detected.I wonder how many more times I will watch The Age of Innocence before I risk being exposed to Hollywood's 21st century conformity, such as Independence Day or Wild, Wild West. All I know is that Ellen Olenska (as one of my favorite cinematic heroines) serves to validate my own sense of individuality, and neither she nor the astonishing beauty of this Scorcese creation, will ever be boring. 10 out of 10 stars.

However, while the story is upper-crust WASP, the visual imprints are his, and the violence is completely internal, emotional, equally if not more devastating.Contemplative, but no less involving, is the core of this movie's visual attitude. With so much subtext just simmering underneath the events told in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, any other approach would have reduced the impact that its denouement reveals. Scorcese uses a tremendous amount of visual tricks to emphasize what or whom we should look at spotlighting Pfeiffer and Day-Lewis as they enjoy a quiet conversation during the intermission in a play; overlapping series of fleeting images from snippets of correspondence between characters; slowing the action down for about five seconds in a key scene (when Pfeiffer gets up from her seat, crosses a room full of guests to go talk to Day-Lewis as Woodward narrates It was not the custom for a lady to get up ... and talk to another man.). His technique forces us to really watch the story, to look for details, overt and covert, since like the opening montage of roses in bloom at the beginning of the credits, this is a movie of deep contemplation -- not because of the lush images, but because of the subtle game of tradition which is being played behind the curtains, just out of the camera's view. Nothing is what it seems, and in the exceptional case of Winona Ryder's incredibly sly portrayal of May Welland, that becomes true she knows much more than her character reveals, and when she does so, it's only with a loving glance. She is aware of her husband's attraction to Ellen Olenska, and even casually feeds him into it, only to chain him to her at the end when all is revealed and nothing can be done. And this is what makes the movie so ultimately tragic and emotionally jarring that true love is consciously allowed to be crushed in lieu of family tradition, which is the overwhelming hypocrisy of the people inhabiting Edith Wharton's timeless novel.

"},{"Title":"Possible spoiler--Brilliant movie!","Date":"18 August 2000","Score":"17 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  One of Edith Wharton's most famous mottoes has to be when she wrote that `Life is the saddest thing there is, next to death.'  Not exactly the life of the party, now are we?  Wharton knew from sadness, and when she wrote novels like Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence she infused them with a tragedy unknown in any other author of the time.  The latter work in particular is a tear-inducing criticism of a society that quashes the life out of passionate individuals who dare to feel for themselves without asking permission from the rest of the world.Martin Scorsese, the man most famous for giving gangsters a loud, cinematic voice, has done the unthinkable he has made what is probably the most elegant film ever created.  Out-costuming the Merchant Ivory team, he's taken the starch out of costume dramas and created an epic of beauty.  He also goes one step further than his cinematic colleagues and perfectly translates Wharton's writing on two important levels having key passages from the book directly narrated (in the most languid voice work) by Joanne Woodward, and visually translating Wharton's sentiments with his camera movements and Thelma Schoonmaker's skillful editing.The story centres on the life of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), a young member of the New York gentry in the 1870s who has the affluent life anyone in his position should have.  He is a successful lawyer, he owns a beautiful home, and is just recently engaged to the beautiful and, ahem, proper May Welland (Ryder).  Upon announcing his engagement, he meets for the first time since childhood May's cousin, one Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer).  She has just returned from Europe after leaving her abusive husband, a Polish Count.It is soon obvious that Archer and Countess Olenska are attracted to each other in the most gripping of ways they understand each other.  This leads them to a passion that is practically deadly in the watchdog society they live in.From the beginning of the story, Scorsese makes sure we get to know who these people are.  Scanning over an opera audience's heads, he gives us close-ups of the ornaments in the women's hair, the chains on the men's ornate pocket watches.  When we are shown a dinner scene at a particular hosts' grand estate, Scorsese lingers over the perfectly arranged plates of food, or the meticulously designed floral bouquets.  All this may seem unnecessary, but it's actually the setup for a love story that needs this careful attention to detail to be told correctly.These elements are given to us in such detail because the world we're watching knows nothing of more importance than your house's interior decoration if your host doesn't have a proper drawing room decorated in the generally accepted fashion, he might be considered unfit for your patronage (at one point, the not-so-respectable Julius Beauford hangs a nude Venus, audaciously, in plain sight).  In her novel, Wharton painted a picture of two-dimensional people, people who wasted entire lives (and loves) on making sure they could avoid the careful whispers being spoken behind closed doors, even though it never stopped them from joining in on the whispering when someone else was involved.These details are comfortably housed in Dante Ferretti's brilliant production design.  The sets come from a beautiful dream, looming large over the actors' heads, surrounding them with the obsession of `conspicuous consumption' that heavily marked the Victorian period.  In the same way, Gabriella Pescucci's detailed costume designs display the plush fabrics and embroideries that reveal to the audience much of the characters' emotions and situations.  Even the stark black and white of the men's suits seem to suggest how these gentlemen view the issues they face in their lives, such as a nearly-married man involved romantically with his fiancee's cousin.  Archer's suits, as the film progresses, begin to be worn in the colour gray.Filling these costumes is no easy task.  For the three main characters in this battle of wills, Scorsese has hired none but the very best.  As Archer, Day-Lewis gives his most comprehensive performance so far.  Abandoning his usually ingratiating showy techniques, his performance lies in the suffering that we witness behind his eyes.  I so much prefer this role over his overstated innocent-prisoner turn in In The Name of the Father, which also came out the same year (and for which he received all the critical attention and award nominations); here he treads more along the same lines as his tenderhearted punk rocker in Stephen Frears' My Beautiful Laundrette.Michelle Pfeiffer is as sharp as a tack as Ellen Olenska, a woman who has seen it all and is still forced to suffer.  Looking at it from her point of view, the film is about a woman who is punished by society for being comfortable with herself.  From the outset we see she is different she doesn't speak shyly to men or wait for them to initiate conversation.  `Why would they start a new world only to make it exactly like the old one?' she asks Archer.  She smokes in front of Archer, is seen publicly being escorted places (quite innocently) with a married man (Wilson) who she doesn't want to go out with but feels obligated by family ties, and dares to attempt a divorce from her monster of a husband.  A woman who knows what she wants and goes for it? Demonic! She must be destroyed.  All New York shamelessly rallies together to eradicate this villain.Who better to lead the haughty fray than Olenska's own nemesis May Welland.  As May, Ryder is simply remarkable.  In her first scene she seems to us a complete nitwit a pretty and well-dressed girl, but one who pays no attention to the betterment of her mental faculties.  Ryder tears down that façade with burning relish.  She understands the character from the inside out, making May the most emotionally inspiring character in the whole movie (and the one that inspires the most conversation after viewing the film).  As the plot progresses, we start to understand how May really works; though she is intellectually unrefined, she's not in the least bit stupid.  She is Wharton's representation of the society Archer and Olenska are trapped in she plays by the rules like she invented them, and uses any device to make sure everything turns out her way, and it does.  She never comes out with what she wants to say, opting instead to turn passive-aggressive on her husband.   When she slips up on a story he's made up to get away from home to visit the Countess, May questions him like she has no idea what he's talking about.  `Oh never mind me, it's too complicated for me to understand,' she intimates with her large doe eyes and wan smile.  It comes as no surprise to me that Ryder wrote an essay on this character in high school and got an A for it.Wharton's message of doom is clear the one who plays along with the lie we've all helped to create is the one who succeeds.  May has her marriage, her children and a completely comfortable life.  Archer is caught into a plastic marriage and separated from the one person who ever makes him feel alive.  Olenska, feeling too threatened by those around her, is forced to make her home in Europe again, but far away from her husband.Who would have thought Scorsese could do it? Well, myself for starters.  Just because he's most famous for his gangster films doesn't mean that those are the only films he's capable of doing well.  With projects like After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Scorsese has shown his capability with a wide range of cinematic genres; why stop him at the period-drama threshold?  He drives the pace along with a slow but sure hand, never for a moment letting the film get carried away with itself.  Not to mention the atmosphere.  There are moments during this movie I just couldn't breathe.  No matter where in New York they go, Archer and the Countess are just never alone.  They might seem to be, but even the hand-sewn curtains seem to have eyes (those eyes are all photographed by Michael Ballhaus, the man also responsible for the gorgeous Bram Stoker's Dracula a year before, also starring Ryder).  The rooms with their overstuffed decorations and walls covered with numerous paintings loom over our protagonists with a close gaze; they're never trusted from the second they meet.Real love is the answer, but no one can ever dare ask the question.  Who knows what sadness Wharton knew to paint such a tormenting picture of true passion-between watching this and The Remains of the Day a week later, it's amazing I was able to leave my room for a year.  No one escapes this doom, Wharton says we either break the rules and are punished to death for it, or play by them and watch ourselves slowly perish on the inside.  We become less human and more drawings of humans; we become as hollow, or shall we say `innocent', as the age around us.

Michael Ballhaus has handsomely photographed the film, with wonderful gliding takes, use of over-exposure to change scenes, and some artificial spotlights to highlight the important details in certain frames. The pacing is slow, but not in a negative way, as it gives one time to be drawn into the film and the depicted period. The third person narration from Joanne Woodward does however make it slightly restrained, as it is impersonal and sets emotion aside from the action on screen. The acting is also a tad ordinary from most performers, but besides for these two points there is little to complain about here.

If it don't fit, you must . . . uh, quit!Apart from the New York setting, it's hard to perceive how Scorsese felt that he had an affinity for this material.  The very first scene indicates a drastic mismatch.  He employs split-second cutting, breakneck Steadicam zooms, and at one point I think he even fiddles with the camera speed  and for what?  a scene at an opera house, attended by the elite of 1870's  Old New York.  Look out, folks! -- it's Goodfellas-Meets-High Society!  Jake La Motta is crashing the party!  Clearly, Scorsese is terrified of losing our attention in this movie -- hence the endless succession of pointless stylistic flourishes throughout the 2-1/2-hour running-time.  After the seventh Olde-Style iris fadeout, one starts longing for the simplicity, taste, and self-confidence of James Ivory.In fact, Scorsese's adaption of Wharton's novel is a textbook case of Having No Confidence In What You Are Doing.  The gimmicky direction is, of course, the sort of bluff and bluster typical of defensiveness.  But the script, which treats the novel like a sacred text, also indicates a lack of confidence.  Scorsese includes virtually every character from the novel, with incoherent results  half the time, we don't know which character another character is referring to.  Too many names, too many characters to keep up with.  (One of them, Fanny Ring, is mentioned a dozen times in the movie, but we never meet her.)  If one has read the book, one has an easier time of things . . . but I hadn't read the novel yet when this film came out a decade ago, and consequently had some difficulty following the thread of the fairly dense plot.  While it's easy to keep things straight in Wharton's novel, the movie, by insisting on including EVERYTHING, must skim frantically over the backstory minutiae, ultimately leading to windiness in the script and confusion for the viewer.  Even the dialog is lifted directly from the novel  this can sometimes be praiseworthy, but, given the context of this movie, it rather indicates that the filmmakers don't really have a point of view about the whole thing.  They're copying sentences here, not forging an adaptation.  Of course, it goes without saying that the movie fails to include the most important aspect of the novel, which is Wharton's cool ironic distance.  The results are disastrous  the film brings the weepy ladies'-novel plot to the foreground, and pushes the thematic context to the margins.  Again, one starts to appreciate the skilled adaptations of James Ivory.Scorsese's lack of confidence is most glaring in the performances he gets from the principal actors.  He reserves all the flourishes for himself, and allows Daniel Day-Lewis to turn in a zombified performance.  Newland Archer may be a dilettante in Wharton's novel, but he most decidedly is NOT the automaton that Day-Lewis offers us here.  It's disappointing that Day-Lewis, an actor of primal passions, miscalculates the role of Archer so badly, but there you have it.  As for Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder  the former is miscast, and the latter just isn't any good.  Bottom line  if Scorsese couldn't get the movie made without the use of  name  actresses whom he seemed unsure about, why did he bother?  Just let James Ivory do the thing with Royal Shakespeare Company alumni, and be done with it.Along those lines, one can take serious issue with the ultimate hypocrisy actuating this whole project.  Scorsese, a very wealthy director, presumes to make some Big Statement or other about the very wealthy.  And thus he hires a pair of very wealthy actresses to play the female leads; spends a fortune on set-design; employs expensive, up-to-the-minute film technology intended to wow us; spends an inordinate amount of time gazing fondly on an endless parade of expensive ball-gowns, haute cuisine spread upon imported china  (the shad roe with cucumbers looked particularly delicious), chandeliers the size of Christmas trees, gold cigar-clippers, dazzling jewels, impeccable dancing gloves, Chippendale furniture, fur coats, snazzy velvet hats. . . . In other words, *The Age of Innocence*, far from criticizing this milieu, is completely seduced by it.  It's a nauseatingly ostentatious motion picture.

The narrator talked through about half the movie and would not shut up. I kept trying to get into the mood, the characters, the settings, and to become intertwined in the story, but every time the narrator spoke the intimacy was ruined. I had this same objection to Last of the Dogmen as well as 300 (In 300 there is a narrator during the battle scenes - that should be a mortal sin).A narrator is a fine and sometimes necessary thing when reading a novel. But when it comes to a movie, any narration should be kept absolutely minimal, and preferably there should be none at all. A film should be able to tell you everything it has to say with the actions and dialogue of its characters. If a narrator has to say it, then either the screenplay was lazily written or the director is not using the full potential of his/her cast. In this particular situation, I can only guess the former. It's as if someone did not want to go through the trouble to rewrite the novel into a proper screenplay and thus left far too much information to be conveyed through exterior narration.I imagine I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film if the narration was removed.

Unfortunately, the task appears to be beyond him.The Age of Innocence is Wharton's exploration into the finer details of New York high society circa the late 19th century. The focal character is attorney Newland Archer (played here by Daniel Day-Lewis), who is the walking personification of pristine high society. He is engaged to be married to the oh-so-acceptable May Welland (Winona Ryder), but then meets her scandalous cousin, the Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), a black sheep now that she has separated from her husband. Suddenly Newland's heart is all atwitter and he finds himself willing to risk his reputation and social standing to pursue her.The central romance is strangely missing any romance, much less passion. Scorsese seems far more enamored of the set design, costumes and fancy finery, then he is with the people at the heart of the action. The majority of the people seem anemic, with possibly the exception of a feisty Miriam Margoyles, who seems far more scandalous than Pfeiffer with her loud and oddly hilarious outbursts. Lots of time is spent documenting the dinnerware, etiquette and bearing of the elites, to the point where one starts to cast longing gazes at their watch. And in case you don't get it, Scorsese has decided to include mind-numbingly obvious narration from the cultured tones of Joanne Woodward. Woodward's narration becomes increasingly intrusive to the point where it not only tells us that someone walks across the room (as though we did not witness it), but gives us insight into what people are thinking, as if this is not something the performances should be doing.When not doting on the lovely china, draperies and lace doilies, Scorsese employs rather annoying camera tricks to open or close scenes, and gives us endless montages of hothouse flowers ripening in stop motion - to hint at the emotion roiling beneath the surface of these well-dressed mannequins. Oh, the depth! Some of the acting is quite fine, even with the restrictions placed on it by the storyline. It is intriguing to watch Day-Lewis portray such an inhibited character as Newland Archer. We have some degree of sympathy for Newland, although he brings a lot of his misery on himself. However, we never have much respect for him, because at heart the character is incredibly weak and allows himself to repeatedly be at the mercy of those around him. Day-Lewis conveys a great deal of the frustration and angst of the character. Unfortunately, one thing that does not get conveyed is the longing and passion of his love for the Countess.This last is certainly not all Day-Lewis' fault. Pfeiffer's scandalous cousin is such a jaw-dropping bore and played by the usually reliable actress with such lifelessness that it is impossible to understand how she can awaken longing in anyone. Pfeiffer, strangely resembling a young Lucille Ball here, carries herself ramrod straight with a slight air of discomfort, as though she was bothered by hemorrhoids. She delivers her lines either haltingly or breathlessly in a manner that strains patience. Were it not for the incessant reminders, we would detect nothing interesting - much less scandalous - about her. In fact, she hardly seems to be suffering as a pariah at all since she seems to chronically show up at all of the prime spots. Even worse, her character pales in comparison to May Welland, who is supposed to be the duller of the two women.And here we have another of the film's faults. Winona Ryder is positively radiant as May and delivers one of her last great performances prior to becoming this generation's Hedy Lamarr and forgetting how to act. She does a fantastic job of portraying Archer's still waters run deep fiancée and often seems a far more intriguing love interest. When she senses the attraction between Newland and her cousin, she repeatedly offers him an out to launch his pursuit, which he fails to take her up on. Later, when Newland decides he wants an out at a far more inappropriate time, she does a grand job of insidiously psychologically closing off his paths for escape and ensuring his continued subservience to her, even if he is only going through the motions. Ryder's performance is really quite wonderful here and the fact that one remembers her character far more so than Pfeiffer's indicates a vital flaw in the piece.Due to so much exposition and pontificating on the backdrops, the film is entirely too long for its slight story and it feels it. By the time it grinds to its predictable and emotionally muted conclusion, one is more than ready for the experience to be over. The final sequence with an older Day-Lewis offered the opportunity to once again meet and continue his relationship with Pfeiffer (with the approval of his now late wife) only to culminate with him sitting dumbfounded on a bench before walking away without meeting her ranks as one of the most pointless codas on a film. Truly, the film would have been more improved had Scorsese ended it following the final confrontation between Day-Lewis and Ryder.A lovely looking film, but unless you are interested in seeing Scorsese direct a change-of-pace film or have a particular affinity for Wharton's wallows in misery, there is not a lot here to satisfy.

Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here.Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness.

It is late 19th Century New York and attorney Daniel Day-Lewis is about to wed socialite Winona Ryder (Oscar-nominated). Naturally their lives of privilege and the finer things in life make them a quietly happy couple. However their lives are changed when Day-Lewis is asked to defend Ryder's cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer), a woman trying to divorce herself from an abusive marriage to a man that never loved her. The socialites within Ryder's circle frown upon Pfeiffer, treating her no better than a common stranger (that is putting it mildly at best). Day-Lewis takes a liking to Pfeiffer and he develops admiration and sympathy for the emotionally tortured woman. A mutual love and romance may blossom, but what complications will this create for the duo? The Age of Innocence is a strong film that dominates because of Scorsese's outstanding direction. Much like The Last Temptation of Christ, Scorsese tackles something totally different from what he had previously worked on. The film is a fine accomplishment that is a successful venture overall. It nearly reaches total excellence, but a few minor problems with pacing hurt the production admittedly. Still one of Scorsese's best works. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Although a stunningly beautiful film to watch, the story detracts from the Edith Wharton novel. The narration by Joanne Woodward is jarring at first, yet gives the modern viewer an idea of 1870's New York City mores. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer with strong conviction and virtue. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Countess Olenska seems a bit modern in this otherwise fine period piece. Scorsese's camera deftly flows through ballrooms and mansions effortlessly, giving the film a broader scope visually. I watch this film over and over when I need a break from the mundane films that are pumped out on an assembly line known as Hollywood. Although lacking in story and substance at times, it has some great supporting players, such as Brits Miriam Margolyes, Michael Gough, Jonathan Pryce, Sian Phillips,and of course a wonderful bit by the great Alec McCowen as the snobbish aesthete Sillerton Jackson.

Hollow cheeks. Slits for eyes. Squarely flat chin. Jowls that won't quit. His hands are flat, and his fingers are long and spindly and webbed with veins. Like Ralph Fiennes (whose features can only be described as pathetic), nothing about Day-Lewis says macho. And the harder he tries to be a he-man, the more he looks like Maria Shriver!I remember the huzzahs the critics greeted The Age of Innocence with, in particular, how Richard Schickel was all over it like a whore on a $20 bill. I finally saw it last night on TCM. When the director resorts to slow motion, lap dissolves, steadicam zooms - even irises - then you know he knows he's got a stinker on his hands, but is trying desperately not to let you know he knows! The use of a narrator was another sign Scorsese was half-assing it. It was a cheat and unnecessary.In the middle of this is Day-Lewis. The guy may have been born with the prerequisite burr up his ass, but his Archer is a total wuss. I actually laughed when he kissed Pfeiffer's feet (you'd think, reading the script, he would have gone Are you sh*tting me?) Was that a hug or were they impersonating lumberjacks? The only thing more ridiculous was how she kept telling him how needy she was, then leveled a stare that could freeze Hell!Ryder seemed so intent on making May a martyr, she utterly failed to convey the knowing underneath. After all, May was born and raised for the job. When she tells Archer she told Ellen she was preggers before she knew for sure, she doesn't let on that she knows she's just f***ed him up, f***ed him up good! So when Ted (why his name was changed from Dallas is not for us lesser minds to ponder) tells Archer May told him he is such a great guy, he gave up the one thing he wanted for the sake of appearances, it's another cheat.Another thing that had me scratching my head was how Mrs. Mingott had all this power when you know she got it by marrying it. Why does she back Ellen, but tell the far more-virtuous Mrs. Beaufort, who is in the exact same situation, to take a hike?Instead of drawing us into this rarefied world, Scorsese makes it impossible to understand why these characters feel trapped. Why didn't Archer and Ellen just run off and go West, where no one gave a rat's ass, and you could make it up as you go along? I know that's not in the book, but at least it would have made me feel I hadn't wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life for nothing!

Based on Edith Wharton's novel set in 1870s New York high society, the film wonderfully depicts the falling of tradition and the opening of modernity in the lives of 3 people and their vicious back-stabbing families. Lawyer Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to society maiden May Welland (Winona Ryder; who won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress) but all that is set off-course when May's cousin - the passionate, charming and scandal-clad Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) - has returned to the USA, fleeing her cheating Polish husband, Count Olenska. Ellen sojourns at the estate of New York society matriach, Madame Mingott (Miriam Margolyes) while deciding on what to do with her life. Madame Mingott appoints Newland as Ellen's legal advisor. It is here their passion erupts. In an effort to keep reputation intact and to keep free of further scandal, the affair is unwillingly aborted...but at a cost to the lives of the 3 involved. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an affecting performance as Newland. So restrained, ruled by tradition and fuelled with the most passion in his life which leads to embitterment but quiet contentment with conscience on his side. A beautiful performance. Michelle Pfeiffer was perfectly-cast as the controversial Ellen Olenska. Before she makes her first appearance, we're aware the Countess is a dark lady with many affairs behind her. Once we spend more time with this character, we see she is only following her heart and is so mad at the world for restraining her and labelling everything she does. Ms Pfeiffer gives a brave performance worthy of much more kudos. Winona Ryder made a great transition when switching from the weird high school girls to well-bred and well-intentioned May Welland. However, Winona's most excellent scene is that where she asks to be with Newland a while, only to tell him she is pregnant and then stating she told Ellen 2 weeks before. Newland is surprised as he was certain he heard May say that she only knew that day. Through the sweet smile, we see the cunning eyes of deceit and the evidence that May used her pregnancy as a threat to prevent Ellen's further advances on Newland. May's transition from young lady to woman of the world is very well-executed by Winona Ryder who, like Michelle, deserves a lot more credit for this exceptional performance. Likewise to Martin Scorsese, perhaps the best director in America. This is another film in a long line of Sr. Scorsese masterpieces where he has invented new shots, clever techniques and wise plotting to show the fall of the traditional world. This film is intelligent and lush in emotional landscapes and in suggesting the imperial beauty and bitchery of the period. A stunning depiction of the decline of the old world; the end of the Age of Innocence.

A severe social code controls how people speak, move, meet, separate, eat dinner, earn their income, fall in love, marry. Not a word of the code is recorded anywhere, which is why it serves inescapably as the psychology of everyone's behavior. And they've been learning it since they were born.In the stylish environment of the eldest, wealthiest families in 1870s NYC, marriages are like pacts between land-owners, their intentions not just to bond romance or procreate, but to support the systematic spread of affluence. Anything that jeopardizes this unflappable practice is despised. It's not thought suitable for people to put their own self-seeking wishes above the self-seeking requirements of their self-seeking class. Some do certainly marry for love, but the custom is condemned as bad-mannered and precarious.Newland Archer is engaged to marry the attractive young May Welland. He has great fondness for her, though she doesn't seem terribly bright, obedient rather than lively. All concur this is a good marriage between good families. But one night at the opera he sees a cousin, Ellen, the Countess Olenska, who's been married in Europe for years. She, he's astounded to find, looks on his world with the aloofness of an outcast. She's stunning, but what thrills Archer is the presence of a woman who valiantly thinks for herself.She's not highly regarded. First she made the misstep of marrying a outside her circle and living in Europe. Then she made a bigger boo-boo returning after splitting from her husband, where she sticks out as an unusual woman whom no one entirely knows what to do with. It's plain to everyone that her company's a danger to the tidy development of Archer's marriage.This breed of story would appear to be of little relevance to Scorsese, a director of immense guilty consciences and vigorous violence. But indeed this story's anguished, forceful, the chronicle of a man's obsession trampled, his spirit conquered. And it goes further. The last scene is heartrending because it divulges that Newland wasn't the only one with feelings, that others sacrificed for him, that his deepest misfortune wasn't what he lost, but what he never recognized he had.These prosperous nobles move in their golden circles from opera to banquet to lounge, a uniform for every function, every time of day. Scorsese inundates us with the largest and smallest social details, the tilts of heads, positions of fleeting looks, understated intonations. He captures the heart of each moment. He stops and slows time. He changes space. He creates moods. And slowly we grasp what's occurring Archer's contemplating breaking his engagement to May so as to elope with Ellen. Everyone's concerned to thwart him, while at no time does anyone betray by the least indication that they know what they're doing.Scorsese channels his headlong temperament into an unquenchably comprehensive, multifaceted formality. So much applause has deservedly been given to the extraordinary Copacabana tracking shot in GoodFellas, the aftermath in Taxi Driver, the march to the ring in Raging Bull. Yet none of them require the level of perspective intricacy, swarming hustle-bustle, ornament and elaborately planned movement as a handful of extensive tracking shots here, particularly the first of them. He lusts over full-course meals, sees through roving opera glasses, captures the weather and architectural gravel of 1870 New York. There's a gorgeous Saul Bass opening title sequence.We're supplied with Joanne Woodward's narration, comprehending all that's transpiring, furnishing the concealed thoughts of the characters. We gather the rules of the upper crust. We meet the old Mrs. Mingott, who has enormous amounts of money and acts for her society as more or less an appeals court of what can and can't be acceptable. And we see the boundless sensitivity and consideration with which May preserves her relationship with Archer. May realizes or conjectures everything that materializes between him and Ellen, but she decides to accept only some information, and works with unforeseen cunning to protect her marriage while never totally seeming to detect anything.Each performance is tempered to maintain the diplomatic equilibrium of the warfare. Day-Lewis endures at the core, misled for a time that he has independence. Pfeiffer, as the countess, is a woman who sees through society without totally denying it, taking a nearly sensuous delight in seducing Archer with the strength of her mind. Initially it seems that May's an ignorant looker-on and casualty, but Ryder slowly uncovers her astuteness. If you notice, none of the actors are concentrated on themselves. Their inflections, facial expressions come entirely from their interest in the responses of the other. Scorsese's romantic leads don't have to sleep together. They don't even have to like each other all the time. As long as they listen. The texture, gist, wit, tension are all enriched by every performance. I've seen love scenes wherein nude bodies lash in slippery, big-breasted fervor, but I've seldom seen them more zealous than in this movie, where everyone's enveloped in covers of Victorian tyranny. The major erotic flashes happen in public among completely clad people speaking in flawlessly tempered expressions, so crammed with libido and dread. Story's put ahead of showy individual performances.The Age of Innocence seems to characterize a world utterly unfamiliar to us. But Edith Wharton appreciated that the people of her story had the same hungers as we barbaric moderns. Not acting on them made them all the more resilient. By the end, we've found they have all the same sentiments, enthusiasms, doubts, and needs that we do. It's just that they treasure them differently. They're less casual with them, and don't choose a moment's excess over an existence's acute romantic sorrow.

His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema! "},{"Title":"Some things are worth fighting for","Date":"2 March 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The Age of Innocence is centered within the crème de la crème of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living.The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of cinders in his mouth.The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have no character, no colour, no variety, where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene.This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on Closer when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him There's a moment, there's always a moment, I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it. Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not.Another obligatory comparison is with The Bridges of Madison County. On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. The Bridges of Madison County presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on The Age of Innocence the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together.This is what coming of age really is about! "},{"Title":"The Social Insider","Date":"16 August 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably The Last Temptation of Christ, but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory heritage cinema style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. The Age of Innocence was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. Heritage cinema is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, The Go-Between. The House of Mirth (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. The Age of Innocence, by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a typical Day-Lewis character, but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in In the Name of the Father, excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in The Last of the Mohicans, who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in There Will Be Blood. In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in Batman and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in Love Field had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in Dangerous Liaisons. The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for Best Supporting Actress, which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The innocence of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. MingottThe film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. (Raging Bull, for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas Gangs of New York and The Aviator. The Age of Innocence can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10 "},{"Title":"And here begins The Age of Innocence  Marty's epic and tormented Romance ...","Date":"30 December 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" From the bold and shadowy streets of New-York, where the slang is punctuated every minute with so many F and S bombs, Martin Scorsese plunges us in The Age of innocence into a totally different world, not so far from his earlier works's settings, but so far in time that it seems to belong to an era that never existed. In this brilliant, elegantly directed film, we discover New-York's Aristocracy of the 1870's. A world of distinction, elegance, refinement, a world where every single word should be carefully weighted before being submitted to the gossips ... a world where silence is a dangerous weapon, a world where beyond the splendor, reigns a stink maybe worst than in the sleaziest street in the town. Yes, if the beautiful cinematography reminds you of Kubrick, Bergman, Forman or Visconti, the themes of the film remain purely Scorsesian.A young lawyer, named Newland Archer, seems to be the perfect man, or husband to fit into this environment he's handsome, elegant and distinguished. But by one cruel irony of fate, he's also an idealist with a tendency of being seduced by anti-conformist spirits, and it gets worse when this spirit inhabits the beautiful body and charming personality of the countess Ellen Olenska, played by a magnificent Michelle Pfeiffer, and its even worse when this man is already engaged to the innocent and angelic May, played in a scene-stealing role by the delicious Winona Ryder. And the man is no one but Daniel-Day Lewis in a tailor-made role played in all nuance. But let's not reduce this masterpiece to a banal triangular love story.Martin Scorsese proves again that when it comes to portray the torment of guilt and regret, no director comes to this level of brilliance. Here is a man who is torn between his passion and his true faithful love to the girl he promised to marry, so sweet and devoted she's like a reminiscence of Olivia De Havilland in Gone With the Wind. His passion is incarnated by Ellen, an unhappy woman suffering from the griefs of a bad marriage, worsened by the condescending gossips of a society that is high by the name and low by the thoughts. This woman, ironically, seems to carry more joy and free-spiritedness than any other person Archer encountered in his life. Basically, this would be such an easier deal if he wasn't engaged and her not married but life can't be arranged like marriages, even implicitly.Still, Archer believes in freedom, in a sort of equality of rights between men and women in the satisfaction of desires, couldn't he be wrong? Is there really two kind of women, the Kays and the Ellens, .. what makes the movie even more satisfying is its realistic approach, at many points, you don't exactly know which side Archer's feelings lean to. What makes its approach even more realistic is the depth that the script and Marty's masterful directing bring to the characters. Ellen has a sense of duty and a maturity that prevents her from being labeled as the typical frivolous woman who puts her claws on the good husband. Michelle is no cat-woman here. May's character is far from being the naive cheated wife, she knows exactly what it is all about.And of course, you have the heart of your film, Daniel Day Lewis, a fascinating character, so typically Scorsesian. A man who makes choices only to face immediate regrets, who seems so sure about his feelings, but from whom the lightest breeze of passion makes the whole tower of confidence literally collapse. Passion is everything that leads our acts, and guide them until we realize that reason must prevail, and in this cruelly ironic world, the reason, incarnated by the duty, is guided by society, by friends, by family. One of the most intelligent and insightful quotes I've ever listened to is How can we be happy behind the backs of people who trust us? That very quote rang true in my heart.People we love are our most dangerous dream killers, because they are in our hearts but they don't penetrate our soul enough to guess our feelings, our dreams, our motives. Yet, when we live in a world where convenience must predominate our acts, when an appearance of happiness is more important than happiness itself, when values rely on signs more than meanings, and any disobedience is like a piece of meat abandoned in a forest full of starving wolves, what is to expect from two passioned hearts who only want to be alone together instead of being together but alone? Archer indeed appears like a lonely character, floating in a world, in an etiquette, he doesn't belong to, so is Ellen. So they took the wisest decision, it didn't extinguish the passion, but at least, it was just more convenient. Duty has the merit of calming passion in a way we can try to reach happiness without touching it, instead of touching it many times and being swept away from it. To avoid the pain of a repetitive loss, better to lose once for all.No time to regret, no time to feel guilt, not in the Scorsesian era of Goodfellas or Mean Streets where every word is said straight-forwardly, where every hit leads to bloodshed, and any fight can lead to death. The world of Archer is too insincere, too codified for that, the best way to conjure the doom is to react with the same weapon, a serene but calculated resignation. Deliberately choosing unhappiness might be the best way to keep happy. Scorsese teaches us how you can get rid of guilt and regret when you anticipate how things can go worse. Wisdom of resignation, interesting ... When stops the guilt, begins The Age of Innocence.

To the unwary audience member, this languishing film based on Edith Wharton's masterpiece, The Age of Innocence, might seem all that, and many online viewer comment boards can attest to this opinion. However, from the very beginning, we are shown most vividly that this movie is more then just about the perils of repression and the regrets of the unlived life. Inhibition in this movie is beautiful, something the main character, Newland Archer, learns as the narrative progresses. We are enveloped constantly by this theme through Martin Scorsese's lyrical focus on the tangible objects that make up the film's mise-en-scene and his poetic cinematography of the objective close-up, fetishistic in its intensity. The main characters' incapacity to act in a closed world of visual metaphors and the emphasis on the beauty of repression make Age of Innocence highly melodramatic, creating a floating vision of a restrictive and yet tragically beautiful world of 1870s New York. A must see film that has been gravely underappreciated, it is one of the only movies that nearly lives up to the novel.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!********** The Age of Innocence is one of the very few films I have ever seen that had me crying at the end. I am a die-hard romantic, and I think Newland's actions were perfectly in character. He had long ago made the choice (you could argue that May made it for him, but that is not true) not to become a social outcast by dissolving his marriage in favor of Ellen, and he stayed true to that decision. To be with Ellen in his later years would be unbearable, for he would be constantly reminded of how much he had lost by not being with her for all those years in between.What makes that final scene so incredibly moving is the memory of the lighthouse and the sailboat, a pivotal scene from earlier in the film. Newland recalls that precise moment in his youth when he let Ellen get away, and it is undoubtedly something he has replayed in his mind countless times. What makes it even more devastating is that Ellen wanted him, but she would not be the one to disrupt the marriage - Newland had to decide for himself. I have never seen a better filmed representation of a person's regret for actions not taken, always more cutting than sorrow over ill-advised actions that were taken. The incredible subtlety with which Scorsese presents this, with just images and music, always blows me away; I consider it one of the classic moments in all of film. For a movie about a society of submerged passion and surface calm, The Age of Innocence packs an extraordinarily powerful emotional punch.  You may have reservations about the casting or the faithfulness to the book, but as it stands, this is a superb classic of filmed romance.

Daniel Day Lewis plays a man who is torn between marrying a woman he likes (Winona Ryder) and making her family happy as well, or choosing a tempting woman with a free mind (Michelle Pfieffer).

Both, the novel and the film are set in upper class New York City in the 1870s.The Age of Innocence is the movie that proves once again what a versatile talented, unpredictable, incredibly passionate, and artistically outstanding director Martin Scorsese is. Recently I saw for the first time Scorsese's comedy After Hours and was fascinated how masterful he was in creating a darkly funny surreal comedy. Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching. It is PG rated, and the characters speak in refined, almost forgotten English. The director himself described The Age of Innocence as the most violent film he's ever made, clearly referring to the inner turmoil, disappointment and resignation the two main characters of this drama go through.The material world Scorsese created and paints with his lenses is of incredible beauty. Michael Ballhaus' camera brings out the perfection of craftsmanship of every object it looks at be it the costumes (Oscar statuette for Gabriella Pescucci who has dressed the heroes of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Der Name der Rose (1986), and Upon a Time in America (1984) to name a few), china, crystal, silver, flower arrangements, jewelry or furniture. The exquisite meals looked delicious and required a special food consultant who was mentioned in the film's credits. Or take for example these elegant leather ladies gloves with small buttons. Who would think that unbuttoning a glove on the hand of a beautiful woman slowly, tenderly, makes one of the most erotic scene ever filmed? The people who inhabited this world of beauty, comfort, and privilege seem the perfect happy creatures but not all is so perfect in the paradise. Two beautiful passionate people found love that could only happen once in a life time but the strict norms or society they live in and the unbending unwritten rules based on convention and hypocrisy they must obey won't permit them to follow their hearts freely, to fulfill their desire, and to be happy in that Age of Innocence. The cast is superb, and includes Daniel Day-Lewis, the film protagonist Newland Archer, Michelle Pfeiffer, as Countess Olenska, a woman with a Past who stole his heart, and very young Winona Ryder, May Welland, the girl whom Archer will marry. 22 years old Ryder very deservingly received the Oscar nomination for her performance. I would like to mention Joanne Woodward's subtle narrating of Edith Wharton's prose which is one of the high points of the film. IMO, the film has only high points and is Martin Scorsese's fine (perhaps, the finest) and stunning achievement.

Yet, I see this film as very similar to Goodfellas. Each catalogue the lives of people who live by a very strict code of conduct. Each has their particular sense of honor and loyalty. Each have methods of dealing with those who step outside the box. In Goodfellas it is guns and fists (or kitchen knives); in The Age of Innocence it is gossip and dinner invitations. Both films are rich, elaborate representations of a specific way of life. Scorsese is a filmmaker completely in control of his craft. Every aspect of this film adds an integral part to it. Nothing is incidental or superfluous. The production design in this film is as good as it gets. There is so much detail in every scene. The houses these people live in a founded on the principle of appearances, much like their lives. Everything in them is designed to disguise or distort the truth. I love that fact that the walls are covered, floor to ceiling, with pictures. These people strive to be living portraits, perfect in every visible detail. The music and sound is perfectly suited. There is a bitter loveliness to the score. The classical movement that Scorsese uses is lovely and meaningful. The acting is fantastic. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest current actors. He gives a very deep and complete performance. I could feel his despair and claustrophobia. Michelle Pieffer is very ironic and cynical. She, like Lewis' character, is a real being trapped in a world of contrived illusion. Ryder's performance is one of the key performances in the film. She is sly and cunning, completely in control of her surroundings. Yet she is able to mask her devilish manipulation as a sweet, shy exterior. I love the narration of the film. It would not have made sense in this film for one of the main characters to narrate, as in Goodfellas. The world in this film is determined by what other people think and say. So it is apropos to have a exterior commentator. Woodward does fine work as the cynical, satirical commentator, exposing the rotten underbelly of this world, and doing it with wily delight. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Scorsese never moves his camera without purpose. Each shot is executed for the maximum emotional and cognitive effect. The scenes are edited masterfully. Many times he will cut away right in the middle of a shot to an image that perfectly metaphors the mood and context of the scene. This is one of the most tightly composed films of Scorsese I have seen. I need to watch this film more times. It is very complex. It is a great film.

The smoothness of the camera, that one continuous shot, takes my breath away each time I watch it, it is pure art.It might not be one continuous shot in The Age of Innocence, but I found similarities with Russian Ark. With a slow moving camera, Scorsese takes time to show us many details from the decoration, the life of the high society where the strict code of conduct is well depicted, ex men's white gloves, cutting cigars, social convention... what is acceptable and what is not. The same way Russian Ark awakes the senses, The Age gave me the feeling I could smell the flowers or the food, touch the velvet, taste the drinks, hear the music and by watching it, be part of it. I'm not sure that the 2 main female characters were the bests to play their parts, but Scorsese was able to build a subtle sexual tension between them and Newland (played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is very good). The score enhance the emotions and the parallel made between the tragic opera and Newland's dilemma becomes heartbreaking at the end.

So if you like Daniel Day-Lewis, you may well love the film--he's in nearly every scene. For my part, I find him almost unbearable to watch, never more so than here. It's hard to imagine him as an object of desire, even in this period piece. And saddling his character with feminist political philosophy, while it may enhance his appeal to some viewers, is a stretch from the novel's characterization and quite anachronistic besides.However, the other leads are notably fine (especially Michelle Pfeiffer and even the endlessly variable Winona Ryder) and there are knockout performances in the supporting roles, particularly Siân Phillips, Jonathan Pryce and Miriam Margolyes.Otherwise, the film's pacing is the problem. The film is simply overlong; boring and tedious at times (and I'm a person who loves Bergman), although never less than stunning visually. That last fact alone carried me through several scenes.

Daniel Day-Lewis's respected lawyer is engaged to Winona Ryder's heiress, but then falls for her cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer).The idea behind the story is that the main character is as trapped by his surroundings as is Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. There's not an iota of bloodshed in this adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel, but the emotional violence that the characters here perpetrate on each other is analogous to the physical violence in Scorsese's most famous movies. The innocence of the title is as much of a facade as is the lifestyle in The Graduate.Nonetheless, I couldn't watch the movie without throwing out a few MST3K-style comments. For one thing, I kept thinking to myself This is directed by the man who gave us 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Also, any look at high society tempts me to launch some barbs. I just find it hard to take such a focus seriously. To crown everything, Daniel Day-Lewis's other 1993 movie was In the Name of the Father, which couldn't have been more different from The Age of Innocence.In the end, I recommend the movie.

After reading the novel, I was fascinated as to how it would best look on film, as subtlety is such a big part of how the characters interact and how their world functions, which puts a lot of pressure on the actors and writers to convey it through actions instead of narration. It's a success thanks to a faithful yet cinematic screenplay and great performances a well thought out cast. Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer are electric as Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska and are able to make some steamy scenes within the PG rating, which is quite impressive. Winona Ryder received the most acclaim for her role as May Welland, though her performance was enigmatic. I didn't quite pick up the innocent scheming that her character requires, but I'll have to contemplate it more.

I remember finding Day-Lewis' acting and character far too languid and exasperatingly soft-spoken for instance. Having examined the film closely this time, I have found that both Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer are in fact breathtaking. Day- Lewis' character is meek only on the outside; on his face, he lets you glimpse into the storm and the rebellion that are raging inside. Pfeiffer's Countess Olenska is vivid and charming, at times woeful. In those incredible eyes of hers - made of glass, tinged with blood sometimes - and under her smile, there is struggle, vulnerability and abnegation. When you watch this film, you cannot be knitting or snacking, you should not leave the actors out of your sight for a second or you will miss the action. The film is like a bow that is being subtly stretched and stretched to its utter limit and never released.The story is wonderful from a writer's point of view, awful from a human perspective.Edith Wharton is the negative image of Jane Austen. She studies 19th century American high society with the same scrutiny and mercilessness as Austen observes the ridicules of the Regency landed gentry. But Austen is infinitely pleasing and funny, Wharton's characters are tormented, desperate, trapped, their lives wasted. Your heart breaks.I come to the point I really wanted to make. Scorsese's film is flawed. The incredible acting, Wharton's story, the costumes, the music and the director's unquestionable skills result in a film that is utterly compelling, but a disaster... of sorts.First of all, there is the awful narration. Yes, the words are beautifully written. Of course they are, they belong to Edith Wharton. But they are a nuisance in the context of the film, like a mosquito buzzing in your ear, or unwanted background music. Why does a director of this caliber resort to such a clumsy method to inform the audience?Secondly, Scorsese's virtuosity gets in the way of the story. He is too present as a director. What works wonderfully well in his other films often appears superfluous or downright monstrous here. Not a single frame is shot without the director's ostentatious signature on it. Everything is filmed flamboyantly, stylishly.The lavish camera work is trying to match point by point the sumptuous nature of the story, the magnificent costumes, the opera house, the forbidden and exacerbated feelings, the muted scandals. It becomes a character of its own, a distracting, overwhelming creature. In this story of restraint, the camera is too loud.The BBC makes better period adaptations, they seem to have worked out that the best make-up is the one you cannot see. With works by Austen and Wharton, you do not have to muster all your directorial sorcery, the stories are so exquisitely written that, once you have got your team of writers, actors, hairdressers etc, you just have to let the plots unfold. They take care of themselves.What a strange period drama Scorsese has given us. A riveting failure. A beautiful disaster. Like the lives of Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska.

Then you asked me to go on with a false one- Newland Archer Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a well-respected lawyer who begins to fall for Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) whilst he is engaged to her cousin Mary Welland (Winona Ryder). There is much more depth to the film than just an internal love story as it expresses the lives of the upper class in New York. The exclusivity and distinction of the elite is beautifully shown in this film of passion and loss as the masquerade of the period politics slowly fall apart in the eyes of Newland Archer.The film Age of Innocence takes us into a new realm of skill shown by Martin Scorsese with this brilliant period piece set on the novel by Edith Wharton written in 1920. Scorsese's repertoire has largely held the grit of films such as Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas, but with Age of Innocence there is a more delicate touch to the way the plot unfolds. The novel was introduced to Scorsese by Jay Cocks, who then co wrote the script with him in is his first attempt at converting English literary into a film. What makes this a magnificent piece is Scorsese's understanding of creating an atmosphere that constantly intrigues despite the fact little may seemingly be going on. It is the lighting of the sets that really captures the period of the film, as the candles and fires flicker on the screen. The whole mood of the film stirs within the use of the shadows Scorsese spreads over those whose unorthodox nature could not fit into the mold of the strict high family politics. The beautiful set designs and Academy Award winning costumes brings real sincerity to the exclusion of the high society. The three central performances from Daniel-Day Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder hold the whole social orchestration of the time perfectly. Winona Ryder puts in the performance of her career portraying a delicate and indifferent fabrication to the political tide around her that she rose to with covert ease. A long period of time is covered in the film as we follow their lives and it is the interaction between the central three that stops the film stable as they create the subtle changes with age.The run time is fairly long, standing at two hours twenty minutes, with a long period of the characters lives being covered. There are often jumps of years at a time, which could make for a very messy narrative, however, Joanne Woodward pieces, this together with some elegant narration. It is perfectly condensed into longer sequences and will often include traits of the time during lingering camera work on specifics of the time.It is a film of utter splendour, as we watch the elite play their own little game of beauty, which will no doubt put many off. It is worth seeing to witness a masterful paintbrush by Martin Scorsese who shows a new range of skills that continues to put him in the running as one of the greatest directors of all time. "},{"Title":"Innocent on the surface","Date":"17 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. The Age of Innocence is one of his most refined movies. The décor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire.Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of high society. This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In The Age of Innocence, Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the outsiders that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fiancé May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families.Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the old fashioned days&#x97;inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society.Nevertheless, The Age of Innocence will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence. "},{"Title":"An interesting, but failed, departure.","Date":"27 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout.Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict.Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fiancée Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart.Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage.However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen.There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story.The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment &#x96; it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie.It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of cliché. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough.But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull. "},{"Title":"Crooked relations in a degenerate society","Date":"2 January 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I used the last days of December to watch some films, that I found inspiring about a decade ago. The film The Age of Innocence was among them. Around 2000 I watched it quite a number of times, and was deeply moved by the social and emotional atmosphere. I tried to analyze the dialogs, which are evidently ambiguous on the psychological level. I even read the book by Edith Wharton, which closely resembles the film. Or to be more precise, the film manages to give a very accurate portrayal of the book. At the time I empathized with the dilemma of the main male character, Newland Archer, namely the impossible choice between two very different women. Today to my surprise I found it unpleasant to see The Age of Innocence again. The narrative and the characters irritated me, and I had to force myself to watch the thing until its end. Since the film has not changed, it must be my new perspective on such matters. I find the moaning and whining of Archer, and his wives May (true) and Ellen (off the record) disgusting and crooked. This does not mean, that I question the credibility of the story. On the contrary, three-cornered love affairs are probably fairly common. I am sure that it is possible to make a psycho-analysis of the characters, that would make their behavior rational. My problem is, that as distinct from a twelve years ago I am no longer prepared to indulge in this psycho-analysis. It is just not a theme. The appearance of the relations is simply too tragic. The situations of the main characters are devoid of hope, and nevertheless they seem to find their fate agreeable. Thus their mental states look utterly ill. Should the inability of Archer to make a choice not motivate him to abandon both women? For it is obvious that neither May or Ellen gives him complete satisfaction.A decade ago I did not yet grasp the importance of the society on the fate of the main characters. It may be that Archer and his wives should broaden their social insight, but their community forbids them to do so. It is supposed to be the elite of New York, but their social circle is decaying. Archer may be an excellent advocate - I doubt it - but he is definitely bourgeois. At about the same time the economist T.B. Veblen made a study of the important families of the USA. Veblen felt, that these families and also the new rising class of large entrepreneurs were totally useless and even harmful. They led a life of wasteful ostentation and opulence, which Veblen called conspicuous consumption. This elite preferred to earn their income by means of speculation and manipulations, that where damaging to the productivity. Fortunately thanks to the instinct of workmanship of the technicians the enterprises remained healthy, which allowed the progress to continue. The picture of Veblen of the elite as an isolated class fits nicely with the decadence shown in The Age of Innocence.A nasty theme does not disqualify a film. The life in a degenerated community and its lack of progress are just unpleasant to watch.

My ONLY complaint has to do with the angle that the description of the movie on the DVD gives...Instead of implying that the 18th century attitudes were so proper and Newland's reactions to his situation were so correct, I felt differently about what the movie message was, particularly regarding Newland. Unlike what the description says, Newland did NOT risk everything he had to be with Ellen--he risked NOTHING!!! That's why he lost. Newland was more concerned about his image and reputation,(not unlike most people today), than being true to his heart and everyone else. He wanted to have his cake and eat it too, on his own terms, but keep his image intact. Ellen said, I love you, but I don't want you this way...and her integrity far outshined Newland's, but he didn't seem too concerned about it in himself. Newland in my eyes, was not a man of honor like he so tried to project himself to be, but rather a weakling. By not being openly forthright and honest on all accounts, he created what he feared. So Newland got exactly what he asked for. Nothing he wanted, but all he deserved.

Martin Scorsese, as if it wasn't yet known, cemented his legacy as the finest American director of his day with this pitch-perfect tale of forbidden love and strict social mores in upper-crust New York in the late 19th century. Scorsese has famously said that this is his most violent film, which he means in reference to the emotional undertones conflicting harshly below the surface of the breath-taking elegance. This is the central theme of the film, and one that fascinates Scorsese and us. How did these people live? What adds to the film tremendously are the fine performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer. Both are very fine actors, Day-Lewis in particular is one of the great actors of all time, but within this particular era and hierarchy of class, they are required to suppress nearly all outward feelings and emotions in order to maintain the ranking they have achieved. In such a structured state, both are superb in their roles as two people always at odds with society's notions of behavior and morals, leading them towards each other and away from everyone else, including Day-Lewis' fiancée, May Welland. As May, Winona Ryder is good as the quiet, gentle type who despite her appearance is aware of all happening around her. In the end, Ryder is probably the one weak link of all the acting, not entirely able to handle the steep, eloquent language of the novel as well as Pfeiffer and certainly not as well as Day-Lewis.In the end, what Scorsese suggests through these characters and their actions becomes more powerful and telling than any form of physical or visceral violence. On top of that, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. The sets are as realistic as possible, the costumes are elegant and stunning, and all the while Scorsese's effortless camera movements capture what he sees as tribal rituals done not to fulfill desires or needs but to present a false image of what life should be like instead of what it is. Certainly, this is a film that bears repeated views and due to the beauty of the language, sets, costumes and Michelle Pfeiffer, that won't be a problem.

Martin Scorsese has been one of my favorite directors for some time now yet this is a film that I have always put off watching. To me, looking at the cover box and watching the trailer, I expected little more than beautiful eye candy with three attractive stars. What exactly could Scorsese bring to the issue of high society in the 1800's that hasn't been already addressed? As it turns out, quite a bit.With The Age of Innocence, Scorsese plays against type (if doing so as a director is possible) and dives straight into a genre that he is both not well known for as well as not directly familiar with. His lavish art direction and assured directing help make a familiar tale of doomed love breathe with new life. For example, one element of the film that I found fascinating was the film's use of colors to represent themes of the various characters. I love how the forbidden Ellen is always shown in dark, startling colors like bright blues, vibrant yellows, and blood reds whereas the pristine imagine of Mae is shown through light colors like soft, delicate pastels. As for the acting, I found it all to be uniformly superb. From Michelle Pfeiffer, as the fallen from grace Ellen, to the underrated work of Winona Ryder, as uptight May Welland, it all works.As for the twist ending, I wasn't really all that surprised. For a movie that is very beautifully mounted and fully aware of its style over substance, it should come as no surprise that Archer doesn't end up with Ellen. In reality, he wouldn't have either. Image meant a lot in the 1800's&#133;and still does today. Why give up his vision of perfection when it may not honestly be perfection at all?

With beautiful detail, and sumptuous to watch, this is one of the strengths of this film.But there are two main triumphs Firstly, Daniel Day-Lewis gives an intelligent introspective performance as Newland Archer. His intense relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer sparkles on the screen, and Day-Lewis really gives live to Newland, lifting him off the page as a man caught between two ways of life- rebellion and convention.And secondly, the glowing, knowing narration by Joanne Woodward adds real depth to this social drama. In my opinion the use of narration, saves this film from just being a mere 'costume drama' with emphasis on visual detail than the story itself. Woodward's voice gives reflection and depth to the social context.The acting is well founded and suitably subtle. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the 'wayward' Countess Olenska is poignant and fragile yet with the same intensity that Day-Lewis connotes. Her accent is a little too 'American' however, as she looses some of the New England diction that was custom of the time.Winona Ryder sensibly underplays her role as the good hearted May, adding a welcome snooty streak to the character.The supporting cast is well chosen and distinguished, with co-stars such as Geraldine Chaplin, Richard E. Grant, Miriam Margoyles and Sian Phillips. But it is really Margoyles and Phillips who stand out from this line-up, as socially conscious matriarchs.A few of the flaws lie in lingering close-ups and shots, while it is obvious that they are there to establish the attraction between Day Lewis and Pfeiffer's characters, they are slightly overdone.Some of the opera scenes feel a bit 'forced' as well, and do not quite fit into the structure of the film as a whole.But otherwise for Scorcese, this is a triumph proving himself as capable of handling delicate, sensitive romantic dramas with a social conscience.

Scorsese and Jay cocks have written a great screenplay in Age of innocence, almost as great as the one in gangs of new york, although the cast is better in this film. This film was great, with possibly one of the best scores of any of scorseses films (although doesn't match taxi driver and goodfellas of course). The score was one of my favorite parts, thanks to Elmer bernstiens great work. This is a great entertaining film, an underrated Scorsese masterpiece. 10/10 #61 on my list of all-time favorite films "},{"Title":"Most beautiful and heartbreaking movie I have ever seen...","Date":"26 February 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I saw this when it first came out in the theater and loved it.

Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer play three characters caught up in a love triangle during a period in time when society dictated what type of behavior was to be considered appropriate and acceptable, and any stray from the norm would serve as ground for ostracism. This film was quite a change from some of the other films that Martin Scorsese has directed, especially his better-known violent films. He managed to make this a compelling film that tells the story of life in an intricate little world of privilege where keeping up appearances was of extreme importance. Scorsese's direction, the performances of the three leads, as well as the cinematography, production design, and costumes make this one of the better films of the 1990s and one of Martin Scorsese's best films.

The fluid camera movement shows the audience the beautiful rooms and costumes of the late 19th century New York society. Scorcese also pays close attention to the mechanics of the society; we can watch the meat being carved and the cigars being clipped and lit. Just as in Goodfellas, we watch how the mob works from the inside, Age of Innocence lets us watch the inner workings of this scoiety. Of course there are the stylistic techniques that Scorcese is famous for. The way he darkens part of the screen and focuses on Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer in one scene at the opera is further proof of his genuis as a film maker.

Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors duty above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it.

The vile backstabbing of old New York society feels as realistically portrayed as the other New York we normally associate Scorcese with. We are truly transported into this era - the director being significantly aided by some truly incredible performances. Daniel Day Lewis, who is without a doubt the best film actor in the world, certainly of the last 20 or so years, is predictably excellent, but this film really belongs to its women.

The most violent act is that of a hand putting a letter on a silver tray (and this can be very violent, in fact), or a quiet man lighting a cigarette during a conversation, or the main character (Daniel Day-Lewis) looking at the hat of his rival. Everything played by extraordinary actors and actresses like Siân Phillips, Geraldine Chaplin, Norman Lloyd, Richard E. Grant, Alexis Smith or Michael Gough, not to mention the leading roles (the presence of two beauties like Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder might be a just too evident warning of the special qualities of this film).You have not lived until you have heard the voice of Joanne Woodward narrating the story by Edith Wharton subtlety, irony, sorrow. Only a person with a rich experience of life could talk like that, with such depth. The Spanish version had the voice of Nuria Espert, a veteran Catalan actress a right choice. Unfortunately, the version showed on Catalan TV had the voice of a young woman (of course, I expected Espert or any other among many excellent Catalan actresses of similar age) and although that young actress did her best, the narration was not the same the burden of life is necessary in the voice telling such a tragic story.Sublime music by Elmer Bernstein, exquisite photography by Michael Ballhaus, expert editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, production design by master Dante Ferretti... and of course Scorsese's long traveling shots, color flashes, and a lesson on the possibilities of cinema everything in this film is aesthetic perfection, unappreciated by many viewers who perhaps miss subtle details or don't feel the overall harmony of such a unique masterpiece.10 out of 10 with no doubt.

It's a meticulous, richly detailed, leisurely adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel about a thwarted love affair between a man who is engaged to a beautiful young girl (Winona Ryder) and his yearning for her more worldly cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer). It's a yen that can't be dismissed lightly--in fact, it's a love that haunts him all of his life as he pretends to be a loyal husband with nothing more on his mind than fitting in with upper-class New York society.He reaches the end of the story, imprisoned by society and never able to spend time with the woman he really loves. Slow pacing hurts the narrative (as does the use of a narration by Joanne Woodward which is offsetting more than anything else). A more genteel narrator would have suited the voiceover for this one.As the troubled hero, Daniel Day-Lewis is the focal point of the entire story and gives an admirable performance, particularly touching in the final scene with his son. Ryder does fairly well with a less complex role but never seems much more than a naive and rather shallow young woman until a revelation about her that comes toward the finale. Michelle Pfeiffer is striking but never seems to fit comfortably into the period scene--she seems too modern even though she's playing an independent soul here.Surprising to see Alexis Smith in such a small supporting role, looking a bit frail in what must have been one of her last appearances. As for director Scorsese, this is a far cry from his gangster element but he does a superb job of recreating an age of elegance and manners among the idle rich in the New York society of the 1870s.

This is PIVOTAL to the story. From where does this forbidden attraction sprout? You mean to tell me that they chat a few times at social functions, giggle at a few trite insults they trade at the expense of some of New York's gluttonous upper crust (of which they are a part), and that's it? They become utterly spiritually and erotically consumed with one another? Sorry, don't buy it. I suppose there is such a thing as love at first sight or some variation of it, but I couldn't make that leap of imagination here either. There lacked, I thought, that intangible chemistry between two lovers. (I think of Calista Flockhart and Robert Downey Jr. in that one episode I saw of Ali McBeale. Hard to describe, but that's chemistry.)As for the erotic scene, I had to suppress chuckles. This could have been very highly charged if only the chemistry between them was there--either by having set up the attraction more plausibly or by casting more appropriate actors--and since it wasn't, it looked ridiculous. One minute they're talking, next minute he's sniffing her slipper.Day-Lewis' performance was starchy from beginning to end. I thought, at first, that it was a way to show what a person became in a society such as that--stiff, wooden, bland. But then I thought, people had souls even then. They may have been strictly bound by formality in public, but in private they were still human and could get angry, be passionate, be distraught, etc. I could see Day-Lewis trying to do that at times, but that stiffness just wouldn't go away. (Who knows, maybe that's the point.)Pfeiffer was miscast. Mysterious, cultured, a dark, shameful past? Uh-uh. She just struck me a broad from abroad. Big deal.Winona Ryder's performance was very good. It may have been just Winona being Winona as opposed to great acting, but she played the part of the dainty, rose-cheeked, innocent (but scheming when it comes to keeping her man), New York Victorian bride to a tee.The narration was very irritating, the voice grating on my ears.

A story of obsession... being obsessed with a thing you can not have to the point of missing the life you do have. Focusing on the fruit of the forbidden will rob a person if they allow it to. It's a story as old as time... the story of Adam and Eve... of being so far sighted in looking outside that you miss the blessing of what's right in front of you and chase after an idea, a dream, an idealization. It is Satan's lie, as old as time itself. I know that this does not fit with the typical interpretation of an Edith Wharton novel, but it is the view that I take on the story. Perhaps Edith Wharton was writing about the thing she herself realized she missed by flouting the rules.When he walks away at the end I take it as his final realization that the life he chose was the one with which he was blessed.

The film has kind of been forgotten over the years but I guess I can bring it back. To be honest, if you're expecting your usual Scorsese bloodbath, you're not gonna get. Just listen to the title. Even though it's not one of his best works, its still a film to admire.The film is a period piece. The film is about a nice man named Newland Archer(played with sweetness by Daniel Day Lewis), who is engaged to a nice girl(played with even more sweetness by Winona Ryder) and claims to love her, though he doesn't really know her all that well. But he ends up falling for her cousin(played by Michelle Pfeifer), and in this time, that sort of thing was very wrong, and still is.Even though Lewis' character is doing a wrong thing, you still feel for him and care about him. Its mainly because he's such a nice character, and he is actually haunted by what he's doing. And I admire that.The Age of Innocence is a little slow. But the performances are delightful and strong, and the ending is wonderful. I didn't love The Age of Innocence quite as much as I wanted to, but I still enjoyed it. It's probably Scorsese's first and last chick flick. So, I recommend it to them, and anyone who is up for it.

Lewis is excellent as a lawyer engaged to a simple young woman but in love with his fiancé's worldly cousin. Pfeiffer is enchanting as the object of Lewis's desire.

Things start to change for Newland when May's cousin, the unconventional Dutchess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), moves to New York following the separation of her and her Polish Count husband. As Newland helps her through legal matters Newland begins to fall in love with her, and begins to question his relationship with May.Martin Scorsese had been considering making a romance for years, but could never seem to find the right project. Then in 1980 screenwriter Jay Cocks gave Scorsese a copy of Edith Wharton's book The Age of Innocence saying, When you do that romantic piece, this one is you. Seven years later, Scorsese finally read the book and decided to make the movie. Not only did he make the movie, he got his first choice for the three leads in the cast.This movie gives an interesting look into the gossipy nature of old school high society New York. Through the narration of the movie you really feel like you're being thrust into the middle of these people's lives. You hear the gossip, see the backstabbing, and deal with the rules of residing in high society. It's because of the toying with emotions and backstabbing that occurs in high society that Scorsese said this is the most violent movie he ever made.In high society it's only natural that people will hide their true feelings beneath the surface, and here the actors due a superb job at exemplifying that trait. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as a the man torn between his fiancé and her cousin, but trying to hide it from the world. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as the woman who catches Newland's heart with her unorthodox behavior. But it's Winona Ryder who steals the show. As May, she plays a character who acts clueless, but underneath she's broken by what's going on and plotting to keep her husband.If you like period dramas or Scorsese films I highly recommend this film. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about this movie when I was first done watching this, but in the time since I've thought about it and I have to admit that I'm definitely going to be watching it again.

"},{"Title":"Scrumptious, stylish, but slight","Date":"14 September 2010","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The Age of Innocence finds actors Daniel Day-Lewis playing Newland Archer, a lawyer in 1870s New York who is engaged to May Welland, played by the always-fragile Winona Ryder. Gradually, however, Newland falls in love with Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), a social outcast whose rebellious and fiery personality intrigues him far more than his beautiful but conventional bride to be. A love triangle thus ensues.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is however more interested in looking at the ways in which 19th century New York is divided into gangs of gossipping sophisticates, all of whom hypocritically turn their noses up to the scandals surrounding Countess Olenska. The film is mostly a triumph of style over substance, though, Scorsese so terrified of losing his audience that he defensively serves up an endless succession of stylistic flourishes.The style is great, of course, but there's none of the depth or scope of Visconti (particularly Senso and The Leopard), De Sica, Minnelli, Rosselini, Truffaut's Two English Girls, Welles' The Magnificent Amberson's, Sternberg's Scarlett Empress, the lurid melodramas of Wyler (The Heiress etc) and Ophuls (The Earrings of Maddame De, Letter From an Unknown Woman) or even Merchant Ivory's The Remains of the Day, which was released the same year as The Age of Innocence and tells the same story whilst also managing to touch upon so much more.The film is often compared to Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and the bourgeois anxieties of early Antonioni, but these comparisons aren't apt. Scorsese's really emulating Powell and Pressburger's Black Narcissus, which likewise used a hyper-saturated palette and eye-popping visuals to tell the tale of a sexually repressed romance between an uptight nun and a gaudy, vulgar man. Innocence offers the same story, only here it is Newland Archer who is rigid and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays the more liberated character, their passions translating, like Black Narcissus, to the film's lush visual style, in which repressed desires seem to blossom from every frame. Both films are gorgeously shot and ooze a kind of suffocated sex, but compare them to, say, The Remains of The Day (another film about an uptight character in love with a liberated young woman but unable to act due to societal pressures), the similarly themed Far From Heaven, or any of the films/directors I listed above, one sees how small an artist Scorsese is once you peel back the petals.But even if we take the film solely as an exercise in style, there is a sense that Scorsese's style is itself an attempt to distract us from a lack of style. Watch how small every scene is, how there is no sense of true three-dimensional space, how afraid the camera is of breaking its tether or connection with its actors, how the film lacks any spatial sense. It's all very pretty, all very neatly arranged, but so very small.Bizarrely, the film's style also undermines or works in direct opposition to the story. Consider this the film is about how protocols and rituals stifle emotions and become a form of oppressively decorous formality. And yet Scorsese's camera is so obsessed with impressing his audience that he marries what should be inflexible rituals and constrictions (ie the despotism of protocol) to fluid camera swoops, dazzling pans and wonderful iris shots. The camera breathes flexibility, freedom and sensation into what should be observed rigidness.Beyond this you have another wonderful performance by Daniel Day Lewis. His character may not be as iconic as Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day, but his performance is arguably better, if only because he has the difficult task of taming Scorsese's technique. Day Lewis acts with his forehead and lips here, turning his face into a cauldron of pent up emotions. Scorsese's camera may dance, but Lewis' face doesn't move an inch.8/10 &#x96; The film opens with a typo, the words New York City, the 1870's containing a superfluous apostrophe which highlights how unconcerned the film is with time and place. Manny Farber called this white elephant art, but others call it great cinema. In truth, it's a mixture of the two. Scorsese technique is impressive (along with Kundun, this is Scorsese's most visually impeccable film; visually, it glides), but what it's in service of never is.Worth multiple viewings.

This film is artistic, romantic, sophisticated but also gives us the deep understanding on life and love. Anybody who has experienced a feeling of love which seems to be immoral could understand the behaviors of Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis). The lovers can never achieve their desires and such a love might be old-fashioned. The couple is always prevented by such obstacles as society, class, fame, family, etc. Although the story written by Edith Wharton is set in an early 20th Century New York City upper class, we, living in the present days, are also surrounded by the same or the other obstacles in some situations.Some scenes are picturesque; when Newland Archer watches Ellen on the back on the seashore, she does not notice him and watches a beautiful barque passing by and she does not turn her head though he wants her to do so; after Ellen was informed that Archer's wife, May (Winona Ryder) was pregnant, she pretends to be calm, says good-bye to Newland, supported by their acquaintances who know everything about their hidden feeling, and departs by a carriage with the pale face; in the last scene, old Newland is dazzled by the sun light reflected on a window of Ellen's apartment her maid tries to close, and is reminded of the seashore scene where, however, Ellen notices him and turns her head in his imagination.In this film, we often see people eat at beautifully decorated tables and with refined tableware, and Scorsese seems to highlight those meal scenes.Daniel Day-Lewis well performs the elegance and intelligence of Newland Archer, and Michelle Pfeiffer skilfully expresses Ellen's state of mind. Winona Ryder is young, pure and innocently pretty. Furthermore, Joanne Woodward's narration and Elmer Bernstein's music are also keys to add more taste to the film.I would like to recommend you to see Scorsese's another world!

As much as a man can be. And do you think there's a limit?* * Spoilers throughout, I'm afraid. * * Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), an impeccably eligible bachelor, adornment of New York's high society of the late nineteenth century, is startled to find himself actually caring, deeply, for something outside of the self-imposed strictures of his mapped-out life. How unfortunate, then, that the object is not his dull new fiancée, but his cousin, an altogether rarer creature &#150; and that their kindling mutual attachment sets them apart, threatening to make outcasts of them both. Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) was once plain old Ellen Mingott; now, fleeing her impossible foreign husband, impossibly exotic herself in the tiny, enclosed world of Old New York, she thinks she has found kind old friends and a home, but discovers that they are just another set of impossible shackles. But despite her whiff of the corrupt Old World, Ellen has fresh new ways of looking at and responding to the world around her that work on Newland immediately. Old New York is all style and no substance its rigours are morbid, obscene, hypocritical, as artificial and constricting as a corset. Nothing can be said or done, or worn, that is not sanctioned by the severe eyes of Society. In this charged atmosphere, in a world so controlled, tiny details (the colour of a flower, a woman's decision to walk across a room) take on depth and intensity (and, of course, have specific consequences). If you don't find the moment at theatre where Ellen refers to Newland's yellow roses unbearably sexually charged, I give you up. Your guide through this complicated world is Joanne Woodward's dry, elegant narrator, the authorial voice of the original novel by Edith Wharton. Themes of innocence are expertly spun throughout this story, no less so by Scorsese than by the book's author. Scorsese keeps his direction tight, subtle, in the background, so as not to swamp a large cast of characters, and a story that needs to be followed attentively. The art direction is brilliant; the costumes magnificent, and the various family homes around which the story centres perfectly reflect the characters of their inhabitants. Day Lewis brings marvellous life to Newland Archer. You feel the power &#150; and panic &#150; of his growing passion, as the predicament into which he has bound himself unfolds itself before him in ever more oppressive detail. Pfeiffer is immensely likable, really inhabiting the skin of the tarnished, elegant, headstrong Ellen. The effect of the chill upon her initiated by events in New York is that of corrupting her innocence. Even charmless Winona Ryder is, unfortunately for her, perfectly cast as May, the pretty, sporty, blank wife of Archer's old dreams, before his eyes were opened. Story and direction alike are really quite subversive they turn you and turn you, until you feel (don't you?) that true innocence lies in the hearts of the reluctant lovers, and that it is the surface 'innocence' of Old New York, with its prominent families, its subtle manoeuvrings, which is a sham, a corruption, unable to alter itself by so much as a whisker in its staid respectability. A less brave or passionate director would have made a colder, stuffier film, 'faithful' but dull (like May, Newland's fiancée). Scorsese finds the adventure, the emotional pull, the sarcasm and scathing criticism beneath the collected and 'proper' exterior. Wonderful, sad and beautiful, don't be put off by the 'period' label. Terence Davies' adaptation of Wharton's The House of Mirth is equal in excellence, its star Gillian Anderson a revelation.

Daniel Day-Lewis and the cast do a great job of just letting this story unfold before our eyes. Nothing is overdone and everything happens in a matter of fact way that seems to mesh with the times in late 1800 New York City(where this movie is set). The story is about a couple of the brink of their engagement where the marriage will link together two powerful families in the area, but arriving on the scene from overseas is a countess who has been left alone by her husband as she attempts a divorce in the U.S.(where it's legal but looked down upon). The Daniel Day-Lewis character befriends the countess played by Michelle Pfeiffer, excellently, and starts to become attracted to her. This starts a battle within him as to what should be, compared to what he wants, that spans throughout the rest of the movie. Martin Scorsese does a great job of making the focus the story in this adaptation of a novel and keeps your interest throughout. There is an underlying theme of never allowing the negative to be seen or spoken of in this culture but rather shown in the families acts. This is portrayed in who they invite to parties and for what occasions they have parties. It's all a very behind the scenes manipulative process of controlling their world and is done by whole groups of people in an almost natural and scary way. This theme plays out in the conclusion in a very negative way as we see that it is very difficult in this setting for people to have their real dreams fulfilled because everything is played out for them, making for an internal prison. Again, this is all portrayed excellently in this very under-stated and un-heralded masterpiece from a brilliant filmmaker.

As usual for then I was playing Hooke from work and saw it in a virtually empty theater for the noon day showing. Following on the heals of Cape Fear (One of the director's worst) I was undaunted to see what he had done with the material having read the book in college. This adaptation has the aid of a first rate voice over from Glen Close and since she is ready directly from Edith Wharton's novel one walks away with a two tiered experience. We get the character insight that only a novel can give but the superb cinematography really whisks you away to another time and place. The long tracking shot as our hero enters the long lobby of the mansion hosting the post ballet party reception is stunning, certainly rivaling the prolonged entrance of Henry Hill to the Copa.The only complaints from friends regarding the film is that it is boring. It is only boring to those that have short attention spans and next to the narcolepsy inducing Illusionist of this year it is positively riveting.

I admire Scorcese as a film historian - I'll listen to him talk for hours - but I don't like the kind of films he usually makes and thus I avoid them. INNOCENCE is an atypical Scorcese film and that's one reason I wanted to see it (the other being that I like literary period dramas such as this) - the only other films he's directed that I got through were ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and RAGING BULL (I enjoyed the latter much more than I expected to, finally seeing it only a few months ago) - I walked out of NEW YORK, NEW YORK and AFTER HOURS. I even turned off THE AVIATOR after about half an hour. He was just trying to hard to impress me, I guess.

His voice-over in that scene, as in many others, uses strange vowels that are probably the product of the adoption of a different accent for the role. While not exactly wrong, it is certainly striking. His voice-overs often tell us of his desire for societal change. Although most people have at some point felt iconoclastic emotion, Scorsese's 19C New York is sufficiently exotic and charming to me that I felt no desire to see any of it change.The string sections of the background score's leitmotif are gorgeous melodies, as are the waltzes at the numerous balls. It struck me that the history of popular Western dance is a trajectory from the structured dance, with mandated bodily contact waltz, to the completely unstructured, with no bodily contact rave. I also thought it was beautifully photographed. Like David Lynch, Martin Scorsese can equate architecture with character traits. In one instance, Olenska's house stands about six stories, in long shot and in stark relief to the snowy grid of empty lots that box it in.

Being as it was directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer, and set amongst the treacherous social climate of late 19th century New York. Unfortunately, it turns into little more than an endurance test.It's starts off promisingly, with a lush period setting being viewed with Scorsese's characteristically sweeping camera, and voice over narration. The complex world of New York socialites appears fascinating.  But the film never delivers on its promise.The story turns out to be painfully simplistic.  Newland (Day Lewis) falls in love with the Countess Alenska (Pfeiffer), but he is alas engaged to marry another much less interesting womanThis wouldn't have mattered if the characters had been vibrant and interesting, but alas it's only a radiant Pfeiffer who supplies a character with any spark whatsoever.  We can totally understand why Newland would fall for her.  Pfeiffer anchors the first half of the movie, but fades out in the second half, leaving us to put up with a stuffy performance from Day Lewis, and the annoying presence of Winona Ryder as May, his wife.I don't want to be too harsh on Day Lewis, he's a gifted actor, but here he gives a performance that makes Ralph Fiennes's performance in The English Patient look over-the-top.  This typifies my problem with the whole movie. The film is excessively restrained.  Emotion is implied, but never supplied. No one ever really shows sadness, or happiness, or anger.  It's no wonder people call this film boring, because virtually nothing happens in it.Ryder, who is so good at quirky outcasts (see Heathers) is totally out of place here.  It seems she watched Uma Thurman's prototype naive innocent in Dangerous Liaisons and tried to copy it.  She does not succeed and gives a very unappealing performance.This film is exquisitely made, so it's very hard to put it down.

It is, I think, the best costume picture I have ever seen. OK, The Leopard is greater, and Barry Lyndon might also be, but what company! The book is of course wonderful source material, but that doesn't guarantee greatness as a film; and the film has a sensuality, a tactile, flowing quality, that is utterly remarkable. Every vase on the bureau, painting on the wall, teapot on the table seems to have been chosen with meticulous care, and the whole thing feels lived in too; the camera roams the walls or the gallery at the opera the way our eyes might. Sublime. This is what I was hoping for when Scorsese labored for years on Gangs--a lovingly detailed, completely sensual immersion in the past. Didn't happen that time. But why this movie isn't on the shortlist of great literary adaptations I will never understand. It's a master filmmaker at his most fluid, and (as another reviewer on IMDb presciently put it) Visconti-like.I first saw this film at its (world?) premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. As just a normal plebe, I couldn't score a ticket for the daytime screening on the Lido, but as I waited to see something else I saw the European cinejournalists coming out, all looking nonplussed. I talked to a few of them, and all of them said it was boring and offered criticism along the lines of he just filmed the book. Nonetheless, I went later that week to an outdoor nighttime screening for the public at the Campo Santo Stefano (if I'm not mistaken), and from the opening shots of the blooming flowers across that widescreen space, I was truly captivated. But I must admit that I didn't fully trust my feelings about the film--the later American reviews seemed to echo the ones of the Euro journalists, and I wondered if it was seeing this film so far from home in a foreign location that had made it so vivid for me. But I saw it again about 12 years later and it came into focus just how great it really is, critics be damned. This is a film that gets better and better with age, especially since we're not surrounded by Merchant/Ivory style films like we were then, or rather nowadays they've all been Weinsteined into star vehicles for Gwyneth or Keira. Just as in that wonderful earlier comment on this thread by Jess Fink, I am happy/sad to see the film get so much love on this board. I had assumed there were so few of us, and we'd have 40 years in the wilderness before the world would catch on.Day-Lewis is terrific, as is most of the supporting cast, but the reason I can't give this a perfect 10--the only flaws I can think of--are the performances of the leading ladies. Pfeiffer has some good moments, but I think she is unable to fully carry off the complexity of the role. On second viewing, Ryder's performance seemed less stiff than I remembered from the initial viewing, but I do think she's also a little overmatched by the incredible actors around her. She makes a good effort though.A terrific film that will help round out your understanding of this great director.

What makes Edith Wharton's novel such a great read is that May Welland is a babe-and-a-half, the Belle of New York, desired by every man who sets eyes on her.  Newland Archer is the lucky dog who wins her heart.  Ellen Olenska, on the other hand, is a dark little woman who attracts Archer not with her looks but with her worldliness.  But instead of the big athletic blonde at whose  feet men want to throw themselves, Winona Ryder's May Welland is slight and rather anemic. The only reason you can think for Newland Archer to stay with her, and not run off with Ellen Olenska, is that he feels sorry for her.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a little better as Ellen Olenska, but you still sense in her the big bankable Hollywood star gamely doing whatever her handlers tell her to.Look at the archery competition scene some time. As played by Winona Ryder, May Welland's most characteristic gesture is a kind of apologetic smiling and shrugging.  When she wins, it's almost by  accident.  You half expect to see a man standing at her elbow helping her to manage the bow and  arrows.  There is absolutely nothing of Wharton's May Welland in her performance in this scene.  When on of the men acidly remarks that that's the only  bull's-eye she'll ever hit, you think to yourself what a pity poor May is both plain *and* stupid, when in  fact what you're hearing is the world's first Dumb Blonde joke.

Why is this? First, because we can't get into the soul of Newland Archer, as Wharton does, to understand his secret cravings and fears. While Mr. Lewis tries admirably, this movie is just not a vehicle for the expression of mens' inner visions, as Wharton provides with her written words. (See her Ralph Marvel character in Custom of the Country for inner visions.)The second reason is that the persona of Ellen Olenska is not developed in a way that makes her compellingly attractive. To me, Madam Olenska of the novel is a dark enigma, at the same time impetuous and patient, plain and yet beautiful, fair, honest, compassionate, compromised and yet virtuous, strong willed and yet vulnerable, possessing her own style, self-effacing, but not ashamed. She is a person who seeks to satisfy her own desires but is also willing to sacrifice all for those she loves. Newland Archer becomes hooked on her integrity. The Ellen of the movie doesn't portray the powerful, exotic, alluring presence of Wharton's Ellen.I agree with those who take exception to the screenplay, and think it could have been better adapted to the screen venue, more oriented toward character expression.I wonder about the casting decisions to embody Ellen with Ms. Pheiffer's light hair and complexion, and wide features, and to portray May with Ms. Ryder's dark hair and smaller person, reversing their personal qualities from the novel.

Pérez-Galdós would have been greatly angered by any similar treatment of his `Fortunata y Jacinta', for example. If Wharton in 1870 was decidedly retrograde, Scorsese in 1993 was definitely on another planet. How or why Scorsese could ever have been inspired to make a pretence replica of anything in the style of the magnificent `Fanny och Alexander' just beggars belief. He builds a sumptuous, even fastidious, set, decorates it with some rather good actors, and uses highly toned up coloring, no doubt as if to add insult to grievous occular harm, which, for 1870 New York, was indeed a gross insolence and incoherent injustice.The dialogues are somewhat akin to the luscious-looking dishes spread out on the extravagant tables made of plastic and indigestible, however brilliantly &#150; sic &#150; they may have been filmed.So much mannerism and forced modalities, at times taking on tragicomedy theatrical proportions, seemed as authentic as a penguin acting as a tourist guide in `La Alhambra'.The non-original music included some good pieces, even though `Alerte!

This is almost as bad as the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of The Bostonians (yawn!). Why on earth Scorsese thought it was a good idea to cast a brunette in the blonde's role and vice versa is beyond our comprehension, and if he was going to do that couldn't he have found ANYONE besides Winona Ryder to cast as May?  Frankly, we'd much rather watch Casino on an endless loop for a year than sit through this again Casino may just repeat Goodfellas but at least it doesn't make you cringe every five minutes.

Martin Scorsese directed and, though a few of his trademark touches are in evidence, his ultra-restrained atmosphere (while appropriate for the period) proves disenchanting as entertainment, turning his three star leads (Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder) into suffering, swooning waxworks. Scorsese was probably attempting to channel William Wyler and films such as The Heiress, but his take on this story is cold and unenticing, and everything from the dialogue to the melodrama is stilted. An Oscar winner for the costumes--appropriate since the picture is really all style. Story previously filmed in 1934 with Irene Dunne and John Boles. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"The Age of Innocence is Anything But **","Date":"20 August 2007","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Very disappointing film depicting upper class society in 1875 New York.The performances are incredibly bad. Michelle Pfeiffer is woefully miscast as the Princess Olenska. Princess? She sounds like she comes from a Brooklyn tenement. She is churlish at best and reminds me of Marilyn Monroe in Some Like it Hot.Equally bad is Winona Ryder in her supporting Oscar nominated performance. She pretends to be as naive as Melanie Hamilton in Gone With the Wind, when in reality she wasn't.Daniel Day Lewis rises above the mess and gives a fairly decent performance as the lawyer who falls for the cousin of the woman he is engaged to. British actress Miriam Margolyes is appealing as the stroke stricken grandmother to May.(Ryder)The film discusses the disdain for divorce among the upper crust. In reality, these people are nothing more than a bunch of snobs who attend operas and haven't exactly done a hard day's work.Lewis and Pfeiffer puff away on cigarettes. 1875 N.Y., smoking among women? If a woman smoked then, it was done very privately.The first part of the film is utterly boring. The second part is slightly better as the affair can't come to a head.The film really goes down when a period of 25-30 years is glossed over quickly to get the desired effect. The problem is that we get no desire from watching this.In essence, the film is a royal stinker.

It lacks so much of the novel's depth -- and what little it does manage to convey, it does in so clumsy a manner -- that I can only wonder whom Scorsese intended it for (the illiterate?).How much better it might have been if Scorsese had allowed himself to be inspired by the novel, and to set a similar story in that same world - or, perhaps, allowed himself to take a few liberties with Wharton's text, instead of adhering to it so unimaginatively. He did neither, and the result is one of the coldest adaptations I've ever had the displeasure of watching.Very briefly Read the book. You'll enjoy it. Skip this.

I can understand & appreciate Mr. Scorsese's efforts to pace the actors' readings, a valiant essay at simulating the dialogs of another age, but it only emphasizes the weaknesses of the performances of his primary actresses, Pfeiffer & Ryder, who whine away from a self-oriented post-Freudian core. Very disappointing.

I actually saw this movie in the theatre with some friends, and they all hated it and said it was slow and boring. I defended it at the time, and said they just didn't appreciate its subtleties. However, on second review, it just isn't very good.As the movie is based in the well-heeled society of New York City in the 1870s, you expect it to be a bit dry and formal. Unfortunately, the movie takes it to the extreme.The bottom line theme is that this is a story of a forbidden love of sorts, suppressed by the propriety of the society they live in and the circumstance that finds the parties married to other people. What happens when you find your true love and it is not the person you are married to...in 1870s NYC...whoops. In modern times, you just get divorced I guess. But at the time, in those social circles, divorce was a taboo that would lead to being ostracized from all the hip parties (and possibly your family). Why that would be a hindrance to true love I don't know, but it was in this movie.In any event, we get to watch the slow suffering of these estranged lovers over time, but Scorcese never quite hits the emotional vein that makes a tragedy of so long life really captivating to an audience. Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic per usual, one of the few bright spots. He really captured the essence of a proper man suffering greatly just underneath the surface. Michelle Pfifer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liasons (a far superior movie). The rest of the cast were so so, because the story and the movie were so so.If you've run out of movies to watch, or want something to fall asleep to, go ahead and give this movie a try. Otherwise, just read the Cliff Notes.

I hate this movie. I was very eager to watch it but then I got all bored. It was the most boring movie I have ever watched. Not because of the actors, of course. The acting was perfect in fact maybe that was worth watching but the rest...I hated it.All this talk about love and desire but where is this desire, no where in the movie desire is present just cheating and full stop. I thought there would be some ecxitment in this movie. In the way it is desire mentioned I hoped there would be other than just holding hands and kissing.Winona was the best actress and she acted the innocent May so well and she looked very cute. She is a very good actress, one of the best.Well, it is worth watching this film in fast forward.

And I mean that in a good way. This movieis beautifully crafted, and features Winona Ryders bestperformance since Little Women. Daniel Day Lewis has thethankless Edith Wharton male lead role- she wrote best forwomen- and Michelle Pfeiffer is that obscure object of desire.
