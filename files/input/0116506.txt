The result is a strange and fresh perspective of a country in crisis, as well as the perpetrators and victims of these horrific acts.Fourie (Danny Keogh) is sent deep undercover, to infiltrate the African National Congress and to kill one of it's highly ranked leaders, exiled in Zambia.What follows is a chilling journey into unknown territory, both geographical and emotional.  By the time Fourie close enough to achieve his aim the war is all but over. Mandela has been released from years of incarceration and Fourie's handlers in Pretoria have washed their hands of him. He is a lone white man in the heart of black Africa, confused, volatile and unpredictable.Danny Keogh turns in a chilling, world-class performance as Fourie, a disaffected man whose motivations are hard to determine. He is beyond black and white, right or wrong. It's easy to see how he how he could switch sides without renouncing violence.Tightly scripted and directed with vivid cinematography, this is a film you will not soon forget.  "}]
