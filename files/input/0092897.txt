Though it doesn't have much of a following, the movies does have some redeeming qualities that make it worth a rental.The plot follows 3 young men, Marky, Buffy, and Kool through getting fired from a low rate Nursing home. Lucky for them (or so they think) Winslow Lowry is right there to offer them a new job caring for his Uncle Albert.What the boys don't know is that Winslow actually wants his Uncle to die so that he can inherit Albert's huge fortune. On top of that, Mr. Winslow is in debt to Mr. Montana, a ruthless criminal mastermind. If Winslow doesn't get the money within 3 weeks, he's dead.Winslow's plan quickly backfires as he finds out that his new Orderlies have actually helped Albert feel young again.The movie itself is hilarious. It follows the tradition of the Three Stooges. The constant slap fights and kicks in the backside between the fat boys will keep you stomach in pain from laughter. Ralph Bellamy is great in his role as Albert Dennison. He keeps the movie fresh and alive. While Anthony Geary plays a perfect seedy bad guy.The Soundtrack is also great. The Fat Boys have some pretty catchy tunes throughout the movie, including a hilarious performance for the camera.Give it a Rent, while it's not for everyone, it may just make you laugh out loud a few times.

Heck, they're not even the Ritz Brothers. But their first (and last) big screen adventure (as stars, at least) still manages to hold enough appeal to be watchable.The former rap stars play bumbling orderlies hired on the hope their incompetence will speed up the passing of the wealthy Albert Dennison (the amiable Ralph Bellamy). Albert's nephew, you see, has some nasty debts to pay off. But the plan backfires when the boys and their antics breath new life into the old man. Never laugh-out-loud funny, and sometimes lame, Disorderlies is saved by its cheesy, uniquely '80s appeal. If you perked up at the phrase cheesy, uniquely '80s appeal, then this one's for you.

Its about 3 guys that get fired from their jobs at a nursing home and a sick millionaire's nephew hires them to  accidently kill him so he can inherit all of his uncle's money but that plan backfires. But the funniest part in the movie is when Kool starts blasting a grandfather clock with a machine gun. Thats All I'm going to say. I will only say this other thing. If your looking for a good laugh go to your local video store and rent Disorderlies if they got it and you won't regret it.

It captures the true essence of rap music, with a mastery of cinematography, bringing us an American family classic. This one should truly with stand the tests of time. I'll have to admit when first faced with the decision to watch this movie I hesitated, but I then read the plot on back--finally a story line nobody's had the guts to attempt. Three orderlies ,(or disorderlies in this very hilarious case), are hired to take care of a cranky old rich man. I won't ruin all the twists and surprises.I always thought of the Fat Boys as sub-par rappers, and probably terrible actors. Wrong about both. These guys are brilliant. They're the real pioneers of rappers acting,(Thank God for that).You're sure to watch this ground breaker dozens of times. You'll find yourself quoting some of the off the wall catch phrases, and you won't be able to quit singing their amazing version of the Beatles, Baby Your a Rich Man.

Especially when you have The Fat Boys. In the movie Disorderlies it's nonstop fun, and plenty of music, rhyme and reason to bolster the fun. Here you have three rotund orderlies from Brooklyn(The Fat Boys) who get canned and was spotted by the nephew of a rich man in Florida. The reason why he hired them so he can get his greedy hands on the fortune. While trying to adapt in the high life, the three orderlies put some A in the word attitude to the people there. Albert(Raplh Bellamy) gets to have fun with them. And when he started to act like them, the boys wished he would talk normal to them when he said quit illin' you two. However, the trio made him feel young and alive. They never left their hometown flair behind, but they can live it up anyway. When the scheming nephew try to do away his uncle, the team of them and Albert foil the scheme. I don't think this was box office material, but it's great for home use.

Anthony Geary should have definitely took home the best Supporting Actor trophy. He did not even get nominated??? He gives a performance of a lifetime. This is Ralph Bellamy's second role as a millionaire in an 80's film. He earlier appeared in the much inferior Trading Places. That film doesn't even hold a candle to this one.The Fat Boys play orderlies who are put in charge of an elderly millionaire (Bellamy). His nephew (Geary) hires them in the hope that their incompetence kills his uncle and he can inherit the money. What an original storyline!!

Told to come up with the cash and fast if he doesn't want to end up at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea Winslow's only chance to pay Montana off is to get his rich but very ill Uncle Albert to see his maker as soon as possible if not sooner.With the orderlies looking after Uncle Albert doing an excellent job in keeping him alive and kicking Winslow fires them and hirers in their place Brooklyn nursing home orderlies Markie Buffy and Cool. Winslow knows that they, in how incompetent they are on the job, will eventually do in Uncle Albert and make it possible for him to inherit his millions. Money that Winslow desperately needs, if he wan't to continue living, to pay off mobster Luis Montana.Going from the slums of East New York Brooklyn to the wealthy social register town of West Palm Beach had the Fat Boys for once do their job in actually getting the almost comatose Uncle Albert on his feet and out of his bed and wheel chair. This all was done by the Fat Boys' unorthodox way of doing things which was to lose all of Uncle Albert's medication, by using the pills as chips to play cards with, and have the old guy just let his hair down and go boogie woogie at the local roller disco.Winslow now determined to take out Uncle Albert himself since, to his bitter surprise, the bumbling orderlies the three Fat Boys who were to unknowingly do him in actually not only got Uncle Albert out of his sickbed but now have him playing polo and skin diving at the age of 82 no less! It's then when Winslow & Montana plan to blow up Uncle Albert's estate, with him in it, with it looking like a robbery/murder and trying to pin it on the totally innocent Fat Boys! The very people who have not only cured Uncle Albert but protected him from his nephew who's out to put him away for good.Putting the leather to the gas peddle the Fat Boys are at their best here in The Disorderlies not only in their slap stick comedy but rap songs, there are ten of them in the movie, that includes hits like Baby your a Rich Man and Disorerly Conduct. As you would expect in seeing how the Fat Boys stymied Winslow & Co. all throughout the movie this last desperate attempt by Winslow to do in Uncle Albert eventually falls flat on its face. ***SPOILER*** Winslow not only ends up behind bars but with a severe case of hemorrhoids, due to a gunshot wound, in him foolishly trying to make himself a victim, in throwing off the police, and hero at the same time. P.S The Fat Boys, originally known as the Dsco 3, career came to a sudden end by the time the rap-music 1980's scene ended. Breaking up and going their separate ways the Fat Boys, in trying to get back together, planned a reunion album in 1995 but that was tragically abandoned when Buffy, Darren Robisnson, suddenly passed away. Weighing an enormous 450 pounds Buffy's obesity eventually did him in the end. Buffy was doing what he loved rapping with his friends, at his home in Queens New York, when he went into cardiac arrest and died of a massive heart attack at the young age of 28.

Not surprisingly, it's the scenes where they are eating or rapping that they seem most at home. It's not that the movie is the embarrassing mess that Pepper's is, but there isn't anything that stands out. Then, there are annoying fat jokes and the most tired cliché of the genre, a white man spouting slang. Needless to say, he doesn't do it well. Perfect example, The Fat Boys ride horses for the first time. What happens? Two fall off and the third only has to look at his horse before it has a heart attack. That's whack.

I was pleased to hear that Prince Markie Dee and Kool Rock were finally getting back together for a Fat Boys reunion album. Buffy, the largest of the group, died back in 1995 but it is nice for them to carry on the legacy of the group. There was Buffy recorded vocals for a comeback album that was planned during the nineties that never came about - so they those for the upcoming album.ANYWAY I thought of Disorderlies - which I pulled off my friend's DVD shelf to watch. The Fat Boys stole the show in Krush Groove and their lighthearted humor would play out well for a starring feature. They landed Krush Groove director Michael Schultz who had, at that time, directed some classics like Car Wash and Cooley High (not to forget The Last Dragon) and Ralph Bellamy - who is usually known as 'one of the old dudes from Trading Places'.The film was actually a very modest hit - making just a little more than 10 million dollars at the box office. Run-D.M.C.'s film, which came out just a year later, would only gross 3.5 million!!! Off the top of my head I went and looked up what Belly made in theaters - the film that starred Nas, DMX, and Method Man. Over 10 years later that film made just LESS than 10 million dollars. DMX you got PWNED by The Fat Boys Around 1987 was where Schoolly D, Public Enemy, and Ice-T were bringing their early gangster rap that would soon be solidified by N.W.A. The Fat Boys would see Disorderlies as one of their higher points as a group. They made a few more albums, the last one without Markie as he broke out to do a successfully early 90s solo career. And that would be it for the boys - at least moviewise. Sure this film isn't winning any awards but over twenty years later it is still FUN! Of course others have compared this the humor to The Three Stooges and perhaps owing a bit to The Marx Brothers as well. It's a welcomed comparison but the slapstick plays well with the Fat Boys.So I was happy to rewatch the movie and enjoy the hell out of it. If you've never seen the movie or never even heard of the Fat Boys - it is really a treat to watch for the first time. The trio were amazing rappers and...while not great actors...made the most of a fun film. It almost makes you forgive Michael Schultz for directing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. ... Almost.

You have some over weight young black orderlies who can not only laugh at themselves, but make you laugh with every line, every nuance and subtle gesture they conjure up in this movie. Ralph Bellamy plays the consummate straight guy and doesn't miss a beat, esp. at his age. My 15 year old son watched it once and we split our sides laughing. My son is 30 now and he asked me if I wanted to watch that movie with him again. Yeah I said. We could use more laughs. We could use more young actor/comedians, especially ones from our own minority groups here in the good ol' USA. This is a funny movie and its probably more hilarious the second time around.
