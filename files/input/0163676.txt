The movie is about Adrien, a strange girl who gets a job at a posh country club, when she meets Brittany, a pretty, rich, popular girl who is the leader of 'The In Crowd.' Brittany invites Adrien to hang out with her and her friends and everything is going well at first until things go bad and Brittany turns nasty. I thought most of the cast played there parts well and even though as the movie went on you tend to know what is going to happen, the movie is still enjoyable to watch. This is definitely recommended for people who enjoy teen thrillers as this is a really good one.

Like all films that foster extreme comments and establish preconceived expectations, this one failed to live up (or should I say down) to them.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as its critics say it was.The story was actually good, in a puerile way.  What I liked about it was that it accurately portrayed the immature backbiting and excessive preoccupation with superficialities that are common among teens.  In certain ways, the story was predictable.  It was easy to foresee that Adrien (Lori Heuring) was kidding herself if she thought there was no ulterior motive behind Brittany's (Susan Ward) open acceptance of an outsider into the group.  What was cleverly presented and not so obvious was Brittany's motive.The production was TV quality.  Director, Mary Lambert has mostly TV credits on her resume and didn't push the envelope.  The acting was mediocre at best.  Both Lori Heuring and Susan Ward were passable but unpolished and they lacked subtlety.  The rest of the cast was far worse.This film will probably find a niche with teens and twenty-something young adults, but I don't think it is camp enough to attain cult status.  I rated it a 5/10.  It's not terrible, but it really doesn't distinguish itself in any meaningful way.

Actually, it was more than tolerable, it was actually fairly good, not the acting, by any stretch of the imagination, but it served its purpose. In my opinion, it's a great movie to watch on a slow/rainy weekend evening. I went into this film with little to no expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised. I was sure by the reviews that it would be terrible, instead I found myself thoroughly satisfied. While TIC is no Cruel Intentions, it's of the same genre. Spoiled rich kids, doing bad things to each other and sucking in the lowly outsider in the process.In Crowd has the same atmosphere and draw as any soap opera today, but the cheesy drama of soaps seems to translate well to a certain niche, but it DOES have a niche. Expect nothing more than a two hour version of All My Children and you won't end this film angry. I say give it a chance. If anything it'll end up on your guilty pleasures list.

What do you expect for a rated PG-13 movie?  It's not going to be super scary.  There isn't going to be a lot of killings, but there seems to be enough in this movie.  This movie likes to play with your mind.  Brittany Foster (Susan Ward) is a character who I think makes this movie better.  Without Susan Ward's portrayal of Brittany this movie would not be worth watching.  Lori Huering does an okay job as Adrien, but it isn't the strongest acting.

After being locked up in any institution would change the person. Some go back to their old ways, some don't. In The In Crowd, it goes to show that cliques aren't worth your while. A woman named Adrien(Lori Heuring), gets out from the psych ward, and into a country club where she can work. In the club, she meets a clique run by Brittany(Susan Ward). Her co-worker warns her about her. Naivity would settle in, then Adrien does catches on about her. Tough as nails, she handled the snake joke very well. Others would have a coronary. The lip gloss Brittany wears is the only thing that makes her look good, everything else brought out the ugly truth. When Adrien was set up for the murder of Dr. Henry Thompson(Daniel Hugh Kelly), one of the in crowds makes a trap for Brittany. It takes one person to stand out in front of the crowd, and think for one self. The rest would look at Brittany in total disgust. They'll be finding themselves a new leader. The point is, crowds can be dangerous. That's why I believe in individuality. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

It opens in an institution where teen Lori Heuring is released into society. Her doctor sets her up in a job at a golf resort where she meets Susan Ward, the popular girl. As predicted a rivalry begins but every is borrowed from other films. It never addresses issues regarding rehabilitation but instead settles for tired thriller clichés that are less than thrilling. Mary Lambert directs with skill but she deserves material with conviction instead of formula elements. Heuring and Ward play roles of little development or care. They will start out as friends before one attempts to screw over the other. The payoff is supposedly a violent showdown of idiotic proportions. Matthew Settle plays the guy whom both girls are interested for whatever reason. He plays the typical slasher film boyfriend baring no personality. Tess Harper also makes an appearance but who really cares. These characters are lined up for no other reason than to get killed with us apparently suppose to be entertained. The rehabilitation theme is bypassed for peep show nudity and violence in its most glorifying. Perhaps the new in-crowd will consist of people who have seen this tragic exercise and need rehabilitation.

I had long forgotten about this film until I caught it on HBO a few weeks ago, After watching this film for the first time in 11 years I never knew how lifeless the actors and actresses were and how predictable the plot is. The story was interesting it was about a girl named Adrien who was just released from a mental hospital to work as a housekeeper at a country club/resort type place, where young, beautiful college kids lay around in the sun, play tennis, etc. She meets Brittany Hodges or actually more like saves her, when Brittany tries to fake like she drowned. So Adrien and Brittany become friends, and some strange things happen at the club. One of Brittany's so-called friends warns Adrien to go away, and to leave the huge mystery that happened a year ago alone, but Adrien knows something's up. Brittany's games are a little too much to handle sometimes. And after learning about Adrien's history she seduces Adrien's therapist while wearing Adrien's dress, then kills the therapist at a party later, and then Adrien goes to jail because they think she was the one who had sex with him, and killed him. It could have been a much better movie had the script really been tweaked, but tweaked it was not so good this is not.

But, and it's a big but, it is a curious glimpse of how mind-bogglingly oblivious some people can be to how lucky they are, of how treacherous young women can be when it comes to their territory, of how stupid young men can be, of how a social group can be seen as responsible for the abuses of one individual within that group, especially when that group is the one in power.But, and this is another big but, there are far more satisfying explorations of such topics, that offer something beyond prurience.Too bad, because I have been hopeful of Mary Lambert ever since Pet Sematary which, though not a highwater mark in any genre, did explore in a gratifying way how deep people's needs and wants can run, and how that can sometimes manifest in absolute and utter resentment within and between the sexes.It also had a neat sense of humor underlying it all, which does not always balance well in a horror flick.Come on, Mary, where's the good stuff?

It's pretty simple and straight-forward, but it's there, so don't believe the people who say that there's no plot.

I don't know what those ratings have to do with reviewing, so I'm not getting into that.Many reviewers compared 'The in Crowd' to 'Wild Things'.

Furthermore, due to its more playful nature, In Crowd is a far sexier, and more fun, PG-13 alternative to its more explicit R- and unrated counterparts.In Crowd contains a plot that one would expect from mixing ingredients such as the stranger-with-a-dark-past, a mental institution, a missing sister, class conflict at a country club, and sex, lies, and murder.  Who is good and who is bad is easily discerned early on, and the few weakly scattered red herrings do nothing to distract from it.  The real value of this film is found in individual scenes within which the actresses sketch likeable performances and hint at what they could do in better films. (SPOILER BEGINS HERE.)  Ward's character is an obsessive character a la Glenn Close's Alex in Fatal Attraction, but Ward exudes a cheerfully amoral malice from her character as opposed to Close's larger-than-life portrayal.  Ward is so likeable in the role that it is believable that her character could get away with a lot of what she does.  Heuring also defies convention by not playing her character as a frail, put-upon former mental patient, but rather adding a layer of toughness.  (SPOILER ENDS HERE.) Both Ward and Heuring offer vivid characterizations that play off each other well.  Another standout is Nathan Bexton, who portrays a character who is perpetually drinking.  He draws notice and a few laughs, however, not from the usual slurred speech or stumbling about, but from a nervous, goofy energy that emanates from his facial expressions.  The only overacting comes courtesy of Taylor Negron's, welcome, unfortunately very brief, throwaway cameo as an effete, thickly Bayou-accented hairdresser -- a character in the mold of Bill Murray's lawyer from Wild Things (though not nearly as integral to the plot).The other reason for recommending In Crowd is the film's ebullient eroticism.  Wild Things fumbled this point by being self-conscious.  Its notorious three-way sex scene involving Neve Campbell, Matt Dillon, and Denise Richards, for all its fondling and bared flesh and characters who are supposedly consumed with lust, was quite uninvolving because it seemed studied and the actors moved tentatively and uncomfortably.  This was underscored by Dillon's character actually doling out instructions to the other characters.  On the other hand, the PG-13 In Crowd contains a fully-clothed three-way bump-and-grind at a dance club, which is sexier for its more teasing quality and the expressiveness of the actors in portraying characters enjoying their sexuality.  In Crowd contains other scenes of same- and opposite-sex sensuality which similarly succeed because the actors are engaging and the staging is suggestive rather than explicit.The best way to view In Crowd is on DVD, since it contains a running commentary track featuring Ward and Heuring, whose chemistry is even better showcased here.  Because the film itself is fluff, there is no illuminating insight.  Unlike the sometimes dry, technical commentary found on DVDs of far superior films, however, Ward and Heuring's enthusiastic banter throughout offers an unscripted, more intimate viewing experience and suggests that they really enjoyed making the film together.

Although this movie didn't figure on most people's 'must see' movie list, I have to admit it was right up there with the big ones for me.The reason I was so intent on seeing this psychological thriller, was the fact that I used to watch that cancelled soap opera 'Sunset Beach', and found myself being a huge fan of Susan Ward, who mercilessly steals the show over here. I mean, hate this movie if you want, but when it's over one thing will stick to your mind Susan Ward. Even if this movie didn't do good, I'm sure most of us would love to see Susan in anything again!The plotline of this teen targeted thriller is quite predictable Mental girl befriends rich bitch, turns out rich bitch is the crazy one! I know, I know it sounds campy. But believe me when a chase scene ensues where the villain wields hedge clippers, you know you just gotta love it!!The movie has an age restriction of 13, but I think if they targeted it for 17year olds, it would have been more successful. The movie isn't terribly violent, but it shows that you don't have to go to extremes to make your movie scary.The movie is funny (I loved the part where the guy says 'Welcome to the lives of the rich and tasteless' - it sums everything up), scary (the climax is right up there with any good thriller), sexy (the dance club scenes are hot!) and the cast of newcomers are all talented enough. Lori Heuring plays the good girl, she's pretty and cute, but she doesn't make nearly as big an impact as Susan. Mainly because the villains are always the most interesting to watch. The supporting cast, including Nathan Bexton (Go), Katharine Towne (What Lies Beneath), Ethan Erickson (Jawbreaker), Matthew Settle (U-571), Laurie Fortier (To Gillian on her 37th Birthday), Erinn Bartlett (Deep Blue Sea), Kim Murphy (Houseguest) etc. all show great promise, and the veterans Daniel Hugh Kelly and Tess Harper are reliable.So, all in all, it's a great suspense thriller. If you ignored it while it was in the cinemas, don't forget to watch it when it comes out on video! Even if it's only to glimpse a gorgeous star in the making Susan Ward.

But it's a lot of fun to watch.  Most camp movies only stick around for 90 minutes or so...this one clocks in at almost 2 hours and while you may hate yourself the next day for shelling out the money for it...this movie still is strangely amusing when watching it.  It's a dirty-old man movie, though, with lots of girl-on-girl action.  If you can get past the pervy quality of it and enjoy the final catfight (and if you don't chuckle at all...there's something wrong) you will enjoy it.  Give it a try...I'm sure it will be on video soon and that's where it will do better.

This movie was so wretched I couldn't even believe I spent $7.00 to see it.  The acting in this movie is pure crap.  I've seen episodes of Kids Incorporated that have better acting and a more interesting plotline.  This movie stole ideas from Scream, Girl Interrupted, and countless episodes of 90210.  The movie tries so hard to have some sort of meaning with lines like My mom died while she was giving birth to me. This ring is like a way of keeping her close to me always. Please.  This movie is so dull I can't say enough bad things about.  Okay, so Maybe the some of the people in this movie are attractive, but they couldn't act if their lives depended on it.

I am always up for a good psychological thriller but there wasn't much here with this one. The story was very predictable and while I did not expect it to break any new ground at least it could have been somewhat interesting. Alas that was not to be. This movie bordered on dull. Actually scratch the bordered, it WAS dull. And rather annoying.There wasn't one surprise throughout the whole thing and many of the characters were very one dimensional. The length of the movie didn't help. It's not that it is unreasonably long, but it FEELS like it is. One feels every second of this movie and when your waiting for a movie to end that is definitely not a good thing.Plus there are oodles of other movies similar to this one and many of those just do the whole storyline better. The In Crowd lacked that compelling component that can sometimes make a psychological thriller, even a not so good one, really really fun to watch. But it was kind of lackluster and it also didn't help that there was very little done in other areas as well such as cinematography and music.Speaking of the music, it was very very annoying. It didn't fit with the movie at all. And the movie itself just crept along and almost every scene could easily have been predicted. Plus there's very little of the campy factor so it doesn't even venture into the so bad it's good area.As far as positives go I will say this is not unwatchable and watching it is not an unbearable experience. but it is rather bland and is easily lost among a sea of other similar such movies. I wouldn't call this the worst of the worst but it sounded to be much more fun then it wound up being and is definitely below average.

In attempting to do whatever she wanted to do, (because it didn't see like she wanted to live, in fact every dumb possible thing she could've done was done, even after genius plans to escape a facility), she failed miserably. Then more stuff happens, which I wont reveal in order to not spoil the magical suspense of fine storytelling. I didn't see the beginning of this movie, I don't know if she's supposed to be mentally retarded or something. If they didn't show the kid at the end of Forrest Gump I would've thought this was his daughter and they included her in some cheap thriller for a sequel. The hot girl was the antagonist, who just needed to act evil and pretty, which she did, and do tons of sex scenes, which she didn't. I just found out on this site that it was PG-13, I wish I had known that in advance. The acting is horrible, but you can mute it and just look at her for a couple of minutes.

This is one of the worst movies of the year, with little to no plot, corny, campy situations, disgraceful performances, insipid direction, and a screenplay that is not even capable of wandering off in various directions, which would have been much more interesting than focusing on these boring characters.What little story present deals with a young woman named Adrien Williams (Lori Heuring) who was just released from a psychiatric hospital she had sexual obsessions. Her doctor (Daniel High Kelly) has arranged for her to get a summer job at a wealthy seaside club where young adults party amongst theirselves. There she meets a semi-lesbian named Brittany Foster (Susan Ward), who runs a private clique of locals, The In Crowd. The two become friends, share secrets, erotically attempt to seduce the other, all while other club members, including Bobby (Nathan Bexton), Kelly (Laurie Fortier), Tom (Ethan Erickson) and Morgan (Katharine Towne), become confused about Adrien. Soon bad things happen and Adrien is not so sure about the identity of Brittany.The dialogue provides an excuse to continue the movie forward, but goes nowhere with a pointless and meaningless theme of action. There is simply no plot here, and the scenes do not provide the necessary tension, suspense, conflict, or character development required for anything to be of any interest. What are the characters trying to achieve? Most individuals in the film just drift around the lush landscape drinking, showing off their shapely bodies, and playing tricks on the new girl there is no purpose or motive to propel the screenplay. The film's final half hour is revealing, involving, and inquisitive, but still ranks as a pale shadow to similar, better productions like the sexy and twisted Wild Things.The In Crowd contains a showcase of lazy, deprived performances from a variety of unknown novice actors. I am a part-time Broadway actor myself and have seen seven-year-olds portraying Shakespeare who had most of a clue of what they were doing than these bland performers. Lori Heuring, Matthew Settle, and Nathan Bexton act like they are in a cheesy soap opera. They lack energy, style, and depth, but contain attractive allure and seductive gestures.  Does director Mary Lambert (Pet Cemetery) think good movies are made from good looks?The movie also fails technically. Although there are times when the various camera angles and intense cinematography impressed me, the cuts are often too meteoric and fragmented. Its style is lush, but cannot overcome the lack of any good qualities.The In Crowd earned a discrepancy-laden PG-13 by the MPAA, but deserves an R-rating. The film is for adults with its almost constant sexual content, nudity, homosexual undertones, often lethal violence, and the whole subject of sexual obsession and alcohol abuse. If this movie goes as far as it does erotically, why didn't it push the envelope or emphasize shock value, like Wild Things, instead of holding back. I guess boldness was not what these filmmakers were looking for, but instead constructing eye candy that tastes like moldy bread.

Yes, it's a highly commercial venture but its creators and participants just can't resist doing something compelling - and fascinating - with their work. For me, the all-time classic in this category would be Herk Harvey's Carnival Of Souls (1962). Expectations are set at zero but, scene by scene, something is developing that you just don't want to let go of. I find that low budget films in general have an astonishing tendency to find their own unique character! The basic premise is well-thought out and very well conceived - you immediately sense the vulnerability of Lori Heuring's very well-played character as the have-not among the disturbingly menacing haves. And, as a result, you feel her personal strength as well. Thus the major conflict is set -- and the crisis and resolution turn out to be pretty gripping after all. Susan Ward is truly mesmerizing in her meticulously developed, wonderfully shaded role. The movie would be worth seeing for that alone but it's actually a very good, spine-tingling psychological horror/thriller and it's entertaining throughout.

It's more like a two-part episode of  Aaron Spelling's former show Titans. Anyway, Susan Ward (who played goody-two-shoes Meg on Spelling's Sunset Beach) plays the evil Brittney and does a pretty good job. The character is meant to be played over-the-top, and Ward looks like she's reveling in the role, playing bad for once. Daniel Hugh Kelly and Tess Harper look embarrassed in their small roles (what possessed them to sign up for this film? Lack of decent offers?) but the actress who played the good girl (her name escapes me) was decent in her role.One question they obviously had to tone down several things in this film to make it PG-13. Why didn't they just run with it and make it an R? Doesn't make sense.If you're going to rent this, rent The Crush also and watch them back to back. This film is so bad it's fun!

I mean when something hits it big they sure copycat it to death. The In Crowd is the obligatory teen thriller done with some twist and lots of sex appeal. Girl with past get a job around cool people. She starts hanging with the cool people and becomes one of them. One member gets jealous then others. And finally bodies started piling up and we're trying to figure out was it the girl with a past, the rich sob of a leader or the weird friend of the girl with a past. It's all been done before. Jawbreaker took a dark comedy turn with the subject. The Skulls was the guys version of it. The Rage Carrie 2 took it on in the horror genre. But I think the film that this resembles the most is Wild Things. There are many unexpected twist, some which catch you off guard and some that are predictable. If Wild Things was PG-13 it would have been The In Crowd. There are lesbian undertones, nudity, girl fights, and lots of drinking. This film was made for one reason and one reason alone, the eye candy. Girls in next to nothing, some time not ever that and guys walking around with their shirts off. I give the ladies of this film a 10. But overall the film is a 7. If your under 21 you will like this film. If your over that you'll either love it or hate it. The In Crowd, a not too predictable teen thriller with loads of eye candy.
