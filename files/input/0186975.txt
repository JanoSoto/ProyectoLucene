However, after seeing the marquee poster - a knockoff of The Very Thought of You - I scaled down my expectations and braced for a painful two hours. My prediction was partially correct.Unlike the typical teen oriented romantic comedy there was an attempt to infuse this movie with a bit of reality. Unfortunately, the writers apparently could not decide if they wanted to make a romantic comedy or a serious relationship movie. The result is a confused mess a ludicrous subplot about a student's burgeoning career as a pornographer gets far more screen time than does the terrified couple trying to come to grips with a potential pregnancy. The second problem is the chemistry between Stiles and Freddie Prinze Jr - there is none (I blame the casting director for this). Although both actors have screen presence, they don't click as a duo, consequently, their interactions- especially the fight scenes -do not ring true. Their job is made doubly difficult by having to utter stupid lines.This movie has been targeted to a certain market, and will probably do well.Too bad.

Pay no attention to them. It is rare for romantic comedies to be entirely original they are after all dealing with love, but Down to You does have it's moments differing it from most of the recently released teen comedies to which it has constantly been compared.Through narration by both protagonists the audience is able to see the development of both characters in the long-term and how they ultimately react to each other.  Freddie Prinze Jr and Julia Stiles were perfectly cast and behaved as mature young adults for the majority of the film sparing the audience from cliched teen talk.  They leave the zaniness to their co-stars, which was a good move.  The film is more of a love story then most recent teen flicks dealing mainly with physical attraction or opposites attract.One problem with Down to You however is it's not presented well enough to keep the audience interested.  Perhaps in the hands of a more capable director this would be achieved, as I got a bit bored with a few of the scenes and some jokes really fall flat.  Because of this, it's not as memorable as other teen flicks such as 10 Things or Scream, even.. as it's pacing is quite slow.  It's saving grace is the cast.  Henry Winkler gives a comic performance as Prinze's celebrity-chef father and Zak Orth plays Prinze's friend turned porn- star-friend with gutso.  Selma Blair gave a sultry performance but lacked development making her nothing more than the porn star girl.Compared to the other three major teen romance flicks of the year (Loser, Whatever it Takes, Boys and Girls) Down to You is indeed one of the finest. It just needed more oomph to make it more memorable.7/10  "},{"Title":"Not awful &#150; just unremarkable and mediocre","Date":"22 April 2003","Score":"13 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Al and Imogen have both finished college and now live separately despite seeing each other throughout their college years.  However it is clear that both have some degree of unresolved feelings for each other.  In to-camera interviews they discuss their relationship and trace it's path from the first time they met in Imogen's freshman year.It is a device that I have grown accustom to because I have seen it done well quite often, but the direct-to-camera style is clearly difficult to do.  First of all you need strong or likeable characters as the style is basically requiring some degree of interest of empathy from the first second.  Without this it is pretty weak.  This film stumbles at this point because even halfway through the film, I was still struggling to care less about the characters.  Past this problem the plot is not the strongest &#150; it has been done before regardless of superficial changes.  It has little genuine humour and mostly is just the cinematic version of puppy love.  When the problems come they are so poorly handled by the script that they fail to convince.Sadly the blame must be shared between script and actors for most of this.  The script fails to create characters that convince.  The dialogue rarely rings true and sounds like a weak teen drama at worst.  However this doesn't totally excuse the actors as they don't bring much to the roles.  Prinze Jr is so wishy-washy and lifeless that he is not someone I ever got behind as real.  He is too idealistic and, as a result, any scenes where he has to show hurt or anger, are unbelievable.  Stiles is OK but suffers from a poor script.  The support cast are basically monkeys who are simply comedy characters.  I know that sounds cruel but none have any effort put into them &#150; the porn star (no type of porn I've ever seen), the geek etc.  Henry Winkler gets the odd smile but is just a famous face to add colour.  Selma Blair is the least convincing porn actress I've ever seen but the Biggest waste to me was Rosario Dawson, not only gorgeous but a real talent given the chance, her character was so pointless that I wondered why they even bothered creating it.It's not an awful film &#150; it is simply mediocre and unremarkable to the point of monotony.  Every part of it feels like you've seen it better somewhere else.  The script is lazy &#150; things are poorly thought out and the characters are thin and poorly developed.  None of the cast really put their heart into it and the end result is a film that doesn't really do anything but still seems to take forever to finish!Although it will be remembered for things like Trainspotting and My Beautiful Laundrette, FilmFour folded partly because it produced things like this that were without spark, wit or invention.

Very uninteresting,the cast (mostly) is forgettable and frankly, we've seen this movie before......However, what sets Down apart is 3 wonderful performances, and 1 so bad it's gonna get special attention in this review...We'll start with the good....Julia Stiles is Imogen, a new freshman at an unnamed NYC college.  She is a stellar artist, and wishes to persue that in some manner.  Ms. Stiles delivers a performance above the drivel she has to work with, making Imogen a teen character with heart and feeling.  She once again (as in 10 Things) dances in this one..and I personally think she needs a dance scene in each movie.Henry Winkler plays Ray Connelly...host of a nationwide cooking show, and father of Al, the lead male in the story.  His character is well played and humorous, with grand visions for both himself and his son (he wants to do a cooking show take off of Cops with Al).  A great performance from Mr. Winkler, and he is quickly putting the ghost of Fonzie behind him.Now to the bad before I surprise you and give you the last good.....Selma Blair plays Cyrus, a major flirt and porn actress. I hate to have to say this, but after Cruel Intentions and now this, I am truly convinced that she is either someone's daughter or is involved in a relationship with someone.  This woman cannot act.  I truly believe with every fiber of my being that she could not play dead convincingly.  Hopefully her performance here will kill what little career she has.Now, for the last good review.......are you ready for this?? Freddie Prinze Jr. is Alfred..the film's lead male character.  He spots Imogen across a crowded room and the two instantly hit it off.  After forgetable turns in every movie he has done, he shows a never before seen maturity and makes Alfred a character that seems real and true.Down To You is more formulaic drivel aimed at the easily entertained teen audience.  While the story is something we've all seen before, the performances of its lead characters make this movie worth a watch, regardless of how bad it really is.1 out of 5 "},{"Title":"I paid 7 dollars to see this?","Date":"4 February 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  What was I thinking?

I'm sorry, I might just be a teenager but I know crap when it's crap and I know what I like, and this movie I did not. Where was the plot? Where was one spec of originality?

I don't care how good looking Freddie is, he needs to take some acting classes, either that strive to make his characters have a little bit more difference then the name change. I like Julia Stiles, but normally when you have to play off a bad actor it reflects badly on you.

The fact that this movie was even made, and even more that some big name actors were in it shocked me. I have to say, before seeing this movie, I was excited that there was a teen movie that wasn't about high school coming out. But unfortunately,  this movie has no plot. I've read some of the other user comments that said you would only be able to understand this movie if you were in college, and that the people who didn't like it must have been too young or too old. I could not disagree more. I am in college, and have had a relationship in college and this movie still didn't make sense. This is not about being able to relate, it's just the fact that this movie has no plot and is terribly confusing. For example, the wine scene. Maybe if the audience was let in on what was in each glass, we would be able to understand the importance, but unfortunately we aren't. And the car accident scene? What even happened there? The whole porno sub-plot? I could go on and on... Forget the excuses, this movie was just terrible. Don't waste your time.

Freddie Prinze Jnr just isn't an engaging person and I just didn't feel the chemistry between him and Julia Stiles and the peripheral characters weren't charming or interesting at all. Having said that there's this amazing scene where Julia Stiles dances in front of a room of people (.... cue 10 Things, The Prince And Me, Save The Last Dance ....) and it's really funny.

Freddie and Julia are cute to watch, but their coupling, was just not believable. Truth be told, I found the scenes of them kissing, almost painful to watch. It's meant to be a romance, and it looked as though he was kissing his sister. I am a fan of Julia Stiles, and I went into this movie, thinking it would be of the same caliber as 10 Things I Hate About You, but it didn't even come close. And it all boiled down to the one thing ... no chemistry.If you are a fan of Julie or Freddie, and just want to watch because it is a title with their name on it. Then ya, go ahead.

It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. who loves to cook and specializes in smoked salmon. His father hosts his own cooking show and hopes that his son will follow in his footsteps. Julia Stiles plays an artist who designs album covers. Concept isn't bad but the rest is predictable with a conventional ending. Directed by Kris Isacsson with fine location work. The screenplay thrusts Stiles and Prinze through standard romantic clichés and a lot of bull crap. She is a woman thrust into confusion. Prinze Jr. is given a lame sequence where he digests shampoo. Perhaps that was his reaction to the script. He and Stiles also have hokey scenes where they sit around and eat cake. Henry Winkler might have been interesting on his own but the screenplay calls him to be at odds with his son's decisions and then forgive. Shawn Hatosy plays one of their friends who shows up and makes a total ass out of himself at parties. Selma Blair was a scene stealer in Cruel Intentions but here she can merely stand back and watch this travesty fall without romance or laughs. Pointless romantic drivel out for a few undeserved tears and a few sighs but never showing any originality or depth. Perhaps viewers may need the shampoo next.

He's personable, he knew HOW to be cute, and I'm sure that to many women he seemed very datable...which is perfect for what is, essentially, a date movie. Julia Stiles was okay here, although -- and I know this is shallow -- her teeth bothered me when she smiled broadly.As to the bad, most of the actors who played supporting roles, with one exception. The exceptions first -- nice to see Henry Winkler here as the father (my good, has it been that long since Fonzie?). But the rest of the supporting actors and their performances here...well, just flush.As to the ugly, the characters that supported the main story line. Not a one to like. Deadbeats. And a movie with a lot of deadbeats doesn't go very far.The story itself is pretty standard -- boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boys wins girl back. The twist here is that the boy is the good one, the girl gets bitchy.The movie was cute enough to hold my attention...even though I'm 65...but I can hardly give it more than a substandard 6. Me thinks the director just just wasn't ready for prime time (and apparently still isn't, based on his credits).

I think some of the fantasy sequences were cute, like Imogen's baby nightmare and the little Man Show clip, which was actually pretty funny.--It was surprised to see that Down to You doesn't COMPLETELY follow the teen romcom formula. It was good to see for once that the guy isn't the wrong doer in the relationship that causes the split. Imogen is the one who makes a mistake and quite a shocking mistake at that. I was also surprised, and quite happy, to see that the characters didn't run to each other at the airport at the end of the film and have a kiss that ended the movie. They actually spend some time apart, quite a lengthy part too. It worked nicely, though otherwise Down to You is formulaic.THE BAD--I felt nothing for the characters, and was not happy to see that the actors didn't really do much to change these uninteresting and unsympathetic people. Freddie Prinze Jr is annoying as the wimpy Al. Julia Stiles (who I loved in the great 10 Things I Hate About You) is surprisingly over-the-top for the most part, though she does have her moments. I just didn't really like her character all that much and it p***ed me off how Al forgave her so easily for all her mistakes. Also, Julia, you have some major talent and are a hottie! What the hell are you doing in Freddie Prinze Jr movies? Become a serious actress damnt! Selma Blair does the best she can with her character who is never paid off but ultimately tries a bit too hard to be sexy. Shawn Hatosy would have to the film's most annoying actor and character; his lame character was both pointless and majorly unfunny. I just kept wondering what the hell the talented Henry Winkler was doing here - he's majorly embarrassing his comedic career. And Ashton Kutcher? You have great comedic talent, but stop picking crap movies! What the hell are you doing in this movie, dude? Your part sucks major ass!--I was so angry to see that Down to You actually had some potential, sometimes it even looked like it was gonna take a different road and be original and daring. Unfortunately it rarely takes these roads and goes off being another dumb romantic comedy. Who else would've enjoyed seeing the unique aspect of a teenage relationship being cursed by a baby? Or perhaps the hardness of being apart while your partner is away in France? I can't believe how quickly and effortlessly the previous two things I mentioned were resolved, it was obvious the writer just wanted to get to the kiss-and-make-up ending. This movie suffers from an extremely obvious case of lazy writing; it passes up good opportunities for drama in exchange for being predictable and formulaic.--It was aggravating to say the least to see how many clichés were used in the film. This is especially noticeable in those high school date flashback scenes. The nerdy scientist, the hypo/stoner guy and there are many more that I can't really recall because this movie just wasn't at all memorable. But I do certainly remember that there were so many completely unfunny character clichés that seriously drag the film down.RATING4/10 - I'll go as far as saying this movie actually had potential in parts, but it throws it away and becomes another disposable teenage romantic comedy.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND10 Things I Hate About You (8/10) Cruel Intentions (8/10) Drive Me Crazy (3/10) Just Married (5/10) O (9/10) "},{"Title":"Charming, a must-see for the romantically involved","Date":"28 October 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  WARNING May contain spoilers...I guess I should say right off the bat that teen films are not my bag.  I don't know why, its just that overly-sappy stories with 20-somethings playing teenagers has never been my thing. However, I do make exceptions (I'm a Breakfast Club and She's All That fan).  This film is kind of a departure from teen love/teen comedy, because it focuses on a more adult topic that's right, it deals with college kids.I only saw a few scenes towards the end first time I saw this, and then the next time it was on TV, I only saw the same scenes.  I knew I needed to see this film, but it became rare on the pay-per-view channels I saw the ending on, so I went out and paid $29.99 for the DVD.  It's ok--it was worth the price.  I was almost single at the time as well (my 1st boyfriend and I were on the outs), and was just turning 18 when I bought this movie.  It actually helped me through the break-up--I knew things could be worse.In this spirited 2000 retelling of Annie Hall, (which I've never seen), a young man and woman find out about love and relationships during their college years.  Sophomore Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze Jr.), is a satisfied college sophomore who is studying liberal arts, but wants to be a chef. Freshman Imogen (Julia Stiles) worships artistry, but according to her mother, art should only be done on the weekends.  The two meet in a bar one night (AL I thought it was a cool place, but that's because they never checked IDs).  Al falls for Imogen immediately, sort of like infatuation. The two begin a whirlwind courtship that includes a conversation over cake, psychoanalysis (I'll explain this one better, because its one of my favorite scenes), sleeping together, and just enjoying each other's company.  But, the two become distant, and suddenly Al is floored when Imogen dumps him. He suddenly realizes that he needs her to live, and will do anything to get over her, even if it means going to extreme measures.While genuinely a sentimental flick, this is light-hearted and smart. The viewer comes away a little more knowledgable about the opposite sex after seeing this flick.  You can see the chemistry between Al and Imogen, and Prinze and Stiles capture the romantic scenes perfectly.  The story is told from both of their points of view, which is good, because the story would not work one-sided.  Every now and then, the movie would flash forward to either Prinze of Stiles in present day talking about each other, giving their take on everything, as well as a great voice-over track from both during the film.  Anyone who has ever experienced love lost could relate to Al, but I don't know (nor have I heard of) anyone who has ever tried to forget their lost love the way Al did (that was an interesting part).  The reason this film works is the chemistry. Although I am completely over the moon for Prinze, he is not the only reason I enjoyed this film.  It's funny but doesn't try to be silly.  It's sentimental, but not too sappy.  It's smart, but doesn't over kill us with too much intelligence.  It's never stupid, and certainly never dull.  This film works, simply put.My favorite scenes in this film are when Al goes to Imogen's dorm room with cake (Something sacred, he says).  The two have a conversation over the cake, which leads to psychoanalysis, (You know, we're prime for psychoanalysis, Imogen comments).  Al lays on her bed and Imogen asks him questions about his vices (sleeping, beer, wine), he asks about hers (smoking, chocolate, a few others), his past relationships (Faith Keenan--Clepto, Megan Brodski--Cheerleader, Haley Heller-- Scientist), her past relationships (Gabe Stiano--New Age, Ted McGurran--Allergic, and Ricky James--hated by the dog), what they love (him--fish), her (art).  They also disclosed their first kisses (shown in humorous flashbacks--his was a woman who dropped a ring when he was 12, hers was her gym partner when she was 11 1/2, who knocked her down with a baksetball).  In addition, I liked the opening scene in the coffee shop where Al is observing two young lovers while talking to the camera (Reminds me of my relationship, except Imogen never wore that much jewelry, and I wouldn't be caught dead in those shoes.), the flashback scenes, the narration, the scene where Al attempts to get over Imogen by drinking shampoo (this actually was the one scene I heard alot about before seeing this movie), and the concluding scene (which I will not give away--its too good).This movie is a must rent/buy for anyone who likes romantic comedies, Freddie Prinze Jr., or Julia Stiles.  I'm disappointed that alot of people didn't like this film, nor did it get the box office success it deserved. This film is targeted at teenage and young adults girls, and probably wouldn't interest the general public under the age of 13 or over the age of 25-30.  This was a good-intentions film, and a must see for those who are romantically involved, or for a girl's movie night.  I've actually owned the DVD for 2 years (2 years as of today, I believe--it was sometime in late October), and the film holds up well with time.  Definitely see this film, there's something for everyone!

This story is thoughtful and engaging as our two stars struggle with the qualms and traumas of contemporary college life.  Their lives see changes as they come to terms with the temptations and viscissitudes of college life; as their lives change, so does their perception of their relationships with each other.  Inasmuch as they perceive a distance growing between them, their lives and dependency upon each other only grows as adolescence becomes adulthood.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is a strong presence as he finally transcends the generations in this post-high school tale.  Julia Stiles is an uncommon beauty whose poise and screen presence is refreshingly welcome.  I recommend Down To You.

She was fabulous and beautiful beyond words. Her best performance ever I think. Fonz Henry Winkler is absolutely terrific in his role as Al's dad. And real, very real to life he is. Freddie Prinze would be so extremely proud of his son Freddie. The kid just takes us in as one of the greatest young people a dad or mom would ever desire to have. Further, this is a great and refreshing motion picture. I want to take a girlfriend out to dinner and then to this movie. I cried from time to time. But I laughed and cried. Then felt sublimely happy way down deep inside for the way these maturing characters who guided me after a long day's work took me back and forth in Times when I was there too. Times familiar to me as father and as a former high school teacher, and I'm 55. Finally for now, there's the real and rising starlet Julia Styles who is completely reminiscent of the Great Ones from the Golden Age of films. Styles is so beautiful and naturally-natural, that I could not stop thinking how much I would appreciate knowing her personally as a fellow citizen in my community. She is a role model for young folks right out of a mold that only she alone could step back into Time after time. I also wish to compliment the splendid performance of the Rennaisance character who at the moment is unclear to me namewise since the information I've seen here is evasive for the moment. I review and comment on popular films for Le Forum bimonthly publication here at the University of Maine, Orono.

Mmmh, not really. I know a lot of guys squirm at the sound of romantic comedy (Me man! Me need big explosion!!!) but hopefully others don't mind them and Down To You is a pretty good film if you're looking for something sweet and somewhat cheesy. What's more, the film is told mainly through the guy's perspective, a minority in these types of teen movies. Usually, when the main characters are male, the movie will be mainly about having sex and filled with sex jokes, rather than portraying young guys with feelings (oh my god! Guys have feelings too! Just like girls!). Other such movies include the excellent 10 Things I Hate About You (also with Julia Stiles, oddly enough) and The Girl Next Door. So yes, I'd recommend Down To You. It isn't an amazing film by any means and shouldn't be on any Top 10 or even Top 100 best movie list but it's a nice enough little film.

No, She's All That it ain't...but it also doesn't follow the all-too-predictable flow of meeting the leads, meeting the conflict, anticipating the climax, whilst remaining comforted throughout by the inevitable perfect kiss at the end...naturally, accompanied by some current pop-laden tune.Down to You makes you smile...and that's what it's meant to do. Stiles and Prinze, Jr. both hold their own...and the chemistry isn't bubblegum-sweet, for once. They seem like companions, not destined archetypes. Perhaps that is what refreshes the most you get the escapism of an alternate reality, complete with absurd comics and extreme highs and lows...without having to check your brain at the opening credits. Nothing is predictable, even the ending...yes, the unlikely happens...the lovers do reunite, but it isn't a day later, after some basic words from good friends. Even the good friends are tested and played more realistically in this film.Essentially, there's heavy sarcasm to keep you laughing, absurdity to keep you awake, and just enough love and chemistry to make it all endearing...and you definitely won't walk away humming something from Britney Spears' earlier albums.

Not long after Imogen (Stiles) and Al (Prinze) shack up, the anxieties of living together take a toll on the 'tingles' of the true love that they felt when they first met. Their relationship runs aground when Imogen fears that she is pregnant. Later, they split up when Imogen has a one-night stand with another student that resembles late legendary musician Jim Morrison. A few years pass, and Imogen and Al rekindle the old flame or 'tingles' as they referred to them about their first love. The surprises are few and far between in this romance as the sparks.The major flaw in writer & director Kris Iascsson's directorial debut is that his characters lack vitality, and their story skirts conflict. Nothing unique happens in this breezy but thoroughly predictable boy-wins-girl, boy-loses-girl, and boy-wins-girl back plot. Essentially, Down To You qualifies as a lite, twentysomething's version of the Bruce Willis & Michelle Pfeiffer soaper The Story of Us without the sizzle. If comedy broadens character, drama sharpens it. The Story of Us dealt with the ups and downs of a relationship. Nothing that either Imogen or Al do in Down To You is calculated to make us feel either love or hate for them. Indeed, Prinze and Stiles are as cute but just as plastic as Barbie and Ken dolls. They go through the motions without ever showing any genuine emotions.You know a movie is in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than the protagonists. Henry Winkler of Fonz fame from Happy Days has a field day as Freddie's loony father, Chef Ray, and he steals every scene he has with his rambunctious wit. The best scene in Down To You concerns a father and son TV show that Chef Ray pitches to Al. Chef Ray wants to produce 'Cooks,' a gourmet parody of the gritty reality based Fox TV show Cops where Al and he invade homes with a platoon of cooks at random and conjure up meals from scratch for the surprised occupants.The second best scene occurs when Al dreams about being a guest on a macho male talk show segment where tough guys ridicule his sensitive man routine. This is the closest thing to genuine comedy that Iascsson comes up with here, especially when one of the guys warns Al to cross your legs because your panties are showing. Actually, Al lets Imogen wear the pants in their relationship. She steps out on Al, and he throws a tantrum when she tells himself about her infidelity. Things would have been hotter had Al caught Imogen in the sack with her lover, but then Down To You would have gotten pretty raunchy.Al and Imogen's friends provide some welcome relief with their comic antics. Al's pal Monk (Zak Orth of In & Out) a porno star & director and supplies the frat lectures to everybody about the necessity for hot, sweaty sex. Monk probably displays more character development than anybody else in Down To You. The next time that we see him, Monk has turned into an Orson Welles type auteur and is making Shakespeare movies. In a slight, throwaway role, Lucy Arnaz, the real-life daughter of Lucille Ball, plays Al's mother.Freshman writer & director Kris Iascsson does everything that he can to keep things light and effervescent without descending into harsh reality. He makes even more mistakes by telling Down To You in a series of flashbacks with both characters addressing the audience directly&#151;in other words, breaking the fourth wall&#151;as in either Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Annie Hall. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles appear to be stooping in Down To You after scoring respectively in winning comedies such as She's All That and 10 Things I Hate About You. Unless you've never seen a teenage romantic comedy, skip this weepie. Oh, yes, at least, the soundtrack is worth buying, even if the movie vanishes from your memory the next day.

The cinema was empty, there was just me and him, we obviously hogged the backseats, but I remember feeling quite concerned at the lack of people wanting to watch the film and was contemplating the waste of money for our tickets. Stew has never has and never will be a lovey-chicky film, but he went along for me. As the film started I was wondering how the story was going to pan out, but within 10 minutes I guessed that there would be trouble and love loss before finally getting to them being all happy and loved up at the end. It was the journey to that stage that I didn't know about, what was going to happen to these characters? Was Al going to get the girl? Was Imogen slightly stuck up? Overral I enjoyed the film and the romance was enough to keep me glued, but I wasn't really too bothered about the characters. There was no real interest there. Sure, I wanted them to get together and finally live forever together, but I wasn't completely bothered if they didn't. I felt the concept for this story was good, but i wouldn't necessarily say that the film was filmed brilliantly. It kept me entertained like any other romantic film, but it didn't give me feel-good-vibes which we all expect from a film of this genre.Since then I have purchased the film on DVD. It is nearly 7 years on, but I still kind of feel the same as when I first watched it. The story is good and imaginative, but its not necessarily a good story for the big screen.

I believe that this is a shame because people might overlook various aspects of the movie (mainly the plot) simply because their standards are set low to begin with.I won't tell you (guys) that this is not a movie that is more likely to interest girls than us though guys, but if you're even a little sensitive you can really enjoy this movie while having a laugh and after you'll finish seeing it you might end up with a few things to think about (especially if your around 18 - 22 and in the middle of a good semi-long lasting relationship). If you hate all these girly movies and you can only be happy when monster truck mashing is on I suggest you skip this movie and stop reading my review right now.The movie is well made within the standards of modern romantic comedies (again, light movies), the cast is actually very good and even that most of the surrounding characters are not 100% believable that's OK because they were never mend to be that way (the movie got to have those for some comedy). Julia really plays well and if you notice her expressions they seem to be very natural and there's a good chemistry between the couple on-screen and you can really tell.If you take away all the smaller cheesy parts of the movie you are left with a beautiful story about a couple who met too soon and were lucky enough to stumble upon each other later on and relive their love. I think that the fact I had gone through something very similar to this in my personal life had an affect on the way I see the plot. These things do happen and just like that, if you are lucky enough. Right now I'm in that time when we are apart and I hope that my story will end just like the movie did (fat chance).So there you have it. this movie can be all that you want to take from it it can be another romantic comedy movie to pass the weekend or you might learn a thing or two about love and some old memories will come up to the surface again.

Against a backdrop of life at college in New York, a couple take it in turns to describe the highs and lows of first love.Coming off the back of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and 10 Things I Hate About You, both Prinze and Styles were in the ascendant in 2000. First-time writer-director Isacsson's film doesn't take either of them into radically new territory, but with its tricksy structure and high cute quotient, Down To You does prove an efficient romantic comedy driven by charismatic performances by two of Hollywood's most attractive adolescents.Told largely in flashback, lovers Al (Prinze) and Imogen (Styles) take it in turns to describe how they met, partied and parted. The son of a TV chef (former Fonzie Winkler), straight-laced Al's love for arty Imogen follows the usual honeymoon-boredom-infidelity arc, but Isacsson employs a sort of cut and paste technique, scenes from the early stages of their relationship segueing into scenes from its end.The screenplay, with its pithy one-liners, split screens and to-camera asides, clearly aims for an ironic, knowing cool. It doesn't always work, and some of the best moments actually have little to do with the plot at all a prolonged fantasy sequence involving a reality cookery show is unexpectedly effective, as is a sub-plot focusing on Al's room-mate-turned-porn-star Monk (Orth). Finally though, it's a film built around its stars and if, towards the end, Down To You does begin to stumble, Prinz and Styles prove more than capable of bringing it back to its feet.Verdict An enjoyable and, in terms of style, unexpectedly imaginative teen-friendly romantic comedy. Prinz and Styles are solid and attractive, and though Isacsson's screenplay occasionally overreaches itself, a quality cast ensure watch ability is high.

It seemed like Freddie and Julia met in a bar one night and then all of a sudden they are seeing each other and sleeping with each other everyday when they didn't really get to know each other. Freddie's friends had no importance in this movie whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, I really like Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles and I think they are pretty good actors. I just dont think this script reflected their talent. None of this movie made sense and I didn't understand some of the things they were doing and the importance of them. Like when Freddie had to drink the two wines and pick out which one was love, I didn't understand what was going on until the scene was over. My friend and I were really confused. I mean, I'm still in Junior High and I haven't experienced stuff like that before, but even my friend's sister, who is in college, said it was confusing and stupid. I really thought the director could have tied in the title of the movie better than they did. The movie had about 5 minutes left and I still didn't find out why the movie was called Down to You. And even when I did, it didn't make any sense. I mean yeah thats great, she painted a book cover of both of them with the book titled Down to You, but why? Why was it called Down to You? Nothing happened that would help you understand why this movie was called Down to You. In total, I feel this movie wasn't the best and made no sense at all. If you like Freddie Prinze Jr. and want to see him in a teen romance movie, see She's All That with Rachel Lee Cook. That movie is a lot better than this one and makes a lot more sense.

Asking these two to carry a movie is a stretch.In She's all That, Freddie was constantly being bailed out by the unbelievably cute Rachel Leigh Cook or in I Know What you did...Love Hewitt and a cool killer were picking up the lag. 10 things I hate about you wasn't total crap because it had subplots, with different characters doing their thing to take your mind off the mundane love story. But in Down to You, the love story is even worse, not to mention unrealistic. Anyone who has been in a relationship, or even inter-acted with another human being know that this kind of behavior and conversation never occur. Every movie has dialogue written down and spoken, but it shouldn't sound that way. In this film, they could have had line cards.I suppose another reason for my being unsatisfied was an expectation I had after watching the preview. I was led to believe that Prinze and Stiles would have a great but brief relationship ending on account of a silly dispute or misunderstanding, he would cheat, regret it and have to convince her of his love, and then win her back. Sounds unoriginal but it got me to rent the movie right? This is not the case (spoiler alert) I was 70 minutes into the 90 total, when I noticed HEY!, these two are still in love, still dating ,still happy, and I'm still bored. I was wondering how in the world they were going to break up and get back together in the next 20 minutes and still be realistic. It can't and it didn't, and this is the movies biggest problem the ending. It's insulting if this director thinks that I would just sit back and say, awwww, how sweet, I guess they were meant for each other after all. I didn't buy it.........and you shouldn't rent it.

This movie was so sappy and not believable and predictable that I couldn't help but yawn throughout the entire movie.  There were so many things wrong with this movie that it over shadowed the few good parts. Parts such as the flashbacks when they enter each others lives, the part involving the Man Show, Julia's Life speech towards the end, and the part dealing with the pregnancy was really good.  But these small moments were over shadowed by crap, like college kids drinking wine?, just sitting around after a car accident, how did they get in the art gallery?, when did Freddie get the apartment?, Cotton candy at an adult party?.  Who actually still drinks Pabst Blue Ribbon?.  Drinking Shampoo?  Why does Freddie have an Italian accent towards the end?  All of these questions were spoken aloud as I watched this seemingly endless movie drag on.  I thought they could save it at the end, but the part in Columbus Circle was so unbelievably corny. I have had the opportunity to meet Julia on the train one evening, briefly, in September, and she is a very lovely person and actually spoke to me.  She seemed like a bright person.

Julia Stiles, who is a decent actress, is simply annoying in her role. The supporting characters who were meant to be funny...are not. The entire scene on his dad's cooking show was utterly pointless...it was like the director was trying to say hey, you see, he LOVES her, and ooooh, ooooh, they are meant for each other! in case we didn't understand that the movie was about their relationship. There are so many scenes in this movie that don't move the plot(not that there was much of one to begin with) along that you have to wonder who supervised this production.

It is sweet and fluffy with almost no substance.  It is so syrupy in fact; that you have to be careful you don't go into diabetic shock.Writer/Director Kris Isaacson tries very hard to make this the perfect schmaltzy romantic comedy.  He tries to copy Woody Allen's first person multiple narrative technique from the perspectives of the two lovers, but unfortunately, his writing isn't strong enough to make this technique effective.  In the first part of the film, he tries to depict the perfect college romance.  In the second part, he tries to portray the jilted lovelorn guy pathetically drifting with his life bereft of meaning.  The ending; well I'm sure you can figure it out.Unfortunately, all this accomplishes is to create a perfectly trite story with characters so cliché they belong in a soft drink commercial.  This is why I rated this film a perfect 5/10 perfectly average.The acting was better than the direction.  Julie Stiles was the stronger of the two leads.  She was adorable as the misty eyed lover and actually showed some emotional range as the relationship got into trouble.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. seems to be determined to become a male Meg Ryan, not daring to venture beyond the safety of light romantic comedy.  He was adequate in his presentation of the smitten smurf, but his languid character was such an emotional lightweight that a strong breeze would have blown him away.I would recommend this as a good date movie for never married audiences under 25.  It has some funny and charming moments and won't overtax anyone with complex characters and abstruse plotlines.  If you are young or young at heart, you'll probably enjoy it.

His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting.  In his new movie, Prinze plays Al Connelly, a college student searching for love, among other things.When he meets freshman Imogen, played by the lovely Julia Stiles, he is immediately fascinated by her.  Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple.  The movie chronicles their tale of first love, along with every obstacle in between, such as Al's friend who directs porn movies, and his father, who wants to start with a Cops -like cooking show with his son.At the beginning, this seemed like a wonderful idea for a movie.  The first fifteen minutes were a sweet, almost realistic account of first love, which many people could relate to.  A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple.  However, all of the potential of this movie was shattered when all of a sudden, in a moment of 90210 like melodrama, Imogen thinks she's pregnant.  Of course, this event is the beginning of their problems for the rest of the movie.The film continues its downward spiral, culminating an unrealistic and contrived ending.  Prinze and Stiles simply had no chemistry on screen, and by the end, the audience was simply not interested in whether they got together or not.  Prinze seemed incapable of showing any emotion, making his character extremely boring and just annoying.  On the other hand, Stiles (of 10 Things I Hate About You) was charming as usual, but unfortunately stuck in a bad movie, with no place to show off her talent.  Additionally, the supporting cast was no help, awkwardly put in scenes to make badly acted sex jokes, and having no relevant or even interesting purpose.Written and directed by Kris Isacsson, the movie had some good ideas, but those were quickly overshadowed by too much melodrama and contrived storylines.  What could've been an earnest and sweet romance, turned into a boring story with annoying characters.

This movie was technically much more mature than She's All That, and he did a wonderful job handling the depth of his character. It's a shame I can't say that about Julia Stiles. She was embarrassingly miscast. This movie, though a romantic comedy, dealt with a couple that had a number of gliches in their relationship, and they both did their share of hurting each other. This was ALSO the type of movie where one was supposed to feel sympathetic for BOTH characters, and there were few, if any instances where I felt sorry for Stiles when she done Freddie wrong and he was reluctant to forgive her. She had a way of making you despise her. Maybe it was because when Freddie was emotionally hurt he was so much more believable than she was. Sorry, Miss Stiles, but you were a little bit out of your league...It would be unfair to put all the blame on Julia Stiles for the horribleness of this movie. There was just a lot of, for lack of a better word, stupid stuff that went on in this plot a seemingly idiotic pregnancy false alarm, the consumption of a bottle of shampoo, a cooking show that was based along the premise of the show Cops, and my list could go on.

This teen date movie centers around a relationship throughout University or college (it was that hard to stay interested). The relationship goes through its up and down moments and ultimately ends in the one decision as always where do we go from here once it is over? If everyone has been there and done that in their life, than you can ask yourself why Hollywood would make a movie so obvious and predictable. With no point to be made that we already know and teach our kids throughout the walk of life, DOWN TO YOU falls flat on its face.

At first glance, it is very much the boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy and girl date, boy and girl break up, boy and girl get back together and the world is wonderful place kind of story. It's a teen flick so yes, it's going to be predictable. Predictable, however, does not have to mean bad or boring. There was a great deal of emotional undertone to the story. It's about college love, which anyone who's been there knows isn't easy. The timing always seems to be wrong in one way or another. Like many other films, this one does not gloss over that part. It very honestly, I think, shows the kinds of problems that can evolve. Granted, I don't have any porn star turned rich lecturer friends, and I know no one who drank shampoo after a breakup, but there is definitely some measure of reality and honesty to this picture. Yes they end up together in the end (and no, that's not giving away the ending) but it wasn't an easy road nor is there an implication that it is going to be. Love isn't easy. It never has been. If it were easy, the feelings wouldn't have any meaning and this world would be a very dark place. This film captures that essence.If you're asking for a plot that has twists and turns, something that is action packed, then don't see this film. It moves a little slowly and it is difficult to ascertain where some of the characters are coming from. But if you've been in love, if you are in love, if you've had your heart broken or broken someone else's, even if you want to fall in love, see this film. It reminds all of us that there is hope and that you can never completely give up on anybody. One day, you might just be surprised.

Down To You is quite pleasant to look at due to Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles (quite a few very noisy teens in the audience seemed to agree with me). But the writing is so weak; the TV shows I watch are much better with dialog and plot, though there were some good lines about sex, comparable to Undressed on MTV. I enjoyed the talking to the camera about the relationship and some unconventionalities (Prinze's father Henry Winkler is a TV chef and he wants to be a cook too), but the crucial motivations were deus ex machina with no reasons.It's in a very fictional NYC, that reminded me of a college version of Astaire & Rogers movies for its sense of unreal NYC.The music choices weren't the pop I expected -- Folk Implosion, Luscious Jackson, Yo La Tengo--but they made no sense in terms of commenting on the action, just songs strung together for no purpose. And why would college students now be into Al Green such one would be their song?(originally written 1/23/2000) "}{"Title":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen","Date":"24 November 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I love teen movies.

Woof! The only point of interest about this film is how the heck did it get made? To think, Orson Welles did wine commercials for years because he couldn't get financing, and no doubt there are plenty of Orson Welles available *today*, but instead of financing something worthwhile - or even remotely promising - respectable companies like Miramax chose to distribute this film? It is amazing it got past the test audience (unless it was a class of 12 year old girls), let alone onto DVD. To add insult to injury the stars of the film, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles didn't even seem to like each other. Freddie wore his hound dog teary eye look around and Julia had a forced smile plastered on her face. They didn't even seem like they could *act* like they liked each other. Perhaps both of them suspected just how bad this was going to turn out.  Fortunately, they are young and hopefully talented, so they can put this poor excuse for a film behind them. If this is what we have to look forward to from our Gen-X talent, let's hope the baby boomers live a *long*, *long*, time.

First of all, I think that Julia stiles is extremely cute. But what was she thinking. 10 Things I Hate About You was such a cute movie, then she has to go out and do a piece of trash like this. The plot is bad. It's the exact same formula used in every romantic comedy. Except in this movie, if you're laughing, you're laughing at how unbelievably stupid it is. It's a wonder how movies like this ever get made. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Freddie has been in 3 romantic comedies within the past 2 years (We've got She's all That 1999, Down to You 2000 and Boys and Girls 2000) I'm getting a little tired of this. It's the same movie printed 3 times w/ different actors! But back to the movie. This movie was terrible. How does a script this bad ever get made? Actually, I don't WANT to know. So in closing, I hated this movie and it was terrible.

This forgettable movie again features the nocturnal habitants who float about the genre exclusively, and another string of mid twenties wannabes who should rethink about returning to their ordinary day jobs.  High school days absent, using the less frequently treaded stomping ground of college, it does not assist a highly evident flawed script with characters so wooden and hollow that they are less interesting than swiss cheese. By having both lead characters taking turns to tell their respective sides of the story, it only shows the screenwriter's inability to deliver on the already low standards expected from teen romantic comedy.Down to You features a soundtrack fortunately not ear shattering. What a bonus for finding the comforts of your own bed right before the action. There aren't many movies in release that will allow, for eight dollars, to find the most therapeutic sleep enriched slumber away from home.Rating 4/10    "},{"Title":"Can you have a relationship without sex?","Date":"13 February 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Granted, this was a college relationship.

I came out doubling over in laughter at this Harlequin wannabee, piece of garbage movie with one dimensional characters.  Either the direction, script of lack of interest made Julia Stiles lose her otherwise superfluous luster.  Freddie Prinze Jr. made an admirable try, but the lack of chemistry and the nauseating sexual scenes were the first blows. The last pieces of film that could have been salvaged were perhaps some classic lines, witty dialogue and under-developed characters.  The dialogue was flat and predictable.  Horrible movie, dont waste a movie voucher like I did. "}]
