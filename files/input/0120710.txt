Perhaps it was a little overdone, but did anyone ever stop to think that the apples were representative of Clair's fear. The apple, the most innocent of all things, a fruit, as the repository of one's own nightmares and fears is creepy enough in itself. Many regard the scene where Clair is frantically throwing apples from a pile on the cupboard into the garburator of the sink as funny. I didn't I was well enough into the film, that the moment actually felt creepy. Jordan's vicious left/right pans of the camera reinforced her feeling of panic or anxiety around the apples.To mention a couple of the other good points about In Dreams, there were a couple of ingenious cross cutting scenes created. The first is a cross cut sequence involving Clair who is now in the mental hospital and her husband who goes to the motel that she dreamed about to find the dog. Another wonderful cross-cut sequence involves the escape from the institution. In her dreams, Clair follows Vivian (who had spent time in the exact same room as Clair) out of the institution, and there is much cross-cutting between the past and the present. Much suspense was built in the production of this scene. I don't want to give away any of the ending, but trust me, it scared me lifeless. This is definitely not Neil Jordan's best work, certainly The Crying Game is his masterpiece, but nevertheless, this is an original horror suspense film that delivers a punch!

When Claire's Daughter (Katie Sagona) is been murdered by a mysterious Serial Killer (Robert Downey Jr.). Then Claire finds herself predicting the future, when she shares her dreams with the Serial Killer. Unable to convince the lead detective (Paul Guilfoyle), her doctor (Stephen Rea) and even her husband (Aidan Quinn). Claire has to confront the killer alone before her another terrifying dreams becomes real.Directed by Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, In the Company of Wolves, Interview with the Vampire) made a fascinating adult horror thriller. The film was a Box Office disappointment back in 1999. The film receive mixed reviews but what makes the film works is Bening's terrific performance. The Production Values are strong, especially music score by Elliot Goldenthal (Alien 3) and Cinematography by Darius Khondji, A.F.C. (Se7en). The film has a few problems like Robert Downey Jr. as the Serial Killer is oddly cast and he brings laughs to the film, when the film is supposed to be scary. The film also has a weak third act. But the film is saved by Bening's role, film's music, cinematography and Jordan's direction.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD doesn't have much features, it only has the basic like Production Notes, Cast & Filmmakers Bios and the Theatrical Trailer. This is a truly underrated film with some genuine moments. While the film is unpleasant but that what makes a good horror film. The film features a Cult Following. This is worth a look, this could have been a masterpiece for Jordan's film-making. If it wasn't for the third act, this film really could hit a bull's eye. Based upon a Novel, titled Doll's Eyes by Bari Wood. Which Wood also wrote the novel Twins that become a film titled David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers. Screenplay by Bruce Robinson (The Killing Fields, Jennifer 8, Return to Paradise). (****/*****).

I caught it on HBO and, after seeing it, I wish I had seen it in the theatres. I do not know why movie critics generally snubbed this film - I thought it was a taut, edge-of-my-seat complex thriller, and there were a few times that I jumped out of that ol' seat, yelling, YIKES! (or something to that effect). Sure, it may be a bit unrealistic, but as far as storytelling, directing and acting, it's a very good piece.Both Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening were outstanding; I was riveted by their characters and couldn't take my eyes off either of them during the film. Bening shows her great range and depth, playing the heroine/protagonist whose life turns upside down in only moments and spins wildly out from there. Downey also shows great versatility in a role that he is not normally associated in.If you enjoy the work of either of these two actors, or if you enjoy complex, mind-bending thrillers, ignore the critics and watch this.

The color red is used to constantly remind the audience of the tenseness and fear in the film. Ironically enough, the first thing that went through my mind when I saw Robert Downey Jr. as the psychopath as he approached Claire toward the end of the film was that he was horribly miscast in this film, and that his presence would inevitably lead to the ultimate disappointment that I expected to feel after the movie ended. However, aside from the goofy contact lenses that he wore and the obviously dyed hair, I was surprisingly impressed with his contribution to the film. In the film's closing scene, in particular, he was able to deliver one final performance that left jaws dropped as the credits began. In Dreams is definitely not for everyone. I think that for this particular film, there will be people who loved it, people who hated it, and people who just didn't understand it, with probably not much in between. Unfortunately, it was much more effective on the big screen than on video, but with a healthy twist of the volume knob, it can be made to have virtually the same effect.

For some reason, he cannot film an ending to a movie and I don't understand why.  He tends to deal with stories that have interesting premises, but don't actually go anywhere.  I am not really sure why he does this, but he does.  Look back at his filmography you will see what I mean.  The only two films he made with good endings were The Butcher Boy and The Crying Game (you really can't screw up that ending), but even his best films (like Michael Collins) seem to fall apart as they are getting ready to wrap up.  Build up and then disappointment.Luckily, this is not a problem for In Dreams, which falls apart almost immediately.  This film never comes close to generating a truly engrossing story or to establishing characters or situations that are even remotely plausible.  I am normally able to suspend a tremendous amount of disbelief, but I just couldn't follow what was going on, or perhaps I was and it just wasn't interesting so I was trying to make up stuff to amuse myself.I actually did not realize how bad the film actually is until I watched it a second time (being somewhat of a fan of Jordan's I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt).  The movie is so scattered (and the end is sooooo lame) that it is impossible to even comment effectively on what the problems of the plot were.  This reminded me of another of Jordan's films, A Company of Wolves, which had similar problems, but somehow managed to extricate itself from them at least partially (or perhaps I was more forgiving because of the incredibly low budget of the earlier film).  A Company of Wolves was interesting and adult retelling of Little Red RidingHood, which despite its weirdness, managed to hold my interest through most of it.This was not the case with In Dreams, whose weirdness overwhelmed any chance the film had of credulity.  I love weird cinema, but weirdness needs to be used well in order to be effective.  In Dreams is too wierd for no good reason and this sinks the plot and made me continue to view it as a movie rather than allow me to become engrossed in its story.  Oh well, all that said, I have seen worse films.

Is Claire genuinely going through these horrific experiences or is she going mad?There is also a terrible cruel streak running through the film - especially in its treatment of its heroine and her family - which is so unusual and refreshing for a Hollywood film (perhaps this is the main reason why audiences and critics were so alienated by it, they're just not used to it).Visually, Jordan's movie is sumptuous - the rich reds and greens, the autumnal colours, the ghostly underwater sequences.And there are also the performances. Bening, in probably her most neurotic role ever, is as compelling as always.Aidan Quinn is suitably solid in the role of her troubled, if flawed husband. Stephen Rea turns in another subtle performance as the psychiatrist. Paul Guilfoyle is also effective as the cop.And then, there's Robert Downey Junior - so over the top you're waiting for him to crash land with one hell of a thump. But then again, OTT is nothing new to this genre. I give you Jack Nicholson in The Shining, Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Anthony Perkins in Psycho!In Dreams is a multilayered film, attacking you visually, mentally and emotionally on a number of levels.First, there is the nature of dreams and reality, madness and sanity, fairytales and fact.Secondly, you can read it as a love letter to Hitchcock. There is so much Hitchcock in this film - Rebecca, Psycho, The Birds, Marnie, Notorious, Suspicion (they're all alluded to here and many, many more of the Great Master's movies).Thirdly, there's many recurrent themes and imagery from Jordan's own work in here. We have the psychologically disturbed boy from The Butcher Boy, cross dressing, gender bending in The Crying Game, holding captives in a gothic forest from the same film, even the famous run through the forest, the leap from a dam in We're No Angels, the tortured monster a la Interview with the Vampire.Fourthly, there's the apples, those damned red apples that keep troubling everyone. Shades of Adam and Eve? Fairytales like Snow White?In Dreams may not be Jordan's finest work but there is plenty in here to enjoy and to discover on repeated viewings.The movie is uncomfortable viewing at times but gloriously over the top.Time will tell how 'In Dreams' will be viewed in the context of Jordan's overall work and whether it will be a cult movie.I think the biggest surprise of all is that it got through the Hollywood studio system. Full marks to Dreamworks for doing so.

In Dreams introduces us to a slew of ideas which are never resolved in the movie.  The underwater town, a fascinating (albeit farfetched) premise is never used properly.  Promising characters, like Stephen Rea's psychologist and the skeptical detective and Claire's eerie cellmate, never amount to much.  In fact, the whole movie plunges us so rapidly into the chain of events that we barely have time to stake our ground; and while I appreciate this unsettling tactic, I do believe some level of explication is necessary.  We barely get to know Bening's husband and daughter before they're gone, so we don't mourn their loss much. (What is the purpose of introducing Claire's husband's liasons w/ the girl from Sydney? The film is full of tidbits like this which, while they might have been important in the novel, are really distracting here.)I think the movie runs this way because Jordan did pay such compulsive attention to cinematic detail.  As several commenters have noted, every scene in this film is painstakingly crafted; the imagery is rich and almost overwhelming.  The movie is quite short, in fact; despite everyone's groanings, I think it ought to have been longer.   Loose ends could have been tied off.  But  with Jordan's involved treatment of each frame, I'm sure it would have taken a while to finish it properly.  I may go read the book I'm dying to know the exact circumstances of Vivian's childhood, and the reason for Claire's visions.  For a movie which relies so heavily on these two central characters, it's surprising that these questions weren't better answered.

For the first 60 minutes, the film is impeccable. Its confident cinematography superbly illustrates an innocent mother's twisted dream world, which she ultimately shares with a cold blooded killer. This second dimension is engulfed with red, juicy apple orchards, wild scenery, and a mysterious, disturbing voice that whispers in the night. Through this dream world, Claire Cooper (Annette Benning) witnesses several murders, only to become terrified beyond her imagination when she discovers that these dreams are testimony to the future crimes of her small town.Unfortunately for Neil Jordan, this is where the film takes a discouraging turn for the worst. The cinematography and established mood that made the movie so fascinating to this point, essentially vanishes into thin air. We are introduced to the disturbed Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey, Jr.), a serial killer who kidnaps a young girl and summons Claire to save her life and end the madness. The remainder of the movie is spent analyzing the crooked mind of a young boy trying to fabricate a family life that never existed. Finally, the film is quickly put to rest through a weak helicopter chase that ends in tragedy.The movie had great potential, including a solid storyline and impressive imagery.

One of the residents from the local asylum; Robert Downey Jr., is a serial killer. Bening has psychic visions about his victims.The symbol of apples and the color red, are a recurring nightmare for Bening, whose husband (well portrayed by Aidan Quinn) is beyond despair. She needs some sort of psychiatric help for her seeming obsessions. The visuals as she is having nightmares, are quite vivid and ethereal. Particularly noteworthy is the beginning sequence, wherein Bening's daughter is kidnapped. The daughter was just in a school play- the angel wing costume, crystallized and glistening on a tree- is found by the police. No daughter in sight.Claire begins to have nightmares about a child named Ruby - her dog Dobie runs away, and is eventually killed by Downey Jr. There is also a cinematic scene where Bening is at an abandoned hotel, in a flowing red gown- the symbolism is very haunting.Stephen Rea is the psychiatrist who attempts to help Claire with her obsessions/delusions. He is very believable, and the imagery at the state asylum is stark and foreboding.This film has several haunting, subconscious images. Do not be surprised if you find yourself dreaming, or having similar nightmares. Sometimes, REM sleep looks similar to the filmed underwater sequences here.

Like using a sexually ambiguous child as young Vivian.It is a lot like the payoff in `Bladerunner,' where hardly no one gets that Ford is a replicant himself. So most people never got it here and thought of this as a sort of `From the Deep.' I personally think much of the blame can be laid at the feet of Ms Bening.

Also, the most aptly named film ever, for as a powerful dream or nightmare tends to appear fragmented and senseless after one wakes, In Dreams provides a gut-wrenching story with hellish imagery that falls apart once the lights come up and logic is applied.Annette Bening does a fine job as a woman being driven slowly insane (although whether this is due to the dreams of a psychotic killer or her own hellish reality, which involves the murder of her daughter and being comitted to one of the worst mental hospitals depicted on film since The Snake Pit), And Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly creepy as psycho serial killer Vivian, but the story doesn't stand up to further examination.Examples Does Vivian also have the capability of mind control that extends to pets, or is the family dog just the most intelligent mutt since Rin Tin Tin? And how does this mental power also extend to computers and portable radios? Since Vivian's psychosis seems to stem from his abusive mother, what is the significance of of the oft-quoted verse, My Daddy is A Dollar...? The whole relationship between Vivian and his mother is also not very well presented, being told in quick, disjointed flashbacks. Why, for instance, did she leave her son to die when their hometown was flooded to make room for a resevoir? Yes, I know the easy answer is because she was crazier than an outhouse rat but I would have liked something with a little more substance.The high point of this film is its ability to instill a true sense of dread and uneasiness in the viewer. There is not one minute of relief from the disturbing imagery, right up to the somewhat disappointing twist ending, which seems to be inspired by countless stories in the old EC Comics.In Dreams packs a pretty good punch for a serious horror film.

Shortly after at a school play Rebecca goes missing, the police are alerted & start to search for her & eventually find her dead body in a reservoir near her house. Claire is obviously devastated & realises that the dream she had was a prediction of things to come rather than recollection of things past. Claire has a car accident & is hospitalised, her neurosurgeon Dr. Stevens (Dennis Boutsikaris) is worried by what she says & calls his friend & psychiatrist Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rea) in to see if he can help her make sense of her dreams. It's not long before Silverman starts to believe Claire as her dreams become worse, Claire believes she has a psychic link with a serial killer named Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.) who is taunting by sending her these terrifying dreams...Co-written & directed by Neil Jordan I personally didn't find much to like in In Dreams. The script by Jordan & Bruce Robinson is based on a novel called 'Doll's Eyes' by Bari Wood & is a bit of a muddled mess. I found the film far too slow, the story never gripped me as for most of it we don't see Vivian kill anyone as it focuses on Claire & her breakdown, boring. The dreams make no sense & don't really act as clues from which they can find Vivian, I would have preferred more of a straight thriller with more of an emphasis on Vivian & Claire trying to stop him because in the end he finds her & most of the film seems to concentrate on Claire screaming or crying, boring. The character's were dull & uninteresting, I really couldn't have cared less about any of them & when the inevitable climactic showdown between Claire & Vivian happened I was distinctly unexcited & unmoved, in fact I was more bored than anything else (do you see a pattern developing here?). In Dreams is also hard to follow as it skips between bizarre visions or flashbacks or whatever their supposed to be & reality with little regard for the viewer, as a whole the film just about makes sense but I still think it's a bit of a mess, oh & a boring mess too. Finally I saw that so-called 'shock' ending coming a mile off, it was so obvious I was almost embarrassed & the fact that the unpleasant subject of child murder arises it made uncomfortable viewing for me, all I want when I watch a film is to be entertained & have fun & this isn't my idea of entertainment or fun.The thing that saves In Dreams from being a complete bomb is director Jordan's visual style & flair as he gives the film a really nice look & feel with some cool imagery. There seems to be plenty of fairytale references & the dreams themselves look very fairytale like & Claire's latest job was to adapt & illustrate a book of fairy tales by the Grimm Brother's. The blurring of Claire's car crash with the death of her daughter is a nicely put together sequence while the film overall has a dark undercurrent running through it. The violence & gore is restrained, someone has a knife stuck in their eye, a nurse is stabbed in the neck & there is a brief shot of a dog eating someone's face but that is just about it, I would have liked the horror quotient bumped up a little.With a budget of about $30,000,000 I am aghast that In Dreams cost as much money as it did, where did all the money go? There are no major A-list stars, no major action or special effect scenes, takes place in very few locations & nothing in my mind that would justify spending 30 big ones. It's well made (for that sort of money that's the least I would expect) but apart from some nice visual touches nothing stands out as being particularly outstanding. The acting is also another strong element but this hardly makes up for In Dreams other deficiencies.I didn't find anything in In Dreams that I particularly enjoyed, I thought it was boring, dull, uneventful, muddled & I just couldn't get into it. There are so many better horror & thrillers out there that films like In Dreams shouldn't really get made. Disappointing & probably one to avoid as far as I'm concerned.

The story was ludicrous, without even a hint of plausibility or anything that would make me want to suspend my disbelief.  The pace was tedious and meandering, with so many strands that never lead anywhere.  And, as mentioned elsewhere here, the microphone kept popping up in scene after scene.

It stars Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Robert Downey Jr.and Paul Guilfoyle. Music is by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Darius Khondji.In this contrived thriller, Bening is a grief stricken housewife who finds her thoughts in sync with a serial killer (a ridiculously miscast Downey Jr.). Neil Jordan is a great director, but he's also a very frustrating one, case in point In Dreams. The visuals are outstanding here as Jordan and Khondji paint a nightmarish world, but the flashbacks are unfocused and any sense of suspense or plot progression is lost in a whirl of stylised indulgence. Strip away the style and you find a formulaic serial killer picture hiding behind arty farty stubbornness.

I would have given this movie a miss if not for Downey's presence in it. I am currently reading his biography and this movie came at a time when he was at the lowest patch of his career. His screen time is far less but tries to make the most of it. 'In Dreams' is a story of interwoven minds of Vivian & Claire. Downey's best scene in the movie is the one right at the end of the movie. I wish there was more emphasis on building and leading the story than showing Annette's antics and psychotic behavior. I can't find fault with the premise but the story is sort of vague.

Placed into a mental hospital, Claire begins having severe nightmares & visions where she can see into the mind of the killer who has been haunting her since childhood. Her husband doesn't believe her, only for himself to turn up as a victim of the killer. Convinced that only she has the power to stop the killer, Claire breaks out of the asylum & makes her way to the killer's hideout in order to save a young girl from becoming his latest victim.Neil Jordan is one of the world's finest directors, having done the acclaimed likes of The Crying Game & the exceptional romantic werewolf fairy tale THE COMPANY OF WOLVES. In Dreams was one of the director's borderline genre films, a blend of psychodrama & slasher flick.In Dreams might not be one of Neil Jordan's best films &#x96; in fact it is pretty weak in terms of storyline, with a complicated plot that needs several viewings to fully comprehend &#x96; but even with this problem, Jordan still impresses, mainly by way of making evocative visuals. The flooding of the old town, which has divers swimming through a submerged cemetery (that scene alone made me feel uneasy), the dreams that Annette Bening has, which are actually visions of the future, even the haunting rhyme that the killer writes on the walls (My father was a dollar / I wrote it on a fence / my father was a dollar / not worth a hundred cents) all add up to an interestingly creepy atmosphere. Jordan is also an expert in atmosphere, giving an eerie feeling of dread throughout the film, although this is slightly hamstrung somewhat by the frenzied editing. There are several weak points in the film as well &#x96; the story needed a few clarifications on how long Bening has had the visions for; the exact nature of the mind-link with the killer; as well as some needless scenes of destruction that seem to be inserted purely to justify the film's 'thriller' tag. The climax is also pretty weak but is redeemed somewhat by a darkly ironic ending where Bening, now a ghost, haunts Downey Jr's waking moments for karmic payback.The acting is top-notch, although Annette Bening has some trouble getting into the disturbed headspace without doing some glass-munching (the act of doing extreme emotions in an over-the-top manner). As for glass-munching, Robert Downey Jr is perfect as the killer, doing an excellent job of playing a disturbed killer who was traumatised by being left chained up by his mother in the flooding town.

Hooray. And yet the story is ridiculous, and it just doesn't hang together. By the time you get to the clichés that serve as an ending, you'll want to slap something. The garish color and playful effects really do work as individual moments, but the story line is more a serious of dots that start to connect up and then veer into some kind of weird scribble. The waste of acting talent here is particularly odd. Annette Benning is rocking it for much of the film, until she morphs into Laurie Anderson. Downey is only in part of the third reel, and he's fairly restrained but effective. Rea has it dialed way down, to the point where there's almost nothing to it.

Annette Bening is having reoccurring dreams about a young girl being led into an apple orchard by a stranger. Another dream involves a boy tied to a bed while a Church is flooding. The girl turns out to be her daughter whose body is found in the lake. The boy in the flood is an escape mental patient whom Bening connects within her own cell when her husband has her committed. She is driven mad since these dreams seem to be coming from someone else. Intriguing and daring thriller about tortured minds effectively realized by director Neil Jordan who previously made The Crying Game and Michael Collins. Bening does a fine job as a woman who is haunted by images that she doesn't fully comprehend. Aiden Quinn as her husband seems to be there only to lose faith in her and see her as crazy. Robert Downey Jr. has a crucial role that is unlike anything he has done before and it works. Katie Sagona plays Bening's daughter. Paul Guilfoyle plays a detective but the role is not as interesting as the case he is out to crack. While the ending is somewhat hogwash, it is still an entertaining thriller that is visually stunning and mind boggling at best.

They kinda liked it, for some reason, but I really didn't. From the get go, we're given a confusing story involving Claire Cooper and her torture to try to convince people that she isn't crazy. If I was any of those people she got involved with, I would've also thought she was delirious, since nothing she said could make sense. There are some references to the Snow White story, but they are bad executed. The main reason why I found this movie so boring was the never ending flashbacks; I never knew what was happening now and what was just a vision, so the story got extremely confusing and boring for me. Freud's explanation about dreams is more interesting, in my opinion. Besides, the photography directing is poor and makes it impossible to understand what's going on. I'm just not giving it a lower rating because my friends were able to have some fun in it, but I sincerely wasn't. If I were you, I'd just pass it.

But nobody believes her ability to foresee the killer's next steps, as she could with her own daughter. In addition, the nervous breakdown she suffers gets her into a mental facility after a suicide attempt. And here, she dreams of her husband being murdered...You could open up a whole can of worms when you analyse this piece from Jordan. Many have stated that it's the worse film ever made, but that's just a joke. As someone once said, someone's trash is another's treasure, and whilst Jordan has really gone over the top in some aspects, his genius is evident in several scenes.Apples here are the order of the day, is it referring to Snow White, as the play suggests at the beginning, or is it the forbidden fruit? After all, Claire's husband nearly strayed off the path, and Vivian's forbidden fruit is obviously his mother, as he has Freudian issues with her.Its a unique version, and some scenes are very disturbing, but it's certainly a visual treat, even if some of the narrative is a little off par, but then, one could argue, that the whole film consists of dreams within a dream, within a dream, and so on, so this is why the film will be heralded as a masterpiece to some, and a dogs dinner to others.Bening is great as the grieving mother, but once again, Downey Jr is wonderful, in some scenes he looks like the pre transformation wolf in Jordan's The Company Of Wolves, which this film reminded me of from time to time.Whether she dreamt it all, or it was reality, it's still a curiosity piece indeed, and worth watching more than once.....

(I myself am the living proof of the movie's strong impact) The serial killer's motives and intentions are unravelled through Claire's eyes and it is this point of view that makes In Dreams a very exciting and gripping film. However, the focus remains solely on Claire and, as a result, we are none the less enlightened about the killer's personality by the end of the film. It is this focus on Claire until the end rather than the killer that leaves the audience with a huge question mark as to who this man really is and what has led him to his actions. However promising and interesting a serial killer we are prepared to come across, the film leaves us without a climax. Robert Downey Jr gives a remarkable performance as the villain, with nothing exceptional and exaggerating in his acting. His admirable performance makes up for the lack of depth the plot leaves us with, but only partially; not only because of the point of view, but because of the direction, as well.

In Dreams is a new take on the serial killer thriller. Annette Bening stars as Claire Cooper, a mother who dreams about serial killings before they happen. Her husband, Aidan Quinn, is the only one who takes her seriously. He goes to the cops but they think he's nutty too. Then the serial killer takes the life of Bening's only daughter and that's where she loses her mind and tries to killer herself, twice. The film does a great job in floating in and out of the dream sequences. There's a certain camera trick that is noticeable to tell you that this is a dream not reality. Bening is good as the distraught/telepathic mother. She does her routine screaming that is heard in most of her films(it's very noticeable in The Siege and American Beauty). The film goes to the extreme with getting the dark tone implanted in the viewer's mind. The colors are very drab and dark. Everything comes off as looking grimy and dirty. Plus the film is filmed in dark lighting. In some scenes it's hard to even see the characters. This film is a thriller to the T. There are many unexpected turns and twist plus one of the coolest ending I've seen in any film. In Dreams is dark and a new twist on the serial killer genre. It's good for a party or for a movie to see with a boyfriend/girlfriend. I give it an 8. I recommend that you see this. If not for anything else but the ending.

Let's start with the scene outside.., the one where Claire goes outside after hearing her daughter laughing. The maid, Mary had JUST left and she didn't see anyone planting an apple on the swing?? and IF Vivian was there, why didn't the detective see him before he himself ran into Claire in the woods near her home? How about the husband going to look for the dog in that abandoned hotel? (I agree with the other commentator that this part was absolutely ridiculous) Why would he go all that way to look for his dog, when he didn't care about the dog the night that Claire caused an accident in the road while chasing the dog? And who was the woman who knew who the dog belonged to well enough to have Claire's number and call her husband to come get the dog?Now to Vivian.. First, I am disturbed that the reasons behind him being left to die in the lake weren't explained, why his mother was so abusive and what happened to his father? What about the treatment in the mental ward?? Why was he given shock treatments? Because he was screaming on a steeple in the middle of the lake?? HELLO... he had just managed to break free of a chain tying him to his bed before drowning..wouldn't you be screaming if this happened to you? And what about that nursery rhyme? Why was he writing that in his room? where had he heard it? What meaning did it have for him?How about in the hospital when Claire begins tearing up the wallpaper in her room.. do you mean that when the staff comes to get her to talk to the doctor they do not notice the writing on the chalkboard behind the wallpaper enough to let the Doc in on it before he goes to her room to discover it later?I also didn't really like Robert Downey JR's portrayal of the killer. He was too pouty, too sing songy but not where it was spooky or crazy sounding..he just sounded like a spoiled child. Kevin Spacey would have played this part better..had they explained the psychosis a little more.Oh yes and you mean to tell me that for all of his 14 or so years (the age he seemed to be when he escaped from the mental ward) he had never once killed someone in the hospital so that he would have been isolated? I mean, it was so easy for him to kill that nurse..he did it without thought.I love the kind of movies that leave you having to decide for yourself what really happened etc, but not in this manner.. I mean, why not rather just give us a base plot, turn the camera off and leave us to make up the whole movie ourselves?This movie reminded me of Meet Joe Black in the way that someone had a GREAT idea of a story but failed to follow it all the way through.. I think they need to do this before making the final film.. again, it left me hungry.. like going to a dinner party where they give you an appetizer and tastes of the courses but never the full meal..leaving you wanting more..

As it is, it pulls stock tricks out of the bag for scares, which inexplicably made a lot of the audience jump (the IQ levels of preview audiences must be dropping severely) when I and who I was with saw them coming a mile away.

Unable to convince the lead detective (Paul Guilfoyle), her doctor (Stephen Rea) and even her husband (Aidan Quinn), Claire has to confront the killer alone before her terrifying dreams become real.This film is a mess. I don't want to knock Neil Jordan, the director, because I know that he has had other successes, such as Interview With the Vampire. But this just isn't one of them. This film is poorly conceived and poorly executed... I have few good things to say about it.Why was Claire being fed this stuff? How? Her psychic connection is never explained. And I believe she says she had dreams all her life? Were they always connected to the killer? Why were they never this vivid? Did the connection go both ways -- and if the dreams came from the killer, how did he know what was going to happen in the future? How did Vivian hide out so well? Why were we treated to such over-acting by Bening? Another review says she put on a terrific performance and that the film is saved by her acting. That person has their head up their bottom -- Bening was too much. I don't mind her sometimes, but not here.Why did Downey appear so late in the film? (The box itself gives away he's the killer, so it's not much of a surprise.) And from what I understand, it has nothing to do with the original book. So... why even use it? The same reviewer I quote says this one is truly underrated, features a Cult Following and could have been a masterpiece. What film did they see? All I saw was a movie that dragged on and on, and had some odd obsession with apples, which is never really explained. Yes, I get that there's a run down apple orchard -- but why? There were so many apples, it seems like it had to be symbolic, but wasn't. Why did the kidnapped girl (Ruby) not even try to run away? Plot holes, plot holes, plot holes.You don't need to see this movie. You really don't. You can probably find it in the five dollar bin somewhere, but you'd truly be wasting your money and time.

It's not going to work for you. It's not that kind of movie. This is not Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. It's more like Nicholas Roeg's twisted little masterpiece, Don't Look Now. In fact, I recommend that movie to anyone (the few, the proud, the brave) who can see what a terrific movie In Dreams is.Annette Bening, who is in 90 percent of In Dreams, turns in a bravura performance (if you're reading this, Annette, give us a kiss, you ravishing hunk of woman. Speaking of dreams ... well, uh, let's not go there. Let's just say I've about worn out my copy of The Grifters). The story is simple. Bening plays a mom being driven mad by dreams put in her head by the sicko who killed her daughter. These dreams are of events in the past, things happening now and things that haven't happened yet. A lot of the movie is Bening having nervous breakdowns, each one worse than the one before. The apple-throwing sequence is brilliantly acted and shot. Incredible tension. Major props, also, to the big car and truck crash scene. Jordan puts you right there.Aidan Quinn, as her husband, doesn't have much to do but act baffled, but he's good at that. Stephen Rea, as the psychiatrist, performs the same role as the psychiatrist at the end of Psycho, tying together events from years past to what's going on now. Robert Downey Jr. plays the nutcase very well.This movie looks gorgeous &#151; small town Massachusetts in the fall. Vivid colors you could eat with a spoon. The scene with the little boy atop the church steeple poking out of the lake is really eerie.Again, the visuals in this movie are extraordinary. In Dreams is not about something that could actually happen to real people. It's a wonderfully made adult horror movie that, compared to other horror movies, is actually restrained.

Neil Jordan goes further and steals not only from De Palma's famous Carrie ending too, but also the red-obsession and drowning themes of Don't Look Now and the dripping red wallscrawl of The Shining, plus all the usual lunatic asylum clichés. He also reckons that by attaching a Roy Orbison song onto the end of the movie the effect will be as chilling as a David Lynch film, rather than just plain funny.In Dreams wants to be an intelligent and adult thriller, but like a director with obsessive-compulsive disorder, Jordan just can't help himself loading his film with meaningless clichés and nods to his favourite horror movies.The early domestic scenes are effective, as is the gut-wrenching murder which takes place a short way into the film; but once Bening is committed, the film takes a turn for the usual, and instead of being interesting, incisive or intelligent, just throws a lot of MTV tricks and regurgitated movie moments at the screen hoping that some of them will stick.By far the worst thing about the film is Robert Downey Jr., who undoes anything remaining to keep the viewer interested by his cartoonishly camp turn, and we're treated to yet another mother-obsessive lunatic with a penchant for cross-dressing.This is a good film to watch if you have an apple fetish or enjoy being untroubled by original ideas.

Convinced that a psychopathic child-murderer (Robert Downey Jr.) is channeling her mind, everyone around her begins to think she is insane, while she tries to stop him from killing his next victim.This was one strange movie, and I'll openly admit that. It was pretty off-the-wall. But I think that may be why I enjoyed it so much. I've never seen a film quite like this one, ever, and I admired that about it. The story is written both cleverly but also very incoherently (at times), but not to the point of total confusion - I understood everything that was happening, unlike some people who apparently have complained that the film was far too confusing. I don't understand that, because the film made perfect sense to me. As long as you are paying attention, I see no reason why this film should become so confusing that you have no idea what is happening on screen - it really isn't that complicated. There are some very scary scenes and images that will stick in your mind and won't be easily shaken.Aside from the unusually involving plot, is the stunning visual effects and cinematography - this film looks beautiful. Various angles, amazing locations, and wonderful sets make this film pure eye candy. The New England countryside is both eerie and beautiful at the same time, and the entire underwater town presented in the film is strange but also very neat-looking. The color red is consistent in the film that is a symbol, especially to the protagonist. Apples are seen throughout the film constantly, also symbolizing the strange dreams. The dream sequences are eerie and also visually stunning. Atmosphere in the film is very heavy. Annette Bening plays the lead, and she's a sympathetic character who everyone else believes is extremely insane, which is understandable. Aidan Quinn is her confused husband, and Stephen Rea plays a psychologist. And Robert Downey, Jr. plays the menacing serial killer, in a completely bizarre but well-done performance. The character he plays is strange and scary, and he does it well. The entire cast performs well. The conclusion to the movie is a little ambiguous and daring, but I liked how everything came together.Overall, In Dreams is a bizarre but stylish horror movie that is genuinely scary, very suspenseful, and unlike any horror movie I've yet to see. The acting is great and the film visually looks great. The low rating here on IMDb surprised me, but apparently a lot of people didn't like this film. As for me, I thought it was excellent. I'd recommend this film to fans of psychological horror, it's sure to please them. Very spooky and well done. 8/10.

Since the comic-book generation came of age, it seems to be endless. This installment provided by the 3 wizards at SKG, with the cutesy opening sequence that lets you know it'll be okay to watch and even let the older kids in, and you won't be scared too much, but just a little. Enough to make you have a good laugh about it at the end at how you flinched at the multitude of sudden loud sound blasts and jump-at-you edit sequences. Bening's hysterics aside, and Downey Jr's typical hamfisted angst ignored, this is a pretty good thriller story that could have been so much better if done by Argento or another good Giallo director. Let's not forget the obligatory not-really-an-ending ending which is now the common stereotype in these scare films out of the west coast scare-candy factory. Not so in Italy and thereabouts, where every good villain will often meet a demise so hideously unpleasant that even those not considering themselves squeamish will squirm, and it all would be done without the excessive music track that is now just a never-ending background noise.

Undeserved, if you ask me, because this film is professionally made and it'll appeal to both horror fans and drama lovers. Jordan does what he does best here. He chooses a morbid, almost mythical, setting and blends cinema elements that are unlikely to blend. In his own typical stylish way, he brings together supernatural horror and deep psychological drama. In Dreams handles about a middle-aged woman (Claire &#150; played by Anette Bening) who's being haunted by nightmares and eventually the boogeyman in her dreams controls her actions and drives her utterly insane. He's a child-murderer who demands Claire's complete attention, and he's willing to do absolutely everything to achieve this&#133;including murdering Claire's own daughter. In Dreams faces the viewer with the worst possible thing that could happen in life&#133;the torturing and death of innocent children and dealing with it afterwards. The drama and sentiment are real, and the supernatural elements move it up to a higher dimension. The film contains numberless fairy-tales aspects and references to famous fables (the Grimm Brothers) which is also typical Neil Jordan. As stated by previous movies of his like The Company of Wolves and The Miracle, he seems to have a strange obsession for macabre adult fairy-tales. A bit like Tim Burton, only more devilish!Unfortunately, In Dreams suffers from one major and annoying cliché&#133;the horrible child molester turns out to be a mentally disturbed man who was abused and hurt in his own childhood. Quite possible the worst stereotype in the thriller industry, but it remains bearable at all times thanks to the stunning and intense performance by Robert Downey Jr. Interesting little detail In Dreams was brought out during the period Downey was in serious trouble with the law&#133;which gives his character something extra. Completed with a few bloody and frightening sequences, atmospheric music and a terrific anti-climax, In Dreams is a film that comes with my highest recommendation. Especially the first viewing leaves you speechless and impressed&#133;after multiple viewings, the flaws and weaknesses become more and more obvious.

And did I mention a mess?Everything was wrong with the movie.The writing, the direction, the music (which sounded like an autistic person trying to play a violin) the characters, the ending, everything. And the worst part about it is the fact it's overproduced -- by a production company affiliated  with (you guessed it) Steven Speilberg. One bad movie on your credit doesn't hurt, but the Lost World came before this and still gives him a bad name.Let's start with the characters. Annette Bening overacted in a role as a woman bent on thinking she has a psychological connection with a serial killer because of weird dreams. Aidan Quinn was thrown in as her husband, a character who suffers with infidelities. And then there's Stephen Rea -- An Irish born actor -- who struggles in a role playing an American. If you closed your eyes, he sounded a lot like Harvey Kietel. Last but not least, there was Robert Downey, Jr. as the deranged stranger, who wasn't too convincing, because he looked and sounded more like, well, Robert Downey, Jr.There was only two good things about this The ridiculous, unintenionally funny scene where Bening goes back to the kitchen to see apples piled up on the counter (I guess this says she has a fear of them, according to the movie) She goes stir crazy, stuffs them all down the sink disposal (with music in the background reminiscent of Hitchcock's Psycho) and after she turns the button on, a huge gush of apple sludge bursts from the sink like a broken sewage pipe.(And the hysteria continues) The second part was a scene under the credits at the begining, which was underwater photography showing a town in a reservoir.This movie was a total flop.

Jordan's gift for imagery remains intact, but there seems to be no guiding hand on the tiller, so it all becomes overwhelming and incomprehensible after awhile.  The original novel had a concept which it stuck to so the story felt grounded.

I like Annette Bening, I love supernatural movies and serial killer movies. But THIS film I could not recommend to a dog. RUN from this film.Annette plays a psychic children's book illustrator who lives near a reservoir where an old ghost town lies buried, and where the bodies of little girls slain by the town serial killer are showing up. She is having visions of woods and apples, and thinks she is seeing the kidnapped girls, but when her own daughter is kidnapped and killed she realizes she was seeing the future. Then for the next HOUR AND A HALF she sees visions, does crazy things and is sent to mental institutions. Then, at the eleventh hour, she escapes, meets the killer, there is a tepid chase and an inane ending.I could get into all this if it was only ENTERTAINING. But this movie just spins its wheels. The visions and the symbols go nowhere. Annette's several crazy adventures go nowhere. The characters go nowhere. It's not scary, it's not creepy, it's not moving, it's not haunting, and it has virtually no shape or momentum, so basically what you're left with is watching Annette be tortured for two hours. Me and my friend both felt vaguely sleazy (and not in a good way) after watching this film. And you know-- it is a serious thing to portray someone's YOUNG girl being kidnapped and murdered (and quite possibly abused), and it leaves one feeling a bit queasy to have this topic treated in such a shallow ooh, creepy kind of way.Another irritating factor is that the characters in this movie are inexcusably stupid. Okay, EVERYONE knows about this ghost town at the bottom of the reservoir, and the girl's bodies are showing up there, so it's in the news and thematically connected to the killer. But, when Annette has visions, from the killer, of a boy trapped in an old house filling up with water-- NO ONE can figure out what it might be! Annette's husband is so annoyingly patronizing I would have asked for a divorce in the first scene, and all of the mental health professionals she encounters, who are supposed to be used to dealing with crazy people, treat her in the most snide and insulting ways-- I wanted her to punch them. Stephen Rea shows up as the most snide of the psychologists, apparently here at all only because everyone knows Neil Jordan is his meal ticket.There are several areas where this film COULD have become interesting, but in every case it turns away toward the sensationalistic or banal.

This is an adult film that keeps you there despite some predictability.Some read into this that Claire Cooper (Bening's character) is the one with the real mental issue. I can see why this thought process occurs to and is helpful for some viewers, but I subscribe to the more orthodox view that Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.) is the original and the best when it comes to brain sludge.Some characters need to die in these kinds of movies. Why did it have to be Claire's child Rebecca (Katie Sagona) and husband Paul (Aiden Quinn)? Because we wouldn't care about Claire unless they had died. Will she be believed by her doctors and the Police? Will the Police arrive in time? Will Vivian become sane or judicially killed? Is Claire turning vengeful and joining the dark side by getting into Vivian's head at the end, or is it all Vivian? Can you see coming the chase through the apple factory? How about the wrap-up with the water? Okay, so no metaphor will go un-resolved. So what?! And, writers, please use a male name that's sexual ambiguous rather than sounding 1920s and 30s (I'll say it; sissy) in the modern age, even if the works in the context of the movie.

She is continously having dreams that are highly metaphorical and based around fairy tales (heavy Snow White presence here, with the apples and whatnot). At some points, you're not able to tell what is fantasy and what is reality and the mystery builds up to a very cool climax. Robert Downey is one seriously messed-up dude.

So Neil Jordan indeed succeeds. He got everyone so fixed on the horror tale that the point of the movie is missed. Well, I wouldn't admit that I understand every bit of the movie, but this what I have made up so far1. An immature woman lives in her own fairy-tale world (literally, in the woods as Snowwhite). She is neurotic, overnervous and suffers from exaggerated and unrealistic anxieties for children. Why this is, is not further explained. It has lasted all her life and has probably no outward cause.2. Her child is accidentally killed (if it is a drowning accident or car accident is not explained, but it is certainly not a murder).3. She is devastated by the loss of her child, but she is unable to cope with the loss because of her neurosis. In stead, she blames the child's death on herself, thus accusing herself of being the child's murderer (this is a part that I'm not too sure about, yet, see below). She thus murders her husband.4. Committed to an insanity hospital, she identifies with a former inmate (Vivian) who had a terrible childhood. She suspects Vivian to be the murderer of a nurse and a policeman. 5. There is no real serial killer at large in the present time, only in Claire's mind. She drifts into a melting of identities with Vivian, a mere metamorphosis. This is explained in their first meeting by the reflexion of Vivian's face in the car window, since their faces totally cover each other. The reason for this change of character is as mentioned a bit unclear to me; it may be her accusing herself of her child's death or it may be some other reason, e.g. her need to finally shape her own grown-up character.6. The final part of the movie is the (Freudian) struggle between her two identities, her former conscientious self (Claire) and her insane self (Vivian). The melting/struggle of identity is elegantly explained, as Vivian suddenly starts to have horrible dreams.7. The insane character (Vivian) finally takes over, due to the neurosis of the conscientious self. She is convicted for the murder of her husband, but in prison, in the ending scene, her conscientious self now suddenly starts tormenting her insane self back. The schizophrenia is complete.  Of course you can choose to view the movie face value as most critics have done, but then you would not expect such a nonsensical thing from Jordan's acrobatic mind, would you.

His work falls into one of two categories; great and bad, with none that fall in between. He's done great movies like Mona Lisa, The Crying Game, and In The Company of Wolves.  The only bad film that I can remember is Interview with the Vampire. Now comes In Dreams, which doesn't fit neatly into either classification. As a madder of fact, the film falls right in the middle of good and bad; it isn't a terrible movie, but I strain to recommend it.What Jordan does best is quite clear capturing the state of surrealism of dreams in Annette Bening's head, who plays a woman named Claire Cooper. Claire is an adapter and illustrator of children's stories who has a husband (Aidan Quinn) named Paul and a daughter who is killed early in the story.That is what sets the mood to the story, also, when before hand, Claire has dreams or visions, both asleep and awake, of a small girl being lured into an apple orchard then killed. This vision turned out to be the future fate for her innocent daughter. Soon she has more dreams like then, this time detailing a small boy being drowned in his house in a disturbing scene that also has a lot to do with the plot. You see, many years before this, the town where Claire lives was flooded with billions of gallons of water to create a large lake, after the residents moved out.After all, the plot is obvious already too complicated for its own good, and I am only describing the background to the major plot elements.The rest of the story involves Claire jumping from one situation to another, running from the villain, or to the villain. The actual bad guy is very complicated. He seemingly can control Claire's dreams, make playground swings move by themselves, turn on stereos from a distance, put words on a computer screen, and control sink garbage disposals. How? Why? When? None of these questions are answered, except who, which I will not reveal who this mad man is.The performances describe more of the movie's plot then the script itself. Annette Bening is Un-describable as Claire. She puts the nut in nutcase, and at the same time, we feel sorry for her and know that she is innocent. Robert Downey Jr. is a prime example of something I will mention later, but he does his best. Aidan Quinn, as Paul, is cute and sensitive, and provocative. Stephen Rea can't really amount to much with the material he is given, which is a waste of prime talent.So, why didn't I like In Dreams, well, it may sound weird but, it was way too aggressive. What do I mean? Every single element in this movie is covered in over-the-top, hostile, pervasive context. The murders are drowned in buckets and buckets of grade B gore. The characters are so exaggerant that the audience laughed at Bening while her character was in the nut house. Neil Jordan leaves nothing to the imagination, which leads to lack of involvement.There is much to like about In Dreams, How the plot reveals itself in an intriguing and dark stylish fashioned. The performances, the underwater footage, the dreamlike landscape of supernatural reality, which all unfortunately raped up in tireless content that pushes the audience over the edge. Even then, however, I consider this a close miss.Next time, maybe Neil Jordan will leave more room for composition that will enter the audiences' dreams.

Of course it`s not but just because a film had a cinematic release doesn`t mean it`s going to be good Annete Bening plays Claire Cooper a woman who has visions about the death of a child . I`m not really sure why Claire has these visions and by the end of the film it`s still unexplained as far as I know . There`s also other unexplained things like Claire surviving a terrible car crash and by half way through the movie I was at a loss as to what was going on . I do confess I wasn`t watching IN DREAMS too closely but it`s one of those movies that`s too complicated for its own good so much of the audience will find their minds wondering There is another criticism beside the confusing - Dare I say daft ? - story and that`s the amount of gore used . Director Neil Jordan did at least try to give the movie a dark brooding atmosphere but then he spoiled things by injecting a large infusion of gore . IN DREAMS doesn`t work and it works even less with a high gore content Watch THE GIFT if you`re after a haunting thriller featuring a woman having visions   "}]
