Between dealing with Porky the boys find plenty of time for various sexual acts. Look, you're either a fan of the PORKY'S trilogy or you're not. I personally love the series and grew up watching these movies so they certainly are special to me no matter how silly they are. This third film in the series isn't nearly as good as the first but I thought it was a step up from the good, if flawed, second film. I think what works so well here is that it's just fun seeing the gang back and getting into more trouble. Again, if you're wanting comedy in the style of Charles Chaplin then you're not going to find it here but if you enjoy toilet humor, sex jokes and plenty of nudity then this here really delivers. I thought the story itself was mildly entertaining for a film like this but it was certainly a major plus having Porky back in action. After the events in the first film it's just obvious that he really would want some revenge so this adds another layer of fun. As with the first two, there are all sorts of dirty sex jokes and I thought the majority of them worked. This includes the foreign exchange student, a pool orgy and the highlight of the film a sequence inside a motel room. The performances are pretty much what you'd expect from a film like this but the entire cast fit their roles nicely and deliver a good job. There's no question that the film has some major flaws throughout but fans of the series should find this to be a good way to close things out.

One of the &#x96; admittedly many &#x96; reasons of failure was the absence of the titular redneck character who was more or less profiled as the teen protagonists' arch enemy in the first film. Porky Wallace (glorious role of the late Chuck Mitchell) was a fat and sleazy night club owner from a neighboring county who humiliated and deceived the oversexed high school teenagers and prevented them from getting laid in his club. This led to fantastically comical and vulgar situations, but the first sequel skipped all this in favor of politically correct humor and ethically valuable morals. Well, just like the producers of Halloween found out after the disastrous third installment &#x85; every franchise also partly relies on a solid villainous character. The input of Porky's character in this third and final movie isn't exactly tremendous, but it definitely helps. The jokes and absurd situations are also a lot funnier again (albeit not nearly as funny as in the original) because they all revolve on raging hormones, bizarre sexual fetishes, embarrassing encounters and plain juvenile delinquency! Few weeks before graduating high school (about time, as they all appear to be in their mid-twenties&#x85;), the cheerful posse has the chance of realizing their biggest dream winning the state championship in basketball. They face a big &#x96; literally &#x96; obstacle when it turns out their beloved coach has unsettled debts with Porky, who now owns a luxurious casino boat. The only way out is for the team to lose the finale and have Porky cash in the betting money, but their mind is too strongly set on winning&#x85; This is good old-fashioned and textbook 80's comedy, meaning relaxing and utterly brainless. Ideal stuff to re-watch after all these years and revive the spirit of 80's trash.

I just felt as I was watching PORKY'S REVENGE that the laughs were few and far between although there were attempts to reestablish the raunch that appealed to audiences who loved the first film. I think it would've been more ideal to have this cast in college instead of in their senior year of high school as the stars simply look too old at this point to portray 18 year olds. That said there are some inspired moments here and there such as Pee Wee's flashing the parents attending the graduation ceremony on accident(he was tricked into getting nude underneath his robe by the gang)or when the boys have broken into the apartment of a hot biology teacher trying to find a test exam so that Meat(Tony Ganios)could cheat to pass so he could play in the State Basketball Championship, instead catching her in a bit of sexual rollplaying with another teacher. Nancy Parsons returns as Ms. Balbricker and the gang decide to find her lost love which is kind of a nice way to send her character off as she's often the butt of jokes(her hotel scene with Wyatt Knight's Tommy Turner is a laugh as both were expecting to meet other people, this arranged as a practical joke by the gang, although Pee Wee was the intended target for Balbricker). In this sequel, Porky(Chuck Mitchell)now operates an illegal casino on board a riverboat and has negotiated a deal with the boys regarding throwing the basketball championship so that their coach could be exonerated of the gambling debts he owes. Of course the boys plan to screw Porky and when fatso kidnaps Meat(he supposedly got Porky's ugly daughter pregnant after the two went all the way)during prom night they will have to orchestrate a rescue. The result isn't kind to Porky's boat! Mitchell is as repugnant and bullying as ever, the perfect foil for our high school heroes who once again get the best of him. This film features the big game as Angel Beach's basketball team go on a tear when Meat suddenly passes the test and is allowed to toss around the opposition like rag dolls(the referees seemed to have gone on a lunch break, I guess). A constant gag that I didn't really find all that funny has the principal questioning when Billy(Mark Herrier)is gonna set up a period where they can watch a certain art film(it's pornography and Balbricker told on them to the principal). Kaki Hunter is Tommy's girlfriend, Wendy, but she's essentially one of the guys always hanging out with them. Surprising amount of nudity in this sequel; mostly boobs. While a far cry from the first film, which had me laughing out loud quite a bit, PORKY'S REVENGE does come from a great period in the 80s when filmmakers were willing to go anywhere to get a giggle or make the viewer blush.

Sadly, I was only 9 when the movie came out, so I had to wait.After seeing all three movies a number of times, I have to admit that Porky's Revenge is the best one. The story Set in the late 1950's, a bunch of boys with sex on the brain battle with their nemesis, Porky. Porky is a southern gentleman who runs an illegal casino/brothel situated on a riverboat. The boys have been wanting to make this man's life miserable ever since he embarrassed them in the first movie. So once again, they plot to destroy his operation once and for all.The movie had some great scenes, like the pool party, the sneaking into a teacher's apartment and then seeing her and another faculty member doing S&M, and the basketball scenes. This one's script is a lot better and James Welcome Back, Kotter Komack does some decent direction. It's not very good, but it's watchable enough, I've seen this one about 7 times, including today.One last note Porky's riverboat casino looks like the insides of The Hard Rock Hotel/Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.
