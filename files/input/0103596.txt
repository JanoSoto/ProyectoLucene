I grew up watching the movies along with the rest of the series 3 NINJAS KICK BACK and 3 NINJAS KNUCKLE UP. I'm not trying to sound cheesy or anything. I rather watch the series than watching Teenage Ninja Turtles. I think every generation of young kids would have liked 3 Ninjas if they are really interest in Martial Arts. Sure, the film will probably fade away from our interests as we grow up. But in my own opinion and my experiences, I think 3 Ninjas was one of the excellent film of early 1990s that young viewers would enjoy. Now I'm a teenager and I laugh at the thoughts of how obessed I was with 3 Ninjas but that doesn't mean I shouldn't destroy it existence.

The first of its kind. A unique tale of three brothers who spend a summer learning the art of Ninjuitsu from the grandfather out in the deep, peaceful woods. There they meet their grandfather's nemesis, Snyder. He is introduced a few scenes earlier as an illegal arms-dealer who knows a few techniques himself. Well, like all summers, the brothers' comes to an end. They are back in the big city going to school. Like all trio of brothers, the eldest has a girl-friend, which gives the younger two ammo to pick on him with--Rocky loves Emily! Rocky loves Emily! Well, school yard fights and pre-teen humor combine to form the middle of the film. And, as all martial art films have, this film shares a climatic ending when nemesis Snyder has associate hire 3 goons (coincidence that they are going after 3 brothers?) who have a very Bill & Ted-ish vocabulary. As you can imagine, they get in over their heads taking the trio on...in their own house--big mistake! When the goons fail their mission, Snyder sends in his own men to do the job properly--including a 250lbs-or more Bruno. They drag the 3 boys aboard a harbored frigate...and thats then the martial arts mayhem begins.--Personal note How much did they have to pay Patrick Labyorteaux (Bud from JAG) to be in this? There's also a scene, the boys rummage up their house to defeat the 3 goons--how do they explain the damage to mom and dad...I have an alibi, but I'd like to see the bonus scene where they explain that! I love (despise-love) the climatic sword fight between grampa and Snyder...Ninjas are trained to swing in circles--see also books on Aikido and Ninjuitsu.

It is, undoubtedly, better than many of the martial arts films aimed at children that have been produced (check out tosh like 'Tiger Heart' and 'Double Dragon' for proof!).The film centres on three young brothers-- thirteen-year-old Rocky, twelve-year-old Colt and eight-year-old Tum-tum-- who have been studying martial arts since they were toddlers, under the tutelage of their sensei grandfather. The boys' father, an FBI agent, doesn't approve but he is too pre-occupied with catching bad guys to stop them. Then the boys find themselves at the centre of a kidnapping plot by one of their father's perps Snyder, who incidentally was also trained in martial arts by their grandfather.The film has many unrealistic scenes where the three wee moppets take down hordes of grown men with ease and cue the 'Home Alone' style tricks as the boys rig their house against three would-be teenage kidnappers who have the IQ of toast (one of whom was portrayed by Patrick Labyorteaux, who went on to play Bud in 'JAG'). However, to the film's credit, Snyder was depicted to be genuinely cruel and threatening and the three young actors, especially the elder two, who played the brothers were not as irritating as many child actors can be.This is an enjoyable film for kids, especially those interested in martial arts (it did influence me to take up Tae-Kwon Do as a kid!), or those who watched it as a child themselves. Unfortunately, the two sequels '3 Ninjas Kick Back' and '3 Ninjas Knuckle Up' were much cheesier and less watchable and the fourth film '3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain', filmed much later in 1998 and featuring different kids in the role of the brothers, was just so atrocious that it's better to pretend it doesn't exist.

I had just been done watching the live-action Ninja Turtles movies for the first time, so I also discovered a little VHS called 3 Ninjas. Of course, after seeing TMNT I, II, and III, I just HAD to watch this movie. And I did.As a kid, I just ate this stuff up. I loved these movies to death. I thought they were the best things ever. I never understood why everybody hated it, but I got older, and I realize why many people hate this movie It's too unrealistic. But who cares? Not every movie has to be just like real-life. Of course, the 3 Ninjas formula with kids beating the crap out of adults has grown since the release of this movie, but it has gotten way stupid, to the point where the bad guys are bumbling fools who don't fight back. But you don't see that in this movie. It has a pretty dark tone to it. Snyder, the villain isn't just some stupid fool like with things like this nowadays, he's a pretty menacing villain, so that's something that holds up.Another thing that holds up is the action. I love the fight scenes, but it's too bad that a lot of the violence was cut to secure a 'PG' rating. But it's cool now, since the extended cut has surfaced and for some reason only played on movie channels like Showtime.This movie also has some pretty awesome music. It's a shame that an OST for the film's score was never released.Something I don't like about the hate for this movie is how everyone seems to just call this a rip-off of Home Alone and the first live-action TMNT movie just because of the quote from the Boston Globe on the cover of the VHS and DVD. Look, guys, the Boston Globe panned both Home Alone and TMNT, they're not trying to promote it as a rip-off or anything, so calm down.That's my review. Don't look for Citizen Kane in this movie, and don't pass it off as something on the same level as Dora. Just look at it as entertaining fun.And as for the sequels? Well, Knuckle Up and Kick Back were good. Knuckle Up is my favorite because it's action on overdrive, and it doesn't care what the MPAA thinks, because they got a PG-13 rating and took it. Kick Back brought back the same charm that the original had. But High Noon at Mega Mountain was crap. The plot was too silly, but it's fun to watch and laugh at.

I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.Many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message, this one doesn't have any message at all...it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here.. The short, fat, gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious. The kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was maybe the worst kid actor I have ever seen.The movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review. 3 ninjas...yea you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously... Need I say more. Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone.With all that said KIDS WILL LOVE IT. This movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it. If you don't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see.

However Snyder is also a former partner of Tanaka and uses this relationship to get close to the his foil's three sons. With Snyder planning a large missile sale to the Middle East, he gets associate Brown to use three lackeys to kidnap the children just in case. However, he doesn't reckon on the skills of the kids and the stupidity of his men.Call me a sucker for punishment but after watching two of the later 3 Ninjas films I figured that I should at least get myself some explanation as to why more than one film had been made. I assumed that the first film must have been good enough to be successful and by extension have made enough money to have justified sequels to a fan-base loyal enough to cover the costs regardless of the product. However watching the first film left me all the more mystified because it turns out that this film series was cheap and poor quality from the very start. The plot is the usual stuff where the boy use their skills to help foil some criminal adults, in this case a criminal that their fed father is chasing. It is predictable fare and all it does is produce some Home Alone style fights.If these were funny and exciting then the film would have its salvation but sadly this is far from the case. The fights are poorly put together with simple moves and nothing in the way of imagination about them. The comedy is basic as well, which is a shame because good physical comedy tends to cover a large age range of viewers but here it is nothing more than simple pratfalls. Turteltaud's direction is a matter of stringing together static shots while the use of music to convey danger or, more often, wackiness is just painful. I would lay into the acting of the children but suffice to say that they delver just as much as you would expect. The adults are no better with Wong taking it too serious and McRae and Franco offering nothing. If nothing else at least Kingsley and Swetow have the good taste to be hammy fun.Overall then, few people will be surprised by the quality of this film. It is cheaply done with unimaginative writing and action. The only surprise is that despite this the film managed to churn out some sort of puerile franchise out of these distinctly inauspicious beginning. "},{"Title":"OK, I know this was lame, but come on!

This is just one of those movies-you either like it or you don't. This is not high art, though it tries to be. It's not Bruce Lee either, but then what was he doing at 13 years of age? And yes-all of Victor Wong's Martial arts were doubled by others.Still, this movie has some fine moments-like the Ninja version of Home alone. 3 Guys are hired by Snyder to kidnap the boys-but these guys have no idea what they are getting themselves into(Snyder knows-but neglects to tell them what the boys can do!)These boys are Ninjas-and they know how to kick butt! These guys get more than what they bargain for! LO! They get bruised, scores and food poisoning. One of them gets tied by a rope made of ties(this goes a bit far I admit.)Then the boys are Kidnapped by Snyder's own men and are taken to a ship. This is Snyder's hideout. Inside, they are training Ninjas. The boys Do battle with these guys-and the boys win. But by now Snyder and his men are desperate-they turn Guns on them. Just then, Granpa shows up and reminds the boys of the dummy lesson they learned before he takes them home. They use these skills to knock down the big guy who weighs at least 250 pounds-maybe more. Snyder does battle with Grandpa-watch this movie to find out who wins.I have two Minor Complaints of this filmA. The Character Tum Tum is pathetic. The idea of a child eating Candy all the time and having something hanging from his mouth through out the film is sickening. If you are eating dinner during this movie, you wish you weren't. If this was real life, the kid would be wearing dentures before he turns 30-thank God it's only a movie. They should have given this kid a better character and naming him differently, or taken him out altogether.B. The Scene where these kids are on their way to school on their bikes, they ride over just about anything they can-showing off and showing disrespect for the neighbors. I thought kids learn respect for others through martial arts?My favorite Character is Rocky. He has the best moves in this movie.Bottom Line? You can either like or hate this movie. For me at least, I come in between. It's an OK movie-but I know that, with a better script combined with the talents of these kids-it could be a whole lot better.On a Scale of 10-I give it a 5.

After I saw this film, all other GREAT films were dwarfed drastically in comparison.  I mean, how often do you come up with a character as great as Tum-Tum? That kid was eating ALL the TIME!  His grandpa tried to stop him, but he couldn't because he's Tum-Tum.  And all the other kids had dumb names that I can't even bother to remember.  Plus those surfer dudes that tried to kick the crap out of those kids, but ended up getting the crap kicked outta them, they were super-cool! I especially loved the part where the three ninjas went into their kitchen and got all MacGyver and sh*t and made some awesome pepper bombs and threw it at the surfers which blew the surfers' minds.  And then that one guy got diarrhea, and the other guys were getting CDs thrown at them like ninja stars, and there was so much cool stuff in this movie, it would take me forever to recount it all.  But the best part all in all was when the old Chinese grandpa got in his ninja outfit and went to the tanker to go kick some butt.My only complaint was the fact that the kids bore no resemblance to their obviously Asian-American grandfather.  I mean, I like Chinese people just as much as the next person, but really do you expect me to believe that this guy is blood-related to three Caucasian pre-teen children?  I don't think so!  So, do yourself a favor, and watch this movie!  Bonzai!!

In 1992 Touchstone Pictures was ready to jump on the bandwagon with a film that's sort of a cross between 'Home Alone' and 'Surf Ninjas,' two other childhood favorites. The result was a blast and a film that has not been forgotten.Pros A neat concept. Good performances from both the young and adult cast members. Fast paced all the way through. Mostly juvenile, but amusing humor and gags. A cool music score. Some fun, fairly well choreographed fight scenes. Unlike other films of this type, this one isn't too violent for the youngsters. It's nice to see kids doing the butt-kicking for a change...just don't try this stuff at home kids.Cons Little here that hasn't already been done before. Aside from a few decent shots the direction is pretty bland.Final thoughts It's movies like this that made childhood sweet. I enjoyed it very much at the time and still do now that I'm in my 20s.

The cast and crew involved in this film were concerned about two things that the children who saw this movie had a great time watching it (and probably holding it as their theme for make believe afterwords), and that their guardians (parents, whatever) had an enjoyable experience with them. They succeeded. From watching this movie as a child, I fell in love with it. It gave me and my friends a great starting point for our imaginations to take flight. Watching it now (fourteen years later) there is still a very high appeal to this movie. With sentimentality aside, it's very easy to watch this movie and appreciate it for what it is, which, I'm sure, is exactly what it was meant to be. It's so easy for anyone to laugh at the simple (yet clever, on the director's part) humor of the three kidnappers with their appeal to children because they are so dumb, and to adults because they are so dumb. However, this stupid humor is used so skillfully that, no matter what age you are, you have to laugh. It's easy to feel sentimental with the incredibly strong bond between the very believable bond between the brothers, their parents, the grandfather and how far your family will go to protect you, which is the very heart of the movie. This brings me to my point though this is (and meant to be) a fun movie, it has an inspiring amount of heart and thought. If you've never seen this movie before, just have fun with it. If you're watching it again, look at how much is really going on. This movie contains a surprising amount of subtlety (especially with the material that is generally recognized by a seasoned audience), humor, and most importantly, heart, that will rarely make you feel like watching this movie is a chore.

I loved it!","Date":"27 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Family","Review":" First of all, KID POWER! This is a fun-filled, kid-friendly movie about three brothers who have spent their summers practicing martial arts at their grandfather's house. Now this movie was made around the time there was a huge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles craze going on so that explains the subject matter ninjas. An arms dealer named Snyder, who was once the boys' grandfather's student has the children kidnapped in order to keep their father, who is an FBI agent, from messing up a deal that he needs to make on the black market. The kidnappers, which were three complete morons with long hair and seemed like they'd smoked a little too much of the stuff during their lifetime, who were originally hired to abduct the boys were absolutely hilarious. The boys have to use their smarts and martial arts to defeat them, which isn't too hard. I found it very interesting how the martial arts in this movie were much more realistic and entertaining than almost every extravagant, big-budget film I've ever seen. Anticipating the failure of the kidnappers, back-up is sent to the home and the boys are eventually abducted by the criminal's henchmen and carried off to his lair. I won't spoil the rest for you! You have to watch the movie to see how it ends! The youngest of the boys, Tum Tum offered an endless supply of laughs and was so adorable that I could cry. Colt, the middle brother, was the sarcastic one. And Rocky, the eldest, was the level-headed hero type. I laughed! I cried. I loved it!

Always has something in his mouth.            The boys' father, Samuel Sr., is an FBI Agent, tracking down super criminal Hugo Snyder. Snyder and Mori used to be partners a long time ago, but Snyder was the evil one. Snyder plans to have Samuel'skids kidnapped, so he hires three outside guys Fester, Marcus and Hammer. Three bumbling surfers.            The boys prove to be masters at basketball and even show their three captors the error of their ways in a very funny scene! But then, unfortunately, they are kidnapped.          Colt has lost confidence in Grandpa, until he comes to their rescue. He takes on Snyder one on one. It was a close call, but Snyder is defeated and our story has a happy ending.         This movie is pretty funny. I like the scene where Fester,Marcus and Hammer break into the boys' homes.

It is a pity Michael Treanor decided to give up his position as Rocky because Slade and Treanor worked well together. Of the trilogy (I refuse to consider High Noon at Mega Mountain part of the 3 Ninjas because that is truly a horrible piece of work) the last one was the best with by far some of the greatest ninjas moves I've seen ten year olds do but this one was great as well. It's a movie aimed for kids but can be a great relaxer movie for teens and adults. It's got the hilarious one liners and the cutesy kids stuff that for some reason never fails to make you smile. Of course the biggest part of this is the ninja moves and while the idea that three kids could take on an entire army of highly trained ninjas is mind boggling these things have always been possible in Hollywood, there are tons of movies out there where the good guys seem invincible.

It's probably a little shocking, to say the least, that he passed away the day after those planes crashed into the World Trade Center buildings and brought them crashing down (although the circumstances of the buildings' collapse are still somewhat sketchy). But anyway, the anniversary of his passing brings to mind his entire career, including 3 Ninjas. This is mostly just one of those movies that they cranked out in the '80s and early '90s about a bunch of cool kids clobbering dumb adults. Nothing really creative. It seems funny the first time that you see it, but not afterwards. The youngest brother even has the same name as the actor who won an Oscar for playing Gordon Gekko in Wall Street! So, most people will probably compare this movie to Home Alone, but I don't care too much for that movie either. There are plenty of better movies that you can find.

Such a film like this can be the break an adult may not know they need from all the adult fare that is little more than blood and guts and the results of the hard knocks of life. Just don't forget 3 Ninjas is for kids and start missing the physical interactions of adult films and the stronger language and many hours you may find yourself relaxed in sharing with your kids and having them appropriately entertained and perhaps a bit instructed.
