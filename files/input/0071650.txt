[{"Title":"Probably the Greatest Exploitation Film Ever","Date":"1 May 2005","Score":"66 out of 73 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":" First off, understand my rating of Ilsa. Ilsa by general movie standards is not a good movie. If you were to put it up against any of the so called classic movies, it would not stand up. But those who search out Ilsa She Wolf of THe SS or any of the others in the series aren't doing so because they want to see a tense, well acted, well directed movie. Ilsa is first and foremost an exploitation film and, realizing that, I have to say it is in the upper echelons of its field because it wallows in filth and does so unapologetically. It boils down to this. If you search out a Euro Trash film, be it an Italian Giallo or English 70's horror, you desire it to be as sleazy and un politically correct as possible but also you want the movie to have some semblance of a plot, be it ever tiny. Ilsa scores big on all these points. There is wall to wall nudity, all female. Gratitutious torture scenes that are more ridiculous than offensive, (I mean every time Ilsa drags a prisoner down for torture they are completely naked as they are being tortured). And all most everyone of the female cast members at some point is completely naked. Let's be honest, It ain't Shakespeare, nor does it pretend to be. Of note is the lead actress Dyanne Thorne. Apparently Ms. Thorne had lofty ambitions of being a serious actress at one point in her career but the fickle finger of fate lead her to Ilsa fame. In her mid 40's, Ms. Thorne is competent enough not to look like an amateur on screen. She has a several nude scenes throughout the movie and anyone who watches Ilsa will no doubt remember her more for her large breasts than her acting ability. Ilsa She Wolf of the SS is a noteworthy entry into the world of exploitation films and should be the starting point for anyone who journeys into this genre. I rate it as a 10 because it knows what it is and does not pretend to try for anything higher "},{"Title":"There Goes My Appetite...for the next 3 years.","Date":"21 November 2000","Score":"42 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":"  I first rented this sick flick in the 80's, and the guy at the video store who recommended it (knowing I was into shock/exploitation movies) told me he'd give me my money back if I wasn't completely offended. Guess who didn't get their money back? . I finally found a copy of the uncut version I first saw--hard to find, unless you have a DVD player-- and yep, it still shocked me just as much. It may have shocked me even more, because I kept thinking, No WAY could they put a movie like this out today! I've actually seen all of the Ilsa series and each time I watch one, I think this is probably the sickest. Then I realize they are all really sick, just in different nasty ways.  The first time I watched this, even though I wasn't watching it with anyone else, I felt guilty for not turning it off and returning it to the video store, it was so sick.  People have said the violence and acting are unrealistic, but there were parts where I had to remind myself this was a movie (though it was supposedly based on real Nazi experiments...let's not dwell on that) and the women screaming in agony at the top of their lungs were just actresses. There's a few unrealistic scenes- for instance, a woman being boiled to the point where her skin seems to have come off looks almost fine a scene later. Most of it looks a little too real for me-enough so I was feeling sick to my stomach by the big dinner scene, and I didn't even watch it all at once.First of all, anyone who didn't think this movie was violent or gory, you definitely have seen a cut version. Anyone who thought it was boring or tame obviously didn't see the version I saw with the woman being boiled alive onscreen or the patients with huge, open gaping wounds that had been deliberately infected. As another reviewer said, if you see the right version (or the wrong one, depending on your point of view) there are not 5 minutes that go by without some sort of sex, nudity, violence, or all 3 at the same time. If I ever heard anyone describe this movie as 'sexy', I would get away from them as quickly as possible. In this debut of the Ilsa (Ilsa herself pronounces it as Ill-za) series, Dyanne Thorne plays the title role, an extremely sadistic commander of a concentration camp where they perform 'medical research'.  The men usually only get castrated (after sleeping with Ilsa and not 'satisfying' her) or beaten. The women have the bad luck to be in a camp where Ilsa is trying to prove her theory that women are naturally stronger and can take more pain than men. Some are taken away to the 'brothel' area, which is no picnic either (one of the scenes that actually made me lose my appetite showed a prisoner after the men are through with her- not a pretty sight) but the *really* unlucky ones are taken to the 'medical' area. One woman makes the huge mistake of not only telling Ilsa she can take whatever she dishes out (Rule #1 in an Ilsa movie-never taunt her with her tough you are) but giving her attitude and talking back (Rule #2, do NOT give Ilsa attitude or talk back, you will probably receive the most disgusting fate of any character in the entire movie) and Ilsa decides to make an example of her, resulting in some of the nastiest, hardest to watch scenes in the movie.  I can't describe them in detail or this review probably wouldn't be posted. Ilsa picks one American man, Wolf to sleep with her, a so called 'genetic freak' who can satisfy Ilsa, so he gets to keep all his, uh, equipment for the time being. Of course, he has an escape plan...he also provides most of the unintentional comic relief in the movie, as his acting is so amazingly bad, even for an exploitation movie, that he sounds like he is reading from cue cards, a few words at a time I-will-make...love-to-you-like...you-have-never-been....made-love-to-before.As a sidebar, I'd sure like to read Dyanne Thorne's autobiography, if she ever puts one out. Several times during the movie, I wondered if the actress ever told anyone how she was making a living in detail at the time. Well, today I get paid to go dress up in complete Nazi regalia and pretend to pee on another higher ranking Nazi. Then, after lunch.... She hams it up as Ilsa, and was, let's face it, pretty brave to do this movie.A warning to others who might consider renting this because they hear it's campy and fun- don't rent it for that reason unless you have a really sick sense of humor or a real &*%$ed up idea of fun. Some co-workers of mine unwisely didn't listen to any warnings from people who have watched the entire movie and went to see a midnight screening thinking they were going to see some kind of bad-in-an-Ed-Wood-way B-movie.  They made it through maybe 15 minutes tops before walking out in total revulsion. It's not the kind of movie you want to watch over and over because it's so fun. I watch it every once in a while to see if I'm still as easily shocked as I was a few years ago. So far, I am.  Why do I own it, if it's so horrible? I guess I have no excuse for that, other than to show it to people who think they've seen it all. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't, until you see the first 3 Ilsa movies.

Short version Ilsa is the head bitch at a Nazi experimentation camp. She gets her kicks by torturing the male and female prisoners in all kinds of interesting ways. Overall, SHE WOLF is pretty tame in the gore department, compared to what is out there today. I'm sure if you saw this when it first came out in '75, it was probably some really racy stuff...but being from a generation raised on blood-and-guts, the Ilsa films are more laughable than shocking. I prefer SHE WOLF and the under-rated TIGRESS OF SIBERIA installments over HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS and WICKED WARDEN (those two having more of a sleazy sex overtone, and being very light on the red stuff...) but all are worth a look just to say that you've seen them. Anchor Bay has put out a beautiful box-set that contains SHE WOLF, HAREM KEEPER, and WICKED WARDEN, and if you check the right on-line dealers, you can find it for dirt-cheap. Makes a great collection piece. To my knowledge, TIGRESS OF SIBERIA is not available on DVD at this time (at least not in the States...) which is a shame, because although many other reviewers trash it, I really liked that film. Anyway, if you are an exploit fan these films should already be in your collection. If you are interested in checking out this type of material, these films are as good a start as any. Not for the average movie-goer, but not as over-the-top as they could be nowdays. recommended - 8/10 for Dyanne Thorne's big-ass Nazi titties!!!

Fortunately for ILSA I think the movie lives up to it's hype, even if it is a bit dated, and at times heavy on the cheese.Ilsa, played by the well-endowed Thorne, is a sadistic mother, in charge of Medical Camp 9 who spends her days performing many torturous experiments on female and male prisoners alike.  They either disobeyed orders, talked back, or didn't pleasure her right (the men) - One man is castrated because Ilsa didn't reach heights of orgasm that she would've liked (???).  Anyway, the film continues by showing scenes of torture, after torture, after torture....It goes on like this for much of the film.   When characters aren't being brutally whipped, boiled, decompressurized, or mutilated in various forms, Ilsa is seen showing off her enormous breasts (many times I might add). Pacing is really hurt during these scenes, especially when a lot of needless talking comes into play.  Really, these scenes just become downright dull and boring.However, the ending was fairly exciting and violent.  The gore and make-up is pretty good; that literally half-dead woman was made up quite well. She certainly was a freakish sight that's for sure.NOT GOOD by any means, but if you wanna see something that'll really push the limit....

Although it is thoroughly cheesy, poorly acted, routinely directed, and extremely camp at times, the film still packs a punch due to its ability to offend and disgust at every turn; the depiction of Nazi atrocities in the name of entertainment is hard to defend (so I'm not even going to try) and this movie pulls no punches with its well executed graphic violence and horrific torture scenes.Ilsa, played with gusto by chesty blonde Dianne Thorne, is the Kommandant at a concentration camp where she oversees medical research performed on the female prisoners. Meanwhile, she uses the males to try and satisfy her sexual needs (and when they fail, she has them castrated!). It is up to German/American stud Wolfe to lead the prisoners in a revolt against the guards whilst simultaneously gaining Ilsa's trust by rogering her senseless at every opportunity.This notorious sleaze classic packs so much depravity into its 96 minutes running time (uncut), that lovers of exploitation will have a field day. From the opening scene in which Ilsa's sex slave is dragged back to the camp to be emasculated, to the ending in which the prisoners exact bloody retribution, sex and violence pervades every frame. The effective make-up FX by Joe Blasco are repugnant enough for hardened gore-hounds and fans of the female form will be delighted by the copious amounts of nudity (nearly every woman gets naked at some point in the film!). And lets not forget the scene in which Ilsa pees on the Nazi general...Thirty years after it was made, Ilsa still has the ability to shock&#151;the mark of a true exploitation classic!

Even though this movie is pure, unadulterated carnage and heinous acts throughout the entire course of the film, it had a redeeming quality.It's hard to pinpoint what made this movie so appealing to me. It was a perfect emblem of the pure sleaziness and overall decadent atmosphere of the 70's smut prevalent at this time. Like all grindhouse films, it appeals to the baser senses - filled with excess violence (grizzly and well-done) and sex. And it's shot amazingly well for such a poor film. I expected it to be grainy and imperceptible.There's an element of immorality felt when watching films like this, but it's a healthy outlet to sublimate impure thoughts. It's sensationalist, yes. Probably no artistic merit either. But it's an appetizer of the 70's Perversia. I do think it's mostly meant to be titillating and gross for the sake of being gross.

Cue lots of gratuitous nudity, castration, strangulation, boiling alive, magnificent pre-implant breasts, softcore sex and gang rape, golden showers, and general bloody mayhem. The German accents are hilarious, and the acting barely one step up from Hershael Gordon Lewis and early John Waters. It even has the ubiquitous 'moral message' at the beginning. But unlike so many of these movies, 'Ilsa' manages to avoid descending into tedious repetition half way through, and builds to a brilliantly ludicrous climax in which an entire camp is gunned down by machine gun fire, without a drop of blood being spilt.

After reading how people had reacted to it back in 1974, I had to see it. Well, it was pretty horrible in my opinion. Not shocking or gory, just silly and maybe a little creepy.The Ilsa series fits into this category. I had read that the series was shocking, and had to check out what all the fuss was.I watched the Ilsa trilogy last night, and while I can see some of the hype about these films was true, yet again I found myself looking for more.Ilsa She Wolf of the SS features Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa, the warden st Medical Camp # 9. The camp is used to conduct medical research that is to aid the SS during WW2. Women prisoners are injected with viruses, tortured with electroshock and whipped to test their tolerance for pain. Ilsa also conducts private research, more or less for pleasure purposes.Some of the violence is a little graphic. We see a fair bit of blood, and in one instance, they are performing surgery on a prisoner's vagina. Maggots are injected with a virus and allowed to eat away at a prisoner's flesh. One of the female prisoners is left a bloody mess after 3 days of torture. In others it is left to your imagination, such as the castration of a male prisoner and the use of an electrified dildo on the female inmates. During a dinner scene, another female prisoner is hanging from a noose and bound at the hands and feet with only a block of ice supporting her.As for nudity, there is also plenty of that. The prisoners are routinely shown without clothes, and the lovely Miss Thorne also has a fair share of topless shots.Having said all that, I still felt that it was not quite as shocking as I had anticipated. Not that it is ever pleasant to see people being tortured and raped. With the reputation this film had I guess I expected it to be much worse.It's a sad statement on today's society when one reacts so calmly to such a movie. To me, I think some of the shock value may have come from the setting and the storyline. A Nazi prison camp, set during WW2. That certainly does bring up all sorts of disturbing and horrifying images.All in all, while a little less shocking than I was planning for, this was a pretty good film. Anchor Bay did a wonderful job restoring the movie, and put together a nice package along with Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks and The Wicked Warden.Also check out the audio commentary with Thorne, director Don Edmunds and producer David Freidman. Despite the flack that this movie has received, none of the principal people involved seem to have any regrets. (Despite this, Freidman, along with a lot of the other actors used pseudonyms. Freidman claimed it was as a result of a dispute with the Canadian financiers. Thorne is on record as saying the she has indeed suffered a little career-wise after using her real name on the Ilsa films).Rating 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Damaged Film, Damaged Viewers","Date":"1 June 2004","Score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":"  Spoilers herein.Movies touch life in fewer and more unexpected places than you think.

Sure it is cheesy. Sure it is exaggerated from fact and overly theatrical. Sure, it  uses shortcuts visible breasts are substituted for sex; grimaces for anguish; accents for  culture.Why I recommend it is because it makes the viewer feel superior in just the way it tacitly  deplores. The fulcrum is the merger of the American POW icon. American film audiences  needed this in various war pictures to help them decide who they were. It culminated in the  Steve McQueen character among Brits and Krauts in `Great Escape' which has since become a  stereotype. Here it is slightly adjusted as sexual prowess. Not such a big change.You should really see this paired with `Auto Focus' which is a similar take with similar real  life touchstones, including `Hogan's Heros.'

This provides an excuse for torture with electric didoes, medically-induced syphilis, worms in open wounds, scalding, whipping, gang-rape, etc. More frightening than the savagely itself is the fact that somebody actually took some pains with this picture.

Joe Belasco executed the gory make-ups. Uschi Digard is the naked victim in the compression chamber. Wolfgang Roehm (known in other pictures as William Roehm and Richard Kennedy) appears as a general who even disgusts Ilsa. Some video releases of this charmer toned down the more graphic torture scenes--such as one captive's toes being removed with tin snips in tight, loving close-up. Now, SHE WOLF is available on DVD in its uncensored glory. Producer Herman Traeger, by the way, is really the infamous David F. Friedman.

This is no Hogan's Heroes, and don't expect any comic relief. Any attempt at joke making is in itself a brutality. This movie is not for kids or for the squeamish. While there are plenty of good looking nude scenes these scenes are overshadowed by the horror that is an everyday occurrence under Commandant Doctor Ilsa's command. This movie delivers. There are no pulled punches. Other movies that have tried to appear realistic in dealing with similar subject matter have either been too much like a documentary or have fallen way short of the mark (or marks) that Ilsa leaves in terms of ghastly entertainment.

Probably the nastiest, crudest, most brutal, tasteless, sleaziest movie ever made. But, oh yeah, it is entertaining as well. (Well, to some people.) Based on actual historical recordings of Nazi atrocities during WW2 but combined with some totally outrageous exploitation movie elements, this movie tells the story of Ilsa, who runs a Nazi war camp as a means of satisfying her crazed pseudo-sexual desires. She tortures male and female prisoners alike (usually in the nude) and potential viewers must be warned that the juxtaposition of nudity and violence can be *very* jarring. You simply cannot imagine anyone making a movie like this today... much less having it shown in actual movie theatres... and DRIVE-INS! Nonetheless, the movie was a big independent hit in the '70s and the character of Ilsa has become famous the world over (spawning several sequels). Considering that this was a super low budget movie made in only NINE DAYS, it is amazing that the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and action is as good as it is. The elaborate action finale was shot in one day and it puts a lot of higher-budget action movies to shame.

It was based on real characters from the Nazi regime but once they started shooting they realized that a flick having extreme torture can't be funny especially when it all happened for real (it was based on Ilse Koch who made lampshades from human skin). Once the effects came on and a first rough cut was shown people ran out of the theatre. Before they knew it a new genre was born, sexploitation.If you watch it nowadays it's rather cheesy sometimes but do realize made in 1975 it came out before the nasty slashers and almost 10 years before the Video Nasty era. People were indeed shocked by watching it. The effects were done by Joe Blasco and he just came out of the effects for The Addams Family series. I must say that some effects (those on faces) didn't stand the time but if you are not into horror and surely not into exploitation then some scene's still can be shocking. It's also Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa that takes this flick to another level. She gives a good performance . It's funny to see almost all girls full frontal but Dyanne never did, she only revealed her juggs. Nowadays she has a private wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Ilsa still stands up against a lot of Italian rip-offs who were mostly based on the sex in stead of the horror. Still, back then for a few years the Nazi exploitation was the next big thing but it ruined itself due the sex taking over the gore or effects. Even Ilsa spawned 2 other flicks and one that was made by Jess Franco and normally is called Greta Haus Ohne Manner (1977) but having Dyanne in it it soon was renamed Ilsa The Wicked Warden.Don't watch it for the acting and surely not for the outbreak which do look funny but for the idea of the makers and for the horror of the story itself.Gore 2/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5 "}{"Title":"Bob Crane's private version of Hogan's Heroes","Date":"3 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":" If you like big boobs and Hogan's Heroes, you have just found the mother-lode.

NOT!","Date":"30 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":" ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS (1975) is doubtlessly one of the most notorious Exploitation movies of all-time, and for good reasons. There is no doubt that the film is sick and sadistic, and it is understandable that many find it to be despicable. Yet it is also undeniable that this is classic Exploitation stuff and that every hardcore lover of cult-cinema (such as yours truly) kinda has to see it. Along with Tinto Bras' SALON KITTY (1976), director Don Edmonds' film which was produced by the prolific David F. Friedman (who also produced Hershell Gordon Lewis' early gore films) spawned the Nazisploitation (or Nazi-Exploitation) sub-genre (which practically is a sub-sub-genre of the WIP or Women In Prison movie). These films, mostly from the otherwise best Exploitation country Italy, usually managed to be extremely sleazy and brutal, yet very boring at the same time. ILSA is the undisputed classic of the Nazisploitation genre, and certainly the most memorable film of its kind. Whether that is a recommendation lies in the eye of the beholder. While ILSA (and all the other Nazisploitation films) are strongly against the Nazis who are entirely portrayed as evil, it also trivializes this very sensitive topic, which is of course even more questionable since way more Holocaust-survivors were still alive in the 70s. (Then again, the producer's name is Friedman, and I recently saw a documentary about the popularity of Nazi-porno novels in 70s Israel, so who am I to judge...)The eponymous sadistic female Nazi-villain Ilsa (played by the huge-breasted blonde Dyanne Thorne) is the commander of a Nazi experiment camp. In order to prove that females are better soldiers than men, she conducts gruesome experiments on the female prisoners. She also has sex with the male prisoners, whom she castrates after being disappointed in the can. This changes when the super-potent American prisoner Wolfe is brought to the camp and satisfies her non-stop...Apart from the idea of Nazi-exploitation as such being questionable, ILSA also has a somewhat anti-feminist message Even the man-eating villainous bitch gets tamed when she is properly getting... err... satisfied. The film is incredibly perverted and gruesome, and while the violence is often exaggerated to a ridiculous point and hard to be taken seriously it is yet very disturbing. The female cast members, most of which are naked for the majority of their screen time, are beautiful, but the setting and sadistic violence makes that impossible to enjoy. Without getting into detail, I can say that there are plenty of notoriously gruesome sequences, some of them hard to look at even for experienced exploitation fans, others more ridiculous than truly disturbing.Interestingly, this is a German-American co-production, even though the film was banned in Germany (probably both for the violence and the controversial Nazi-topic). Apart from the countless rip-offs, the movie also spawned two sequels, ILSA HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS (1976) and ILSA THE TIGRESS OF SIBERIA (1977), as well as the unofficial sort-of-sequel GRETA HAUS OHNE MÄNNER (aka. ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN, 1977) by the Spanish Exploitation deity Jess Franco.In a nutshell, ILSA is highly questionable and I can understand everybody who finds it despicable to make such a trashy movie about such a sensitive topic. However, it is a must-see for my fellow Exploitation fans (even though nowhere near as essential as other super-notorious classics such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or MARK OF THE DEVIL in my opinion). Definitely not for the easily offended.

It follows the travails of an American soldier sent to a Nazi medical camp run by Ilsa, who is obsessed with proving women's superior capacity to handle pain so that she can go to the front lines.Ilsa represents Nazispoitation at its finest. Throwing the history book out the window, the film gives us a Nazi concentration camp populated by topless female guards and open lesbians. Just for fun, it adds gory experiments which all seem to require attractive nude women. Is it tasteless? Lords yes! But it's also fun.What takes this a notch above other exploitation films is that genuine talent was involved. Ilsa has quality cinematography and surprisingly good special effects.

When American prisoner Wolfe, (Gregory Knoph) arrives at the camp, she takes an instant appeal to him as he manages to please her the way the other prisoners have. Taking an interest in prisoners Anna, (Maria Marx) and Kata, (Nicolle Riddell) to determine whether or not women have a higher threshold for pain than men, she begins to torture them constantly while using him for her own sexual gratification. Finally getting fed up with the living conditions, they decide to make a break for escape with the prisoners still being held at the camp in a way to get away from the sadistic owner.The News This is one of the greatest entries in the exploitation genre. This is mostly due to the film's incredibly ability to really use it's exploitation leanings to provide some genuine and excessive sequences. These are mostly from the gruesome torture scenes, including toes being mangled with pliers, an exceptionally bloody double flogging with the fully naked, blood streaked bodies later hung up, a blood-spewing pressure chamber experiment, skin peeling from immersion in boiling water and a maggot infested wound. We also have a very effective blood pumping cut throat and some of the make-up on the disease ridden women, especially the one whose face has been infected with syphilis and which gets more and more rotten as the film goes on and is suitably revolting. Many of the torture scenes are incredibly brutal and manage to get a little unnerving after a while. There's also the grotesque and sickening sight of a barely living, torture ravaged, cruelly mutilated naked woman lying on a trolley, lying completely out in the open showing off every single wound from the experiments, producing a creepy feel. Away from the gore the film, also delivers a few choice moments of exploitative cruelty including an electrified dildo run through the crotch to generate an electronic stimulation and the sequence where a naked woman with a noose around her neck is supported on a block of ice, on a dinner table, which slowly melts away as the Nazi's dine around her. Female nudity is really rampant, not just in the nude inspections of the prisoners and the sex scenes but also during almost all of the experiment and torture sequences. Sparing the victims nothing, their fully nude bodies are continuously on display and generally as much pubic hair, especially blood-soaked pubic hair, as time allows for is splashed across the screen. Thorne gives her all in her sex scenes with much moaning and bucking, but there's also a couple of non-Thorne sequences, including a brief, ever-essential lesbian tryst, where more breasts are on display. That the film in fact opens to a naked Ilsa riding a male prisoner, then showering down and finally partaking in a spot of bloody castration on her hasty sex slave, only goes to reinforce the fact that there's very little that won't be allowed in here, and the film is all the better for it. The general setting of the film, with the very effective sets and furnishings, as the torture chambers are nicely dank and dungeon-like with strategic portraits of Himmler and Hitler on the walls, the Nazi's dining room is splashed-out in very decadent opulence and the whole thing feels very over-the-top and grand, considering the location, to the very fact that it takes place in a concentration camp where hideous experiments, including deliberate infection by all known diseases, are carried out on the prisoners, scream exploitation-made material here. Perhaps the best element here is that the lead, Dyanne Thorne, here looks absolutely perfect for the kind of film. Statuesque, sexy and oh-so-perfectly form, she dominates the movie and literally makes it a far more satisfying experience than it would otherwise have been and is able to ridicule the men and make the women cower. Willing to disrobe whenever the film needs it, she makes her a sexually strong, and yet also sexually complex, character. Ilsa screws the prisoners in the hope of gratification, but punishes them for screwing her as they are inferior to her. Once they have lain with her they must be silenced and punished for doing so. And yet, despite the sadism she shows to her victims, is also very much a subordinate and a masochist when it comes to her own sexual satisfaction. Thorne does bring an extra level to her character's make-up than is the norm in such films. This one also manages some mostly successful action scenes with a few explosions and even an armored car making an appearance during the fun finale, resulting in some really great action scenes. There's just a minor, minor flaw to this. The fun finale has a really big flaw to get over. There's some very clumsy slow motion and the odd very strange gunshot sound, stand out as poor in the sequence. Mainly since it's done during the gunfight is where it really stands out, but it's still a really annoying problem to it. Other than this little flaw, there wasn't a whole lot to dislike to this.The Final Verdict Without much to stand in the way of pure trash glory, this one here is one of the best and most entertaining examples of the genre.

Though no doubt disturbing to anyone watching expecting mere campy silliness, or anyone with taste, this is pretty mild compared to many other 70's sleaze pictures. Sure there's plenty of exploitative nudity and a few scenes of grisly gore, with quite good, if cheap effects from Joe Blasco, but this really doesn't have anything too shocking going for it beyond the premise and general atmosphere of degradation. The film is even a little lumbering in places, with some potentially real nasty things done off camera and a general feeling of slight idiocy, caused mainly by the banal script and the obvious fact that there isn't all that much talent in this one. I did find Dyanne Thornes performance as Ilsa highly entertaining, mostly because although she gives it her all, she seemed to have too likable a screen presence to ever be convincingly frightening. I found her generally about as menacing as an German accented aerobics instructor, but very watchable. It probably helps that in general I like older women in my sleaze films, especially if they're as buxom and enthusiastic as Dyanne Thorne, I believe forty something when this was made. Veteran George Buck Flowers is in this too and is decent enough if unintentionally amusing at times. The rest of the acting is pretty inane but gets the job done OK. This truly cannot be described as a good film and even in its uncut version it doesn't really live up to its hype, apart from in the tastelessness stakes and even then, from what I've read there are nastier entries in this genre. It mostly stands as a testament to the times when anything could be filmed, when grindhouse cinema was in its prime and directors didn't care about taste, or peoples feelings. One could describe this as reprehensible stuff, but to call it reprehensible would be to take a serious stance on it, which is impossible given that this is about as easy to take seriously as a Herschell Gordon Lewis film. In the end, this is a film for a niche audience who can suspend their taste and moral judgement and they, as I did, will likely get a bit of a kick out of it. P.S. Dyanne Thorne is now an ordained minister who apparently perfoms outdoor scenic weddings for people who prefer open air to churches. When watching this I every so often reminded myself of that fact. I recommend you do too.

Although the film is filled with bad acting and plenty of camp, it also has plenty of sadistic gore and torture, soft-core sex and copious female nudity.Plot-wise, Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS is fairly standard (and simple) exploitation stuff. Ilsa (big-chested Dyanne Thorne) is in charge of a Nazi Concentration Camp which conducts medial experiments. Her goal is to prove that women can take more pain than men, so they should be allowed to fight on the front lines. Alongside this, Ilsa also likes to sleep with the male prisoners and if they do not pleasure her, she takes their manhood away.This story sets up many scenes of depravity which would still shock today. In particular, genitalia seem to be the main target and numerous scenes focus on destroying male and female body parts in many disgusting ways. I will not go into detail but I will warn anyone who is thinking of seeing this but has a weak stomach to stay far away. Not only is the film violent, but there is a disturbing rape scene. However, Dyanne Thorne's ever-present breasts are a welcome presence amidst all the horrible events. Thorne bares them constantly throughout along with almost every other actress.In terms of acting and all the technical stuff, the film is lacking. Nevertheless, it IS an exploitation film so that stuff can be slightly forgiven. Why I give this such a high rating I do not know.

Dyanne Thorne, a statuesque beauty who uses her voluptuous charms to seduce and destroy her helpless victims, in a manner both Sadean and erotic.But the movie's sexual candor is offset by a series of tortures and medical experiments - courtesy of Joe Blasco's revolting makeup effects - rooted in appalling historical fact For instance, the wound in a young girls' leg is deliberately infected with gangrene, and another unfortunate victim is forced to stand naked on a quick-melting block of ice with a noose tightening around her throat while SS officers dine in front of her. Reckless bravado or depraved opportunism? YOU be the judge...Edmonds was clearly unable to get all the coverage he needed to tighten long-winded dialogue sequences (some scenes drag as a consequence), but while production values are sparse, the film is designed and photographed with consummate skill, and the climactic showdown between Ilsa and her former inmates closes proceedings on a note of genuine horror. You have been warned! Thorne featured in two legitimate sequels, ILSA HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS (1975) and ILSA TIGRESS OF SIBERIA (1978), along with Jesùs Franco's tawdry cash-in GRETA THE WICKED WARDEN (1977).

Not only is there all lot of blood and violence, the movie also contains lots of nudity and rape sequences, in which both males and females are the victims and they are not only being raped by males this time. After all, this is a movie about Ilsa, she wolf of the SS. A dominant female doctor who conducts all horrible kind of tests on her female prisoners in a camp, in order to prove her own developed theory that women are better at handling pain than the male species. The male prisoners at the camp serve a whole different purpose for her; to please her in bed and when she isn't pleased with the result, you'll never get out being the same man again.This is basically what the entire movie is about. Rape and torture. The movie is porn for sadist, without of course truly convincing as being a very credible movie. It all above all really remains a big fat B-movie, that often is ridicules but more often still truly disgusting. It doesn't alway convince visually but the ideas and set up of some sequences are already enough to be provocative.It's not hard to see why this movie has grown out in to becoming a cult classic. The title of the movie alone is already good enough to make this an instant cult classic of course. It hove doesn't mean that the movie is also good enough, even for within its genre, to truly impressive and call this a must-see cult classic.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Exploitation 101 (required viewing)","Date":"23 October 2003","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":" This infamous exploitation flick about well-endowed sadistic Nazi warden Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) is not for everyone's tastes to say the absolute least.

By any technical standards, its a horribly made film. The direction by Don Edmonds is among the most uninteresting and anemic I've encountered in a film. Its pretty obvious he had no interest in the film itself and only wanted to pick up a quick buck. The acting is pretty dire, with the exception of Dyanne Thorne, who's merely decent. Plus, as the star of a softcore sexploitation film, Thorne really isn't all that attractive, despite carrying a massive pair of breasts. The sets are understandably shoddy (they're all leftovers from Hogan's Heroes) and the production values are all around poor. Most of all, the idea of setting a softcore sexploitation romp in a concentration camp is of questionable taste to say the least.Despite all this, the film is still well remembered. Why? Because its one of the ultimate exploitation classics, a completely politically incorrect and tasteless film. Many watch it only to say they've seen it, but its pretty unforgettable to be perfectly honest. The film is so over-the-top and campy that its somewhat easier to take than it should have been, but its still pretty disgusting. If you have a twisted sense of humor, you'll find plenty of unintentional laughs. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone (in fact, I'd deny ever seeing it to most), but for exploitation fans, you won't be able to turn your head away from the screen due to the sheer tastelessness of the whole film.

As Commandant (also referred to as Frauline docktor), a medical official of the Nazi's Third Reich, she runs a terribly sadistic concentration camp known simply as `camp 9'. Though all in all a very interesting movie, it has its moments of sheer boredom, making you wonder where exactly it is going. Packed with excellent one-liners and certain situations that can't help but make you laugh, despite the disturbing nature of the movie.  It is also rather obvious that the nazi propaganda portrayed in this movie is intended more for shock value as opposed to the promotion of fascism.  Castration of male prisoners who do not satisfy Ilsa's insatiable sexual appetite, the use of an electrocuting phallus to test the female threshold of pain, and flogging to the bloody death are just a few of the more gruesome moments.  Full of senseless nudity and illicit sex, but what more could be expected from a movie titled `Ilsa She wolf of the SS'.  The acting is quite overdone, and the script definitely lacks in places, but of course this only adds to the campiness. Personally I did enjoy this movie in sort of a sick twisted way, and recommend it to anyone who has a dark sense of humor.  If you can sit thru this one you'll love the rest of the series, `Ilsa Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks' where she is Cadeen of an Arab harem; and  `Ilsa Tigress of Siberia', as a communist camp leader turned Madame of a Canadian whorehouse. There is also a fourth movie originally titled `Greta the Mad Butcher' which was later re-titled  `Ilsa The Wicked Warden', solely to ride the success of it's predecessors. The final does star Dyanne Thorne, who unfortunately only has about 30 minutes of screen time, as the movie seems to center more around the prisoners of a South American Sanitarium. -Mark Thomas  "},{"Title":"This was shot on the Hogan's Heros set?","Date":"27 October 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, War","Review":" I can believe that this movie was made. The 70's seemed to be a bastion for bad exploitation fare involving gratuitous sex and violence. Dyanne Thorne plays Ilsa, the Kommandantin of a secret SS research facility that uses women as guinea pigs for experiments on reactions to pain. She's convinced that women can bear more pain than men and this will some way advance the war effort (how the hell this will work, I don't have the foggiest clue seeing as how all the German soldiers on the front lines were men). Ilsa has a very promiscuous sex life; she sleeps with every male prisoner in camp and then castrates them after the lovin'. Ilsa meets her match when an American POW who can control his ejaculation comes to camp (I didn't write the script, so don't blame me).The whole thing is loaded with sex, violence and very explicit torture scenes. What's really shocking is that the movie was shot on the left over Hogan's Heros set. I'd really love to see Col. Klink and LeBeau pop up somewhere in this thing. This is probably the best of the Ilsa series (that's not saying too much, but it probably has the best plot of the bunch. Dyanne Thorne either enjoyed playing Ilsa, or really needed work).

Afterwards the action proper begins with an unfortunate male prisoner being castrated by Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) & her two guards Ingrid (Jo Jo Deville) & Maigret (Sandy Richman). Ilsa is the Nazi Commandant of 'Camp 9' that is used by the Third Reich for cruel medical research. Shortly after 15 new female prisoners arrive for Ilsa & the sleazy Dr. Binz (George 'Buck' Flower) to conduct their experiments on & prove her meaningless theory that specially trained women can withstand more pain then men. New inmate Anna (Maria Marx) is as hard as nails & refuses to break, just the sort of woman Ilsa is looking for. Anna decides she has no intention of hanging around & befriends Kata (Nicolle Riddell) who tells her about the male prisoners who are kept separate & that they might be able to join forces & break out. Meanwhile a German born American (!) named Wolfe (Gregory Knoph) has amazed Ilsa with his sexual powers to withhold ejaculation (!) which he intends to use to his advantage, help the escape effort & liberate the camp...This German American co-production was directed by Don Edmonds & was the first of four films featuring the infamous character of Ilsa although apart from her presence none are really connected to each other & it really didn't do that much for me. The script by Jonah Royston goes for all out exploitation & sleaze with virtually no regard to historic accuracy or worrying about little things like the story & character's, at least it keeps moving & never becomes dull or boring. Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS exists purely to show off plenty of naked flesh, soft-core sex & torture scenes, if this sounds fun then I guess you'll love it but I look for a little bit more depth & reasoning behind my exploitation. The torture & gore scenes aren't much to get excited about these days as they feature plenty of (very) fake blood but few are overly explicit, someone has her toenails pulled out, someone is forced to lie in a tub of boiling water, someone is left in a pressurisation chamber, someone has their privates operated on, people's open wounds are deliberately infected with diseases, someone has their throat cut & there are various beating's & floggings. There is also a dining scene in which a female prisoner has a noose tied around her neck & is stood upon a block of ice, as the ice melts & begins to disappear the noose gets tighter... There is plenty of female nudity but the sex is pretty soft, there is a gang rape & an embarrassingly lame attempt at a golden shower scene I mean just look at the expression on her face as she delivers the goods... With an estimated budget of about $150,000 Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS has surprisingly good production values although that can be contributed in no small part to it being filmed on the existing sets from the recently finished TV series Hogan's Heroes (1961 - 1971) which probably actually had a set design budget. The costumes are OK although there aren't many guards are there? The special effects are good enough but mostly consist of fake blood, the music & cinematography are also better than one would expect from a poverty row exploitation film such as this. The acting was OK but I have to admit I really dislike Thorne, she was 42 when she made this & looks it & being in my mid-20's I found her somewhat off-putting (& I'm being kind there so I won't mention her horrid saggy breasts). Not really much else to say other than if you like exploitation then this is a must watch but ultimately it didn't do that much for me.
