Nothing against Saving Private Ryan or Shakespeare in Love, but this film should have won Best Picture in 1998 and it was a shame that it wasn't nominated. It's an even bigger injustice that it did not get a nomination for best screenplay or cinematography.In the hands of another writer, this movie could have been made as just a parody of 1950's sitcoms like Leave It To Beaver or Ozzie and Harriet. But this film isn't about how clich√©d those series look decades later. It's about the false nostalgia for a past that never existed. We survived the past and we know that everything turned out all right. Because of this, we selectively choose our memories and weed out the unpleasant ones. That's why the past is sometimes seen as the good ol' days. Pleasantville does not represent how the 50's actually were but rather an idealization of what people THINK the 50's were---no one had sex, everyone got along swell, and life was fairly easy. Nothing could be further from the truth, and there are many film from that era which show how real people (even in suburbia) actually lived. This film argues that free will and choice is ESSENTIAL to life and that we should embrace freedom instead of fearing it. It isn't just about making out, but having the OPTION to make out.Another reviewer claimed that this film was an attack on the 50's, but David and Jennifer could very easily have been dumped in the world of The Brady Bunch, Gilligan's Island , or Batman. But setting Pleasantville in a 1950's sitcom allows for the brilliant metaphor of black and white versus color. Black and white photography is a stylized depiction of the universe, but unless you're color blind it's not the way you actually see the universe. When we first see Pleasantville's citizens, all of them are cardboard cut-outs of stereotypes. As they begin to open up and become real people, color seeps into their world. The catalyst seems to be the willingness to experience new sensations and become vulnerable. Jennifer has slept with lot of guys when she was in the normal world, so sex does not change HER into a color character. On the other hand, when she actually finishes a book (without pictures) for the first time in her life, THEN she becomes colorized. Similarly, David does not bloom into color until he breaks out of his aloofness and defends his mother. Compare the way he ignores his real mother at the beginning of the film to how he consoles and comforts her at the end to see how much David has changed.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. There are a lot of films out there that are very entertaining and/or very moving--like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Titanic. Movies like Pleasantville which challenge the audience and force them to think are very rare, and should be treasured by the discerning filmgoer.

What was wrong wasn't that these people were living according conservative values, but that they didn't really choose those values in the first place!I like the fact that the film was bold, and that it made its point as directly as it contrasted the black and white with the splotches of Technicolour.

Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore, clearly misses the point. ... The 50s -- or more specifically, 50s TV -- is used as a metaphor, because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically, this movie is about Living Life to the fullest, whatever that means. More specifically, to live life to the fullest -- to truly feel alive -- you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting pleasant all the time, is no way to live. That's what Tobey McGuire's speech at the end to his real mother is all about. Bad things happen, it's part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives -- but suppressing true feelings for the sake of pleasantness is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that issue is everlasting to the human condition. Another point People fear change. This is universal from the start of time until the end of time. The film suggests that changing and growing as a society and as people -- even if scary -- is good. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for that, don't believe for a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.Another issue common for people critical of this film is the sexual issue.  They say that Gary Ross is promoting sexual promiscuity, sex out of wedlock, etc...  Again, I believe it misses the point.  Is Ross suggesting that premarital sex is OK?  Yes, and I'd agree - and I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't agree with that, and that's OK too.  But, again, the sex is just part of the theme - used as a high-profile example to making the overall point about openness - and not suppressing one's feelings.  Note that the Reese Witherspoon character was already promiscuous, and her transformation was actually something completely different.I can't make everyone like this film - I'll just say that, on a personal note, I was so floored by this film, I had to see it again the next day. That had never happened to me before, or since. Ross' commentary goes on to speak of everything I felt about the film when I first saw it. It was great to hear that his reasons for what he did, meshed exactly with how I took it. I had to write him a letter to tell him so - another thing I'd never done before or since.This is not a perfect film. I liked its subtlety, but then the racism correlation, and the censorship stuff, got a bit more overt. The courtroom scene at the end is a bit cliche ... and I also agree with one poster who said that, to make the point about taking the good with the bad, we should've seen a bit more about the consequences of their actions.Those are merely nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. This is a 10 out of 10.

My manager and I seem to go out to movies a lot after work.  It's odd how people who around film all day cling to it for relaxation at the end of the shift.  We knew the manager of the theater, so we got in free.I knew Pleasantville was about some kids who fall into a world of television and adventures ensue.  Plus I knew that it had Don Knotts and I've always loved his acting.  Expecting a funny little film about TV, I got a brilliant commentary on the social and political environment of the 50's.  There were countless religious, political, and racial references throughout the film.Life in Pleasantville is perfect.  For breakfast you get everything your heart desires, the basketball team wins every game, and everyone is just swell.  The only problem is that life is set; there is no free will, self-expression, or new thought.The Characters begin turning colour when they break their set mold, break out of their lives into something new.  When Mary sue first has sex with Skip, he doesn't turn to colour because he doesn't know what's happened. The event does lead him to begin seeing the world differently, hence the red rose.  People only change when they do something freely and of their own will.  The mother and her bathroom incident, when Mary Sure finally discovers life beyond sex and seduction in books and thought, and when Bud finally stands up for himself.The fact that new thought and experience leads to the thought of the breakdown of the Pleasantville world speaks to the desire in the 50's not to change.  Things were good, values were abundant, and life was good.  Dinner was ready at 6, the wife was always home cleaning or cooking or something. Then came those greasers and people doing more than holding hands.  One of the main points of this film was that change is one of those things that can become undesirable, but is needed to evolve and grow as a society.Another big statement this film makes is one the issue of racism, and very well I might add.  There are no black people in Pleasantville.  This isn't an attack of any sort on race.  I'm sure you can count on one hand the average number of black people in a 50's television show.  The point is that the colored people are representative of all nationalities oppressed in the fifties, even through today.  Because of things they could not necessarily control, they are all hated and spat upon for being different.  Especially in the end when all the `colored' people are at the top of the courthouse segregated from the non-colored people.  And don't forget the `no colored people' signs in the shop windows.This film is about more than the way things were and how change is good. It's about the way we see ourselves inside and out.  If life is static and non-changing, then all you get is black and white.  It's only when people allow themselves to grow and mature as people and human beings that they see the world through coloured eyes.  Pleasantville only becomes whole when everyone sees appears in colour.  Only then do the roads open up and the life beyond the town exists.  It's odd how people in the city know what colour is, yet are shocked when it appears everywhere.

Ignore any review (and reviewer) that says different. We live in a day and age that we seems like every movie has a touch of this old film and bit of that one...or is a remake or possibly a re-release. But Pleasantville is none of that...it is unique, fresh, reflective, pleasant (you knew I was going to use that word someplace), sad, but yet still had a touch of fun. The film begins by looking at the interaction between and the lives of a brother (Tobey Maguire) and sister (Reese Witherspoon). The brother is very content with his life and enjoys watching television, in particular, the show, Pleasantville. His sister, a bit more outgoing, enjoys meeting new people and seeing where this interaction will lead. A fight over which show to watch results in the intervention by Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith and Three's Company fame). Maguire and Witherspoon are wisked into the television set and take center stage as two of the Pleasantville cast. The only difference is while the world may be watching a tv show, to them, this is their reality. The film appears to be in black and white, but as each character opens their mind or changes from the perception of the Pleasantville tv show, then they begin to gain color. As those in color become more prevalent, the old black & whites become resistant to change. To ebb the flow of change, the black and whites react violently against the new colors and begin placing restrictions on them. Yes the similarities of the 60s civil rights movement are here as are the violent acts of the Nazis in pre-World War II. But while you see these, you are also brought to the realization that there still exists a great deal of prejudice, discrimination, and close-mindedness in this world. One of the most pleasing aspects of this film is the cinematography, the mixing of the colors with the black & white shots were great. The story keeps your interest and the characters impact upon each member of the audience in their own special way. This is one film to see for I think you will hear more about it around Oscar time. Bottom line...if we open our minds more towards others, letting them be who they are, rather than who we want them to be, then not only will we be richer in color, but also richer in character.

They both showed larger than life happenings and captured our minds with their perspectives. In EdTv there was a humble video store clerk guy having his life filmed for a reality show, which was happening in present time. Though in Truman Show very futurist and fantastically, Truman Burbank was not even aware that his life is being filmed, offering the viewer the vision of life from God's perspective. Distinctively here in Pleasantville, there is a journey which starts with materializing a TV-series into life and ends up with materializing the life into this TV-series.The cheerful 1950s' TV sit-com Pleasantville is revived in the '90s on cable. A homebody teen, David Wagner, escapes from the daily rush of the real unpleasant world by watching this show. He doesn't even miss the reruns, memorizes the scripts and speaks them out before the actors in the show say their part. One day after school, he and his sister Jennifer can't agree on the right TV channel to watch. Then they fight over the remote control and it breaks. The new remote, which will zap them inside Pleasantville, given them by a strange TV-repairman.When they entered Pleasantville, they become the part of the show and turn to black-and-white as the TV show displays. David and Jennifer take up residence as the son and the daughter of the sit-com family. Soon, they realize that there the life is always pleasant; the temperature is always lukewarm and the seasons are always spring with no rain no snow no hot no cold weather, books have no words, roads end where they start, nothing burns and matches are useless, married couples sleep in twin beds, sex does not exist, nobody gets sick, nobody gets hurt and nobody ever questions this hassle-free life. David fits right in as he always dreamt to be, while her sister persists on him to try to figure out what should they do to escape from there. Though she changes her mind when he gets a boyfriend from school. Her attempts of putting her lifestyle on effect causes Pleasantville gets colors. Thus wonderful and frightening changes start to take place.Pleasantville is a truly original film that soars with dynamism and aesthetic. From a social and deeply political perspective; it has deep meaning and relevance in today's society. Consequently, it should serve as a reminder for most that the world is made up of how its residents think and act. You can't stop something that's inside you. says David, and that could be summation of all that Pleasantville stands for.

This superbly mounted and completely winning fantasy starred Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as a contemporary teenage brother and sister who are magically transported into a black and white television show called Pleasantville, a show similar to Leave it to Beaver or I Love Lucy, where everyone in the town knows each other, where the fire department only saves cats from trees and never put out fires and where there are no pages in the books or toilets in the bathrooms. Maguire's character is a Pleasantville trivia expert so he knows everyone there and everything that's going to happen but sis Witherspoon is a stranger in a strange land whose introduction of 1990's sensibilities to the citizens of this town brings about extraordinary changes. The film is beautifully made with a very smart screenplay and superb performances, the best of which is by Joan Allen, who is luminous as Betty, the mother in the sitcom who is shocked at first but learns to accept the 1990's coming to Pleasantville. Yes, it may borrow from other movies, but there is a freshness and originality to this movie that is most engaging and anytime with Don Knotts is time well spent.

There actions have consequences and result in major changes with the characters from the show.The misandric (anti-male) messages abound. As the (positive) changes occur in the town, the adult males are the ones that are shown as being adamantly opposed,and are shown as stereotypical stuck-in-the-muds that don't like change. The adult males are shown as incompetents that are unable to even cook for themselves and gripe about having no one (i.e. their wives, which they are *dependant* upon like children) cook, clean or prepare their clothing for them.The movie goes into depth to portray what the expectations of women back in the 1950s (e.g. cooking and cleaning), yet does NOTHING to portray the limitations and responsibilities imposed upon males, like providing for the family, wearing a suit and tie everyday and male-oriented work like yardwork. As with most aspects of modern culture, only the lamentations of frustrated women are shown and males are shown as living in a utopian society with no worries or limits.Just as other movies, this movie shows a woman having a extra marital affair and it is justified because she has grown weary of her married life. Despite the fact that she never *discusses* the matter with her husband, who remains OBLIVIOUS to the changes that are happening, she has decided that her husband cannot cope with her newly discovered sexual desires and seeks out another man. This, of course, would be *taboo* if a man had done it; there are enough movies showing what a creep a man is who cheats on his wife, yet a when a woman has an affair it is always justified. The father character is shown as being a nice guy, who never accosts his family, provides for them and seems to do nothing wrong, yet this also portrays him as being boring and therefore needs to change.The movie started with an interesting premise and had really good acting and good special effects, I just found it difficult to stomach the frequent negative attitudes about males and the male bashing. This movie would fit in well in the book, Misandry The Teaching of Contempt for Males in Popular Culture.Overall the movie was pretty hypocritical. The basic premise was, People should be free to do what they want, as long as what they want is what we tell them they want. For example, the father character was comfortable and happy with his old life. *That* was the life he wanted and he was happy with it. But this is portrayed as wrong because he is not changing his lifestyle to conform to what the other people are saying. Huh?

A first all seems perfect in a cheesy 1950's way - all language is wholesome, everything is black and white, none of the sports team ever miss and nothing is unwholesome.  However when David and Jenifer begin to influence those around them they not only change attitudes and behaviour but start to bring colour to the town.  The town splits in it's attitude to this change.This is a very gentle comedy but with a hint of a moral about it.  It starts out with `once upon a time' and that's quite apt in that it is a fable with a moral in the way many fairy tales are.  At the start it's all quite small and the film almost shows the changes as bad and something that has comedy value, however later the changes are shown as something that should be embraced rather than feared.  Then those who fear change and expression are shown to be wrong.  It's all quite clever - the only problem to me was that the message felt a bit muddled and could have been a bit clearer - but then maybe that's the point, we learn our own lessons from it.The effects are excellent throughout - colour creeps in in some objects and people to great effect.  It's very well done and never seems unnatural.  As a metaphor for change or lost innocence it gets a bit tired but for most it's very effective as a way of seeing people's true feelings come out.The cast are great - Maguire and Witherspoon are both good (yes, even Witherspoon!), but the real strength comes from the adult support cast.  Daniels gives a great understated role, it's not his best as he plays it a little too much like a wounded deer at times but he's still very good.  Allen is the strongest as she has to carry much of the story with Macy who it goes without saying is superb - they share some very emotionally charged scenes together.  It's always a pleasure to see the late J.T. Walsh in anything and here he is good in a comparatively minor role.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that is very thoughtful and easily overcomes it's slow pace and slight lack of total clarity.

Pleasantville explores a greatly simplified fantasy world -- a hypothetical 50's TV sitcom -- and examines what happens when reality intrudes on its premises. As Shakespeare put it, There's more to heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.Unfortunately, some reviewers see the film as commentary of another kind. They view it as a confirmation of, or attack on, their own personal philosophies, political, social, or the like. For those who are expecting such, let me say what Pleasantville is NOT* It is not a criticism of the 1950s, its social mores or political bent.* It is not a celebration of liberalism versus some conservative straightjacket view of the world.* It is not a groundbreaking, original thought piece on philosophy, religion or anything of the like.The creators of this film could have made it such, but I think they were smarter than that.What Pleasantville IS is a celebration of real life, in all its messy, confusing, beautiful and often painful detail. And the celebration is masterfully executed.The device of the 50s sitcom is used to convey the film's central point that it is often easy, comforting, even helpful for us to think about things in simplistic terms, and even that there isn't anything wrong with that per se.But to think about REAL LIFE this way is to live a smaller, lesser life. Life without color is easy to look at, and it certainly works. But a black-and-white life is certainly less of a life. OK, that one's easy, and that's where Pleasantville starts. (I'm supposed to be IN COLOR!) Even the next evolution, that life is better with sex, is pretty much taken for granted, but of course that enhancement to Pleasantville later brings the real-life complications we can all predict.And the complications continue, as Pleasantville residents discover that there are other places in the world, other people, other ways to think and imagine as evidenced in the books that had all heretofore been blank. As evidenced in the changes in music we hear at the soda shop. And these complications aren't all good. They introduce upheaval, prejudice, violence.But the film successfully carries the theme that you just can't have the good without the bad. It keeps reminding the viewer that, if you're thinking that way, you are missing a subtlety of life, and you'd better think again. And I think it goes even further, making the case that even the existence of these evils makes life the richer for living, because they enable us to distinguish what we like and wish for from what we find reprehensible.My favorite scene of the film may be when Bud brings Mr. Johnson an art book from the library. As he leafs through its pages, we are left to wonder what life would be like had we never had the chance to see these magnificent works, what a tragedy it would be, what a smaller, meaner life we would have lived. And a later remark in the film reminds us that seeing is only part of life, that the real joy is in understanding what we have the privilege to experience.The film seems at times like it is hitting the viewer over the head, but it's deeper than that. When Bud takes (Betty Sue?) to Lover's Lane, his first trip there, she offers him some berries as they sit on the grass by the pond. And then she gets up, runs to a nearby tree, picks a shiny red apple, and offers it to him. The metaphor is painfully obvious, but it's supposed to be. We all recognize it. The point is, Bud recognizes it too, and he realizes in that moment that the fact that not all change is good will sooner or later intrude on the lives of these people, which is precisely what then begins to happen in the film. The scene isn't precious for a Do You Get It? Adam & Eve metaphor, it's precious for the look on Bud's face as HE realizes the metaphor being enacted when a beautiful girl offers him a bite of a nice red apple, as his look reveals his thought Uh oh. This is about to get ugly.If you're looking for a groundbreaking thought work, look elsewhere than Pleasantville. It treats a classic theme, not a brand new one. But it does not, in my view, pretend to do more than that, and it treats that theme brilliantly.

The self-referential notion of having characters interact with the very media which represents them has its counterpart as far back as 1924 with Buster Keaton in Sherlock Jr., in 1970 with a low-budget film named The Projectionist, and in 1985 with Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo.  But where the others explore the private experience of self-discovery through their enmeshment with the media, this one explores a much wider public awareness.  In that sense it is a very cleaver and intelligent story, offering numerous social messages worthy of consideration.On the downside, its message that different is better mostly translates into contrary means better, providing an anything goes mentality in answer to conventional values.  The rules are to be broken by gratuitous sex, loud music, and cheap garish art.  Not transcending in answer to different, but rather setting up what is conventional today as more desirable than what was conventional back then.  Exchanging one convention for another is not for that reason an improvement, and the attempt to do so results in a self-congratulatory narcissism of the form See how much more urbane and sophisticated we are than our parents were?  The 1950s are set up as a straw-man, while the values of the 1990s are simply taken for granted as superior.  Hence the deeper questions of change, growth and improvement, are never asked, and what we are given merely puts the past down without bringing up the present.

We are then kindly told by the director/script-writers (complete with cheery music) that lots of sex with no feelings involved is better than having ultra-clean morals. After all, clean morals are for boring people. Tobey McGuire's character goes from calm geek to sex-starved teenager because some good-looking girl he never met made him cookies after he becomes popular (awwww, true love). This film is filled with such positive values.All in all, it's a very childish movie obviously written by an amateur. It even contradicts itself, since the nice people portrayed in Pleasantville would never turn into a fanatical violent mob. The worst scene is when the father of the family, who is consistently shown as a  nice guy throughout the movie (talking to his children, kissing his wife, etc), is ruined by doing a 180, he's turned into a close-headed chauvinist so that we can give the lively wife a big scene where she proclaims her independence about how she doesn't want to make dinner, that she wants to run off with another man.

However, I feel Pleasantville doesn't hold a candle to The Truman Show. While Truman offered genuine pathos, a sympathetic, even heroic lead, and insight into the intrusive nature of television, Pleasantville is overlong, repetitive, simplistic, and hollow.The plot of Pleasantville has two modern-day teen-agers being magically transported to a fictional T.V. show set in the '50's, called Pleasantville (by no less a character than Don Knotts, the movie's only inspired idea). The boy, played by Toby Maguire, likes it there - it's a nice respite from his family problems, which includes his sister, played by Reese Witherspoon. She is transported with her brother, but feels she has entered Nerdville, and so sets out to change her surroundings to something she is more familiar with, something with a more 90's sensibility, like, say with...sex?This is actually an interesting premise, especially since the 50's world is in black and white, and only gradually introduced to color. Unfortunately, the movie takes a black and white attitude in its morality too, hammering the same point home over and over again. I think the movie is basically saying the 50's was a time of stifling conformity, dull and unimaginative culture, and in the end, threatening and oppressive patriarchy. The 90's, on the other hand, offers ultruistic freedom, better values, and color! to life.Please! One could make a better argument that the 90's offers moral decay and fear, as evidenced by broken families, teenage pregnancy, violence, and general cynicism towards all authority. The film takes the logically dubious step of taking 50's sitcom sensibility and making it the reality of that time. Just ask how 90's sitcoms accurately reflect 90's reality. One could defend the movie by saying that it is not making a literal 50's - 90's comparison, but is making the more general point that freedom is better than confromity. This is a truism and doesn't need over two hours to justify, and besides, the movie is taking that comparison seriously. The audience shouldn't.  "},{"Title":"Please do not fry my brain!

When breakfasts were plentiful, and it never rained and dinner was at five and there was no such thing as sex and everyone obeyed their parents and got good grades and everything was just super. Well, transport two modern day teens into a 50's sitcom and watch them wreak havoc on this perfect little world from the past that we've created. I think everyone will agree, that is what this movie is about. Two teens trapped in a fictional, black-and-white world, where everything is perfect, and bringing with them unwanted, but ultimately, extremely necessary change. I believe that I have given a glorified description of this allegory, just as the director claims that we have a glorified view of the past. It seems so perfect, yet underneath, it's so extremely flawed. I do not see an overall message to this movie. If this was a paper, and I was a teacher grading it, I would write in bold red ink across the top, WHAT'S THE THESIS? It seems to be going in so many directions, and ends up being nothing more than melodramatic sap. At first the director seems to be saying that we view the past as perfect, but that's just our imperfect memory at work. But what's the deal with there being no such thing as rain, and never any fires? Well, reviewers will claim, this is not about real life, it's about characters on a television show. Wait a minute? I thought this was about us having a false perception of the past? 50's sitcoms were made in the 50's. False memory had nothing to do with it. It was about entertaining. Yes, I understand this suggests that the movie is about fiction vs. reality. However, if that is so, then it's not about change, it's about facing up to the truth that was always there. All of the elements seem to contradict each other. I'm so confused. I'm trying to balance all these things that are offered in the movie that just won't connect because they are randomly flying at me from from all over the place. We need color, nothing is just black-and-white.  Ok, but I don't believe looking to the past, and realizing it wasn't perfect, is going to help us be more well-rounded people.  It serves as nothing other than to tell us we're wrong, the good old days were not perfect.  How does that affect the now? If it is about accepting that it is good that nothing is perfect in today's world, then that contradicts the idea that the past was not perfect.  What is the director trying to say? The film does not know what it wants to be, is my final analysis. Is it about change?  Acceptance of color, and rejecting black and white? Admitting that the past was not as perfect as we like to think? I don't know and I don't care. It gives no insight into the human condition, as far as I'm concerned, and that's all I care about in movies and literature.  A 3/10. Just read The Giver or Harrison Bergeron. By the way, I heard that they were going to make The Giver into a movie, but they couldn't because Pleasantville stole it's thunder. No doubt it needed it to go along with that dramatic rain scene.

If you're wondering whether to see it, please do. It's somewhat similar in feel to The Truman Show - a warm comedy that conveys social criticism. That's why I just rented them both for the first time and watched them back to back - and much preferred Pleasantville as more profound, funnier, and having more original writing.However, at times Pleasantville is a little odd. First, it may well rub people the wrong way (it did me) that indiscriminate nightly recreational sex by teenagers is seen as causing them to flower into real people. Thus, a teenager contracting a venereal disease becomes the amusing equivalent to lipstick found on someone's collar. Well, it isn't. It's bothersome that this is seen as meaning the teenagers have somehow acquired real life and flowered.Similarly, the infidelity of the perfect suburban wife is seen as completely wonderful - the horrific impact on the husband shown merely comically because dinner isn't ready.Somehow, the town's negative reaction to a nude painting of the wife by her lover on the windows of the local hangout is seen as perverse. The writer/director sees the painting as just a wonderful expression of a long repressed artistic sensibility. Hmmm - imagine YOUR mother painted naked on the storefront window! You wouldn't want it to remain there!Similarly, character after character responds enviously when presented with the idea that there is a more dangerous world out there. Well, I wish there were less danger in the world - less likelihood of disease, of murder, of ruinous bankruptcies of people's hopes, of litigation that drives people under, of unemployment, of infidelity. These are terrible things - they ruin and end lives. That doesn't mean I want a controlled environment - but only that it is hard to imagine anyone wishing for life to be MORE dangerous.Moreover, much of the social criticism is blunted by the fact that many of the oddities the characters find about their situation are not because they are in the 1950s, but because they are in the midst of a television show rather than real life. Thus, ALL books have blank pages, there is no known place outside that town, all basketballs swish through the hoops, everyone's routine is so rigid that the soda fountain worker is unable to cope when a worker fils to show up in time to fold the napkins while he begins cooking.The question thus becomes whether the director is satirizing merely television shows. But if it is merely a satire of old television programs, it is strange. On Leave it to Beaver or Father Knows Best or Donna Reed or My Three Sons, the characters OFTEN failed - and the inevitable moral lesson about trying again or keeping one's chin up was the point of the show.If instead, it is social commentary about conformity and repression (as the movie's point appears more to be), then the oddities of being inside a television program unfortunately vitiate the point of the movie.I also have a problem with a movie that confuses expression with libertine behavior. It's one thing to be free to draw any picture - it's another for teenagers to contract venereal diseases through indiscriminate sex. They AREN'T the same things, and making it appear that those who are confused when their wives have simply abandoned them and their children without even a note, with those who are violent book burners or utterly rigid conformists, is really hitting too broadly.All that said, the movie was terribly moving in showing those in a conformist society finding themselves bloom, and  the confusion and shock and anger that this causes among others. It's sweet and funny, and I particularly liked how well drawn the two leads were - quite distinct people who react very differently to the situation.It's interesting that Toby McGuire begins by trying his utmost not to upset the existing conformist social order (his sister doesn't care at all), but ends completely believably as the revolutionary subverter of that order. The movie is well worth seeing even if you think the director insists on throwing out the morality of fidelity along with the bathwater of mindless rigid conformity.

(Yep. That's right! - Corrupted it!) It was especially the Jennifer air-head character who literally slutified Pleasantville in no time flat. She even educated her TV-Mother on how to please oneself through the dexterity of finger masturbation.I thought that as a movie Pleasantville got its equation for fulfillment all wrong. By using the screwy metaphor of color as its yardstick to measure fulfillment, I was told, plain and simple, that a black and white world equaled sterility, close-mindedness and gross naivety. While, on the other hand, a Technicolor world meant only beauty, life-lovingness, and rich rewards.This film seemed to have absolutely no understanding or appreciation for the targeted era in US culture that it so smugly attempted to belittle and ridicule.Pleasantville's message was neither deep nor meaningful. All that this picture seemed to be was just another way for its producers to show off their expertise solely in terms of its CG imagery.Pleasantville's story repeatedly told me that one must drop (like - Pronto!) all sexual inhibitions in order to be totally fulfilled in this life. And, yet, it made no mention that it's due to a lack of common sense and rampant, unprotected sex that this world is rife with STDs and unwanted pregnancies.I found it really hard to believe that the characters living in Pleasantville (before the colors of sex arrived) were so bloody clueless that they didn't know that a whole, wide world existed out there beyond the idealistic borders of their quaint, little town.Like, didn't these innocent-ones ever watch movies and TV? And, didn't they actually see in color? And, finally - It really baffled me that the TV Repairman (whose motives were decidedly dubious) had become absolutely outraged when he found out what dear-Jennifer and her darling bro, David, had done to the innocence of Pleasantville - Especially since it was he who had zapped them there in the first place.Like, what the hell did he expect to happen by introducing these 2 casualties of the post-sexual revolution into this unspoiled environment?

She's a self-absorbed party girl; he's a nerdy home-body.

Some characters go through a sexual awakening, others more of a cultural awakening, but they each mature and advance in their own way. Even David and Jennifer find that these TV sitcom characters have something to teach them. The film is just so smart and funny that it doesn't come across as melodramatic, and the lessons on society aren't in your face.Pleasantville is beautifully shot and well written, and is far from the teen fantasy film that it sometimes gets advertised as.

The standout in this excellent ensemble has to be Joan Allen, whose remarkably studied performance is a masterclass in character development, as her Betty slowly steps free of repression and blossoms into a woman of sensuous, simple beauty and independence. Jeff Daniels is charming too as Bill, the bow-tied soda store owner who discovers passions within. Coming to terms with one's inner passion isn't an easy process, we discover, as the town breaks apart into paranoia and fear, dangerously teetering on the brink of a kind of apartheid until even the staunchest black-and-white citizen realises that change is inevitable and that the unPleasant waits within. It is precisely this thread of tension that elevates Pleasantville over the level of easy comedy, though there are a good number of affectionate laughs here.The beauty of Pleasantville is the way in which the film so easily and comfortably finds its stride and, like Groundhog Day, uses every last scrap of its unapologetically high concept to the maximum. The real coup de cinema is that the modern-day kids don't learn old-fashioned values as much as the citizens of Pleasantville learn from David and Jennifer how wonderful sexual and cultural freedom can be. This isn't just a fish-out-of-water comedy - the arrival of the kids disturbs the very fundament of Pleasantville. The way in which the seemingly happy yet horribly repressed town is slowly exposed to the freedoms of modern life is thrilling to watch - symbolised with such great clarity initially by the use of colour and other unPleasant things like lightning, rain and the joyous eruption of a tree into orange and yellow flames upon Betty's first orgasm. Another great achievement here is that the audience really gets a sense of how powerfully such changes impact upon the community - the first glimpse of a red rose is framed with such intensity that we ourselves are disturbed - uncertain as to whether we should be thrilled or frightened.

Notice who gets shelled in this film, the '50's and the '90's.  Conveniently sandwiched between these two highlighted decades is the real culprit.  Growing up in the '60's, being educated in the '70's, and working in the '80's, the hippy generation has once again stuck it to their forbears and their offspring.As the story goes, the people of the 1950's were so square they couldn't see color because they lacked sexual knowledge and experience.  Moreover, people of the '90's lost the vigor of color because the sexual revolution had long ended with just assembly line sex remaining.  If a rational individual removes the one linchpin of this logic (e.g. sex), the whole proof crashes down upon itself.  All I'm convinced of, is that the hippies, were, are, and continue to be consumed by the issue of sex, and anyone not so inclined is square.  This movie rates two out of ten.

Fine, that's a cute premise, maybe for one of today's sitcoms (in which it has already been done many times before), but the town of Pleasantville is such an extreme exaggeration that I never bought the fantasy world presented within it. This is something that is necessary to the viewer when it comes to films involving fantasy--we must believe in the world depicted. It didn't work for me at all. Sex was something that was never talked about on shows from the 1950's, but I'm sure Mrs. Cleaver (Yes, I mean the fictional character) knew what it was! I also think that the characters from those shows also knew that there was a world beyond their own town, that there were days when it would rain, and that the local sports teams didn't always win.Director Gary Ross seems pretty unsure of his material himself, and that is probably why the film keeps defining itself; within the last half-hour of the movie, a young boy punches another. Those watching look on in surprise and wonder. They've never seen violence before someone a few rows behind me in the theatre said. Well, duh! I thought this was clear as soon as the movie started (but I still never bought it), leaving the audience to defend the monotony of the screenplay. At one point, William H. Macy looks all over the place for his wife, looking for his dinner. I feel sorry for him, an uncomfortable audience member said.When the movie is not overdoing itself in explaining its world, it is trying to shock us with sexual humor, also in the same, tedious, overblown way--after Paul Walker is deflowered by Reese Witherspoon, the camera LINGERS on him, emphasizing his shocked and dumbfounded expression, milking it for ungenuine laughs. The film then TEDIOUSLY expands this single joke commonly throughout the movie, showing us shocking images of kinky sex acts, some I can't even mention here, for my comments won't be posted (HINT one involves a popular number in the double digits), and when we're not seeing the acts of sex or the blown-away expressions of those who have just experienced it, we get some really shocking conversation; Reese Witherspoon has been shacking up with every guy in sight, then educates her mother on ways to please herself--Oh, MY! Another shock, provoking embarrassed and courteous laughs from the audience.The final scenes of the film dissolve into complete disorder; Don Knotts starts getting angry at the kids for their disruption of Pleasantville, and goes quite mad, but what was he expecting in the first place, and why does his demeanor change so radically from that of the first act? Other characters end their stories without solutions, not that its wrong to leave certain stories open-ended--I just feel that Ross didn't know what he wanted to do with most of his characters. The final scene Gee, you know you're pretty smart is poorly written, tacked-on, unsatisfying, and forced.I think what bothers me most about the film is that, since these banal characters are just imaginary, dull caricatures of 50's television shows, who don't even really exist, why should we care about them? At one point, Tobey Macguire's character is offered the chance to leave Pleasantville, but he turns it down--he wants to make a difference here. WHO CARES! It's just a TV show! Maybe I would have cared if I found the world of Pleasantville to be believable, but I never did.

Gary Ross, who previously wrote Dave and Big, both of which were excellent comedies as well as being timely moral statements, has now crossed the line.Not in filmic terms, but in morality.It's obvious that Ross is making a statement about the inherent freedom within everyone from Adam and Eve right down to people within the world of television.  This is a beautiful statement, one that should be lauded.  But it is also one that should be tempered with responsibility and reason.Tobey Maguire plays the proverbial Adam, a boy that loves everything to do with the 'pleasant' world of forties and fifties television, until he and his sister, Reese Witherspoon who plays the also proverbial Eve, are zapped into the television world of Pleasantville.In this world, everything is black and white, until Eve feeds the apple to an unsuspecting boy.  As his desire is aroused, color appears in the world. Soon, all the kids are doing it...literally, at the ridiculously named 'Lover's Lane'.  More and more color appears, and yet, strangely enough nobody gets pregnant.The mother of Adam and Eve, played by Joan Allen, is Mrs. Cleaver to a 'T', until her daughter teaches her about sex.  After having been taught, the mother proclaims that the father would never to THAT, to which the evil Eve says, There are other ways to find pleasure.  To the mother, this means more than just masturbating in the bathtub.  She leaves her home and family without even speaking with her husband and the only after math that we see is that food is not on the table.In the end, the normal people of Pleasantville must somehow come to terms with the 'coloreds'.  But what of consequence?  The only true evil in the film comes by way of the males who refuse to partake in the world of color. They burn books, rape women, and are generally Hitler-esque.In Ross's world, color means free will.  The freedom to do whatever you please.  This is truly an amazing thing that human beings possess, but this gift we have is tempered by the fact that we have consequences for every action that we indulge in.In Pleasantville, there are no consequences.In the ancient allegory, when Adam and Eve were cast out of the 'black and white' Garden of Eden, they were sent into the world we know too well.  A world of hardship, but certainly a beautiful world.Nobody dies in Pleasantville before and after color appears, there are no accidents, no mishaps, with unprotected rampant sex comes no disease, no pregnancy, no remorse...no sense.  With the pleasure, there is no pain.Someone said, How can we know the sweet without tasting the bitter?  Gary Ross will show you.Pleasantville is like the allegory of Adam and Eve cast UP from the Garden of Eden straight to heaven...  So why are we here at all?

As such, I decided not to watch it. At first I thought that it was in the same vein as the Truman Show, but it is far from it. Where the Truman Show had some deep, intricate themes regarding control, Pleasantville is about enjoying life and questions the ideas of morality.The movie is about a fifties television show where everything is perfect. A boy loves the show while his sister scorns it. They are completely opposite in personality, she being a slut while he being a nerd. They then get drawn into the show, and the boy is ecstatic while she is angered, especially since she misses out on a date with Mr Studley from her school (who would want to date a donkey Mr Studley anyway - they sound so try-hard).By the end of the movie, the boy has shed his shell and comes to see that a perfect world is not always a happy world while she discovers that there is much more to the world than sex. The movie depicts these changes in characters by giving them colours (as the TV Show is black and white). As people come to find joy in life, they come to take on colours. The movie emphasises that this joy is not simply sexual gratification, as the sister has a lot of sex, yet does not become coloured until she discovers the wonder of literature.One wonders if this movie is trying to advocate the 90's over the fifties, but I don't think so. What I think this movie is trying to draw out is that which we find joyful. We might be happy doing something, but it might not be truly joyful, especially since we won't want to do it because of fear of persecution. This is emphasised at the end as those who are still black and white begin to persecute those who are coloured.When I saw this movie, I wasn't paying that much attention, but what I did see was that it was a much better movie that I expected, and will have to watch it again more closely.

The worst signs were the over-dramatic courtroom monologue adding nothing particularly original (what's different is inside us), the extremely heavy racial and religious allegory (girlfriend offering an apple? things that are off-limits to colored people? mccarthy-era fahrenheit 451-style book burning??), the overplayed color metaphor (the first few times were great, having it last to the end of the story dragged). It begins to seem a bit dumb and heavy...and its message is ridiculously left-leaning.

A brother and sister who are polar opposites get sucked into their television set one evening just as a Pleasantville marathon is set to start. The show, per its' name, is a mega-sappy boomer-era sitcom comparable to the likes of 'Leave it to Beaver', and this is the world they find themselves stuck in. It soon becomes evident that if the pair neglect to play along with every little nuance of the Pleasantville episodes, it's entire universe would cease making sense. Desperate to keep the innocent folks of Pleasantville intact, David struggles to keep everything routine and orderly like the episodes he's memorized, but Jennifer, known as the school slut back in reality, has other plans.The running time for Pleasantville stretches just over 120 minutes, and while it feels about as long as it is, it is time well spent. The characters are written with remarkable emotional maturity, even for the surreal P-ville residents, some of which are borderline childish in their ignorance (WHERE'S MY DINNER?!), but even such a disposition is portrayed with honest human emotion and a belief in goodness underneath it all. The director commands a subtlety from his actors, and manages to succeed in having them play their sappy archetypes and be themselves at the same time, coming across with a humble ignorance that offers a rich duality. For while they are merely people trying to be people on the inside, the impostors amongst them are people trying to be Pleasants.The colors. Oh, the colors!

A burning tree glowing against a pale picket fence, pink cherry blossoms in a gray lovers lane, and (to me) most memorably a black and white greaser runs a vibrant-colored comb through his black and white hair. The effects are done with technical proficiency to the effect of beauty. But the colors are loud in multiple ways because they say so much. They spring up in any of the town residents when something happens, and just what that is could be discussed amongst the audience. On the surface, the colors change when a person changes; a routine, a feeling, a way of thinking. Underneath, a passionate moviegoer can look inside these characters, find the humanity, and pick out how they feel like a familiar outfit. It is in these moments of relation that we connect most with the Pleasants, and it is also when they receive their new colors. I think it was these kinds of moments that inspired the color in Pleasantville, the moments of purity. Another interesting perspective I had of the concept was as a kind of reflection of American culture, ranging from the 1950s generation gap to the later civil-rights movement (check out the No Coloreds sign in a store window).I won't try to nutshell the movie, since the characters endure a whirlwind of change and turmoil. Suffice it to say that it's full, rich, sensitive, and funny. It manages to say a lot and it looks damn good doing it. This one stood out on its' own, even within a period of cinematic revival and new ideas spawned by special effects (but not TOO MUCH fx). Yet one more reason why I miss the 90s'.

That scenario has disaster potential of FEMA proportions, so when the filmmakers avoided making a post-modern film version of Gilligan's Island starring Will Ferrell is half the battle. And director Gary Ross got just about everything else about Pleasantville half-right, which makes for a halfway decent viewing experience, nowhere near as bad as it could be, but not as good either.The look of the scenes in the sitcom small-town is half-right -- the costumes, hairstyles and set decorations are perfect, but the pretty black-and-white cinematography and odd camera angles are more reminiscent of an art movie by Scorcese or Woody Allen than grainy single-set 50s TV. The casting is half-right. Don Knotts as the mysterious TV repairman who transforms people into sitcom characters? Perfect. Tobey Maguire as the nerdy, unpopular teen obsessed with an old family sitcom? Way too easy. Looking at Tobey Maguire back in 1998, you assumed he was a geek, so he coasts on his charisma deficit and doesn't bother creating much of a character. Reese Witherspoon as the slutty girl who introduces sexual liberation into the staid 1950s? Brilliant. This was before anyone knew how good she was, and her depth and intelligence shine through this gimmicky role -- her sense of mischief in her early sitcom scene is hilarious, her transformation into a more thoughtful young woman is quite moving. Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk with artistic aspirations? Confused. Is his character stupid or repressed? Daniels never figures it out so he plays it both ways and winds up just kind of stiff and awkward. Finally, the politics of Pleasantville are halfway thought-provoking. A few scenes of book burning and threatened gang rape are enough to make you wonder if Pleasantville is about the sentimental impulse at the heart of fascism. But that's kind of intense for an American movie so it almost literally backs away from that idea in a bizarre edit and becomes a sentimental movie about self-acceptance and self-actualization. Which is fine, just not incredibly distinctive. Good but not great.

While you have no idea WHY, Don Knotts (yes, Don Knotts!) plays a magical TV repairman who gives them a bizarre looking remote that somehow transports them into a TV show that Tobey loves--Pleasantville. They have no idea why this occurred or if it will ever end or if Knotts is god, but oddly neither questions this new world that is literally in black & white like an old episode of Father Knows Best. However, unwittingly, their presence with their modern sensibilities and notions causes this seemingly idyllic world to start to slowly come apart at the seems. Notions such as freedom to choose, sex and individuality are missing in this world--and the two interlopers bring this to the plastic world of Pleasantville.By the way, Pleasantville is odd in many ways. First, all roads in town lead right back to town and no one has ever left the town or knows anything about the world outside. Second, books are blank inside and the people have no idea about what they contain. Third, when there is a fire, the fire department actually has no idea WHAT a fire is--they are only used to things you might see in the TV world--such as rescuing cats stuck in trees. In fact, how Tobey is able to finally convince the firemen to come to his house when there is an actual fire is pretty funny. There's a lot more that is strange about the town and it gets stranger when the influence of the two outsiders slowly causes actual colors to begin appearing in the monochrome world.The film is a strange surreal sort of thing that is truly unique. Using colorization techniques, they are able to achieve amazing results that seem to jump off the screen. It's all a metaphor about how the idyllic life of 50s TV was actually quite stilted and repressive, though Maquire and Witherspoon's life in the real world isn't exactly great either--their parents are divorced and Witherspoon is, to put it nicely, a bit shallow and slutty. A happy medium would sure be nice--combining the best of both worlds--and I think this is a valid interpretation of the film's intent. Where exactly it all goes and the unexpected consequences are something you'll just have to learn about yourself, so watch the film.Overall, a rather interesting and innovative film. It was nominated for three Oscars and deserved kudos in these departments--for sets, costume design and music. While I wouldn't put it in the category of must-see, it is interesting and worth seeing--even if the ending is a bit too drawn out in some ways. The only real misgiving I have is the way SOME might see the film and come to the conclusions that the 1950s were all bad and repressive--a rather oversimplification of the era, to say the least. This era, like all in our history, had its good and bad points and I worry that such a revisionist view of our past will be believed by young people seeing this movie--especially since films such as this are the only way most teens get their history. I know, as I've taught US and World History--kids are THAT gullible...really. I can't really blame the folks from Pleasantville for this lack of awareness in teens, but it did concern me as I watched the film.By the way, one thing I liked about the film was the courtroom scene and William Macy's acting. While he said very, very little, his face showed so much expression--now THAT'S acting!

The movie audience, having spent some time like the characters seeing everything in black and white, can share with him the experience of seeing the paintings in their full color for the first time. We have all seen the famous paintings he looks at in the book many times, but have we ever seen them with such fresh eyes? The colors, both subtle in the Old Masters and bold in the modern works, virtually jump off the pages.And continuing in this vein, when Daniels wipes Joan Allen's face with his napkin and reveals her true and vibrant skin color, it looks exactly as though he is painting her face with his strokes.

I thought it would be some kind of corny comedy and what convinced me to watch it was the cast. But 'Pleasantville' is so much more than I expected.It touches a very interesting theme of what people think of the 1950's America based on the movies and sitcoms. Most of these media portray it so stereotypically as a result of which people are under the illusion that it was a time of innocence, when people followed rules and were always 'happy', when there was no sex or violence and history was just perfect. All the women had 'perfect' hair and makeup, the guys had 'perfectly' combed hair and would wear suits or uniforms. The characters never swore etc. But, that's not how life really was and this is what 'Pleasantville' beautifully demonstrates. There aren't many well-known films or series that depict the 50's more realistically. In this film, we see that the more the characters break away from stereotype and act out of their own free will, the more realistic the 'life' becomes in the town. The colour and black and white contrast plays a crucial role as it stresses on the stereotype (that is marked with extreme colours such as black and white) but gradually people make their own choices and add more colour to their life. Through the character of the mayor, Ross also portrays the irony of society. The mayor stands against the 'colouring' of society and he gets people to protest for him yet he too, just like everyone else, has his own secret desires. Yet, it isn't only about making choices, it's about discovering something new, something that shows that there's always more to life than its present state like Jennifer's new-find interest in books, Bill's passion for painting and Betty's new-find self.Ross deserves most of the credit for his innovative writing and crafty direction. He touches on several themes such as racism and sexism. The 50's movie feel is nicely done with the score, the costumes, the sets and the acting. I really liked how Ross brought the surprise element but I hope people do not reject this film thinking that it's some silly film about two modern-day spoilt teens' adventure in a 50's sitcom. At least for me, the unusual cast drew my attention (I had forgotten that Ross was also the man behind 'Seabiscuit'). A supercute Reese Witherspoon and a naive Tobey McGuire are very convincing as siblings. Moreover, both show David and Jennifer's growth with √©lan. Joan Allen would make for a hot 50's mom. The actress is sublime. Likewise Jeff Daniels and William H. Macy are superb.'Pleasantville' remains good entertainment while it presents some relevant themes with class. I had seen Ross's 'Seabiscuit' earlier, (which is a completely different film) and both movies show his capability as a filmmaker.

One day, when they both are alone in their house, they broke the TV remote control in a fight, and a very strange repair man gives David a new remote that is capable of sending them (Jennifer and David) to the Pleasantville soap Opera, inside the TV.Trapped in a life of old fashioned values, they both need to live as Mary Sue and Bud to integrate themselves into this 50's life, so different from what they were used. What do they don't know, is the difference they will make to the Pleasantville's society and how this little society will also change them.I watched ''Pleasantville'' for the first time when I was 12, and I recently watched again with 23 years old.

The idea was intriguing enough that I thought the possibilities for comedy and slapstick were endless.  If Pleasantville had been one of those comedy capers churned out by the Disney Studios, I'm sure that is the kind of film I would have seen.  Thanks to direction and writing by Gary Ross, what I got instead was not only film magic of the highest order, but a film with so much more to say, and a film that affected me in ways I never thought possible.  Pleasantville is easily one of the most gratifying film experiences I was privileged to enjoy in the 1990's.Much of the early parts of Pleasantville are as I suspected they would be.  When brother and sister David(Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer(Reese Witherspoon) are sucked into an old black and white sitcom named Pleasantville, courtesy of a TV repairman(Don Knotts), early hilarity ensues as they cope with their situation.  It seems in Pleasantville, everything always has been and always will be Pleasant.  The people of Pleasantville existence remains constant from day to day, never changing, never experiencing sadness, hurt, or anger.  It is a land of Stepford people in a sense, not because the citizens of Pleasantville are robotic, but because they only know the pleasures and joy of the world in which they live.  At first, Bud implores his sister to go along with the program and not to upset the apple cart.  He tells her it could wreck the whole universe of Pleasantville and ruin any chance of them returning to the real world they left behind.  An easy task for the nerdish David(now Bud), who has dealt with the trials and tribulations of the real world by losing himself in the fantasy of the reruns of Pleasantville.  Alas, Jennifer(now Mary Sue), is just the opposite.  In the real world, she is a sluttish boy crazy, cigarette smoking teenager, and the world of Pleasantville is as foreign to her as the clothes she is now forced to wear.  Obviously her resolve to go along with David doesn't last very long.  It is then that, slowly Pleasantville changes from a farce, into a meaningful film experience.As David and Jennifer interact with the people of Pleasantville, the world around them slowly begins to change.  As their classmates and the townspeople learn and experiences things they never dream of, the things around them change from the drabness of black and white to color.  It can be something as small and subtle as a rose blossom or as they find new meaningful changes in their lives some of the inhabitants themselves change from black and white to color.  It is not long before the town is divided into two factions those that have experienced the joys of discovering there is more to life than the every day blandness of living in Pleasantville, and those that wish for Pleasantville to stay exactly as it always has been, never changing, never evolving, forever to remain in the suspended animation of a 50's TV sitcom idea.  There are so many great performances so many well written scenes, so much wonderful cinematography as John Lindley expertly blends together scenes of color and black and white, aided by the most purposeful use of digital effects ever seen in a film.  I could list each acting performance individually be it Maguire or Witherspoon, William H. Macy, or Joan Allan, or Jeff Daniels, but they are all exceptional and there is not enough superlatives to do so.  Add to this a beautifully rendered score by Randy Newman, and you have film perfection.I have viewed Pleasantville a number of times.  With each viewing it holds more fascination for me as I discover little gems one will miss from just having seen it once.  It is one of those films I never tire of watching and for me to run down a list of the wonderful moments encapsulated withing Pleasantville would do nothing more but to spoil those discoveries for yourself.  Much has been written about what Gary Ross may or may not have been trying to say with his film.  For me, Pleasantville says that life is ever changing.  As much as we would like for things always to remain constant, change cannot and will not be held back, nor should it be feared.  More importantly, especially in the times in which we live now, where people are quickly denigrated for opinions and thoughts beyond that of the masses, one should be able to express new ideas and different opinions without fear, without malice, and without contempt.My Grade A+         "},{"Title":"The 50s weren't really that way and the 90s weren't  that great","Date":"13 November 2005","Score":"14 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" The movie is technically clever, well-acted and beautifully photographed - but that's where the good stuff ends.The point of view of this film is that people in the 1950s were stupid, complacent, unaware and uncaring of the world outside their immediate environs. Not so. Furthermore, the film would have the viewer believe that if one drops all sexual inhibitions, whether you're a teenager or a middle aged wife and mother - only then will you be fulfilled. Again, not so. That's how we got the real life screw-ups that show up with Jerry Springer, Maury and Montel on TV every day of the week.To put this film in a historical context, the 50s were really a breathing space for America after saving the world from the Nazis and the Japanese in World War II just a few years before. In the 1950s, the United States was heavily involved in rebuilding those parts of the world devastated by a war they did not start.Before that, Americans had struggled through 12 years of severe economic hardship known as The Great Depression (effectively 1929-1941).In the 1950s, middle America was getting back on its financial feet and raising families. There was peace and the beginning of prosperity for the first time in many years. The U.S. was not filled with innocent, stupid teenagers. High school graduation rates were far higher then than now. The economy was good and unemployment was low. The polio vaccine was developed and cures for other ailments were in the works. Rock and Roll had its beginnings and the space exploration program was started. Civil rights changes were also emerging. For most people it was a very good time. Fast forward 40 years and look at today's crime stats, divorce rates, incurable STDs and high percentage of unwed mothers and consider whether or not the more moralistic 1950s were not a better time. Too many young people look like idiots with their tattoos and piercings and dressing like bums or whores. When did ripped, over-sized jeans falling off your backside become a positive fashion statement? More importantly today, consumption and greed are rampant. The U.S. has lost millions of manufacturing jobs and the borders are wide open driving down wages. It used to be a coveted privilege to emigrate here - now it's a catch and release program at best and English is becoming an optional language. Standards in everything are eroding.Look at the family sitcoms of the late 1990s like Rosanne, Malcolm in the Middle vs. Leave It To Beaver of the late 50s early 60s and consider where you would rather be.Pleasantville is a movie with little understanding and appreciation of the period in American history that it attempts to belittle by its revisionist portrayal.This film is not funny, witty nor insightful.

It is a golden idea to juxtapose monochrome with colourful graduation concurring with the evolving storyline. A present-day (1990s) high school siblings David (Maguire) and Jennifer (Witherspoon) have been transported inside their TV, as Bud and Mary Sue, the children of George and Betty Parker (H. Macy and Allen), living in a small black & white town called Pleasantville, based on a sitcom of 1950s where all its residents are also exclusively black and white and comport themselves in a monotonous harmony with storybook unconsciousness of their own feelings, books are blank, toilets are empty spaces, basket-shooting accuracy is 100%, fire and rain are non-existent, parents never hear about sex, the lovey-dovey Lovers' Lane is the place where young couples go for holding hands. In order to get back their life on track until the odd TV repairman (Knotts) is willing to transport them back to reality, David, who is a big fan of the show, proposes they should abide by their characters and act along with rest of the people, but Jennifer is a unchaste nonconformist, on their first night, she has her way with the basketball jock Skip (Walker), like the snake in the Eden, she usher sex in the town, and ignites the ripple effects with colour-transformations (from black & white to multicolour) of the unsophisticated denizens whoever experiences any degree of self-discovery and the objects as well. Betty rejects to be an archetype housewife and finds uninhibited romance with Bud's friend Bill (Daniels), whose untapped talent as a painter also be spontaneously triggered thereafter by her. Meanwhile, David (Bud) and Jennifer (Mary Sue) are also undergoing their own metamorphosis through the revolutionary shift, their own life- changing epiphanies will arrive too although from the mid-stream Jennifer is largely sidelined in the plot while David becomes a pioneering hero to defend his cause to unleash everyone's own feelings from the conservative party leads by mayor Big Bob (Walsh). A great cast of veterans, Joan Allen is the MVP as she stuns the audiences with her elegant flair to bring true vitality to her role, she is the most intrepid person in the film, the ending with an equivocal m√©nage-√†-trois scenario is a big thumb-up to the liberation of feminism. William H. Macy has less showy pieces to perform, but he effuses a drolly naivety all the way through, his final conversion is clich√© in the script but he nails it with compelling sympathy. It is also a career-defining role for Reese Witherspoon, her Jennifer is the kind of rebellious kids with an open mind about sex and a hipster's selfishness, as in Alexander Payne's ELECTION (1999, 7/10) one year later. Tobey Maguire has been consistent outstanding in his earlier filmography, not as wide-eyed as he looks, in the films he is always arresting without giving away too much information about his true feelings, it is the real deal to be a star on the big-screen, as SPIDER- MAN trilogy (2002-2007) would prove, which earns him a deluge of money but also ruins his following career, or maybe acting is not the priority in his life now, how pitiful it is. What is not so agreeable in the film? In some way, the script is too idiosyncratic to make the ends meet, one has to be a complete non-skeptic to buy all its castle-in-the-air premise, nevertheless it is a film has its distinct merits, to say the least is Randy Newman's hearty music score and Gary Ross' competence to single-handedly pin down its dystopia nucleus with sterling nostalgia lustre.

Occasionally other pictures rely on the black and white/color dichotomy, but this one does so to present an interesting idea. When a person steps outside of their normal comfort zone in the picture, they transform from black and white into color. The concept is then turned on it's head when the majority (the b&w) start to turn on those who have experienced something new (the coloreds). I don't know if that was supposed to be an overt comment on racism or not, but I got that impression, similar to the way the issue of race was handled in the Loki episode of 'Star Trek' back in the 'real' Sixties.It was also pretty cool to see one of the Sixties' most memorable character actors, Don Knotts, in the role of the TV repairman. I'm glad they had his personality toned down as opposed to the brainless deputy Barney Fife he portrayed on the Andy Griffith Show. What a neat way to make the transition from the 1998 (then) present to the decades earlier past. Reading some of the other reviews posted on this board, it's kind of comical to me to see how young present day viewers interpret a past they hadn't lived through and which they can't fully understand. Entertainment media in all forms has undergone a gradual transition over time and what once were taboo subjects for TV like the word 'pregnant', are almost unimaginable today with the way anything goes nowadays. I'm reminded of my own son when he was only about eight years old asking me if when I was a kid, did everything exist in only black and white.

Such 1950's television shows like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver hit the airwaves and create a generation of its own kind. But as time went on, television soon began to experiment on controversial social subject matter. Television shows like All in the Family, The Jeffersons and St. Elsewhere told American families and households about certain social issues such as rape, AIDS, the Vietnam War, racism and even sexual oppression. However, there was one television show that was clearly flipped upside-down. That show was called Pleasantville.Pleasantville is a film that I was very surprised by because of its ideology toward different time values. In the 1990's, modest, but shy high-school student David (Tobey Maguire) is a fan of the fictional 1950's TV Sitcom, Pleasantville. His sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), is not a fan of the show and would rather watch a concert on MTV instead. One night, David is hinted that a Pleasantville marathon is coming on in 20 minutes. But, Jennifer wants to watch the concert that she was waiting for on MTV. In the middle of the scuffle, the TV remote control breaks. An strange and old TV repairman, (Don Knotts) stops by and gives David a very awkward, but very special TV remote control. After the TV repair leaves, the fighting continues and as the fighting goes on, the TV remote control transports both David and Jennifer into Pleasantville itself. Instead of being Jennifer and David, they are both children of Pleasantville parents George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). At first, the siblings decide to play along as the Pleasantville children, Bud and Mary Sue. In the dear old town of Pleasantville, everything is calm. Everything is utopia. But, that's about to change. Soon enough, the world of this peaceful town starts to change for the better. First, Jennifer goes on a date with Skip (Paul Walker) and then goes on to make love to him. That, of course, is the introduction to sex in Pleasantville. In another scenario, Bud introduces books to the teens of the town and in another scene, Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), starts to paint provocative paintings, especially one particular painting involving a nude painting of Betty. After social issues starts to take its toll on Pleasantville, the entire town and citizens starts to turn into Technicolor. The community is split up between people who are black and white and those that are Technicolor. The mayor of Pleasantville, (J.T. Walsh, in his final film role), decides to create a Plesantville code of conduct that somewhat mirrors the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. It seems that the reason why everyone is turning colors is because of emotions. With that being said, Plesantville doesn't have to be pleasant after all.The movie was directed by Gary Ross, who also worked on previous movies like Big and Dave. This is particularly his best work since the two. The interesting ideas that surrounds this movie is the difference in time values between the 1950's and the 1990's. The movie dares us to ask ourselves, What is our values toward different time eras?. It is a big contrast, yes, but it makes total sense on what certain things have to be like in a community like Plesantville. Back then, Mom always had a freshly cooked meatloaf sitting at the dinner table and Dad always coming to a nice clean house. In this time of age, that's not even presentable. Things have changed over the years in our American social history. And, as we progress toward the future, our values would increasingly differ from our earlier years.One thing that also stuck out to me is the way the movie pays a great deal of contribution to American television. I was around during 1998, which is the year this movie came out. The only thing is that I was just a baby. But, I can tell that in this world, the only things that people are attracted to are the media and the technology advantages that makes this world so much different that that from the 50's. Another film that have used this kind of ideology is Peter Weir's film, The Truman Show, which was released the same year as Pleasantville. I think that these two films really tells us how far we come from a world of both entertainment values and social values.The movie is very well photographed by John Lindley and it creates a Technicolor world of imagination and fantasy. The special effects are marvelous and it works mostly because it blends with the storyline, telling us how this peaceful town get turned into a understandable environment. Even as upcoming movie stars, Tobey Magiure and Reese Witherspoon bring out the charm and humor of their characters and make them into the heroes of Pleasantville. They are smart enough to make this town into understanding their own values toward life and society. Even with that being said, the movie create a sense of unpredictability.Plesantville is a funny, smart and charming fantasy that creates a world full of imagination and wonder. Its look and photography paints a elaborate storyline that moves a certain pace with humor. At first, I didn't know if I like this movie because I have heard of it before. Well, I like it a lot and I do think it's one of the best films of 1998. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4 stars.

It is not like anything I have seen recently. I was vaguely aware of the basic premise when the movie came out, probably from reading a review. It was done very well, the symbolism being out there for everyone, but not beating us over the head with it. When the NO COLOREDS sign appeared in a shop window, I was afraid it was going to get ultra-preachy about race, but they just made the point and moved on. Reese Witherspoon was so beautiful here. Apparently she was about twenty-one when it was filmed, but I could see that certain something, the charisma of a movie star. Joan Allen was also very, very good in a somewhat sad part. I resisted watching this film, but wish I hadn't. It's pretty good!

With this being said I find myself intrigued and mesmerized with those deeper movies. By that I don't mean the ones about love altogether but one's that are past the mindless explosions-for-the-sake-of-explosions movies, but use symbolism to relate to the viewer, as well as conveying new ideas in a more thought-provoking manner. So I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the film. The film begins with a teenager by the name of David, who let's just say does not have the greatest home life. He copes with this by seeking refuge in the 50's perfect world, portrayed in a sitcom called Pleasantville. His sister, Jennifer's character, however is contrary to his. She is wild and enjoys life's thrills, worries about her appearance, and how she is perceived by those around her. The film really begins to take shape as the two characters are actually thrown into the sitcom. In the sitcom, all the characters are black and white but as David and his sister bring imperfection to their world they begin to see colors appearing on certain people in the sitcom. It seems that things such as sex, violence, sadness, and other feelings that are not pleasant trigger the change in color.However, it is not the corruption that causes color in Pleasantville, rather it symbolizes when people live life to the fullest with a wide array of feelings, not just the good, but the bad too, all of themselves. So when the black and white characters begin to experience some of these new feelings such as love they begin really living. The beauty of the color as opposed to black and white also symbolizes the beauty in living life to the fullness. The symbolic reasons as to why people obtain color is perhaps best evident (as well as the 'courtroom scene', which was one of my favorite scenes) when David and his sister are one of the last of the main characters to obtain color. David obtains color when he stands up for his mother. This displays David exercising an unexplored side of his personality, where he generally is content with his life and what is happening. But his stepping out of his comfort zone causes him to live a fuller life. His sister obtains color when she reads a book and genuinely enjoys it. This symbolizes that the best parts of themselves, the parts they never knew existed were there all along and once you experience all of life, its beauty and majesty, then can we live full lives, and in doing so we may have to do things out of the status quo (as Bud and Mr.Johnson did when they painted the mural on the wall, knowing they would be persecuted and ridiculed by other members of the town). Another great use of symbolism is the ending when Jennifer chooses to stay in Pleasantville, while Bud chooses to go back to his imperfect world. This shows that Bud, although wishing he could live in Peasantville originally, realized that a perfect world has no surprises, no newness to it and that he should embrace his imperfect world, as he realized in his time in Pleasantville. He also realized that he should just live and not expect things to be a certain way and that life will be life and it was meant to be lived to the fullest of our potential and embraced. While, his sister though wild at the start and hated Pleasantville originally, found that the best part of her was her thirst for knowledge and new love of literature, something in which she never knew she had in her. Besides the great theme, and beautiful portrayal through various accounts of symbolism there were also wonderful casting done in this film, as well as wonderful performances particularly by Maguire, and Daniels. I would highly recommend the film to those in search of the deeper film "},{"Title":"Pleasantville has come home to roost","Date":"24 October 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" A really great movie.

I was struck by the resemblance between the Pleasantville chamber of commerce and how they discouraged any sort of thought, and the Tea Party supporters that we hear all the time talking about their wish to reinstate those same types of traditional values.

This is, by far, one of my favorite films to date. This initially appears to be a somewhat light film about 2 modern day characters ( Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) that have a run-in with Don Knotts as a T.V. repairmen. The outcome of which ends them both in the T.V. show of Pleasantville. A place where the temperature is always 72 degrees, the sun always shines, and everything is in black and white, and ...pleasant.After the initial shock wears off, both characters discover how 2-dimensional the characters in Pleasantville are. They find themselves as the main characters in a 50's T.V. show as children of George and Betty Parker. The actors in this film do a phenomenal job portraying a life devoid of passion. They find that all of the characters go about life in a mechanical fashion, without any knowledge of lust, hope, grief, or anger.Reese's character (Jennifer) quickly turns to her old ways, and promptly takes her 'boyfriend' (Paul Walker of The Fast and the Furious fame) to lovers lane. She shows him the joys of sex, at which point, the exodus from Eden begins. Shortly after Paul drops Reese off at home, he sees a single red rose. By red, I mean this is the only non black and white thing in Pleasantville. From here on the movie reaches out and grabs you. It turns into a cascading affect of self discovery, both good and bad for the citizens of Smallville. Initially all of the high school kids enter onto this path, as glimpses here and there of pink bubble gum, neon signs at the local hang out/diner, rose red lips, and curiosity about the previously unknown world outside of Pleasantville. The Diner and Lovers lane become a place of color in a black and white world with many allegories to The Garden of Eden.They discover things like love, lust, wonder about the world around them. This is where I disagree with many of the reviews here. This is a movie about passion. You have to look beyond the first and most obvious things that curious teenagers do. The changes in the children begin to happen with the parents. Suddenly dinner isn't cooked and ready at 6. A wife burns her husband's shirt with a iron because she was daydreaming. They see rain and rainbows in Technicolor for the first time, and a tree in front of the Parkers' household bursts into flame as the mother (Joan Allen) pleasures herself in the bathroom (with a little instruction from Reese Witherspoon on the facts of life). These scenes are all tastefully done.From here the film takes a turn into the darker side of human emotion. Soon, the 'coloreds' are drawing attention to the fact that things are changing in Pleasantville. Signs stating that no coloreds are allowed start appearing on Main Street while the coloreds continue to explore themselves and the world around them. Angry mobs begin to form, trying to stamp out any sign of change. As each person discovers passion in some form (whether hate, love, lust, bigotry, grief, regret), they turn into coloreds who then initially hide in the local soda shop, desperate to escape the angry mobs outside. A new city ordinance is passed declaring what music is acceptable, and what colors are safe (as long as they are a shade of gray).Jeff Daniels also shines here as the local Diner owner. He finds himself attracted to Miss Parker, who in turn finds herself drawn to him even though her character is 'happily' married. Daniels also finds he has a passion for art. He goes from a mechanical shop keeper to a person in love, who also stands defiant with Tobey Maguire in painting a naked mural showing Miss Parker. This sets off a riot, and ends with the Diner being trashed and a bonfire culminating in a book burning. Some of these moments have you sitting with a lump in our throat from the raw emotion the visuals and the music evoke from this film.Suffice it to say; this is one of the finest and most original films I've ever seen, and certainly not to be missed. For those that think this is an attack on moral values, you have missed the point. This is not about lust, or promiscuity. It simply shows that were are all human. We make mistakes. We love. We live. As a result, we have passions of which sometimes you cannot control.

The use of color, or lack there of works two different ways.  First, it makes the story a whites and colored film.  It's about oppression based on your color.  This film tries to show, and i think succeeds in showing how closed minded people can be when it comes to the color of your skin.  The other reason that the use of black and white and color is a good idea is because of how they deal with it.  You become color by discovering something inside yourself, something you never saw...a passion, a understanding.  The film implies how learning about ourselves gives up a favor, makes us all colorful.Gary Ross does a great job at the filming of this.

But this movie is done in such an innovative way that it is an instant classic.  This movie will definitely be in the Oscar race, and has a good chance at winning.

It's subtle message about tolerance for diversity ought to be required viewing for those of us who make public policy and influence public opinion.Television of the Fifties seems to have fashioned an image of the American family that permeates our political views and social mores right down to today. Not that families were any better or worse during the Fifties, but the image that television created with families from Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It To Beaver, Father Knows Best, right through to the Brady Bunch seem to set impossible standards. Including a favorite of mine, the Donna Reed Show which I believe was the model for the Parker family in Pleasantville. Starting with your's truly, I don't know anyone who had an upbringing like in a TV family.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play a pair of current teens who don't have the greatest of home lives. Maguire is a nerdy kid and Witherspoon is a very serious version of Kelly Bundy who thinks if she sleeps around, she'll be popular and hasn't much interest in education.One night while Witherspoon is running late for a date and Maguire is getting ready for a marathon showing of the popular Fifties family comedy Pleasantville the remote breaks down. As if by magic, a TV repairman played by Don Knotts shows up with a very special remote. As Witherspoon and Maguire fight over the remote by magic they are transported into the television set and become part of the self contained universe of Pleasantville. Oh, and they are in black and white as the show was taped back in the day. So with their new identities from the teenage kids of the Parker family with ideal mom and dad Joan Allen and William H. Macy, Maguire and Witherspoon seek to adjust to a new life in television land. But just the introduction of these two into this well ordered universe changes things, first in the most subtle ways and then as both realize the problems with this world in more direct ways. As the change comes, color comes slowly creeping into the black and white images. Pleasantville got Oscar nominations for Art&Set Design, Original Score, and Costume Design unfortunately not winning any. However it won Saturn Awards for Tobey Maguire and Joan Allen for Best Actor and Supporting Actress in a Science Fiction film. I prefer to think of it as a fantasy rather than a science fiction film, though I can see that science fiction certainly influenced the creation. It combines the best elements of a Star Trek TNG pair of episodes involving Data and LeForge with a holodeck character based on Professor Moriarty and how he's dealt with and an original episode involving Kirk and Spock and some of the rest of the crew landing on a planet where the philosophy of a former sage named Landru is enforced vigorously. There's a bit of the Stepford Wives here as well.In fact in the role of the head of the Pleasantville Men's Association is J.T. Walsh in a farewell performance. Such things that don't fit his ideas and those of an influential few are just not permitted in their paradise. Pleasantville is also the last big screen appearance of Don Knotts, an interesting choice for the TV repairman as he was a regular on the most wholesome Andy Griffith Show.Pleasantville is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century. It illustrates that humanity's real strength is in its diversity and how we respect that diversity. It's what brings out the best in the human character, in the human spirit.

Not to mention rewarding. Far more than you might imagine. It really is a wonderful film. I can't praise it enough. It is so good. And intelligent. And entertaining. All qualities in short supply in films nowadays but are in Pleasantville by the bucketload.Pleasantville was a little overshadowed in 1998 by The Truman Show, even though they're equally great films. But although they cover similar ground, they are quite different. They share the same conceit of television thrust upon the unsuspecting individual, but the worlds they inhabit are diametrically opposed. Truman's world was an artificial construct designed for him to interact with. But in the case of Pleasantville, this is a self-contained world with actual people who inhabit it. But all within the boundaries of television programming.Pleasantville is actually a 1950s sitcom. A cosy, b/w world of picket fences, malt shops and bowling alleys. Everyone is happy. Everyone lives normal, untroubled lives. The weather is always perfect. And the people are perfectly content.In our world, David (Tobey Maguire) is a social outcast at school. And he has a distant relationship with his Mum and rebellious sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). His only means of escape is the uncomplicated world of Pleasantville. While waiting for a Pleasantville marathon, a TV repairman turns up, and gives David a new remote control. When Jennifer wants to watch something else, they fight over the remote, and end up zapped inside Pleasantville.Taking on the characters of Bud and Mary-Sue, David and Jennifer begin to explore this new world. Their fictional parents are George and Betty Parker (two wonderful performances from William H Macy and especially Joan Allen). George is the strait-laced Father Knows Best, and Betty is the happy homemaker. But they're not really people. They're two-dimensional characters inhabiting a flat, insular, sexless, joyless environment.The first half of the film is enjoyable because it allows us time to speculate what the film might be about. Perhaps a witty, even gently scathing satire on classic American sitcoms and family values. Where these people are so touching in their naivet√©, and so willing to believe in the noble intentions of others. But as the film progresses, it soon becomes more than enjoyable. It becomes extraordinary.Jennifer is unhappy. Geography lessons only consist of the world of Pleasantville. Books have no writing in them. Parents sleep in separate beds. And no-one has ever heard of sex. Jennifer changes that when she introduces the concept of sex to the captain of the basketball team. In Pleasantville, nobody ever loses at basketball. They make a basket every time. But now, after having sex, the captain misses. And that's only the beginning.David and Jennifer's presence begins to introduce startling changes. The kids are the first ones to notice. The basketball team are now missing almost every time. They're all discovering the sexual act. And their behaviour is starting to change. They actually now have a thirst for knowledge. After Jennifer accidentally introduces them to the joys of reading, now that the books are no longer blank, the kids want to learn more about the world beyond Pleasantville. A concept completely alien to them before.The characters of Pleasantville are beginning to think for themselves. They're becoming self-aware. And eventually, their self-discovery develops to the point where they're no longer two-dimensional, b/w caricatures. But fully realised, three-dimensional, in-colour, individuals.Director Gary Ross is careful the way he introduces colour into the picture. It happens gradually. Like a red rose in a grey flower-bed. Or a green neon sign in a b/w background. The way colour is utilised in this film is superb. The in-colour people stand out with an astonishing beauty. Or the breathtaking scene when David is driving through a b/w grove showered by pink cherry blossoms. Those scenes resonate with a vitality that is just wonderful to watch.Eventually the adults start to catch on too. It's marvellously satisfying when Betty learns about orgasms from Jennifer, and as she slowly breaks out of the confines of her character, she eventually learns the joy of thinking for one's self. Initially when she goes to colour, she at first tries to hide it with makeup.But when she meets Mr Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the owner of a diner, she starts to reconsider her position. Mr Johnson discovers self-awareness through artistic expression. He loves to paint now that colour has entered the world of Pleasantville. And when he paints a portrait of Betty, she comes to cherish her individuality.Because of the sweeping changes, not everyone welcomes them. Big Bob (J T Walsh's final film role), the mayor insists on things staying the way they always have. And unites the people against the 'coloureds.'First and foremost, Pleasantville is a film of ideas. And its never short of them. Gary Ross manages to find an astonishing level of nuances, as well as a rich subtext. Covering everything from racism, feminism, teenage rebellion, homosexuality, sexual awareness and so on. It communicates the ideal of the sharing of new ideas through art, philosophy, literature, and how change is necessary for a society to survive. The people in b/w represent those opposed to change. The acting is wonderful throughout, and I love the way the people become proud of their new identitiesGeorge Betty, whatever's happening to you. It will go away. Betty What if I don't want it to go away?The final scenes are exhilarating, as the whole town goes to colour. It appears so vibrant and beautiful, my heart soared with joy. The music is perfectly matched to the tone as well, creating joyous surges of well-being. I could go on praising Pleasantville all day. I love it so much. A true, modern classic. And a potent, symbolic message of hope and new ideals.Wonderful! Simply wonderful!

In my personal opinion, a movie is unlike a book in that there are many things aside from the symbolism or opinions expressed that have to be taken into consideration when reviewing it (for example, cinematography, lighting, acting, casting, soundtrack, etc.). When you see a movie, you may disagree with the message that the director is trying to force upon the audience, but giving a rating of 1 seems a little too stingy. If you want to get into an academic or political debate, I'm sure that there are a lot of people who would be willing to disagree with your point of view. However, you would be grievously mistaken to write all people with different opinions off as stupid. it is inevitable that people will disagree about things. The director of the movie obviously has a certain idea of what life should be like; whether or not you agree with that is your business. I understand the arguments that some have posed regarding this movie, even if I don't entirely agree with the assumptions that they have made. The difference is I don't write them off as stupid people (i wouldn't give you a intelligence rating of 1 just because i disagree with you). In any case, there are other factors to consider when rating a movie. People who gave a rating of 1 failed to mention any of the other aspects of the movie (for example, were you as displeased with the acting as much as you were with the writing?). In short, I loved Pleasantville. I think that it was entertaining, as well as thought provoking. At the same time, it appeals to many different audiences (much like Shakespeare did). I think that this is the mark of a good film. Even if you disagree with some of the ideals that are presented in the movie, you would be hard pressed to criticize the soundtrack or cinematography of Pleasantville (not to mention the acting). Personally, I wouldn't be willing to spend time writing a several paragraph review of a movie that only got a score of 1. It simply wouldn't be worth my time. In my opinion, a 1 would be a movie with no redeeming qualities that I could not watch start to finish. I seriously doubt that this is the case with people who gave Pleasantville such a low score. If you have not seen Pleasantville, do so now. It is definitely worth watching once, if not many times.

When the movie was commercially released, I didn't think a whole lot of it, thinking that it looked cookie-cutter, and now I feel that I've missed out, and have since brought it on DVD.I'm not going to go into the storyline synopsis, since so many of you probably already have seen it from the movie's main page.  I will, however, give examples of how this movie works.First of all, the special effects; this is a movie where the special effect enhance the story instead of them taking the place of the story.  The mixture of black-and-white with color is absolutely remarkable.  In my opinion, the characters changing from black-and-white to color is attributed to them breaking away from their normal routines and becoming more of a three-dimensional kind of person.  For example, Reese Whitherspoon's character is promiscuous and not intrested in doing much with her life,but when she  starts to read and study, she realizes that there is more to life than the next date.  Same with Tobey Maguire's character; when he gets sucked into that TV world, he's pretty introverted, not very quick to socialize.  As the days go by, he in a sense is responsible for instigating the rebellious nature of the other teenagers, and it hits a peak when he introduces violence to the town, even though he's defending his TV mother. It's at this point that he realizes that it's not supposed to be perfect...it's not 'supposed to be' anything.Another big aspect that makes Pleasantville work is the character development.  In a sense, all of the characters are major stereotypes of themselves, but as the movie goes on, each character tends to become self-aware.  Several of the black-and-white characters are fighting so hard to keep the status quo that the characters in color are starting to become repressed (a rather obvious reference to segregation).There are several other parallels in the story (garden of eden, kristallnacht, etc), there are too many to mention in this one review. I'd just like to conclude by saying that I really recommend this movie to anyone who would be intrested in a good story and not just Hollywood pandering. It's not the perfect movie in the world, but definately one that people should take a cue from.Grade A "},{"Title":"One Of My Favorite Films of All-Time","Date":"31 July 2002","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  (The following discusses and analyzes plot, characters and themes in detail. Those not wanting to receive spoilers should not read this review.)Very rarely do I fall in love with a movie and want to watch it over and over again.  Casablanca is one such film for me and another is Pleasantville.  Watching Pleasantville was one of the most magical film experiences of my life.The idea behind the story is simple.  Take modern teenagers and transport them into the candy-coated 1950s world of a Leave-It-To Beaver television show.  However, producer-writer-director Gary Ross transcends the Jetsons Meet the Flintstones story idea and uses it as a starting point to create a modern fable of shockingly refreshing wisdom.The movie begins in modern day where High School students sit bored as their teachers educate them as to the plagues of modern times -- global warming, sexually transmitted diseases, and other horrors.  It is at this point we meet nerdy David, played by the amazing Tobey Maguire.  David and his sister Jennifer, played by the irrepressible Reese Witherspoon, are children of divorce.  David has a passion for an old 1950s show named Pleasantville where at all times things are pleasant.  His passion for the show is that of a zealous Star Trek fan who knows every line of every episode.  There is poignancy to David's obsession, because the viewer understands that Pleasantville is an escape to a more stable family environment than the one fate has provided for him.However, fantasies often come crashing down when attempted in real life. In a surprising magical leap through the television (supplied by the lovable Don Knotts), David and Jennifer are transported into the Pleasantville black-and-white TV world.  Until they can figure out how to return home, they live the lives of characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker.For Jennifer, a sexually liberated teen, Pleasantville is a drag, so she attempts to introduce modern sexual liberation into the Pleasantville world.  Instantly color is introduced on to the screen.  A rose is shown as true, brilliant red.  When word spreads that love can be expressed in physical form, many younger and older couples begin to have sex.  Some who have sex become colored while others remain black-and-white.  There is a mystery as to why some become colored while others do not.Bud and Jennifer begin talking to students and citizens of Pleasantville about the greatest works in English literature and the greatest paintings in the world, and lines form at the library while impressionist, cubist and modern art begins to appear on the Soda Shop front window.  The people engaging in these passionate ventures are turned from black-and-white to color.It is at this point that we understand the logic.  It is not the act of sex or the mere act of reading a book that turns the characters colored.  It is the passion for creativity, imagination and love that makes the change when ignited in each individual's soul.While change occurs, some in Pleasantville fear change.  The Chamber of Commerce, led by the town's mayor Big Bob (in the last towering performance of J.T. Walsh) takes action to quash the sexually suggestive paintings and books.  They are blind to the imagination and passion going on all around them.  All they see is dirty filthy smut.  They organize a book burning, and create rules of conduct that forces all residents of Pleasantville to act as they did before David and Jennifer entered their world, including the requirement that the only colors allowed are black, white and gray and all citizens must remain pleasant at all times.  I won't give away the end here.When one finishes viewing this masterpiece, one remembers it started out from a simple story idea and ends in book burnings, mob violence, and a defense of creativity and brilliance.  It debunks and criticizes those in public life that would keep our minds small and our ambition to be different even smaller.When this movie came out, it received a lot of criticism from the religious right and radio-talk show hosts like, Dr. Laura Schlesinger, who like the Chamber of Commerce, only saw dirty filthy smut.  They complained that this movie encouraged promiscuity.  It goes without saying that these groups and individuals entirely missed the point.  The movie was explicit that having sex did not change a character from black-and-white to color.  Only true passion and love for something new would do that.  These criticisms remind us that people like the Chamber of Commerce characters do actually exist. They are the ones that ban books, enforce rigid codes of conduct, and protest art that pushes the limit of what a narrow conservative few expect.Pleasantville is one of the most beautifully filmed, thoughtful, and mesmerizing films that I have ever watched in my life.

I must say that this movie will enhance the audience and will open people up if they are willing to take the time and go deep into the valley of their mind. Pleasantville will change you, I am not joking!The movie makes an entrance at poking fun of those old sitcoms as spoofs like Leave it to beaver Father Knows Best The Andy Griffith, Dick Van Dyke but ends up becoming one perfect political satire statement.This is a follow up of the book Fahrenheit 451 as well as The Truman Show but with a different twist. All the people in Pleasantville, as well as us (The audience member) , are though how we must live through change! At first, pleasantville is seen as this quiet little perfect simple minded community, where Everything is good with the world but then we learn that even though everyone is happy in Pleasantville, inside they are actually miserable.

There are no opportunities in Pleasantville, without this, progression cease to exist, without progression, there are no challenges, without challenges, there are no problems.

They share to the world of Pleasantville their culture from the 1990's, and from there progression took place. People then had sex for the first time, basketball shots were missed, the ended up losing their first basketball game ever, and it later brought a bit of color to the town and opportunity. Yes, riots broke out, but they then learned how to defend themselves.

Since it was marketed as a comedy at first, it didn't sound all that appealing.When I caught it on cable later, I was pleasantly (no pun intended) surprised.  Tobey Maguire was especially good in the lead role, and Reese Witherspoon delivered the best performance I've ever seen from her, although that's not saying a lot.  Joan Allen and William Macy are great as the 50's parents who have it all together on the surface but are terribly conflicted internally.However, this film suffers from two things terminal cuteness and a 50's phobia that is so cliched it's tiresome.  The theme of the movie shifts abruptly from a standard science-fiction premise (Maguire cautions his sister not to do anything that will destroy Pleasantville's reality or they may never get back home) to a simplistic screed on racism and stifling conventionality.  Not that there's anything wrong with fighting racism, but maybe it would have been better to introduce the theme a little earlier, when the two were in the 90's.  (Yes, it DOES exist in the 90's and 00's too.)As far as the stifling convention goes, Hollywood seems to consider the 50's the Decade From Hell and takes every opportunity to let us know that.  This is the effect that the Baby Boomers have had on the entertainment industry; they feel they rescued America from the 50's by giving us the 60's and 70's.  That's fine, they're entitled to their opinion, but if I have to see one more movie based on that thought I think I'm going to puke.  Get over it -- the 50's are forty years gone already.Other than that (my soapbox commentary!) the film is really pretty good and worth watching.

And, just like David, I too wished I could warp back in time to live in a simpler and more innocent era (and/or to be transported into my favorite classic tv sitcom).C'mon, be honest. Who among us hasn't wished that? I think that most of the reviews here bears me out on that. The enormous majority of positive reviews always mention the first half of the film with absolute delight while barely mentioning the second half of the film. The negative reviews harps on the second half of the film, barely mentioning the first half.To watch David and Jennifer warp into a 1950's sitcom and have to live in it as if it were real life was quite thrilling. Oh, the possibilities! This movie gives one an idea of what that would be like. It kind of fulfilled that fantasy of mine to go back in time, to LIVE in one of my favorite sitcoms as if it were real. I truly wish that part of the film was a little more played out.  I found it quite funny for David to know everyone, everything, every nuance about the tv show which made it easy for him to get along with the program.David/Bud and Jennifer/Mary Sue are walking down the street on their way to schoolMr. Simpson Hello Bud!David/Bud Hello Mr. Simpson!Mr. Simpson I hear your father has a new car.David/Bud Oh yeah, a Buick. It's swell.Mr. Simpson Great!Jennifer/Mary Sue You know that guy?David/Bud Yeah, he owns the Hardware store.But Pleasantville, which starts out as a comedy/fantasy film, changes gears midway and turns into a sociological/political argument against the fifties and against any modern day romanticism of those years which almost ruins the movie.  After all, a movie is supposed to provide entertainment and what better way to do that than to let us live out our fantasies vicariously? The film lets us do that for just a little while then does an about face and trashes our fantasies, and by extension, trashes those of us who look back on the past somewhat nostalgically. When it comes to the fifties, there are things we could have done without segregation, the cold war, McCarthyism, etc. But there are some things that they were doing so right back then (lower crime rate, lower illegitimacy rate, an educational system that was the envy of the world, fewer divorces, more two parent families and fewer single parents, a healthy respect for religion, children and teenagers treated their elders with more respect, profanity wasnt a part of the everyday language, a Hollywood that was still producing mostly family friendly movies and tv shows, etc.) that we are doing so horribly wrong today.I wouldnt change parts of the film where David and Jennifer introduce and teach the residents of Pleasantville how to do things differently in their day to day lives (except for the sex parts which this movie wouldn't have suffered without) thereby introducing color to the town, but at the same time, I would have done it without having to attack a person's beliefs. The saving grace of the second half of the film is that Jennifer learns something from the towns simple ways, discovering that there are more things to life than her 1990's sluttish ways (like reading a book of classic literature) and becomes enchanted with the 1950's more innocent ways.The special effects are incredible. I liked the crowd scenes of Black and White people mixed in with colored people. The scene in which David/Bud and Margaret (the both of them still in Black and White) are driving down a road in a yellow 1950's convertible car while pink petals are blown all over the place, simply took my breath away the first time I saw that scene. And after multiple viewings, it never ceases to please the heart and puts a smile on my face. It simply has to be the most beautiful scene ever filmed. My only criticism of this scene is that it is too short. I wish it were a much longer scene.In spite of the heavy handed parts of the second half and in spite of my own minor criticisms, I truly love this film and I highly reccomend Pleasantville.

In other words, it suggests that change is always beautiful, ultimately makes everybody happy, and leaves no battle scars. Groovy, man.Well, the radical changes that took place in the late 60's did much good they broke down a lot of prejudices and opened up many young minds to the possibilities of life. They also left us with rampant egotism, mistrust (even hatred) of authority, and a party's-over cynicism that, 30 years later, has only gotten worse.The key problem with Pleasantville is that, despite a rushed (and insincere) reality check at the very end of the film, writer/director Gary Ross wants us to believe that changing the world is as simple as opening up your mind to sex, jazz and art. It's hard to really see this as a metaphor for greater things; Pleasantville is much too simplistic in its power to the people faux-idealism to mean much more than what it shows on the surface.It's also very significant to note that, by film's end, the town of Pleasantville is completely technicolored and every citizen is just as happy and docile on the surface as they appeared in their black and white beginning.

The fifties ARE gone, most likely ( hopefully ) never to return. Yet the Norman Rockwell places of America are dwindling rapidly, and many people cherish them. Myself included. 2 )Typical of Hollywood, there's a sore lack of spirituality in Pleasantville. Not RELIGION, there's a difference. Wouldn't citizens of a liberated community discover the trancendance of THAT as well as the earthly pleasures? *POSSIBLE SPOILERS-WARNING!* 3) Yes, sex is fantastic, but not always. On on occasion girls DO get pregnant. It's unfortunate yes, but it's funny this film doesn't address this. ( Although most movies don't. Fantasies sell better ) 3) Narratively, Gary Ross' screenplay revelations are convoluted. Why didMagical Don Knotts show up to give the kids the magic remote anyway?Why did he get upset when things on the show started changing. ( He must have known that would happen.) How is the boy going to explain to his mother that his sister has gone off to college in a paralel universe?Anyway, I gave up church for the same reasons. NOBODY knows what's best for EVERYBODY.

On one hand, we are told a `Pleasant' world where everyone is comfortable with their lives is not as viable as a world colored with teenage sex and adultery.  Yet, on the other hand the instrument of change (one of the main characters) ended up deciding to stay in this now improved, but still, fifties world.  Her words, `I've done the slut thing,' are ironic as her doing her `slut' thing was what lead to the supposed improvements in Pleasantville.  Another theme in the movie is the use of the term `Coloreds,' and how it relates to the supposed bigotry of `Pleasantville.'  Please.  Is this producer really trying to compare a bewildered town's anxiety with its population sudden randiness with that of the atrocities of the Civil Rights Era?  Finally, why do the producers of this movie believe there are no words in the books of their town?  Weren't most classics written prior to the fifties?

I thought it was a novel idea.But I hated the message it left. It starts off giving you the feeling that times were better back in the 1950's than they are today - no aids, teenage pregnancies were much less a problem, the big problem in school was getting caught chewing gum in the classroom, etc. But then the movie betrays you. It mocks the 1950's, the Father Knows Best lifestyle of that era, and - somehow - tries to sell you the idea that we are better off today. Apparently, in the writers' minds, the civil rights struggle eclipsed all of the good things that the '50's had to offer. Well, I am not a racist or segregationist, but I cannot buy that line. With drug and alcohol abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, teenage pregnancies, and the disrespect teenagers have towards authority, I would take the '50's back in a heartbeat. This is sending a bad message to kids. A very immoral message.About the same time this movie came out, another movie was released called Blast from the Past. Like Pleasantville, that movie highlighted the differences in our culture between the '50's and the '90's. Unlike Pleasantville, it did not mock those traditional moral values. On the contrary, it portrayed Brandon Fraiser's character as being well bred, well educated (as a home schooler), and with respect and admiration toward his parents. How often do you see that on TV or in Hollywood? I would recommend that movie over this one, hands down.

It tries to be a very serious message movie and a fun lighthearted one at the same time. Better to take it as a bad joke of a movie than as a serious one. It really fails on both levels. The sophomoric sledgehammer metaphors really sunk this one for me.The conflict is a modern 90's, sexually aware, colorful, liberal pop culture (good) against a 50's style uptight, repressed, black and white, conservative town (evil). Both sides are portrayed in stereotypes so narrow they look like they were written by a 12 year old. Gee, where have I seen a them like that before? The black and white people are conservative ugly racists, while the good liberal colorful people are wonderful because they get to be true to themselves and become sexually aware because they masturbate.Perhaps the most ridiculous scene is where the girlfriend picks a red apple from a tree and hands it to the hero. The film plays with many religious and moral issues but doesn't have a single thought provoking thing to say about them. Anyone who wants a film with religious messages can surely find better ones than this! The best part of the film is Reese Witherspoon's performance. She plays a good character who has an ugly side of her own. She can't save the film on her own though because the characters are nothing more than cardboard cut-outs. This film is full of the kind of dumbed down politically correct drivel that is very popular these days. Those who think that Al Gore is a hero will probably think that Tobey Maguire's character in this film is one also.

In Pleasantville, David and Jennifer get transferred into the television show and live out the lives of Bud and Mary Sue. Bud and Mary Sue enter a world full of censorship, a world in which the only colors permissible are black, gray and white. In the world of Pleasantville there is no messing around, things are orderly, every shot in the basket goes in and at the end of the street is the beginning of the same street. Yet this goes a little astray when Bud and Mary Sue aren't as 'pleasant' as the rest of the town which restores some color; the first very delicate pink rose grows in a world full of gray. Gary Ross has done a great job telling the story much like in his most recent movie The Hunger Games. Pleasantville is not particularly similar to The Hunger Games, yet is has some similarities like both Bud and Katniss step into strange alien world in which they change their surroundings, much like when Katniss wins the Hunger Games and wins the hearts of Panem, Bud attempts to unify all of the people of Pleasantville.The movie is a well filmed production and has a heart warming storyline and really makes you appreciate the world in which you live in. "},{"Title":"An absolutely wonderful, thought-provoking parable on society","Date":"6 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" The first film directed by Gary Ross, this is an absolutely wonderful and thought-provoking parable on society. It concerns a pair of teenage twins who are transported into the universe of a 1950s sitcom Pleasantville, a seemingly idyllic place where firemen only save cats from trees because there are no fires, everyone is terribly wholesome and sweet and the closest thing to dramatic conflict is a date being cancelled because of an unfortunate case of the measles. However, it soon becomes clear that there is a dark underbelly to this world as conformity is stressed above all else and people, women in particular, are expected to know their place.The first rate script by Ross, whose previous credits include classic films such as Big and Dave, is a powerful statement on the problems which existed in 1950s America but are certainly not exclusive to that time or place. It nicely deconstructs the dippy world inhabited by characters of that era's sitcoms such as Leave It to Beaver or Father Knows Best, which (almost) completely ignored the social issues of the time as well as the existence of people who weren't white and middle class. In 234 episodes of the former, only one black character appeared and she was a maid. The special effects were innovative for their time and never look less than brilliant. It was shot entirely in colour and decolourised where appropriate, in stark contrast to the events of the film itself. The black and white scenes look beautiful and really help to sell the idea that this is an initially black and white world as opposed to merely a partially black and white film.Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as David, a pretty nerdy high school boy who has encyclopedic knowledge of Pleasantville. Prior to entering it, he loves the world of Pleasantville as nothing bad ever happens there and wishes that real life was like that. After he is transported there and assumes the identity of Bud Parker, he discovers that it is essentially a gilded cage where any form of individuality or artistic expression is discouraged. He becomes the champion of colour over black and white in Pleasantville and, in the process, learns to appreciate the real world. This is best illustrated when he returns to it at the end of the film and comforts his distraught mother, played very well in a great cameo by Jane Kaczmarek, instead of simply ignoring her as he did earlier.Reese Witherspoon is excellent as his twin sister Jennifer, a liberated girl of the 1990s who finds the sweaters and poodle skirts - and what they represent - to be more than a little oppressive. Rather than merely holding hands with Skip Martin, she introduces him and Pleasantville to sex, something which starts the ball rolling on the colour conversion. Over the course of the film, Jennifer grows significantly as a character and abandons her wild lifestyle in favour of her education. She takes the decision to remain in Pleasantville's universe to go to college but, considering that time seemingly moves at a different rate, she presumably won't be gone too long, comparatively speaking.The best performance in the film comes from Joan Allen as Betty Parker. She is introduced as the perfect 1950s sitcom wife and mother who is always impeccably dressed and has dinner on the table every night at six without fail. As the changes caused by David and Jennifer begin to ripple through Pleasantville, however, she realises that there is nothing more to her life than that. Like many real women in the 1950s, she wants something more. As such, she develops a sweet relationship with the soda shop owner Bill Johnson, who is played very effectively by Jeff Daniels. Bill is likewise faced with an existential crisis when it occurs to him that his sole function in life is to make hamburgers and serve sodas. Encouraged by David, he pursues his interest in art and paints a surrealist mural in full colour in defiance of the oppressive Chamber of Commerce. When Betty becomes coloured, this is a great scene in which David helps her to use her make-up to pass as black and white, a wonderful allegory for the practice of light skinned African-Americans attempting to pass for white. The scene in which she is harassed by several black and white boys for being coloured is an even more effective allegory.J.T. Walsh, who sadly died before the film was released, was very well cast as the McCarthy-esque Pleasantville mayor Big Bob, who wants everything to remain the same. He claims that it is a question of values, the excuse typically used by traditionalists who find themselves on the wrong side of progress and, eventually, history. In a very strong performance by William H. Macy, George Parker represents the more benign face of conformity who realises the error of his ways in the end. It also features great supporting performances by Marley Shelton as Margaret Henderson, Don Knotts as the mysterious TV repairman and Paul Walker as Skip Martin, who is not as nice as he first appears.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which has some very interesting things to say about the danger of idealising the past. If the entire film had been a parody of the unreality of saccharine sweet sitcom conventions in the style of the Brady Bunch films, it would have still been a great film as the comic writing in these scenes is very sharp but, to his credit, Ross took it to the next level. This is one of my favourite films of the 1990s. Just sublime. "},{"Title":"Exceptional film...different","Date":"17 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Let's see. How do I explain this? Hmmmm. This film is not one of the truly great films (like Gone With The Wind or Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence Of Arabia). But, nevertheless, it is -- quite simply -- a brilliant film.Oddly enough, I avoided watching this film for the last 17 years. And even after I started watching it this time, during the first 20 minutes I repeatedly had the urge to turn it off. It just seemed uninteresting. Then, when the two teens are magically transported to Pleasantville, a rather complex and intriguing story begins to unfold. I can't help but think that the story is loosely based on sort of the mirror image of Father Knows Best, which was one of the most enchanting of all the early family story television shows from the 1950s. Father Knows Best was, of course, often the 1950s-idealized life, which wasn't very much like real life in the 1950s (although, I see Father Knows Best more as a drama and one in which each of the characters had their challenges, though those challenges were muted to fit into television mores of the era.One of the most intriguing things about this film is that the viewer doesn't really have much of any idea where the story is leading...to what conclusion it is racing toward.The acting here is top notch, even though no one in the cast is one of my favorite actors by any means. Tobey Maguire, never a favorite of mine (although I always saw him as a competent actor) is perfect here. I have enjoyed Jeff Daniels pretty much only in The Newsroom before this, but he brings a real sensitivity to his role here' I'm quite impressed. William H. Macy, another non-favorite of mine, is perfect as the Honey I'm home father. And the very talented (though I usually can't remember her name) Joan Allen as the mother is brilliant, as well.A word should be said about the wonderful special effects here -- dabs of color in a black and white world. Just about the most magical use of the concept since Dorothy landed in Oz.At first I thought that the director left out Black people, yet there is an interesting reference to them (coloreds). I wonder how the story would have changed if they had actually included African-Americans. The story doesn't end with a bang...the bang is earlier on.Excellent film, and while not one of the great film masterpieces...definitely brilliant.

I was floored by its benign, lighthearted first third, which gives way to some unexpectedly deep social commentary, brought to life bu truly remarkable performances, and stunning, storybook cinematography that looks like Sin City had a baby with Rumble Fish. Tobey Maguire, an actor I usually can't stand, is nicely low key, while his sister Reese Witherspoon gets the peppy, in your face persona. Following a terse bit of sibling rivalry, a strange TV repairman shows up, bestowing on them an ancient looking replacement remote. Before they can ask where he even came from, they are magically whisked from their 1990's living room right into TV land, specifically a cheery black and white 1950's sitcom called Pleasentville. They find themselves in a gosh golly, apple pie, white picket fence realm of perky, smiling housewives, rampant celibacy (the characters in this town are essentially shells of humans, and have no idea what sex is...yet;). The naive, mentally stunted townsfolk function at the truncated level that the show's writing is allowed, resulting in strangely robotic, stepford wives like versions of people. That all changes however, when Witherspoon introduces a highschool hunk (Paul Walker, hilarious) to the ol' hanky panky. From there on in the townspeople gradually discover books, music, art, and as such start to see the world in vibrant colors, and become colored themselves. It's a genius idea for a film that's executed perfectly, with some scenarios that really pay off, making you feel and think. J.T. Walsh, always fantastic, plays the town's fearful skeptic of a mayor. William H. Macy nails the father role perfectly (Where's my dinner?!), Joan Allen gives the best work I've ever seen her do, giving force and gentle feeling to the wife who starts exploring herself, and the world around her. The crown jewel acting wise though is Jeff Daniels, as an aloof diner owner who discovers an affinity for the arts. He brings such a warmth and budding humanity to the role. There's subtext relating to Mccarthy-ism, and not letting the powers that be tell how you what to like, how to feel or what to do. There's a lot to enjoy in this package, and indeed all aspects are done so well its a wonder this one hasn't retained acclaim over the years.

Then the normal people started to attack and tried to get rid of the colored people. That in my opinion is one of the best connections to the real world in the movie. The idea that colored people which would be African Americans were hated just because of the color of there skin. The movie showed this without saying a single word about African Americans or civil rights and showed how wrong that is to judge somebody by there color of there skin.

Because of people changing to have color instead of being black and white made the town very segregated. Excpecially in the court room, this portraits the many court cases that happened in real life.

The film gains attention from it audience because of the different way that it was made. The film was made in the 90's but the T.V series that the main characters were forced into was based in the 50's in black and white. As the movie progresses and the characters from the naive and proper T.V series are slowly being corrupted by the real world attitude of the new comers, a gradual evolution from a naive black and white to a more jaded Technicolour begins and the consequences are not so pleasant (pun intended). This film highlights the way that life used to be lived back in the 40's and 50's where 'sex' was a mystery and most teenagers were innocent. This movie has magnified this innocents to make it seem as though no one ever did anything bad and in doing so made comparing the 90's where David and Jennifer (main characters) were from, and Pleasantville (where most of the movie is set) seem like parallel worlds, one corrupted with sex and drugs and one naive about anything deemed unpleasant. This film was well made, although I think that the writers should have explained why David loved the show 'Pleasantville' so much. I am under the impression that the character loved the show because his own family was falling apart; his mother and father were divorced, his twin sister hated him and his mother and her boyfriend were leaving town again. David wished that his life was like Bud's from 'Pleasantville' with a caring mother, an attentive father and a sister that didn't drive him crazy. I would recommend this film to teenagers, and grown up families (as it is not appropriate for young children). This film has good morals as it shows that when you take a risk or do something that is out of your comfort zone you can reap the benefits that courage bring, in this case courage brought the residents of 'Pleasantville' Technicolour. This film also shows how diversity can be feared. The residents that stuck to their routines and lived in a 'pleasant' hell (pun intended) stayed in black and white didn't approve of the colored people and many didn't want any association with them at all. Many issues of racism were raised in this movie, especially when black and white store owners made signs saying 'no coloured's' and separate but equal seemed to be implemented in the small town. Of course in the end right prevails and 'Pleasantville' opens its self up to the rest of the world.

The abject conformity, the unquestioning belief in conservative propaganda, the appalling ignorance, the complete lack of sophistication, and the simmering bigotry bubbling beneath the surface ready to boil over at a moment's notice -- that more or less describes the town in the movie and it's precisely what our town is like, as well. In fact, the flick gave me the willies just watching it a second time because we are surrounded by people just like that. Our next door neighbors, for example, are straight out of some Nazi nightmare, ready to dial 911 for the slightest reason. The woman (hardly a lady) spies on us openly and brazenly as if there is nothing wrong with it. Today I watched in bemused horror as she directed a fire truck toward a single car accident that occurred about a block up the street. There was nothing wrong with trying to help, mind you, although they already knew full well where they were going. It was the way she pointed in the direction of the accident dramatically and repeatedly as if she were some sort of self-appointed cop trying to earn her merit badge and her assistance was ever so important. What a butt-kisser and what a Nazi. You had to be there to see it with your own two eyes to understand precisely what I mean. The broad is simply nuts, and in this neighborhood, she's hardly alone. Others call in complaints over really trivial matters that don't concern them in the least. This particularly egregious clique that lives in our immediate vicinity are always chatting one another up like a gaggle of teenagers yet they refuse even to acknowledge our presence. It's not that we want to socialize with them, because we don't, but there is something so strange and weird about those people that it's difficult to describe in a few choice sentences if you don't already understand. Bible-thumping conservatives act as if places like this constitute some sort of real world paradise. What a sorry joke. It's a complete police state and about as far from paradise as one can get. Not to excuse or justify the lefties, we used to live in one of their so-called paradises and it was a complete hellhole, too.

There is much use of symbolism, particularly the gradual depiction of characters and objects in colour rather than black and white.The acting is of a high quality, with seasoned performers such as Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels and William Macy providing a solid background to (relative) newcomers Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.However, some of the messages and symbolism is alternatively muddled (the timing of the transformations to colour) and heavy-handed (the signs that start to spring up saying 'no coloureds'.Having said that, there is a lot to like about 'Pleasantville', even if the loftiness of its ambitions is only partially met by its success.Worth a look.

If you want to feel special about yourself for having a consciousness that's more evolved than those silly 50s people, see this movie.  It actually raised my opinion of this movie to find out it was being attacked by social conservatives; I guess there still are some people that need to hear this message (but they're not going to get it from this movie). Let me be clear, I agree with much of what this movie tries to say, but this movie is merely preaching to the converted.If you step back and really look at this movie it's quite hypocritical. The movie itself completely stereotypes and vilifies those that do not agree with its social agenda.  People were two dimensional, judgmental and scared of change before there were contemporary left wing social values.  Is anyone truly liberal enough to say human value transcends social values, or do we just embrace all the different people that agree with us?  But I digress.On the other hand, the performances were all great, the entire cast just shined, and the cinematography was tremendous--it's certainly a very watchable film.  Gary Ross did a very impressive job of directing, especially for his first time out.  But at root, I think the message is archaic and Ross is just patting himself on the back for growing up in the 60s and 70s.maybe that's not so bad.it's certainly a good way to get your film made in Hollywood.

What's the point of criticizing a movie from a serious perspective if it isn't meant to be serious? I mean, it's about two kids jumping into their TV with a magical remote, for fuck's sake. What did you expect? The film makes a simple point -- and I'm willing to bet it's not the first to bring it up. When it's done, not much is left to the imagination, but so what? It is just a little off-the-wall fantasy story or fairy tale with that same message of individualism and creativity to throw at you -- the beauty and wonder of eccentric free thought and emotion. Its entire point is to elevate this as the nexus of our humanity, beyond tradition, stability and benign comfort.So, taking it as such, I thought it was enjoyable -- even if for no reason other then its style. I'm a sucker for all things retro and that 50's culture/atmosphere has always fascinated me. Of course, the movie's not supposed to portray what real life in the 50s was like. Instead, it brings to the screen that cheesy, picture-perfect, television stereotype a monotonous, plain, patriarchal and conservative society that knows nothing but its stable, boring, predictable lifestyle -- the Honey, I'm home!, Dinner's on the table! , ridiculously flawless, idealistic suburban town. It's literally in black-and-white.It would be a huge understatement to say that colors played an essential part in this movie. They practically made it. And though playing around with these colors got old rather quickly, I really liked the way this film blended black-white and colored scenery together. Many parts played out like great satire; some of it was just really funny; other moments breached critical levels on my retard-o-meter.A little annoying at times, but there are a few golden nuggets along the way as well.All-together, a fun movie to watch.

As I understand it the film is about the fact that accepting change and diversity is something valuable. The main point is that confronting your own prejudices and accepting the diversity in our lives make it so much easier to enjoy and appreciate. The fact is that every society throughout human history that has stopped evolving, and focused on preserving the Status Quo, has broken down. This is especially true to societies that refuse to accept new ideas and intellectual independence. And as I understand it, keeping the social Status Quo and protecting an abstract idea called the American way of life was the main goal of the 50¬¥s U.S. culture. Remember that this was a time in U.S. history when people were punished for their ideals and thoughts via the oppressive structure called McCarthyism.In this, very light and in my opinion surprisingly tame, film this is shown in the way people react to the coloureds, i.e. the people who start to brake social conventions. And it is not until the people of Pleasantville start accepting change that they can see the problems in their society.Now I have to admit that I have trouble understanding all aspects of U.S. culture. That is why I have a hard time understanding the critique that some commentators have posted against this film. I know that, especially in the U.S., sexuality and rebellion against social tabu¬¥s is a touchy subject.But that is what makes this a good film, it actually manages to make people think and that is all too rare in contemporary American cinema.

Jennifer is the cool kid, while David is, well, not. While Jennifer is into trying to get guys, and smoking and all that, David is into watching tv, especially his favorite tv show, Pleasantville. Tonight David and Jennifer have slightly different plans. David is planning on watching a 24 hour marathon of Pleasantville, while Jennifer is planning on watching a concert on MTV with this guy she's invited over. During their squabble over the all-mighty remote, it breaks, and a mysterious stranger is at the door (Don Knotts). He hands them a new remote that changes their lives forever. Somehow David and Jennifer get zapped into the tv, and are now part of Pleasantville.Pleasantville (the tv show) is an old black and white wholesome show where the father comes home from work everyday at 5, his wife has prepared dinner for them, and the two kids rush over to see daddy. The temperature never goes above or below 72 degrees, and life is well, pleasant. David and Jennifer (who are now Bud and Mary Sue) have to deal with this new life, while trying to figure a way out. Soon the black and white world of Pleasantville is turning colorized, and people aren't sure what to do. Is this change a good thing, or will it ruin the lives of the people of Pleasantville? There are a few obvious messages screenwriter/director Gary Ross is trying to show. So I'll just tell you what I got out of it. Basically I thought he was trying to say that people need to express themselves. Your world will remain in black and white unless you're willing to open your eyes to new experiences. Once you start seeing what the world around you has to offer, your once black and white world can open up into a rainbow of colors. Of course Ross could have been trying to say that being an individual is important rather than always following what the group says. Or he could have been saying, can't we all just get along? Whatever his real message was, he certainly hits his point, over and over and over again. I though I was pretty smart picking up on his message (something I usually don't see) early on in the film. Then for the last 30-45 minutes, he just kept slamming his message into you again and again. And while I didn't feel that he needed to, it didn't really take away from the movie. The black and white vs. color idea was something different. The special effects were quite cool in fact. Seeing how the world of Pleasantville slowing transformed, flower by flower, face by face, into color was very interesting. Although for a while it seemed the only way a person could turn into color was by having sex (an idea later refuted by Mary Sue). The acting was wonderful, and it was all held together by Tobey Maguire. His character (David/Bud) had a powerful yet boyish innocence about him. He knew the tv show so well he knew what all the people were supposed to be doing, yet after trying desperately to keep them in line, he realized that maybe change was a good thing. The one character that truly showed how change can affect you was the mom Betty Parker (Joan Allen). Her performance showed how change can be exciting and at the same time frightening. It was funny to see how all the kids changed into color first, while all the older white males were the last to go. It tells me that the kids of today are more willing to go out there and make changes, and that we are the voice of a new world. But those older white guys will come along, once they realize that maybe kids have something important to say. So overall, I really enjoyed Pleasantville. It was well made, and well acted. And while it did beat you over the head with its many messages, the story was still done in such a way that I didn't really mind it. It's a movie that I'll probably see again.

Suddenly, though, it seems so apt for this time.  It is a story of a paradise more naive than innocent, suddenly and uncomfortably presented with the beauty and fear of reality experienced in its full complexity.  Pleasantville seems now to illustrate the process that America and its people are said to be experiencing, a looking outwards, a growing awareness of its position, of its unique power, among the nations; but also an apprehension of the vulnerability that America's people shares with us all, in a dangerous and sometimes evil world.

Jennifer doesn't waste her time reading, is popular in school, and obsesses on sex. Suddenly, by magic both are transported into the black and white world of Pleasantville. The impact of these two modern-day kids on that one-dimensional culture is explosive. SPOILERS. Jennifer brings the joys of sex and passion to the people of Pleasantville, and David opens their eyes to an exciting outside world they never knew existed. However, Jennifer and David, themselves, are changed dramatically. BIG SPOILERS COMING. Jennifer finds joy in other things besides just sex and popularity; she becomes an avid reader; and in the end remains in Pleasantville to attend college, an opportunity not available to her in her original life. David finds himself suddenly the center of attention, a hero, and popular; and the prettiest girl in Pleasantville, Margaret (Marley Shelton), falls in love with him. However, having grown up, so to speak, he accepts the opportunity to return home. The movie touches on several issues - social, political, and personal - including how reading and literature can change the outlook of people; how important color is in the appreciation of art ... and life; how passions vitalize people; how insidious racial intolerance is; and how static cultures fear the written word. The importance of the written word is especially emphasized here. However, there's an even more profound and important message delivered by this movie. Actually, it comes in one of those short, unheralded golden movie moments, which sometimes in a matter of a few simple seconds, define a good movie. It took me several months and many viewings to catch the significance of that moment in Pleasantville, a moment so seemingly unimportant that I originally gave it little more than a passing thought; in fact it seemed to me somewhat irrelevant until I finally figured it out.SPOILER. David is about to push the TV remote button that will send him back to his present day home. Margaret hugs him tightly, and as tears roll down her cheeks, says to him, Don't forget about me. Even if you never come back, I just don't want you to forget about me. As I watched that scene for the umpteenth time, it struck me. Margaret was the symbol of his fantasy come to life. And it was important for him. It would indeed be tragic if he forgot Margaret and the beauty she brought to his life through his fantasy, as well as the value his life gained from the changes Margaret and his fantasy world wrought in him. Fantasy isn't to be taken lightly.An excellent piece of work by Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, Jane Kaczmarek, William H. Macy, Marley Shelton, J. T.

Suddenly in minute, a strange repair man comes over to there house and gives them a new remote control, when they receive it, they end up fighting over it again and this leaves them suddenly in Pleasantville, as two of the Pleasantville characters, Bud and Mary-Sue Parker. In Pleasantville everything is obviously in black and white, including them. They have new parents, new clothes, new friends, etc. Everything is just very Pleasant. They obviously want to get out of Pleasantville but they don't know how. Jennifer decides to go on her own little tour though meeting  new love interest, Skip Martin (The Brilliant Paul Walker.) Soon enough though, things are turning into colour. The more rules that are getting broken in Pleasantville, more things are turning to colour in the small town. Tobey Maguire is quite good here. I thought he had that old fashioned  look which went right with the film. Reese Witherspoon does an okay job, but I would of preferred someone else having her role. Jeff Daniels does a job too and so does Paul Walker who really should of had a bigger part in the movie.Pleasantville is a cute, original film with some great effects and some captivating moments. The funny thing was the first time I saw Pleasantville, I wasn't to keen on it, after seeing if for the second time, I was.

Watching it, one is reminded of Woody Allen's THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, a wonderful film which also dealt with people entering and characters leaving the screen.  PURPLE ROSE dealt with the big screen, PLEASANTVILLE deals with the small screen.The film's title refers to a 1950's TV show where everything is monotone and monochrome, life is scheduled and fixed and everyone is well....swell! Through a series of inexplicable events, a fanatical fan of the film (Tobey Maguire) and his not-so-fanatical-fan of a sister (Reese Witherspoon) are transported into the show as Bud and Mary Sue.The reasons for and the how of the entry into the show is unexplained and it doesn't really need to be.  We take it as a given.  The presence of the two outsiders in the show changes its environment, its people and their whole world forever.  The library books now have words, firemen now fight fire and there is colour.Though at times the film's script does get a bit heavy handed, especially in the attack at racial prejudice, the film always retains a gentle, aloof humour that keeps the audience amused.The special effects in the film are unprecedented, subtle and marvellous with 1950's costumes to match.  Everyone in the cast is a joy to watch. With Joan Allen, William H. Macy, J.T.

It's a drawback that I don't think the great folks running the dB can circumvent, but it's one we should keep in mind. Especially while reading about this movie.Why do I say that? Because I'm certain, despite all the rave reviews of this film, that there are many, many people out there who saw Pleasantville and knew instantly that it's a piece of trash. I'm writing this review because I think it's an interesting and telling piece of trash.I encourage people to see Pleasantville (not to actually pay for the rental or ticket price, of course, but only to borrow it or watch it with others if they happen to have it) because it's more illuminating than any other film I've seen on the latest hollywood technique intellectual gimmicks. This movie is rife with metaphors that don't line up, symbolism that doesn't work out, images that obviously are meant to seem significant, and other such gimmicks that exist (but aren't as obvious) in nearly every movie hollywood releases today. For the unconvinced what's the message of the film? If you indulge in innocuous pleasures, society will shun you? Okay, I can begin to believe that... until the coloreds political metaphor kicks in. If you indulge in innocuous pleasures, society will shun you in a way that's a lot like racism? Okay. But what does abstract painting have to do with this? What about the garden of eden imagery? All these things are so incongruous and disconnected that it becomes obvious on reflection that the seeming metaphors are designed simply for audience effect. Hollywood knows that people want movies that make you think; that's why hollywood engineered this type of movie, a movie so convoluted and inane that it should take a long time to sort out all the metaphors and realize that there's nothing behind them. Trouble is, this movie failed at that it's obvious after a while that it's just inane, so the movie itself has to resort to trying to capitalize on its own inanity by being a fairy tale. Indulging in the liberals vs. conservatives argument is just what hollywood wants us to do, too, and it gets us nowhere. It's not that hollywood is liberal; it's that they know that sex sells.That's why I tell people to see this movie; after Pleasantville, the difficulties with movies like Fight Club, American Beauty and Memento become much more obvious. It's hard to see at first that these movies are just designed to sell themselves by puzzling the viewer; after one sees Pleasantville, however, one can appreciate hollywood's skills in this area much more, since all the foils and gimmicks are so obvious.

Of course, being a 1950's sitcom, everything in this imaginary world is black and white, everything is perfect, husbands and wives sleep in twin beds, etc. The introduction of two kids from the '90's is sure to add some colour to this black and white world.When I first watched Pleasantville I treated it as a rather pleasant and funny example of culture shock, as the kids from the '90's came to terms with Pleasantville and Pleasantville came to terms with them. However, with the second viewing I was far more taken with the political satire involved in it.There is a rather abrupt shift in focus about halfway through the movie. Up to that point, it had been rather amusing. From that point on, as those opposed to change in Pleasantville's black and white world begin to resist, the tone actually becomes quite ominous; sort of McCarthy, Communism and Orwell's 1984 all rolled into one, complete with mob violence and book burning. All those who treat their politics in simple black and white terms should sit up and take note of the dangers involved.An interesting subplot is that any type of lifestyle can become monotonous. While the kids of Pleasantville break out of their monotony by engaging in the more physical pleasures of life that had been denied to them, it is Jennifer - the loose girl from the '90's - who discovers that her very looseness has become monotony. It's only when she discovers the joy involved in reading and study that she breaks out and discovers new life.This was an absolutely fascinating and immensely enjoyable movie.

Almost every one of the characters ends up going through some kind of change at some point in the movie, and all of the actors do a good job of making you care about their particular character.  One of the main problems with the movie isn't it's acting, but it's pacing- it is very uneven.

Gary Ross' film is evenly paced, ingenious and downright full of acting talent.It begins with a simple premise Two teenagers from the modern era are transported into a 1950's sitcom. During their stay, their influences begin to spark a series of changes in the uniform community. This occurrence begins to disturb most residents and trigger a dispute among each other.Gary Ross' own screenplay is actually an excellent depiction of how a permanent community adapts to major changes. From monochrome to color and routine to decisions, Pleasantville explains how changes affect every single individual. Many in the film were confused and had a hard time to accept things brought about by changes. It was clearly seen in the film how a peaceful community transformed into a violent and segregated society as it clung itself together in ways to find solace and harmony.Moreover, Gary Ross' direction is a clever mix of brilliance and charm. He used several techniques, such as colored objects amidst black and white background or vice versa. His techniques are quite remarkable and astonishing, as most clearly seen with Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon's acting. Both give satisfying performances as the teenagers who introduced reforms into a predictable society.I liked the film, and how it ended, although it turned out to what I expected.

Unfortunately, from there on it goes downhill fast. Still, it opens interestingly enough. Two contemporary kids are being sucked into a tv-series from the 1950's and get to embody two of the leading roles. But their arrival is somewhat analogue with Adam and Eve eating the apple and thus infecting mankind with sin. Because Pleasantville, the town where the action takes place, is a world where the roads go round in circles and where everything is known, because nothing changes; accordingly neither do the history lessons at school. It's truly a world based on tradition.But when the newcomers arrive, they take the forces of nature (rain, fire etc) as well as the forces of mankind (sexuality, violence, frustration, hate, love and confusion) with them. And along with all this colour (the tv-series are originally in black and white). The Pleasantville citizens gets curious and starts laborating with things previously unknown, such as sex and art. But this is also wrecking the balance of their world. When the man in the main family comes home and his wife is gone (out with her new lover), he walks around in the house, confused, wondering why there isn't any food at the table, as it has always been before. This and other incidents forces some of the citizens to make a list of some basic rules that the people of Pleasantville have to follow, and the group agrees to fight together for the values in which they believe.So far so good. But at this point there is not much time left of the movie, and what's there almost spoils the whole thing. It really starts at the court scene, where one of the characters stand trial for using illegal colours in his paintings. I won't say what happens, let's just establish that the colored world defeats the gray one, and not only that this process is uniformly welcomed by everyone.  I don't appreciate this at all. It is not only a pathetic clich√©, well in line with the view on mankind that we see all the time in commercials etc. More so, it makes the movie turn 360 degrees and end up where it started - in a new paradise! But we all know that the colored world, that we're all very aware of, isn't anything like paradise.One can say that this last statement is the only knowledge we can cherish. The filmmakers seem to do just that. That must be the reason for the morality of this movie, manifested in the dialogue at the end between the main male character and his real mother. She is frustrated with her life, and says I'm forty years old, it's not supposed to be like this. He replies It's not supposed to be anything, and she finds him suddenly very wise. The morals are life is a mess, but take it day by day and it'll be quite alright. But, honestly, is that really enough of guidance for us in life? And more over, in whose interest is it that the members of society just floats along on the river like unmoored boats, neglecting to navigate?That said - forgetting the inadequate answers - Pleasantville evoces many questions which themselves are a treasure to have and to hold. And one more thing just watch out for the sequence where the main female character explains to her mother about sex - hilarious!

In all these films the main characters find themselves in a different world where the time-space continuum remains unchanging until the main characters and the people of the world surrounding them undergo a radical change. Though the film can be appreciated by the teenager audience as well as by the adults the film crew expertly introduced the theme of fascism and racism, which helped the film to become a serious production. The film investigates the roots of  intolerance to alien values and reveals the fact that most people are not guaranteed against turning into a savage mob when confronted with something new and unconventional. It leaves the viewer pondering over the possibility of fascist and racist ideology taking over normal ethics. That's why it stands closer to Zerkalo dlya Geroya where the main hero finds himself in his native town but in the late 40-s and even meets himself as a small boy.

But there is a twist of course. They are characters of a show and trapped in their preset routines - a parallel for the roles a society is sometimes enforcing on people. The message of the movie is that, when there are no free choices then there is trouble in Paradise. I must admit that the approach was somewhat simplistic and the two 90's kids are predictably bringing chaos in such a society.

I'm a fan of The Truman Show and so I thougt the premise for this was intersting. So I watched it on the Friday Afternoon, someone had left it halfway through the tape, later I realised why. What had been a very good idea for a film, that could have worked on many levels, many of the levels that people seem to think it does work on (50's vs the 90's), (the US Society) etc. Although I liked the characters and the idea of the film, I found the whole affair turned out be rather mediocre. The film wasn't very credible, and it lacked action, which just resulted in boredom. The full possibilites of the situation, weren't properly explored. The 50's Pleasant Tv-moulded characters who they met do not seem to have a point to them. The messages in this film seem to be very vague, better more dynamic writing what probably bring them about better. The film comes across as a bit of a mish-mash, while they spirit of it is good, and the characters are sond, the rebellious sister from the 90's forced to live in a different role. Many people seem to moved by the atmospherics for the film, but much of it was fantasy based on nothing with any credibility. It may be that I cannot relate to the 50's TV world of the US or something. It just seemed such a mediocre film and such a waste of a good idea. It didn't seem to symbolise anything, because the TV World didn't mean anything, adn they were trying to use color as a symbol. If the film was trying to show us that the 90's were dysfunctional or something, then why does it turn out that Pleasantville is such a dysfunctional place too. Color is sued to symbolise the corruption of the town's innocence, and it was crudely applied, this is contradictive (colour eventually becomes a symbol of freedom). And anyway if those 50's networks had had color, that's how they would have filmed it, people aren't black and white if they have to be, so why is that symbolic. It's all too abstract. However the fact that there still were things I liked about it, were probably enough for some people to like it a lot. They must have clearly understood the abstract sublimial meanigns of the film, which didnt exactly go out of it's way to explain itself. It was just another mediocre movie. However if you can see something in it, then that is great, I was amazed at the praise it got on the IMDB, because I had truly thought that it would have bad reviews. Either we're al being taken in by Hollywood or I'm just dumb and shoukld get back to watching blockbusters, 'cause if you all feel that way about it, it must be good. I'm gonna watch it again, I might get it this time.

The touch of genius is the use of color in an otherwise black and white movie (it was filmed the other way around). It is done with so much subtlety that I ended up watching Pleasantville two times in a row - just to catch all the nuances. Brilliant stuff.Where the movie does seem a bit too long and the ending is a bit lopsided, Tobey Maguire is truly spellbinding in the lead role (as is the whole cast actually) and his intensity quickly interlocks with director Ross` calm, matter-of-factly style.More importantly, the campy 50s diner `feel' and environment is dead on  re-created with the same charm as in other modern day classics, notably George Lucas` American Graffiti and Barry Levinson`s Diner.

What a mix-up THIS film is.  It's a bit like Gary Ross was told he could only direct one more film in his entire life and that he had to fit into it everything he wanted to say. The result is that he faffs around a lot but achieves little; the mix of potentially colourful themes ending up as a nondescript grey sludge of good ideas but a complete failure in the conclusions department.Stepping into the TV is a good start I thought, mainly because I very much liked Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo (and his earlier short story The Kugelmass Episode).  The theme had also appeared in Poltergeist/The Twilight Zone/Stay Tuned etc. so was not new but clearly there was more that could be done with it.But not much is. The fact that the kids are thrown into a TV series is for the most part forgotten and instead, the question is what do the 90s kids do if thrown into a 50s world? And that question was better dealt with in Back to the Future, because at least in that film there was an intention of producing a passably realistic impression of the 50s.  Instead, there are uncomfortable limits imposed as to the knowledge of the Pleasantville residents, ie no sex/colour/books/out of town/fire etc. but no rhyme or reason as to why some things exist in their world but others don't.Add to that a random bit of magic realism (ie the burning tree), an embarrassing attempt to deal with race/discrimination issues, and the most unsatisfactory love-triangle sub-plot ever devised, and you have a proper mess, with more loose ends than a spaghetti sandwich.  True, there are some pretty bits with the colour/black-and-white cine effects mix, very clever I'm sure, but that is just gilding a rotten lily.

And anything that brings Don Knotts back to us isn't all bad, believe me.Now, what isn't so hot-I got confused, was director Gary Ross saying that the '50s were suffocating, stunk, repressed, and that everything afterwards is so much improved by opening up, living your life is better if you do your own thing, etc. Sex is fun! etc. I.E. Gifts that the '60s gave us.Okay, sure. I admit-much of that is true, plus the racism in pre-Martin Luther King America was ugly, and its true '50's sitcoms like 'Father Knows Best' and 'Leave it to Beaver' were stilted and unrealistic in the extreme. I guess if you did take a few 1998 teenagers and plunk them down into such a universe, say onto the front lawn of the Beaver's house, sure-they could turn things upside down in a heartbeat.But that's on TV.I don't know about anyone else, but the people I know who lived in the '50s, my family, parents, their parents, friends, etc. were hardly a bunch of innocent boobs waiting for some 5-2 sleaze like the Reese Witherspoon character here to come prancing outta the future and show them how to Wake up and Really live.These were people who had fought in WWII, who had made it through the Depression before it, who also fought in Korea....people died of Polio, cancer, etc. at a much higher rate then now....Much lower homicide rate, drug rate, etc...Am I missing something here?

He turns up Pleasantville to drown out the sounds of his divorced mother screaming into the phone at her ex about her new boyfriend. The audience begins to think, Okay, this film will be about finding wholesomeness and innocence again.David, who craves innocence (his sister points out that he really, seriously likes the way these people live once they arrive in Pleasantville), and Jennifer, who finds innocence nerdy and geeky, arrive in Pleasantville.  It seems that they will be thrust into '50s culture and have to learn how to live in it.  But soon we see that they are actually up against '50s TV culture, in a world where people have to do things by repetition, there is no rain, and there are no toilets.  So, I realized, if these kids were going to do battle with this black and white culture, it was going to be a fake culture from the start, a fantasy land in which nature doesn't even work right, not a real place.I expected David to find his peace in Pleasantville, but he just seems mildly amused by the whole experience.  Jennifer's reactions and changes are more interesting, as she finally learns that reading, valuing her own potential and intelligence, is what matters.But, as has been pointed out by other IMDB users, the reasons for the characters' growth/color change are vast and different.  Apparently sex outside of marriage is deep inner growth for some teens; adultery in Mrs. Parker and Mr. Johnson represents a wonderful growth for them; screaming and yelling make the mayor become who he really is; and yet reading is what makes Jennifer find herself, David must stand up and defend someone to become his best self, and finding respect and love for his wife makes Mr. Parker into a real person. Why does the emphasis go both ways?  If you're a slut, read more books? If you read too many books, go have sex?  What is the message?David's peace and satisfaction are the most confusing moment.  He and his sister venture into a world of perfect innocence, break up a family, introduce promiscuity (what about the references to STDs at the beginning of the film?), and leave an enlightened world behind them.  Why does this make them happy?  The one place of innocence has been stamped out.  Was it a real, realistic world?  No, but as David insisted over and over to his sister early in the film  They're happy!  They're really happy, and you have no right to destroy their universe.  If people are innocent and happy, why is it better to bring in this sort of enlightenment?  As the world becomes enlightened, fights break out for the first time; boys who used to be innocent about sex begin to gang up on women; marriages that used to be happy fall apart.  Is this what we are supposed to want?I feel that the best moment of hope was lost at the end.  When Mr. Parker admits that he loves his wife and turns colored, why not have him go to her, apologize and confess love, and work with her to create a stronger marriage in which they can both be more independent and happy?The message of Pleasantville seems to be that getting what you want first is what's most important, and you should go through anyone to get it, even dumping people and relationships and responsibility if you don't think it will make you happy enough.  (Like the reference to a boy quitting his job because he doesn't feel like it anymore, as if this is a good, positive growth for him.)  This film should have been about balance- yes, women deserve more than being confined to the kitchen; people should be able to paint beautiful artwork; we should grow as human beings.  But not through the destruction of innocence.

While the premise is intriguing, it's essentially a high concept, one joke movie.  Worse, the filmmakers weren't exactly sure what story they were telling, so the metaphor switches directions a couple of times, lots of attempts at explaining only make things more confused, and some of the parallels between what's going on in Pleasantville and real world events (Nazis, race riots, etc.) are so heavy handed they might as well have just run a crawl across the screen This is just like when Hitler ordered all books by Jews burnt.  Oooh. History...It's a shame, because the movie hits on an interesting idea at the very beginning, but it was probably an accident.  Mainly, the trip to Pleasantville is set up as largely a reaction of Toby Maguire's character to the sucky world of the 90s.  (Unfortunately, this concept is utterly trashed by the appearance of Don Knotts as a TV Repairman, a useless character that probably happened because several studio execs were confused. B-b-but... how does he get into Pleasantville?  I don't understand...) Anyway, the world of Pleasantville, under the surface, is really a political correctness freak's wet dream, NOT a version of the 1950s -- but we're led into it from the start knowing that this place is entirely wrong, and that's where all the potential ends.By far the most annoying aspect of the film, though, is that the filmmakers don't bother to give us the most important scenes.  At several points, when we're about to hit an emotional moment that might mean something, bang, we cut away to something else.  It's almost like the movie was cut with a stop watch.  As a result, it's impossible to care about anyone, because we never get to see the moments that matter to them.  (The most heinous examples of this come in the Joan Allen/Jeff Daniels relationship.  I think something happens between them, but it's hard to tell.)I won't even mention that Gary Ross hasn't bothered to think about the rules of the world here.  The TV Repairman character is inconsistent -- eager to send people into the place at one moment, outraged that things are changing in another.  As another IMDB reviewer pointed out, the reasons for people changing from black and white to color are also inconsistent.  At first, it seems like getting laid is the way to colorization, but at the end of the film, we learn that there are other reasons, and are left to wonder why the entire town hadn't turned technicolor a lot sooner.I don't know why the critics raved.  Maybe because nothing blows up and most of the film is in black and white.  But, if you want  great visual effects that actually have a compelling story attached to them, tune in to a Gatorade commercial.  Don't waste  your time on Pleasantville, because there's nothing there you haven't seen already -- or can't guess long before it happens.

Pleasantville wasn't supposed to be a representation of the 50's, it was supposed to be a representation of a 50's family comedy, i.e. Leave It to Beaver.  Not a very good representation, I'll admit, but neither was the Brady Bunch Movie a representation of the Brady Bunch.  It's satire, folks.This movie has too much swearing/sex/etc! It's 1999, and this wasn't rated 'G'. Profanity and sex were actually important to the changes that occurred in the characters, which were necessary for them to become colored.I, personally, think that this was a fair movie. I enjoyed watching it.  I think it was a bit preachy.  And there were a few annoying inconsistencies.For instance, the people of Pleasantville, were supposed to be pleasant. The thing that made people colored, was that they had fundamentally changed in some way.  If this were true, the rock throwers and book burners would have become colored simply because it shouldn't have been in their nature to do so.  I point to the climax of the courtroom scene to illustrate my point.And what about the relationship between Mrs. Parker and Mr. Johnson.  Did she leave Mr. Parker?  Did she simply have a fling with Mr. Johnson?  I'd hoped that this question would be answered at the end of the movie.  But then suddenly Mr. Parker turned into Mr. Johnson!  Did they forget about this plot point?  Did they suddenly realize after the first screening that they had forgotten and quickly tack on the ending? It left me confused.Despite those few annoying things, the message of the movie was an important one, and I recommend this movie to everyone, especially young people.  The story it tells has a moral that everyone should understand.  Intolerance and resistance to change are impediments to life and should be avoided at all costs.

It does not appear to have been very well marketed, especially the trailer which almost put me off seeing the film, and as a result has failed to capture the public's imagination despite receiving critical acclaim in the press.Overall, this is a film which could have been so much more and done so much better but at the end of the day is just pleasant.

Fortunately, writer/director Gary Ross (Oscar nominated for his screenplays for Big and Dave) has given us a thought-provoking tale. Through effective, albeit less-than-subtle, symbolism, Ross uses images to convey timely messages about race relations, tolerance and individuality. The fact that he accomplishes this without coming off as preachy is a testament to the strength of the amount of talent involved in this film.

It was good.  It was above average. It was mild. It showed that bland could be raised to an art form and thought-provoking. In a place of forever sunny skies, cheery wives, and holding hands, the movie colored in a couple of with it teens from the 90s age of acerbic tongues and one-night stands.The black and white world of Pleasantville, the village where everything goes right and everyone knows right from wrong -  and Father Knows Best - was a hybrid of Our Town and The Truman Show. It was like the former perhaps for no other reason than being about small town America in sweet, innocent era, and a bit of the latter since everyone had a role to perform, done in the exact order all the time day after day without end.  Without such a purpose the players in Pleasantville the village would have been in the dark. Coping with the unexpected was not in the grand scheme of things for the denizens of Pleasantville.That's where the teenagers came in, and life in docile in which the basketball team never lost - and made all their baskets - and nothing caught on fire or got sullied from sin or sand was not to be the same.Pleasantville the movie, contrasting this monochromatic world without conflict with a modern viewpoint, gave us an entertaining movie that reminded me of the time that a gentleman wouldn't dare to use 'truck driver' language in front of a lady. The concept of Pleasantville, although not entirely novel, did exhibit a flair for jarring those cobwebs to get us old timers, especially, to do a retake of the past, all-too-often looked at through rose-colored lenses.  It told us how innocent and, quite really, how stupid we were to fall for that tome of family values, hook, line and sinker.  Two twin beds in the master bedroom gave the appearance of the perfect, virginal family, whose big event of the day came when Father announced, Honey, I'm home.  Lovers lane was for star gazing but not on your back.When the teens were released from their roles in Pleasantville and one of them returned to the present, we were jarred to 90s-reality of how tough we were.  The over-the-hill 40 year old was all pent-up over not picking up a stud nine years her junior and vented a common obscenity, the kind of language only a truck driver would use in the day and age of Pleasantville. Certainly a lady wouldn't utter such crudeness.  I guess we've come a long way, haven't we, Baby?  We've become seasoned pros at spouting off, wagging our tongue with UNpleasantries.Pleasantville, though not a strong or compelling movie, did serve up two hours of a pleasant film experience.  It threw on a little salt to a pretty bland time in our nation's history.  It's a good, unpretentious  film that gives you something to think about.

It is easy to say what this film is not. It is not an attack on fifties morality, it is not a critique of television, it is not a nihilistic call to arms. Instead it is a film about nostalgia. How often do you hear people harp back to the good old days, the way society was before it got corrupted. What this film does is take a snapshot view of the present world; full of social hardship, environmental problems, AIDS and broken homes and then presents an imagined view of what the world used to be like;solid nuclear families, permanently sunny weather, innocent teens. This is what many people do when they become nostalgic. They only see the bad aspects of the world as it is and only remember the good parts of the world as it was. What the director then proceeds to do is show us why the world is not like that anymore, if it ever was. The most important thing that the two main characters bring with them to their new world is knowledge. Knowledge of their own sexuality, knowledge of the outside world, knowledge of the arts, knowledge of gender issues. It is this knowledge that changes Pleasantville's world and is presented as a parallel of the changes brought about in America from the fifties to the present day. What the director is careful to avoid, even though he has been accused of doing just this, is to suggest that all the things that knowledge brings about are good. We have already seen the problems inherent in the real world that they have left and they bring many new problems into the world, broken families, polarized communities and violence. It is no coincidence that Bud is the first person to use violence in pleasantville and show it's power to the rest of the world. The acquisition of forbidden knowledge is obviously going to bring comparisons with the story of genesis and Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden. A fact that the director acknowledges with some subtle references but does not make his primary concern. All in all this is a film that works on many levels. The main message of the film seems to be that changes to society are inevitable given mans quest for new knowledge but that  such changes are preferable to living in a state of ignorant bliss. You may disagree with this idea but you must admire the subtle and thoughtful way that he has put this idea across and for his courage in making a big budget special effects movie that can be both thought provoking and entertaining.

Remember the milkman, the paperboy, the wife who always prepares the dinner table.PLEASANTVILLE is an entertaining nostalgic trip back in the days of black-and-white television shows, and fantasizes the past pop culture through a deep blending of a modern-day unruly society. It sounds like a new and rewarding concept, and it goes even further by examining two different worlds the happy, shiny, rock n' roll 50s and the dark, decaying, alternative 90s. Writing and direction have its bold merits, expressing a masterful view of moral values in a properly known fictional town called Pleasantville. If we wanted to escape the world where sex and violence would create a problem, then this is the right place to be. Rather, this is a movie to watch because it will stir some deep emotions for choosing to look back into a bygone era when life was enjoyed peacefully. Emotions alone wouldn't have been totally necessary for a movie like this, which focuses on the 50s way of living. In the end, the importance lies within the history to be remembered, and how it builds up into the present, and even the future. But the movie wouldn't have been anywhere near as pleasant without Don Knotts, magnificently cast as a handy-dandy reliable TV repairman stuck in the tube.Originality aside, PLEASANTVILLE whisks us away when we think about the wonderful possibilities life had accomplished, and how changes in society must always phase.

This is a gentle way of saying that this is a dumb movie that may be confused for being important.You no doubt know the story by now siblings get sucked into a 50s-era black-and-white television series called Pleasantville. Much hilariousness follows. (And important, weighty social lessons, too!)At least that is what Gary Ross, the auteur behind this mess, would like you to believe. In truth, whatever comedy could've been wrested from the fishes-out-of-water premise was all milked perfectly by Back to the Future over a decade ago. In retrospect, Back to the Future seems a smarter social commentary, too, even as it is also an exponentially more entertaining story, with memorable, endearing (and enduring) characters.But I digress. We were speaking of Pleasantville.Tiresome and hypocritical, the film makes its strongest case against simple-minded moralizing by being the embodiment of that which it indicts. It is a irony beyond explanation that a film can so closemindedly assert and repeat ad nauseum, open your mind. To what, exactly, you ask? Well, anything, really. Promiscuity, changing your routines, a new job, masturbation, racial equality, unleashing your inner artist, all sorts of important STUFF. Why, you inquire? Because if you don't, you are a 1) A Nazi 2) A Repressed Zombie, or 3) a VERY WHITE MALE.If you think there must be more to Pleasantville than Gary Ross finding a variety of challenging ways to insult your intelligence, you're right. There are a lot of very boring storylines involving utterly uninteresting characters that evolve slower than mankind. You will be amazed, by the story's end, at just how little you cared about anyone in the film.Much like its theologically-retarded sibling, What Dreams May Come, Pleasantville is SUPERBLY acted, and BEAUTIFULLY shot. The failure of both films lies solely in the clumsy, ham-handed storytelling.Rather than watch this two-hour bumpersticker, do yourself a favor and rent a few superior films with complimentary themes1) Woody Allen's spectacular The Purple Rose of Cairo, 2) Robert Zemekis' Back to the Future, 3) Woody Allen's Crimes and MisdemeanorsI know this review isn't exactly a well written criticism, but by this point, I'm sure you understand why.

Anyone who watches B&W TV programming knows that you don't need color to be able to tell what color Herman Munster's skin is or what color dress June Cleaver is wearing.  Ross did a great job of capturing that look, and then showed everything to us again in color, which I personally enjoyed a great deal.That, however, is not the really surprising part about this movie.  After all, Ben Hur had some amazing sets and wonderful costuming, but that's not why it's a great movie - it all comes down to what story is being told.

The acting, particularly Macy, Maguire, Allen and Daniels deliver subtle sensitive performances that go way beyond the standard that The Academy would consider for nomination.The direction is superb also combining the breath-taking cinematography with a score that stays on the right side of sentiment. But the most remarkable thing about this film is the quality and standard of the script itself.At first thought the film's subtext seems straight-forward; that one should live life to the full in order that you can realise your potential. This is most obvious in the fact that Jennifer/Mary-Sue stays in Pleasantville to go to college because she wouldn't make it in the real world. But this is not the only point. One has to accept that things change. Pleasantville exists in the eve of the 60's, and this was something that some of the characters could not accept. Racial intolenrance was another theme (demonstrated by the courthouse segregation a la To Kill A Mockingbird). The most fundamental such feeling is that of destroying what is not understood (the park bench through the malt shop window). The most shocking example is the Nazi-like burning of books which represent a different way of life, and also a change. The suggestion of rape, a theme in To Kill a Mockingbird, is also potent in the sight of teenaged girls with ripped clothes. Sex is another theme. The 60's would see a sexual revolution, shown by the antics in Lover's Lane, and the idea of Betty masturbating shows not only this but her breaking away from her husband, pre-empting feminism. Censorship is a running concept, with the afore-mentioned bonfires, blank books and disgust at the nude paintings evoking memories of McCarthyism, and making the Patton spoof that much more meaningful.In short, this film has the perfect setting for its many themes a town on the cusp of change plauged by the narrow-minded. But the town itself is a theme. The point is not just that it never existed, but that it cannot exist. The spirit of imagination, emotion and curiosity is something that can never be contained.I walked out of the cinema feeling elated. I valued what I had more. I even appreciated colour more. I found this film moving on a very profound level. The reference to The Shawshank Redemption was a master stroke however. Never has a film reference been more skillful, natural, and emotional than that single shot. But then what do I know. I liked The Avengers.

Ie Rather than building a milieu around a central concept (cf 'The Truman Show'), the basic premise as a pastiche of the American media's portrayal of 50s surburban America here amounts to little more than a change in scenery. Unfortunately, Ross' portrayal of contemporary US teenage life is equally ersatz and seems like it was lifted from any one of a dozen Hollywood films, so any attempt at juxtaposition is nominal. If read on the same superficial level as the aforementioned films, it fails too. There is never really much feeling of involvement in the story, as characterisation, and especially character interaction, is both simplistic and unsubtle (I don't think the brother and sister talk to each other for a least half of the film, and the mother/son relationship in both time zones is equally poorly sketched). As a lead, Tobey Maguire (so good in 'The Ice Storm') is painfully miscast, becoming more and more irritatingly smug as the film progresses, and ultimately hammering home the film's rather trite message (that things change, but not for better or worse, they just do) vocally and repeatedly to the wide-eyed adoration of all of the female members of the cast. Aesthetically the use of colour is effective, but as a metaphor it rapidly degenerates into self-servitude, and any higher message becomes progressively more cryptic. Despite the gloss provided by a generous budget, the film is clumsily constructed, and routinely scripted, and not half as clever as it thinks it is.

Unfortunately, though, there isn't much evidence of a singular vision. It's unfocused and confused about the direction it wants to take. It's alternately obvious and heavy-handed. It's obvious when it's trying to be funny (which it sometimes is, but the targets are very cheap), and it's heavy-handed when it trys to tackle social comment (actually, it's also pretty obvious when it's tackling social comment).The acting is uniformly excellent but one can't help but feel that the actors really ARE living inside a quaint unrealistic slice of Americana. Pleasantville has no edge, there is no genuine accompanying darkness. The small-minded small-town aggression presented towards the end is very brief and glossed-over. The only blood we see trickles from the mouth of an ignorant (see black and white) character when he is punched for harassing an enlightened (see colour) character.Get it? We're all the same colour on the inside (Sheesh!).The characters are depicted as being liberated in positive ways, mainly through sex (even Jeff Daniel's passion for painting is sexually charged), but there is no down side. It could have traveled down some much more interesing paths than it does - teenage pregnancy (or at least teenage acne!) could have been addressed. It's all pros and no cons.The gradual colourisation of the town is interesting visually (and technically) but conceptually it's inconsistent. Initially it seems that the changes happening in the town alter the characters own perception, they begin to see things differently. This would seem to make perfect sense, their outlook has been expanded by experience, but the film changes tack quite quickly.These newly-aware characters blossom into colour themselves, and characters who are against change (and remain in black and white) can perceive the colour as well as any of the characters who have blossomed. Conceptually it's muddy and half-baked. It could have been much more interesting if the characters who had blossomed remained invisible to the characters who hadn't. They could have played with a more subtle political comment rather than a sledgehammer approach to race issues. I guess they wouldn't have been able to use the line no coloreds allowed (groan) if they took this path.Oh, and just where DID they go to the toilet? (we know that they ate a lot of cheeseburgers).

Ten minutes into the film, despite Reese Witherspoon, I was actually thinking about doing that but once when the 2 main characters warp into Pleastantville and William H. Macy came out that instantly changed. The message here is a very different one but has a good point, some people cannot take serious changes in life even if it could be for the better.There were only 2 things I didn't like about this film that I felt could of been taken out or changed.  The whole TV Repair Salesman was annoying and having the main characters just wake up one day in Pleasantville would have actually seemed more acceptable even though it wouldn't be that original. The salesman just bothered me by his overacting and he had way too much of a childish feel to him.  The other problem was the whole masturbation bit. For a movie like Pleasantville it just didn't really fit in that well, just felt like it was being put in bad taste.  However, these two aspects I didn't like don't even get a total of 8 minutes of screentime combined so they can be overlooked.Pleasantville was a one of a kind experience.  Bulworth and The Truman Show were among the other 2 creative films that were released this year but surprisingly Pleasantville is more enjoyable.

Is there ever a fire, or a car accident? Did anyone smell badly? Were the scones ever burnt?And most importantly, what would happen if 90's morality was introduced into such an environment? Would the citizens understand what was happening?The first part of Pleasantville establishes the ineffective agents. One is male (Tobey Maguire). He's a bit of a nerd and a devotee to the Pleasantville TV series (which shows how much of a nerd he is!)  The other is female and is played by Reese Witherspoon. She's sexually active and more combative in nature.Upon entering their new environment they infect the locals such that before long the teenagers are screwing each other in lover's lane instead of perhaps holding hands, and isn't that wonderful?? Then in the final third there's the reaction to change and then the rather hazy conclusion; an ending that leaves as many questions unanswered as it resolves, especially in regard to the moral majority political movements in present day U.S.A..However there isn't an issue raised in Pleasantville that hasn't been much more adequately addressed in plenty of other films. Check out Life Is Beautiful or Bulworth if you want to see strong comment on racism.The special effects are pleasant as the film begins in black and white (in Pleasantville) and gradually gains colour as the citizens become more enlightened and there are plenty of good performances; especially from Tobey Maguire, Joan Allen , Jeff Daniels and Don Knotts but the overall impression is about as bland as Pleasantville must have been.

The plot involves two teen siblings from the '90's who are magically transported inside the storyline of a 1950's TV show, where everything is black and white -- there are no toilets, the parents sleep in separate beds, and the basketball team never misses a shot. What starts out as a culture-clash comedy changes to a moving commentary on what effect even the simple pleasures of life can have on those who have never experienced them before, as well as a parable about what happens to normally idyllic communities when change is opposed harshly enough. The cast is perfect, with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon cast as the two teens - they will soon be on to bigger and better things. William H.

A must see","Date":"4 February 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  Suppose you suddenly found yourself trapped in the old television show Father Knows Best. The world is black and white and life is perfect. The basketball team never loses, Mommy dearest cooks four course breakfasts, and it never rains. Perfect right? Unless, of course, you refuse to follow the script. Once you deviate from the script, everything starts to fall apart.This is the clever and very effective premise of Pleasantville. David and Jennifer are brother and sister in a very imperfect 90's family. In a fight over the television remote control, they are transported into the television show Pleasantville. David is the reigning Pleasantville trivia champ and a devout fan. He can quote scripts word for word. (Danger, danger Will Robinson! I can quote Monty Python scripts until my fiance kicks me under the table. In the shins. Hard.)  Jennifer, however, thinks it is stupid and corny. Once it is clear what has happened (even if the Why? is as yet unresolved) David is thrilled and Jennifer is outraged. David finally has the nuclear family he has always wanted. Jennifer is aghast at her pasty complexion. While David slowly recognizes which episode they have been trapped in, Jennifer charges off on her own, refusing to follow the script.The nice, bland, white-bread world can't handle the variety. When Jennifer seduces the high school hunk, the scripts fall apart. Couples who previously were contemplating holding hands are suddenly discovering the Kama Sutra in the back seat on Lover's Lane. Suddenly the basketball players can't make a shot. They actually lose a game and the entire town is quietly nonplussed. The men in the barber shop suddenly understand the phrase You can't win them all. More importantly, the world starts to turn into a color world. At first it is just a patch of color here and there. A rose, an umbrella, a young girl's tongue. As the people in Pleasantville start to explore possibilities their world leaves the old black and white behind.The change from black and white to color is handled very deftly and it serves a number of functions. First, it provides a visible symbol of the sense of freedom and possibility that gradually seep into Pleasantville. Second, it serves to give rise to an exploration of prejudice (it gives rise to a very clever visual pun on colored). The gradual transformation to color is quite effective. Although we have seen the same technique in isolated scenes or ads, the effects here really serve the story well.If this movie were just one clever idea, it would be like a Saturday Night Live skit-a one liner dragged out for twelve (or in this case ninety) minutes. But writer/director Gary Ross has more up his sleeve than just a clever idea. He has created a charming and warmly felt movie. We are given two wonderful stories that draw the plot out in fine detail.First, David and Jennifer's parents start to have a few problems. Betty (played by Joan Allen) turns colored as she explores an art book with soda shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels). Johnson has always loved painting his windows for the holidays. With the coming of color, he is given an art history book that brings his artistic soul from a banked ember to a full blaze. Betty is drawn in, and she poses for an expressionist nude in the soda shop window. Trapped in Pleasantville's first thunderstorm, she spends the night with Mr. Johnson. Meanwhile, her husband George arrives home, puts up his hat, and cries out Honey, I'm home! Betty is nowhere to be found, dinner is not on the table or in the oven. When she does turn up she is in full color. George tries to reassure her that the color will go away. But I don't want it to go away! she replies. The breach is irresolvable, and she leaves him for Mr. Johnson. (Later, when George visits David in jail, he brings a bottle of martini olives, the only food in the house he can find.) It's a touching scene, well rendered.The later exploration of prejudice/racism arises very believably. Had it been handled poorly, it would have felt gratuitous or merely tacked on. But here we see its source. As life slips from its comfortable, reassuring ruts, some are not happy with the change. They don't like all the color, changing roles, new music and upheaval. They are not evil, just weak, frightened, and unequipped to cope with the new world. At first, they seek some sort of compromise. They decree a new code of conduct legislating music, allowable colors, etc. Of course, it is perfectly acceptable if you want to remain in the rut. For many of the liberated coloreds it is just another form of surrender. As the coloreds are persecuted by the black-and-whites a huge wall of graffiti becomes a form of protest, leading to a courtroom showdown.This is quite a tribute to the power of the individual and the importance of freedom. We have seen the police state held up as the opposite of freedom, and we are correctly frightened of it. But this movie shows us an altogether more insidious version of such repression. Repression does not automatically mean nasty, evil, or cruel. It can be pleasant, palatable, and prosperous. This is the kind of prejudice that everyone faces in every day life. And the sources of prejudice and control are not just radicals. They are our own family, our friends, our coworkers. Their expectations and need to pigeon hole us have a subtle, cumulative force that takes strength and courage to oppose. And it shows how, in many ways, it takes very little to oppose those forces.

Unfortunately, the director felt it necessary to bring the film full circle by tacking on a sappy and drawn-out conclusion.Aside from the goofy beginning and ending, the silly concept of a magical remote control and the occasional interruption by the irritating Don Knots (also from Three's Company), this film presents about 80 minutes of highly enjoyable and profound cinema.

That said, I found it to be an entertaining way to spend two hours of my life. Certainly, there were instances where the dialogue fell extraordinarily flat, but the movie had many impressive visual achievements that drew attention away from a shaky transition in tone and an unsatisfactory resolution. I was impressed with the cast, but the attempt to tell several stories at once left me with no real character on whom to focus. I thought the plot was a little too clever for its own good, but it was clever, and that's more than one can say for a large percentage of what's out there. Joan Allen is given the most to do, and she acquits herself admirably; Reese Witherspoon is not given enough to do, which is a shame; Tobey Maguire's character is the least fully realized (I cringed every time his character just stood wide-eyed and slack-jawed while everything happened around him, which is pretty much the entire movie), but he does a good job with what he's given. Although I found this movie entertaining, I feel like it didn't control its theme enough, and most of the pleasures in it were incidentals. The climactic trial scene works, minus any sense of actual resolution. And did I mention the tone? The last movie I saw that was this schizophrenic in tone was Carrie, which made it work in its favor more than this one does. Ultimately, I'll recommend this movie; don't expect too much and you won't be let down.

There were, however, a few things that kept me from putting the movie on my all-time favorites list.  First, there seems to be a simplistic one-to-one correlation made between sex and enlightenment, and though there are events later on in the movie which suggest that this isn't quite the case, sex and (secondarily) art seem to be the only really powerful coloring influences. Second, though I realize that Pleasantville is essentially a fable about censorship and the silliness of trying to separate life into acceptable and unacceptable categories, there are some cloying inconsistencies For instance, the black and whites harass the coloreds in a violent manner, and they don't suddenly turn colored (though the mayor's transformation suggests that they should have).  Notably, the only people who act unpleasant in Pleasantville are the black and whites.  Those who become colored are not really transformed into real people(as the film would seem to suggest) with flaws, they are transformed into a sort of idealized enlightened society.  Like the 50s sitcoms they lampoon, the film-makers have chosen to ignore those things which might possibly be unpleasant.  The characters bring art, beauty, and enlightenment to Pleasantville, and suddenly everything seems hunky-dory.  The End.  Roll Credits.  I guess I'm cynical, but in my imagination, after the end of the film, the inhabitants of Pleasantville start having to deal with teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, spouse abuse, alcoholism, and pollution; then the good citizens of Pleasantville start thinking, It's nice that we can read, and go to the bathroom, and have sex, and see pretty colors, but was it really worth it?

He says that the reason he didn't like the movie was because of a major inconsistency if emotion is what's changing things' colors, why do the outraged conservatives, led by Big Bob (Walsh), remain in black and white?The answer is simple. Emotion is not what is colorizing Pleasantville. It's one's acceptance of change. With that in mind, this reviewer may want to watch the movie a second time to see what I mean. All the people in Pleasantville, Bud and Mary Sue (Maguire and Witherspoon) included, turn colors when they realize that they want things to change. Even inanimate objects begin to change colors as if they were accepting what the humans around them were doing. In that way, the script and the effects remained very consistent.What I thought was going to be a fun lampoon of 50's sitcoms turned out to be a truly moving fun lampoon of 50's sitcoms.

Had this movie JUST been about two teenagers whose actions disrupt (and colorize) the fictional black and white town, it might have passed off as a heart-warming family film (or brainless feel-good entertainment, depending on how you look at it).  Certainly the idea was original and well developed enough to hold my attention for the duration of the movie, but apparently the author couldn't leave it at that. The problem with Pleasantville is that it begins to take itself too seriously.  By the middle of the movie, the author takes to drawing rather blatant connections to racial prejudice (no coloreds), a topic which has been more than adequately explored in numerous movies of a much higher caliber than this one.  Such dry and unfocused social criticism certainly will not bring to light any new insights on the nature of racism. I reluctantly admit that by this point in the movie I was coming dangerously close to mistaking the film's clumsy, surface-deep moral probing for actual profundity.  However, this sentiment is smartly struck down in the movie's climax, which is weakly done and lacks any sort of metaphorical foundation.  Pleasantville solves its problems so easily and unambiguously you'd think the author forgot he was writing about just a moment before. Prejudice, violence, and hate are not so easily solved in Care Bear fashion as this movie suggests. All that aside, you can enjoy the movie well enough if you try not to employ critical thinking.

Are the ideals of the '50s, as embodied in shows like Father Knows Best, really a cause for such an attack?  Satire is one thing, but this film goes far beyond satire. It throws in so much symbolism and social commentary, of a widely diverse nature and seemingly on the writer's whim, that, in the end, it's not really about anything at all.

In the version that I saw, it seemed that a lot of ends were left untied. My husband and I both agreed that it seemed like the movie had been edited down from a longer version and not to its benefit. It's a very good movie, elegantly filmed and well acted. It suffers from either too ambitious an agenda, or too aggressive editing. I'd like to see the director's cut of this. I have a feeling that an extra 20 minutes to 1/2 hour of movie would take this from being a very good movie to being a really great movie.

While this is true, what follows is a well written, thought provoking and heart-warming film that lingers with you after you the lights come up.  I truly enjoy it when a movie not only entertains you, but also gets those brain cells working.  Now, don't get me wrong, don't avoid this movie because you want light entertainment in an effort to get your minds off of things, it can be that for you too.  It's just an added bonus that such an entertaining movie can tickle a few questions up.The general plot of the movie is that two teenagers, David and his twin sister Jennifer, are drawn into David's favorite television show, Pleasantville.  While this fulfills David's fantasy, it is his sister's nightmare.  David tries to conform and maintain his roll as Bud, but Jennifer just can't help but be herself, causing a ripple of change to spread throughout the town.Screenwriter Gary Ross who also wrote Big and Dave, once again creates characters you can both identify with and enjoy watching.  Taking you on a journey that is delightful and unpredictable.  If you liked either of Gary Ross' other movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.With the impressive cast, the acting is, of course, first rate.  Joan Allen and William H. Macy as the twin's b&w parents, show off the reason why they've been nominated for awards and Reese Witherspoon as Jennifer is intriguing to watch.  Though at first, Tobey Maguire is a little annoying as the squeeky-voiced nerd David/Bud,  as the movie progresses, he really improves and becomes quite endearing.Now, let's not forget Pleasantville's incredible digital effects.  While the effects in this movie may not be as dramatic as those in What Dreams May Come, they are nonetheless just as impressive.  One scene in particular featuring Joan Allen is quite striking where David/Bud helps her apply b&w makeup to cover up her colored face.  How'd they do that?So, after a summer filled with big-budget explosions and flying fists, Pleasantville is a refreshing change, and well worth spending the money to see on the big screen.  Don't let it pass you by.

An example of its savvy is this what many people think is real liberation -- free sex -- is, in the end, shown as a shallow ultimate destination.  The young sister admits to tiring of being a self-proclaimed slut, and the real-life mother realizes that one more fling is not going to fill her emptiness.  (Ironically, the Pleasantville mother leaves at the end to try a similar path; if this were her answer, she could have stayed with Jeff Daniel's character, with whom she has an earlier affair.)  The film manages this without clever moralism -- indeed, its moral center, let's remember, is a teenaged boy; well-meaning but hardly the epitome of wisdom --  and has such charm, wit, and sylistic panache that one can't help but cheer it on.  When it ends, and that cover version of Across the Universe plays, it feels that we've actually been somewhere, seen some new thing.

Whereas Woody Allen uses black-and-white cinematography to capture the ambiance of the cinema of the past, Gary Ross, who directed and wrote this film, used the lack of color as a symbol for rigidity, sameness, and intolerance.  Between the sight gags and the innuendo, the message emerged with gathering force throughout the film the fifties were not so pleasant for those whose ideas were not mainstream, and whose ideology didn't conform to the close-mindedness of the times.Images borrowed from many other films depicting the ugly middle-American penchant for intolerance are used throughout Pleasantville, and although a bit too obvious, they worked well enough to trigger a shudder in me.  I thought that the casting of Joan Allen as the robotic Stepford-like wife was a coup, considering her former role as Pat Nixon (in the 1995 film Nixon). William H. Macy, as the Father who apparently didn't know best, was superb, and the late J. T. Walsh was once again perfect as the intimidating small-town bully.Many will see Pleasantville and enjoy it purely as a comic portrayal of the stodgy fifties vs. the cool nineties.  It works fine on that level, if you're willing to resist allowing the strong images of intolerance from making their point.

Yet I left the movie with little peace over the solution.  I can't recall one African-American person in the movie, and yet that angle could have been a powerful means to address what continues to be a sensitive issue.

The scenes with only faint traces of color have great power and a subliminal beauty that should not be taken for granted.  I've never seen contrast in color and in worlds used so effectively before.I enjoyed the story too, but after awhile it degenerated into self-important preaching that came off as watery and ineffective.  The film repeats familiar messages so boldly that you can't even form your own thoughts on them -- they resemble worthy lessons, but are spoken in terms as basic as Facism bad!  Thinking different good!  I agree that our rather conformist society needs to see the power and value of individuality, but this was too much.  By the end I felt that Mr. Ross was trying to give his film more meaning that it had.Still, I think Pleasantville employs humor far more effectively than most comedies have this year.  Watching Joan Allen ask what's sex? was worth the price of admission alone, and the general cluelessness of the citizenry never ceases to amuse.In the end, it is a concept film that makes a great effort, but does not measure up to The Truman Show.

Are you always happy? Or are you like me when nothing ever goes your way? If the answer to the first two questions are no and the third one yes then you should watch this film. You should know that the film references some cult black and whit television but I don't know which. But this film is going to hit with it's message and it lasts. That hope is still in the world even if you change. In Pleasantville David is young man in high school who watches TV times Pleasantville and has watched every single episode and is going to watch the marathon while answering the questions. And he has a crush on a girl in school but doesn't have the courage to ask her out. His sister on the other hand is a fad girl who hangs out with her friends and is trying to make a date with the hottest guy in school. But everything changes when a TV repairman comes at their door and gives them a new remote. He starts asking David questions about Pleasantville, when the repairman leaves David and his sister start arguing over the TV again and they pull the remote and it sends them to Pleasantville, where they begin to discover something in themselves and the town. You will appreciate this film more if you do what I did and go in to it knowing very little. It will be the greatest joy you will have with this film. You might like it if your a self-effacing person because nothing ever goes your way,if you just want a good laugh or if you just want to smile after a bad day.Because it has some memorable characters played by wonderful actors. Tobey Maguire plays David who once he goes into the world of Pleasantville must become Bud and sticks with that name because he is changing. He gives an amazing performance, Tobey Maguire notably does when he plays characters similar to these. This is the best performance I've seen from Reese Witherspoon who plays David/Bud's sister Jenifer/Mary Sue, Her character's always spice things up to her taste, it makes Maguire's characters eventually play along in his own way. Joan Allen(who's work I've never seen)plays Betty the mother of the television characters Bud and Mary Sue. Her and Reese Witherspoon share one of my favorite sequences in the film. Marly Shelton plays Margaret who gives cookies to one of the characters from the TV world but decides to go with the change that she's happening around her. They all feel something in their guts these characters and that's the best thing about them they don't know what to do, they would usually feel scared of getting out of their comfort zone but they have the courage to do so.

After seeing this movie you start to realize that there was a purpose to integrating black and white and color. A main theme of the movie was living life to its fullest, taking the good with the bad, taking a chance once and awhile. Tobey Maguire's speech at the end when he talks about sweeping things under the rug and basically acting pleasant all the time isn't the right way to live. It is a part of life that bad things happen. When you show yourself having passion its going to come with positive outcomes and negative, when you keep in the passion for the sake of being kind or cordial it becomes a empty life. Its a everlasting key to the human condition. People quite often fear change, its universal from beginning to end of time. The film does a great job of showing this fear and when society comes together they grow as a society and it becomes a good thing even when scary. The transitioning from black and white to color expressed this fear perfectly. Some would say that the director is promoting promiscuity, out of wedlock sex. Although there was a suggestion of a point about openness and not conceal ones feelings. Reese Witherspoon's character was already promiscuous but when she finished a book with no pictures the act of completing something and changing her behavior is what changed her into color. The catalyst of people changing in the movie is the eagerness to experience new things and to become vulnerable. I feel that movies like Pleasantville confront the viewer and compel them to think are very rare in today's world of Hollywood movies. Which should be treasured by any avid film-goer. To wrap this all up this is more than the old way and the new way after change. We need to see ourselves inside and out. If you live a life that is stuck and not changing then what you get is black and white. It is when we allow ourselves to mature as people that we are granted with the ability to see in colors or outside the box. The town is only opened up to the rest of the world when everyone is in color and then they are all able to travel outside the few streets in town. Its odd how everyone knows what color is but then don't want it or change when it appears everywhere.

Not even close to what this movie is about!!It's about discovering the beauty that out not-so-perfect world has to offer. I love that the people in this movie discover themselves sexually, artistically and intellectually.

While the film nails the tone one would expect from the writer turned director, what Pleasantville has in store for its viewers is &#x96; for lack of a better term &#x96; a pleasant mix of satire and sentiment as well.If you're not sold by the unique narrative or the gorgeous cinematography at hand, then look forward to the film's brilliant cast. Sure, a young Maguire and Witherspoon are engaging enough, and you can't beat William H. Macy and Joan Allen as the TV parents, but it is Jeff Daniels as a short-order cook turned artist who steals the show. His role in the film and the way he executes it captures both the humanity and humor of the film and ultimately goes a long way to make Pleasantville the unique experience it is and is definitely one of the most criminally overlooked performances in an often over-looked film.While the movie doesn't exactly encapsulate the turn of the century quite in the way that it sets out too, it does bear a few lessons that you're never too old to learn. The main message of the film is to live life to the fullest, to not be afraid to take risks and not be afraid to fail and make mistakes. For every good experience, there's a bad experience to counteract it, something that the folks of the fictional town don't come to realize until the two teens arrive on the scene. To that end, the film is a success, and in essence, Pleasantville is timeless.

The coloreds reference is powerful and anyone part of a minority might see and appreciate the point being made. You might have to watch it 2 or 3 times, as I did, to catch some of the gist.This movie is not Hollywood propaganda, nor leftist garbage; it is simply a story of how simplicity, conformity and no change can be stifling, if not stultifying.

It seems like a simple story at first but as the plot deepens, the film becomes unwieldy though fascinating in sections.Tobey Macguire is David, a teenager who is looking forward to a marathon of his favorite TV show, Pleasantville, a '50s comedy similar to any that baby boomers grew up with. When an unsolicited TV repairman (Don Knotts) appears, he leaves David a special remote. David manages to zap himself and his sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) into the black and white world of Pleasantville. David warns Jennifer that they cannot do anything out of character for the town. However, being modern teens, they are not in step with the people of Pleasantville and sure enough, the TV town begins to change...from black and white to color.What makes Pleasantville the movie a fun experience is that everyone seems to have a different interpretation of what, for instance, the color means, and the message of the film. I can only give my own impressions. For some, the film promotes sexual promiscuity. As the kids become more sexually active, led by Jennifer, and turn into color characters, they are then faced with sexually transmitted diseases and become objects of prejudice, black and white versus colored. Get it? Then pages that were blank in books are filled in as Jennifer and David tell the stories of Huck Finn et al., which causes books to be burned.For me the color wasn't equal to sexual promiscuity but to emotional life. And what the movie was trying to say for me is that the black and white world of the Pleasantville TV show only existed on television. There were enlightened people in the '50s and plenty of dysfunctional families and illegitimate babies, so someone was having sex; television just didn't show them. TV did mirror much of society, but people have been people through the ages even if the identities men and women have in our culture has changed. Jennifer is a sexually promiscuous teen; in Pleasantville, she starts reading and studying and understands that there's a lot more to life. David's TV dad (Bill Macy) realizes that he loves his wife (Joan Allen) even if she doesn't have dinner on the table at 6 p.m. every evening.I found Pleasantville absorbing but something was a little off-kilter about its execution. Perhaps it was in the set-up of David and Jennifer winding up in Pleasantville, which initially made it seem that the film was going to be a wacky comedy. Despite fine performances from Bill Macy, Jeff Daniels as a coffee shop owner/frustrated artist, Joan Allen, Knotts, Witherspoon, and Maguire, in the end, Pleasantville bit off a little more than it could chew.

The point of the movie (as far as I'm concerned and from listening to the commentary track by Ross on the DVD) is that life is never simple and life does not follow any set of rules that are found in the fictional town of Pleasantville. Rules can be made, but all rules are broken at some point or another. Some people don't need a movie to tell them that, but others like to be reminded that life isn't as simple as some want us to believe. There are rich metaphors in this movie and a great deal of symbols that you sometimes need to look for and other times are very straightforward.

The fact that no one in the town knows what is outside of Pleasantville is so indicative of people that don't know that there is anything else in life other than their routine lives.

I like it on its terms, though, not the terms that everybody seems to impute to it. In short, it is the story of two 1990's average teens (one an obsessive fan of a 1950s family drama about an ideal town in the mold of Father Knows Best) who are transported magically from their own shabby world to the world of that TV show.OK, let me get out a couple of thoughts up front. Pleasantville is not an attack on the Fifties. It does not contain any references to Nazis (though there is some unnecessary fascist imagery). It is not a polemic about the Civil Rights movement. Sorry, I know that's what everyone wants to believe. But it isn't so.The use of a 1950s-style TV show to develop the plot is what throws everybody off about this film. It may as well be a movie about the 1850s as it is about the 1950s, but the film happens to be set in 1950s suburbia, so immediately everybody's opinions about that milieu rise to the surface. But that is a red herring. The actual point of the film is much more interesting.The film is not saying that the 1990s (or whenever) is better than the 1950s. It is saying that real life, with all its messy situations and complications, is preferable to some perfect fantasy-land. It also is saying that obsessing over an old, completed body of work - here, the old TV show - is a dead end. It is static and unchanging. That story is written and will never change. But real life isn't already written, and is vibrant and infinitely preferable. Not realizing that is missing out on what life has to offer.So, if you are a big fan of, say, Charles Dickens (to get back to that 1850s comment I made above), that is all well and good. But his novels aren't going to change. The endings are whatever he wrote, and he's dead. His works can be enjoyed, but they are no substitute for real life adventures, which don't have endings yet.Note the beginning of film, when the Tobey Maguire character sits through lectures about the horrible things happening in his world. That's the key - the film is not trying to say his world is more perfect or anything like that. He is such a big fan because his own world (broken home) is so horrible, and he longs for a touch of Pleasantville perfection. But his world is his reality, and finally he realizes that that is way better than any fiction.The best scene in the film, for me, is at the very end. The Don Knotts character, when all is said and done and the Maguire character has learned his lesson, gives a knowing smile and drives away. I like to think that he knew the movie could just as easily have been called Mayberry.

What stuck out to me, however, was the director's brilliance portraying a circumstance of clashing values. The two clashing values in this film are free expression and order. The people of Pleasantville valued order before David and Jennifer arrived. These characters valued free expression and did not understand why they couldn't express freely in a town such as Pleasantville. As they expressed themselves freely, other people in the town began to do the same while the rest of the citizens tried to keep order. Change was considered undesirable in a town like Pleasantville, especially when it was rapid. Eventually most people realized that although it isn't desirable, change is sometimes necessary for a society to grow. Soon, the citizens realized that they had something in them that wanted to express. As this happened, the changing town seemed easier to deal with. The people of Pleasantville found that if they open their minds toward others and allow each other to be who they are instead of who society wants them to be, they will become not only richer in color but richer in any other way they can imagine.

Although this film is mainly described as a comic fantasy, it's not all funny. There is a serious side to it, and underneath the fantastic special effects and nostalgia jokes lies a deeply woven subplot of racism and sexism which takes inspiration from things like the Holocaust. It's there to be seen if you look close enough.The basic plot is two modern day teenagers being paid a visit by a smiley happy TV repair guy (Don Knotts) who gives them a very different kind of remote, which somehow sucks them into a black-and-white 1950's TV show called Pleasantville. Forced to assume the roles of Bud and Mary-Sue Parker (cue Spiderman joke), the two teenagers try to get along in a world that is absolutely perfect, where firemen are required only for getting cats out of trees because nothing can catch fire, where double-beds are unheard of and where the basketball team is undefeated because they can't fail to put the ball in the basket.The acting in this film is very good in some places and not so good in others. Reese Witherspoon is perfectly accurate in her portrayal of Jennifer, the spoiled, sexy sister of the slightly geeky David (Tobey Maguire). Although Tobey is good in some films, I don't think he was a strong enough actor to support the character of David, especially at times when he has to swear and hit people, although he does well in quieter, more sensitive times of the film. Also, keep an eye out for a member of the Buffy cast in a very minor role.This is definitely a film to suit anyone. If you're a real thinker you can appreciate the underlying issues and hints at other points in history. If not, you can just enjoy the fun and surreality of the film, especially the great way they mix colour with black and white.

In 'Pleasantville', this scenario is reversed David (Tobey Maguire) dreams of (and then visits) the idealised world portrayed in a 1950s, black-and-white soap opera, in contrast to the exciting real world in which he is just a geek. His trendy sister, played by Reese Witherspoon, travels with him (though only under severe protest). The need of the characters to adapt to, and not to upset, the past has elements of 'Back to the Future' about it; while the contrast between the real world and a santised utopia, whose inhabitants know nothing different, resembles 'The Truman Show'. 'Pleasantville' is less obviously comic than either of these films, but it is beautifully executed and William H. Macy in particular seems perfect for his role as David's fictional father. Dramatically, however, it suffers from the fact that Maguire never manages to convince that he truly believes in the reality of his situation. And when films such as 'The Last Picture Show' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' have addressed (with great subtlety) what is lost, and gained, when the values on which small town communities are based break down, it seems strange that 'Pleasantville' offers us only a pointless dichotomy between a world where everything is nice but dull, and another equally unreal world, where the pursuit of individual gratification always results in its acquisition. As a result, the film does little more than lazily peddle the standard Hollywood myth, that we can be anything we want if we believe it; a sad end for a work of some artistic distinction.Dorothy tired of Oz and came to wish for Kansas; likewise, David returns to the real world, and in spite of knocking down a conservative straw man, 'Pleasantville' is truly a conservative (and smug) film in itself. David's manifesto is supposedly that there is no right way in life; but as David himself becomes cooler, while his sister learns the joy of books, the standard happy medium is thrust upon the audience with no apparent awareness of the blatant contradiction. In fact, the film's vision of modern life appears no less rose-tinted than the vision of the 1950s it rejects. A pleasant, but pernicious, film.

I like all of the references that it made to real life; about accepting change, overcoming hard times and prejudice against a certain group of people.  The way the black and white people tried to hold back the people in color and the things that caused it really stood out for me.I thought Tobey Maguire's character, David Wagner/Bud Parker, was the coolest.  He knew so much about the show `Pleasantville,' loved the idea of living in the show and yet he when things started to change from black and white to color, he embraced the idea of things changing in a perfect world.The scene that left an image in my mind was the scene where the black and white people trashed Bill Johnson, Jeff Daniels character's, diner because of the color art on the window.  There was so much hatred and violence in that scene that it left an image in my mind.I would definitely recommend this movie to people who are fans of Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, or William Macy.

It is a human story about human aspirations and human failings.  In the end it is life-affirming, but nothing is white-washed along the way.TOO MUCH TVPleasantville is the title of a fifties-style TV show whose reruns dominate the viewing habits of cynical siblings Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.  They scoff at the perfect world portrayed on the TV, but their own lives are on a cynical downward tilt.  When their personal negativity reaches critical mass, they are sucked into the TV set and into the absurdly positive world of Pleasantville.WHAT'S OUTSIDE OF PLEASANTVILLE?But the human kids in the TV world soon discover that all is not as it seems in Pleasantville.  The smiling people all around them are only black-and-white representations of human characters.  They don't smile because they're happy, they smile because they're on TV.  In fact there is no joy nor sorrow in Pleasantville, and nothing of human emotion is allowed to show--until Tobey Maguire goes to work.YOU CAN'T STOP SOMETHING THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU!Tobey plays the well-meaning snake in this monochromatic garden of eden. It is Tobey who prods the Pleasantville People into revealing their hidden colors, their humanity.  But it is not just human beauty that is let loose, but human ugliness as well.  Ross is determined to show us that a chaotic, real world where truth and beauty vie against our darker impulses is the only world where humanity stands a chance of not just persevering, but prevailing.  Otherwise, we will simply fade to black-and-white.Pleasantville, released in 1998, was the first feature to be processed digitally in its entirety (and NOT Star Wars Episode One).  Although this is not an effects movie, techniques developed for Pleasantville are just now being adopted on a similar scale by effects movies.  Gary Ross was ahead of his time both thematically and visually.

Apparently things would start to become flawed - in other words, become just like us), and the colour effects are wonderful, both for their use and restraint (we only actually see a change from monochrome to colour once in the entire movie, making it all the more effective) - but Gary Ross, making his debut as a director after good work as a mere writer (Big, Dave and - er - Mr. Baseball), can't quite cover up some glaring problems with his tale. That there's no adequate explanation offered for how this comes about is fine (this is a fantasy, after all); that it gets sentimental is also no problem (I don't have a problem with schmaltz, as can be judged from the fact that I loved What Dreams May Come).What IS a problem is that it's never explained how a place that's been in black and white since time began can a) know how to tell one colour from another and b) have any concept of colour to begin with; more seriously, the movie overdoes its racial allegory aspect (nowhere more so than in the courtroom climax)... and when you think about it, would it really have been so acclaimed if the situations had been reversed?

One-of-a-kind film that has so many messages, so well done, a real 10 on my scale.","Date":"6 June 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Pleasantville can be enjoyed on two entirely different levels - as a very entertaining fairy tale with great creative use of B&W or color scenes, or as an inspired comentary on the human existence. In truth it is both, and is best enjoyed as both.I will take this opportunity to say that the DVD version is so much superior in every way, it is an injustice to view it any other way. It has a fine making of feature showing how the color/B&W tricks are done. But the most useful feature is the selectable commentary track by the writer/director, Gary Ross, who also wrote a couple of other hit fantasies - Dave and Big. Ross is the son of a scriptwriter, grew up in that environment, is a virtual walking encyclopedia of films, and of course his films like Pleasantville invariably incorporate ideas borrowed from older films. This is not a fault. It works seemlessly to create a great total package of viewing enjoyment.The whole film centers squarely on one subject, which is dear to Ross' heart - Is it better to live in a society with strict rules to ensure absolute safety and happiness, but no choices, or is it ultimately better to have a free society which permits choices, and danger, which we have to learn to deal with, but which may ultimately make our lives more fulfilled?  He does this by transporting teen twins David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon)into a fictional 1950s black and white TV series, Pleasantville, where they become Bud and Mary Sue.  Their TV parents are played by Joan Allen and William Macy. Jeff Daniels plays the local soda jerk and hamburger cook. Don Knotts is the TV technician who provides them with the magical TV remote which causes them to be transported.Their first reactions are understandable. Jennifer wants to get back to her big date on Friday night. Bud realizes where he is, because he is a trivia expert on the TV series, and he just wants to insure everything is preserved just the way it has been scripted.  As viewers, we see them actually in the world represented by the TV series, not simply as series characters. The B&W world that Pleasantville residents live in represents the black and white of right and wrong. The temperature is always 72 degrees, day and night. It never rains. No one ever questions what's outside Pleasantville? The wife always has supper ready at 630PM when each man comes home after his workday. The books have no writing. The bathrooms have no toilets. The residents do not know anger, fighting, or even what sex is. As was in The Purple Rose of Cairo, all they know is what has been contained in the various scripts of the TV series.There are exactly two events which trigger everything else in Pleasantville. One is when Jennifer, as Mary Sue, becomes the sexual aggressor by taking her date to lovers lane, and eventually exposes him to the concept of sex. The second is when David, as Bud, shows up late at the malt shop and finds Daniels' character standing there, rag in hand, rubbing the counter until he had almost eaten through the formica, because his scripted existance didn't allow him to do anything until Bud showed up. Until Bud explained that he could deviate and do things himself, even if Bud weren't there yet. All other changes that Pleasantville goes through are a result of the domino effect as an outfall of those two events.  Don't take my word for it - that's what Gary Ross says about his movie.So, we see color gradually coming into Pleasantville as a result of changed attitudes.  First a single red rose, then a face, a car's tail light, whole people, the sky, and finally the whole town. They introduce conflict of ideas, a defensive punch in the face, rain, lightning, fire, expressive paintings in color.Ross' use of sex in this film has been criticized by some. As he explains in his commentary, from an animal and human existence, recognition of sex and sexual urges are so basic that without them, you cannot fully explore other aspects of your existence. Of course, no one in Pleasantville knew anything about sex. So, this sexual awakening, for the most part tastefully done, among residents of Pleasantville was used as the catalyst, if you will, to lead to all other awakenings. As the story develops, sex becomes very secondary as the characters develop towards more lofty ideals.By the end of the film, David/Bud and Jennifer/Mary Sue each are also very changed, and they don't get colored in Pleasantville until they make these basic changes. Jennifer goes from this shallow, sex-obsessed teen girl, into one who actually values the books she reads and the society she is in, and plans to stay in Pleasantville and to go to college. David gains a real empathy for those around him, embraces change, and in a touching scene back home, consoles his divorced mother who is sad that things aren't the way they are supposed to be. He tells her, It isn't supposed to be any particular way, going on to encourage her to learn to love and live life and just see whats happens.So, in total the whole film comments on the absurdity of blindly trying to preserve our rules, for longing for the good old days, for resisting and fearing change, for such things as discrimination because of the color of a person's skin. And it specifically shows how people can change, as did David, Jennifer, and the residents of Pleasantville, to gain a fresh appreciation for life's possibilities.This film is so well done on every level that on my list it stands as one of the best of all. A truly inspired work. A film that I will enjoy periodocally for years to come.BTW, some have attributed the burning tree to the Biblical burning bush. Author, Ross, says there was no intention there, just a desire to show a fantastic effect when Joan Allen's sexual awakening occurred, and fire, which had never been seen in Pleasantville, seemed like a neat way to do it. However, he does acknowledge the Garden of Eden allegory in the apple scene at lovers lane.

Pleasantville, in more than a pleasant surprise, does the exact opposite. Using the same plot device seen before in much lesser movies, two children of the 90's get zapped into a 1950's sitcom reminiscent of Father Knows Best and Leave It To Beaver. They suddenly face blending into a town where everything is in black-and-white, and everyone has charming, naive good nature. You expect it to get silly and go nowhere after the first few clever cross-genre jokes.Except that in this film, we get a big surprise just when we expect the film to lose its charm, it becomes a far more intelligent, sophisticated and beguiling film than we thought it could be. First-time director Gary Ross actually decided to go somewhere with the plot; we expect that the two modern teenage siblings (the nerdy David and his slutty sister Jennifer, played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) will slip up and in doing so reveal witty differences between the two time periods. However, Ross delivers his surprise not just in how the two modern kids react to an ideal, white-bread 50's-style society, but more immediately in how that society reacts to their hedonistic influences. As David comfortably fits in to a world he is more at ease with, his sister instantly rebels, taking teen-dream basketball player Skip (Paul Walker) to Lover's Lane, where she shows him how to do more than hold hands, and shocks him into a very human male reaction (Skip, it's -supposed- to do that!). But as Skip digests and accepts this amazing experience, he sees a single rose by the side of road in color-and everything goes uphill from there.What is truly most surprising in this film is the unexpected nature of the underlying messages about the two disparate time periods. In an age where middle America looks back in fondness and more than a little longing for those clean, innocent days of a generation forever changed and gone, we get an interesting mixture of commentary not just on what was wrong, but also what was right. Director Ross subtly builds his exposition based upon the metaphor of color, representing change. The primary message is that while the good old days of a utopian suburbia may have been pleasant, we paid a price for it; when everything is swell and keen, we avoid the very bad-but also we avoid the very good. Discord is not too high a price for the true joys of life.Along the way we are treated to some beautiful imagery and sly metaphors which catch you by surprise, from Eve giving Adam the apple to fascist destruction of art and literature-with just the right cast to convey the messages with subtle conviction. Brilliant actors such as Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen and William H. Macy recognized a good film and helped deliver it, Daniels as a kindly-but-dumb soda jerk who realizes a love for art, Allen as perfect housewife discovering a repressed desire for freedom, and Macy as a good-natured dad, not forcefully unwilling to change, but rather woefully befuddled by the passing of his ideal life. Add to that exceptional performances by J. T. Walsh (in his final role, as the hard-headed civic leader who fights the change) and Don Knotts (of all people! as the TV repairman who facilitates David and Jennifer's transference to Pleasantville).This is not to play down the performances of the film's two stars Maguire and Witherspoon, who help deliver the film's subtle message, which is not just portrayed in the changes to the fictional characters of Pleasantville, but is also represented by the changes in the two protagonists. David and Jennifer's initial states of chaste nerd and high-school slut (metaphors for the 50's and the 90's) blend into their final, sensible common state somewhere between the two, suggesting that there are good things about both eras. Not only does the film suggest that the 50's were too good to be good, it also tells us that perhaps we would be better for putting a little of that era into our present lives.

I cannot rave on about it enough, but I'll try right now. I didn't get the part at the start (looking at all the teachers in different classes, talking about future problems with sex, disease, employment, etc.) until later in the film, where it dawned on me that this was simply pointing out how different life in the 90s is to life in the 50s. I myself cannot verify whether life in the 50s was really like this, as I am only sixteen years old, but it was still interesting to compare them. That was what this film really achieved it showed that while lifestyles have changed enormously over the past 40 or 50 years, human nature hasn't. The same racist and prejudiced attitudes still occur today, and this deeper meaning that lies under the surface of Pleasantville is what makes it such an achievement. But I'm jumping to halfway through the film, so I'll get back to the start. I also laughed at the part where Jennifer and David are fighting over the remote, and it is mirrored in Bud and Mary-Sue fighting over the transistor radio. I cracked up at the basketball team missing all their shots at the hoop after Skip has just spoken to them. I also laughed at Betty Parker asking Jennifer what sex was. These, among other moments, lifted the movie up, allowing it to be serious and get a message across, but at the same time being full of laughs. The special effects and photography in this movie were truly a masterpiece. For once, they were put to good use, rather than being used for crashes or explosions. The special effects department here obviously devoted a lot of time and effort to the colour differences. The part where a black and white tree bursts into coloured flames was excellent. The combination of coloured and black and white people in the courtroom was also well done. But what was truly visually stunning was the part where a black and white David/Bud and Margaret are driving in a yellow convertible down the road, while millions of pink petals blow around. This was one of the most beautifully made moments ever put in a movie, and I pressed rewind several times when I got Pleasantville on video, just to watch that part again. That is one of the rare moments you can find in a movie that never fails to make you smile. The lush photography in this movie further adds to the whole experience, making it even more worthwhile. Some criticism has risen about several aspects of the movie. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY OF IT. People have complained about the dramatic second half of the film being a miss. This is completely untrue the second half is direct, straight to the point and gripping. The changes that make the people turn to colour in Pleasantville, when people break away from their normal selves, were also excellent. In particular, when Jennifer stops being a tart and starts enjoying simpler things like books. Also, the script was excellent. The film flowed seamlessly, and the acting was a dream. A lot of the actors here were relative unknowns, except for Reese Witherspoon, who I have also seen in Freeway, Cruel Intentions and Election. I must admit, she is a talented and convincing actor, and has shown that she can play a variety of roles country gal, bimbo/sl*t, good girl and ambitious, ruthless schoolgirl. Both her, Joan Allen, and Tobey Maguire deserved to at least be nominated, and should have won, academy awards for their superb acting, and once you add nominations for art direction, special effects, best film... Pleasantville deserved to get at least about eight nominations, not just one or two. In short, Pleasantville was not about sex, or television (although it was much better than those other television-dissectional savvies, The Truman Show and EDtv), or 90s versus 50s. It was about breaking away from yourself, changing, and facing up to the prejudices that are ever-present in our society. I cannot recommend this movie enough, and it easily earns an 11 out of 10. Don't miss it.

Some people who ask the question, `What's the movie about?' aren't happy unless the response is full of abstract nouns.  Hence, I suppose, the misconception that it's really some kind of comment on America in the 1950s, or lost innocence, or some such.  Viewed that way the film is obviously weak and confused.  But it can only be read that way in wilful defiance of the evidence.  Respond to the fantasy first; hunt for metaphors later.View it properly and you'll notice that `Pleasantville' has nothing to do with a Vanished America or How Fictions Reconstruct Reality or Lost Innocence or any of that tiresome stuff.  It's really a story closely akin to Pygmalion.  (I'm talking Greek myth, not George Bernard Shaw.)  Or perhaps Pinocchio.  It's the story of people who have been created for the purposes of art - statues who have come to life - who gradually attain more and more humanity.  It's a story that can ONLY be told by means of fantasy. You'll notice that the central protagonists (the ones who were real all along) are, in a sense, not fully human either.  Indeed the David/Bud character starts out as one of the most stunted and unlikeable protagonists you're likely to find.  It's the film's triumph that we empathise with him in the end.It's also gorgeously shot.  (It mustn't have been easy - a combination of colour and black and white can so easily look a ghastly mess.)  Special effects show that some people, at least, know how to properly use computers for effect, and when not to use them.  None of the wonderful images was generated by computer - every one of them began as an image should begin, with light striking film.This is really lovely - and worth seeing on a big screen.

I agree with other people who frowned at some of the immorality in the movie, but I don't agree with some of the comments which said that people in the movie only turned color when they were sinning.  They turned color when they were experiencing deep feelings for the first time.  When did Mary Sue/Jen turn color?  When she had delved into a book for the first time.  When did Bud/David turn color?  When he stood up for someone that he cared about. Then there is the bathtub scene.  Maybe I'm way off, but I don't think that Betty actually you-know-what.  I think that her oohing and aahing is supposed to make us think that she is before we realize that she is really oohing and aahing at the colors she is seeing.  It is all a question of interpretation and point of view, as is everything in the movie.  It is about our most human feelings and how we choose to address them.  Do we deny our feelings and live robotic, ignorant lives or do we acknowledge our feelings and nurture them?  These are questions that all of us must ask ourselves.

It felt like a political brow beating. To say that being immoral will better your lives is just the sinners way of justifying their own bad choices. Now I don't have to agree with the ideology and morals of a movie to enjoy it or appreciate the message or statement but this film and story was so flawed in it's delivery that I found it to be of very little worth.If I really expected all films to match my own personal beliefs or convictions in order to enjoy them, I'd probably not like very many films. I know that there are many lifestyles other than my own. I expect to be shocked, scared, enlightened and otherwise affected when seeing a movie. In the instance of Pleasantville, I was simply insulted.Masturbating will make me a better person, huh? Having rampant sex will enrich my life while remaining morally clean means I'm a hate monger and my life is drab? Please.The film depicts people who are in black and white until they show their true colors and experience a new emotion. Usually one that is completely out of character for them. This is literal as all of the people ARE characters in a sterile 50's tv show. There's a major flaw in this concept played out on the screen. Once Joan Allen turns color after discovering that her husband isn't needed for sexual gratification, she is chased around and taunted by some boys who remain black and white despite this current action. The towns mayor turns color after emitting anger and hate. Why then did these boys not turn color when they were acting out their emotions? They weren't exactly living up to the standards of Pleasantville. And what about the rest of the towns people who stood in judgement of the colored people. Are these not converse emotions as well?Parallels are attempted to be drawn between the treatment of the now colored people in the film and the actual colored people from the same era in our real history. This is not accurate. In the film, it was the immoral acts and sins of the people that brought about a change in them, making them appear in full color. They were persecuted and even kept out of certain establishments. In real life, it was not the behavior of colored people that brought about the bigotry. It was the ignorance and hatred of others projected on a whole race, regardless of their morals or behavior. To attempt a comparison of the two is asinine.This movie was just an attempt to give a stamp of approval to doing whatever you want as long as it feels good.If you liked Pleasantville and didn't like this review, consider  this Gary Ross wrote something that is dear to his heart and he spoke his mind. I too wrote something that is dear to my heart and I spoke my mind. I too hope to make films one day. When I do, they'll reflect a part of me. Some you'll like, some you won't. But that's what movies are all about. Pleasantville deserved to be made as does every film. I look forward to Gary's other ventures as a director. He did a fantastic job of bringing Pleasantville to the screen and the message was loud and clear.Until next time, I remain in black and white, and I still love you.

Every so often is there a film that screams the banal message, 'safety is overrated'. This ideology has been repeated so many times in numerous films (though it may fall upon deaf ears), that the message behind it all has become hollowed out. Truth be told, I've gotten bored with this sort of movie.Then comes Pleasantville, the movie that executes this idea so differently, it's simply perfect.Pleasantville is a make-believe town in the movie that is the generic stereotype of good ol' 1950s America; everything's swell, simple, and there was no such thing as no-strings- attached sex. It was a mundane black and white world with no hiccups or atrocities. Pleasantville was, well, pleasant. Then, everything changed when a pair of siblings (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) arrived. Trapped in time, the two siblings are overwhelmed by oddities like loving parents, old-fashioned values, and a plethora of innocence. They soon learn to join this 'backwards' society, bringing colour to this small town. As the naivet√© fades, the teens begin to wonder if their 'modern' perceptions are really the better option. I loved this movie, to say the least. The fact that this movie was set in a 1950s sitcom made the colour versus black and white contrast that much starker. I guess you could blame my inner Literature student for saying this, but this metaphor used made the movie a great deal more enjoyable, and the message so much sharper. The characters changed. They tried new things. They got more intrepid and spontaneous. People painted and had sex, wives no longer made dinner for their husbands, and the world was a technicolour wonderland. As the characters became more willing to try new things and take risks, they become people, and colour trickles into their black and white world. The characters literally had more colour in them as the movie went on. How is one to live passionately if they cling on to good old fashioned values, innocence or caution anyway, right? The concept used in this movie is brilliant. It puts its message across so effectively. Pleasantville is a movie that will make people sit up and go, 'Hey, I get the message. It makes sense.' The concept is so startlingly simple, but it's the most ingenious one I've seen. It grabs the audience's attention and entertains us no end. The setting, characters and plot are all woven together so fittingly. The development of the cardboard cut-out characters to real people, the demolition of awful stereotypes, and the fantastic screenplay make this movie worth your time.Pleasantville is more than pleasant, it is remarkable.

Apparently too good to be true in the TV show, David and Jennifer discover that these people are somehow for real and endearingly child-like in their outlook on the world.Indeed, the whole town is somehow black and white, in a way that parallels their uncomfortably incomplete personalities and grasp of their own potential.Even more disconcerting for the two teenagers - they quickly find themselves parents to these inexperienced human beings who populate the Garden of Eden that is Pleasantville.It dawns early on David that they have a special responsibility towards these fragile individuals whose simple lives they unwittingly challenge and complicate by just being there.Skilfully using the metaphor of the progressive change from monochrome to colour to mirror the rapid personal development and coming of age of the whole community, a warm and gentle comedy threads through their reluctant progress towards a functional and independent existence.There's something disquieting about this film and something wonderfully reassuring. With Tobey McGuire's character David we see a heart-warming transformation from a squabbling teenager at the opening of the film into a resourceful and dependable catalyst for the essential personal obstacles that these outdated black and white characters must overcome.In Reese Witherspoon's character Jennifer, we feel less comfortable. Confronted with their obvious vulnerability and na√Øvet√©, she is not slow to play the situation to her own advantage with little grasp of what is special about them, and why they warrant this careful handling that her brother is at pains to supply.Wrapped up in this film is much of the confusion that seems to underpin family relationships over the lifetime of any individual. It's not always clear at any point in the film who's in need of looking after and why, but by some mysterious process almost everybody is transformed and enriched by the subtle revolution that is wrought by these unlikely visitors from the future "},{"Title":"Moving","Date":"8 February 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" This is no doubt the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

They hate each other, but get stuck in a fifties sitcom and will have to make the best out of it. Because her brother is a big fan of the show, he knows everything about the town and its inhabitants. At first it all seems perfect, but than they find out that the little paradise isn't that perfect at all and that it is really nothing more but a hollow shell without any meaning. Gradually they influence their new world in such a way that nothing is left of what it was like.This movie is actually a great satire. It shows that people have developed an idealistic image of the past that is far from the truth. Everything in the fifties was great, everybody was happy, it never rained, no-one had sex before marriage... It's all wrong, but today there are still people who think we all should go back to these moral standards. In fact this movie shows these people that that ideal image never existed, that there was racial hatred, that not everything went well... and we would never be able to live by those standards.What I liked so much about the movie was the way the perfect world was contrasted with the real world. The real world is in color and the perfect world in black and white. As the perfect world crumbles down, you get to see more and more colors.

Since I intend to deliver here nothing short of a rave review of this film that turns that wisdom on its head, let me qualify it up front with a slam or two. These are SPOILERSThe initial concept is a shallow one. A teenage brother and sister, Bud and Mary Sue (Kevin Connors and Reese Witherspoon), fight over possession of the remote control to the family TV. The control flies out of their hands and is smashed. Horrors! - now Bud will miss the 1950s retro show he was looking forward to seeing. This is the cue for a strange (read irritating) TV repairman to knock on the door. The mystic unsolicited repairman (Don Knotts) hands the teenagers a replacement more powerful TV controller and drives away. Our teens squabble again over this controller, a button is pressed and suddenly they find themselves sucked through the TV tube and they become characters in an idealized monochrome 1950s world.Does this much set the scene for anything better than a mediocre look-at-ourselves-in-the-past B-movie? Is it any advance on time-jump yarns like A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court? Does it help that at some point we get it spelled out for us that the TV repairman is God and that 1950s Pleasantville where colours, sex, rain or a basketball failing to pass perfectly through the hoop are all impossible and forbidden is an allegory for the Garden of Eden? Yes, yes and yes, because what we have in this film is brilliant satire about, and rebuttal on humanistic grounds of, the doctrine of Original Sin.Even so, the wonder of this film lies not its concept but its details. Of course the 1950s props, the cars, bobby socks, picket fences, are perfect. If anything, the camera seems to strain too hard to show us a kind of 1950s poster world that our sibling heroes have to find their way in, eventually to shatter it.The movie's gimmick, which it somewhat overworks, is COLOUR. In Pleasantville when Bud and Mary Sue arrive, everyone has been indoctrinated to accept their stereotype lives and routines as normal and unchanging, and there is no colour to be seen. When our pair begin to make a mark on Pleasantville by introducing their 1990s attitudes and knowledge, we see the effect as colours gradually brought into the monochrome life. Most of the film documents this irreversible process. Herein lie the details, some of which work less well than others, but others of which raise the movie to a masterpiece.An over-facile first step to colour is provided by the liberated sister of the pair, who short-circuits the courting ritual that her Pleasantville beau, the captain of the never-defeated basketball team, tries to follow with her. Instead she whisks him to the Pleasantville Lover's Lane, hitherto a place for couples to sit only and hold hands, and guides him into his (the town's ?) first sexual consummation. This brings colour to his face, and sets the code that will be used throughout the movie, that colour = loss of innocence. I felt sorry for the young man's premature rush into manhood, that leaves him in a mixed confusion and pleasure, but I was also sorry for the actors having to deliver corny double entendre lines such as But it's impossible for you to pin me!Fortunately the writers seem to have realized that 1990s sexual liberation of a 1950s society is not an adequate theme alone. There is a parallel theme of artistic expression, but this theme starts slower and hesitantly. The cook at the burger joint gets bored with his job routine; apparently this dissatisfaction with the status quo is the first cloud in paradise brought in by the new teens. Bud shows him a book of classic paintings (the selection shown is quite interesting I noted Michelangelo, Titian, Van Gogh, Picasso...). This triggers more than just an outpouring of colourful painting by the cook (on the diner windows, on a canvas and on the whole side of a building); our new artist also launches into a sexual affair with Betty, the paradoxically virginal mother (in Pleasantville) of Bud and Mary Sue. This development greatly strengthens the film in two ways the liberation (colorization) of Betty (Joan Allen) was, to me, amazingly touching, and the inalienable human right to creativity in all colours provides a far more arguable rebuttal to the die-hard monochrome repressors in the final courtroom confrontation than the admittedly selfish claim to sexual liberation.Betty's awakening is wonderful and touching. There is a funny set-piece scene of role-reversals where the teen Mary Sue has to explain the facts of life to her own mother. When two people love each other very much, then they.... Since the still-grey father George (William H. Macy) is unready to perform in the way that the F.O.L.s dictate, Mary Sue advises her mother, it is implied, to masturbate in her bath. This she does in a little cameo, the camera showing only her head and ankles, that is brilliantly done and must have been more fun to act than Meg Ryan ever had at the diner table in When Harry Met Sally (1989).There is more colour fun in store. Betty has to hide her newfound womanhood i.e. natural coloured face, by applying grey makeup, to avoid being rejected by the grey-only society. This was not only a striking reversal of the usual role of makeup for women, it was also the point in the movie where it hit me that skin-coloured Betty represents all of us who for temporary advantage choose to hide what we really are.There is also a line where a not-yet-reconstructed youth who is rounding up attendees for a town meeting to protest the recent changes sneers at Bud for spending time with a coloured girl. We understand this in the context of the movie where natural skin colour allegedly means lost innocence, but at the same time it reminds us in obsolescent language (i.e. coloured > non-Caucasian) of a wholly different scenario of racial discrimination which we know to be existing somewhere in the inapproachable territory outside all-white Pleasantville. Signs in shop windows that say No Coloureds make sure we get the point.I didn't mention music. It was there, it didn't intrude, and somehow Dave Brubecks's Take Five tried to signal teenage awakening. There was a little bit of Elvis too but that jarred in my ear, a different revolution perhaps. I have no further comment on that.An enjoyable, funny, touching, intelligent movie. This is the way movies should be.

While we can all laugh at the cheesiness of Leave it to Beaver and its 'golly gee whiz' look and feel, I don't feel that such shows deserve the scorn Pleasantville heaps upon them. In fact many shows from that era have a loyal following and continue to appear on rerun channels. Thank goodness the bimbo Mary Sue Parker was able to go to bed with everyone and save Pleasantville from its goody-goody nature. Since no one ever did any hanky-panky in the 50s, it was fascinating to envision what that would have been like. The only redeeming moment for her was her change of attitude, her realization that this kind of life went nowhere.The notion that movies or television have an obligation to address every one of society's ills is as narrow minded as many of the antagonist characters in Pleasantville. While there are lots of good films that do that, many successful films do not. Pleasantville exaggerated the flaws of its characters to the point of being overly unrealistic. The film sure has an awfully arrogant premise. It's as if the film is saying Look how enlightened we '90s people are and how politically and culturally deprived you '50s people are. The people in the 2030's are going to say the same things about the people of today. What else is new?Pleasantville's message is nothing new. To be culturally enlightened you have to read Catcher in the Rye and like nude paintings and sculptures. Only 10 million literature professors have said the same thing.When I saw the trailers about Pleasantville, I thought it was going to be a satirical look at the cheesiness of 1950s entertainment. This is an approach that could have been quite successful. I was looking forward to seeing this instead of being lectured for two hours.

Pleasantville is a film that begins as an innocent comedy and transforms into a moving drama. It asks philosophical questions about a person's beliefs and lifestyle. It is much more than just black and white.On the surface, it is a film about two teenagers who are zapped into Pleasantville, the utopian 50s town where nothing ever goes wrong. The teens introduce the gray citizens to emotion and knowledge. Colors begin appearing, and soon the whole town has changed. But the film also asks its viewers to consider the situation of the town. Do the leaders of a country have the right to control what their citizens think? Should the pursuit of knowledge be allowed? Is freedom of speech so precious? This film will leave the viewer with something more than entertaining fluff. It will leave you with strong images, those of hate, love and hope for the future.

It also suffers slightly from hypocrisy. It suggests that media entertains us with sanitized environments that we then assume are normal and thus we get caught trying aspire to them. However, the film ends with its own happy endings, that were for me, just as contrived as the conclusion of a Brady Bunch episode.As a result, the film ultimately can become as hollow and simplistic as the very media it pretends to deconstruct.None the less, the film is worthy. It is technically marvelous, it has genuine moments in it and the soda shop owner has a fine evolution in the film. In many ways for me, he became the most real character in the whole film.The film also pays heavy homage to other movies. For example, the courtroom smacks of To Kill a Mockingbird; at one point the protagonist proclaims victory in the rain in direct reference to Shawshank Redemption, there are biblical allusions as well and scenes stolen from situation comedies and supplanted into the film with ironic twists.While I enjoy the film and hold it higher than most fare out of Hollywood, ultimately the theme is just too black and white. The convervatives in the film transition into narrow paranoia too quickly and there's never any consequence to the people who choose to liberate themselves. Every choice made to break society's mold makes the characters happy, free and comfortable. Every change in this film is good, every single one.Life doesn't work that way, but this film does. As a result, the notes it tries to hit are just a little too heavy and sharp.Ultimately the film is pleasant, it doesn't challenge you too much, it provides happy endings and lets you know pretty clearly what is bad and what is not, and makes sure the good guys win out.It is a very pleasant film indeed.

When I first started watching this, it seemed pretty good. The beginning was clever and funny, and I was really enjoying it... until the color began showing up. It was at that point the movie lost any sense of humor it might have had, and got increasingly garbled and pretentious.The idea of two teenagers bringing 90's values to a 50's sitcom is a good one, but director Gary Ross exposes his prejudice by making it clear he equates 50's television with 50's culture in general. As if he could be any more out of his league, he doesn't even seem to be familiar with 50's TV in the first place (what on earth is Pleasantville supposed to be a parody of, anyway? Leave it to Beaver wasn't NEARLY this bland).Back to the Future, a fantastic movie with a similar premise, was about a teenager discovering his parents were really not so different than him when he was young. Pleasantville is about two teenagers discovering their parents' generation was hopelessly backward and ignorant, and it is up to them to set things right. How mean-spirited is that!? Setting things right basically involves teaching everyone how to have sex, which didn't exist in the 50's, so by the time the movie ends the town has become a giant group orgy, although thankfully pregnancy still doesn't exist. I could hardly believe this was supposed to be taken seriously. Another user put it very well saying this movie is like Adam and Eve leaving a black and white Garden of Eden, only to go straight to a color heaven (an Islamic fundamentalist heaven, apparently).Skewed values aside, the movie is even more annoying because of its unnecessarily slow pace, and a plot that keeps getting sloppier and sloppier. Of course you're going to get people who say, It's just a metaphor; you can't pay too much attention to detail. Well, even a metaphor has to have some coherency. I'm referring specifically to the ending, where David goes home and Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. Yes, if you haven't seen the movie and you're not sure if you read that correctly, let me say it again Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. What is David going to tell his mom?? Where's Jennifer, honey? Oh, she got sucked into the TV set and decided to live in a sitcom. She probably won't be back. And like that's not weird enough, how exactly did he explain the situation to his Pleasantville mom? Mom, I'm not actually your son. I know you think I am, but I'm really a kid from the 1990's who got stuck in Pleasantville, and I'm going to go home now by traveling through your TV. I think she took it remarkably well.I will say that it's worth watching for the mixture of black and white and color. I can't imagine how long it took them to edit all this. Scenes like hundreds of pink flower petals falling against a gray background are simply amazing. Visually, it's a great movie. If you watch it with the sound turned off and pretend it has no plot, I'd give it a 10/10. Otherwise, it's a 4/10 at best.

The problem is, it is very, very difficult to sustain a satire over an entire movie (although Kubrick did it in Dr. Strangelove); things can get especially confused if you try to make the satire into a morality tale with a pleasant ending, as Director Gary Ross does here. He knows that life is too complex for easy answers, and that seemed to be one of the things he was trying to say, e.g., monogamy is not necessarily superior to, or inferior to, adultery. Ditto for chastity and fornication. Rain for a change is nice.But he got confused somewhere along the way and ended up with a smug, sappy movie with ideas as shallow and black and white as the 50s milieu he was trying to satirize. The feel good ending is beyond redemption, in its way even sappier than the mythical sit-com it tries to improve upon. Yes, it is kind of neat to see things turn from black and white to color accompanied by stirring orchestral strings, especially as a result of something-like socking a bad guy in the jaw-that pleases one's prejudices. But where are the shades of gray? Not all red is fire engine red nor all blue, baby blue.Reese Witherspoon plays a skanky teen (Jennifer) who teaches (as Mary Sue) the Pleasantvillians to fornicate (and her TV mom to masturbate) while she learns that reading is worthwhile. Tobey Maguire plays her brother David/Bud who begins as a nerd, but ends up heroic, attractive to the opposite sex, and wise beyond his years. (Yes, and we live in the best of all possible worlds.) Strange how this movie manages to satirize itself.Joan Allen is grim as the stay-at-home sit-com housewife, and William H. Macy is appropriately bland as her simpleminded husband. Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk/artiste-and her unlikely lover-is tolerable.Through the film meanders a kind of confused extract of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden. In the Bible, eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil forever removed humans from paradise. In Pleasantville, knowledge of anything outside of town or of anything unpleasant has the same effect, while bestowing wondrous color. We even have a very red apple presented to Bud by his TV girl friend Margaret (played with wholesome sexiness by pretty Marley Shelton).What began to wear on me was the easy choice of target. Going after fifties-style prudery and conformity is like shooting fish in a barrel. I should add here that human desire is infinite too much is never enough. So perhaps it is better to start modestly with a soda at the soda fountain holding hands (the 50s style made fun of in the film) instead of immediately coupling below the dashboard with legs in the air (90s spin on same, lauded in the film).Gary Ross, for your next flick, how about taking aim at today's violent, mercenary, duplicitous society? Bring a cannon.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

Being generous, I have to say that I thought it was pleasant, enjoyable and entertaining. What bothered me is that it was also trying to be profound and instead it was just a clich√© of all the false ideas that people have of the 50's. If you were born in the 70's or later or even as early as 65, you probably think the 50's is like what you see in old Ozzy and Harriet shows. It was far from that. WWII had ended in 1945. It was a blood bath. Many people lost their lives. Women and children were left bereft of their husbands, fathers and lovers. The people that came back had a hard time adjusting to civilian life - they were not the same people who left. Crime broke out and marriages broke up, for illicit sex was rampant. It wasn't just that people were horny, they had too much evil going on in their heads that they needed some way to escape it. With Hitler, every American learned the meaning of genocide. With Stalin, our former ally, becoming a greater butcher than Hitler, people wondered if anything had really changed. The terror of the atomic bomb was strong, and the treat of Communist aggression was real and had people building shelters under the ground. What people wanted on TV was normalcy. There was enough fear, terror, death and injustice in life itself. We didn't need to see it on TV. So TV gave us a fantasy world where there were good people who had good clean fun and everything worked out. It actually helped. It gave you something to shoot for, an idea that reality can be better. Pleasentville parodies a life and an America that never existed. It is stereotype that is as bad and, in my humble opinion, as reprehensible as a watermelon eating black man. The idea that there was a black and white world that is suddenly made colorful by sex is simply a heavy-handed and overly simplistic use of symbolism. There was plenty of sex in the 50's. I know, because I was there. It was rampant and good and dirty, with no excuses or apology. People didn't need to see it on TV. Unfortunately, it seems that the modern generation thinks they invented sex, or at least good sex. Trust me they didn't, any more than it was invented in the 50's. I wonder how they think that they got here? There is something comforting in thinking an earlier age was so wrong and we are so right. Dream on. This movie is so popular, so my review will probably be hated. I'm not sure why I wrote it, even. Maybe because not everyone likes heavy-handed, stereotypical productions that pretend to be saying something. They should be warned. The movie tries to parody a overly simplistic world that never existed in an overly simplistic way. In doing so, it is its own self-parody.

It could have been written by Rod Serling while possessed by a Dybbuk. It has touches of A Short Walk and A Stop in Willoughby in it. But Serling, brought up in Binghamton, New York, usually saw the past as something regrettably lost. A kind of cultural childhood, a Golden Age, a period of innocence, rather like Spielberg. What are we to make of the clash of values that Bud and Mary Sue bring back to 1958 with them? Bud is happy enough to be in the black and white world of stability. (Stability? I mean obsessive-compulsive rigidity.) But Mary Sue runs around like a warthog in heat with nothing in her head except whatever impinges on her body sheath. And then there's this colorization gimmick. People change colors as they, well, evolve maybe. The kids' mother has her first orgasm (self induced) and a tree on the lawn bursts into colorful flame. She turns colored. Mary Sue begins to wonder, since she's been rutting with all the young studs in town, why she remains black and white, and Bud suggests that maybe it's not just the sex. Well then what IS it? It's not simply the capacity for change because Bud's already got his dose. At one point Bud tells a townsman that people get colorized because of something human inside them, something trying to get out, and he demonstrates his point by enraging the mayor (great performance by J. T. Walsh). But something has been trying to get out of the local soda fountain manager, Jeff Daniels, for a long time -- the desire to paint modern pictures a la Picasso -- and it finally does, but he remains black and white for a long time afterward. Cars turn color too, although something has been getting out of them fairly often. I'm stumped. Some of the incidents seem no more than arbitrary.The clash of cultures is interesting though. It's easy to make fun of the 1950s from our current perspective and this movie, unlike Twilight Zone, milks it for laughs. Married couples sleep in separate twin beds and never have sex. (They pollinate, I suppose.) Young couples go to Lover's Lane -- to hold hands. The books in the library are all blank because nobody reads or knows anything about life outside of Pleasantville. That last is a cheap shot, and untrue. Mary Sue, of all people, introduces them to reading and studying, and the books magically fill up with text and engravings. And it's a weak argument that claims we read more now than in 1958.Well, the two kids wind up colorizing everything and everybody and practically wrecking the town in the process. It's supposed to be an improvement, but is it? The black and white townsfolk were dumb but happy. Now they get into fights, insult one another, trash art works they don't like. They screw like minks before they're married. One can imagine what this does to the crime rate and the teenage pregnancy rate -- and taxes. (Is this what been trying to get out of them?) Sure, it was oppressive in the 1950s. We can see that now -- all that conformism and complacency. Is it less oppressive now? Perhaps not. Perhaps we don't recognize the strictures we live under because we take them for granted. We may be in the same position as the guy Mark Twain mentioned who suddenly realized he'd been speaking prose all his life. From inside the box, the commonly accepted assumptions, we seem to have a good deal of freedom to do what we want. The good folk of Pleasantville felt the same way -- and this movie treat them as airheads.I want to mention something about the score. It insinuates anachronistically Dave Brubeck's Take Five into one of the scenes, rather prominently. This is followed, again anachronistically, by a piece from an album I revere, Miles Davis's So What. I'm glad that it wasn't drilled into the viewers' ears in 1958 because it's unforgettable. How easily it could have become a stock piece, like R. Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra from 2001 A Space Odyssey, or the last movement from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I can almost hear it now, playing over and over and over on all kinds of TV commercials for shampoo, kitchen cleansers, pimple removers, and condoms. It may be hard to tell but I kind of enjoyed the movie, although it left me as much puzzled as satisfied. Joan Allen's performance is the only one with true depth; Macy is always interesting but his part gives him less to do. The kids are routine, except for the momentous 1950s bosom Reese Witherspoon has to strap on. Jeff Daniels fits his role as a reasonable but timid person very well. The only role in which I can remember his displaying energy was that of Joshua Chamberlain in Gettysburg. Rod Serling didn't always have a perfect answer for his longing for the past either, but I usually felt it was the result of ambivalence on his part, not, as here, confusion.

Unfortunately, this point is driven home again and again in the movie with the subtlety of a pile-driver.  This movie has the same problem as several other movies that are intended to satirize tv and movie unrealities, and yet plays directly into them (e.g. Last Action Hero, The Hard Way).

The boy (Tobey Maguire) learns to express his anger (and turns to color, to show he is now an honest, self-aware, self-actualized person, I suppose) and the slutty girl (Reese Witherspoon) reads one book and suddenly...oooh!

I'm old enough to recall when these shows were actually ON television, and I can assure you that nobody at the time actually believed these were solidly realistic depictions of actual day-to-day life -- they were SITCOMS, for God's sake. They were meant to be amusing and funny. They were also aimed at families with children, and shown early in the evening, which is why they don't deal openly with sex. (Unlike much of modern programming, which is so pandering and graphic -- even early in the day -- that it would have been considered pornography 25 years ago.) If you actually WATCH shows from the 50s like Beaver and Father Knows Best, instead of just clips or what you THINK you remember, these were actually not bad, and not as bland as Pleasantville wishes to remember them. Especially Beaver, which I have seen in recent re-runs, was a well-written family show and the characters were far from being depicted as being perfect (in fact, they often were shown as flawed, and in need of learning life lessons).I find it hard to believe that anyone really takes sitcoms to heart (then or now), and actually believes that they depict a realistic slice of life, and then bases their real-life decisions and activities on this! (If Gary Ross does or did, then he needs a shrink, not a job directing movies.) So when contemporary films reach out to expose the emptiness and lies of old sitcoms, they are basically being cowardly --because the real job of art (whether books, movies, etc.) is to shine a light at YOUR OWN CULTURE AND TIMES and criticize THAT. But to do that would take courage and vision,and that is sadly lacking in our current crop of directors and movie studios.I'd also like to add how very very tired I am of movies that basically exist to show off expertise and set design in terms of CGI (computer graphic imaging). The conceit of Pleasantville is the contrast between B&W and color images, something that was already being done heavily in TV commercials even in the mid-90s. It's a cool effect, but stretched over the length of a film, it quickly becomes a tiresome gimmick. CGI does not substitute for good writing, witty dialog or the clever conclusion to a story.Need I add that the real 1950s (like EVERY time in the existence of the universe) occurred in color? That color movies were very common by 1950? That color photography existed in abundance? That B&W was only used where it was more economical, but that everyone was quite aware of the existence of color film, movies, printing, etc.? Or that everyone everywhere since time began has had sex, and that it was not invented in the 1960s?

The film's basic premise is moot . . . rather like saying an adult is superior to a child.  It's no great accomplishment for one with a fifty year advantage to look back and down upon one's '50s predecessors.  Children are expected to stand on the shoulders of their parents and surpass them in awareness and performance.What becomes a real copout is to support condemnation, ridicule and judgement of our ancestors . . . all the while ignoring the faux pas of our own culture.  Sure, it's much easier to externally blame than it is to take responsibility for our own experience.I failed to buy into the philosophy of Pleasantville, finding it skewed and sour.  It's inference that color is somehow better than black and white, or that the latter is equated with the sterile, closed minded, naive and stark, while the former is beautiful, lifelike, rich and rewarding--is spurious and fallacious.Out with Vaughn Monroe, in with the Stones.  I feel fortunate indeed to discern artistic quality, even from a pop music perspective, and turn away from the raucous, discordant, and grating as being out of harmony with the human soul.  Ditto for the dazzling Disney-type distractions, the surface glitter of high tech commercial packagings, and the myriad of clever but vacuous products being sold to the public today. Let others revel in this foolishness.  I'm going my own way ... in the opposite direction of the ideology of Pleasantville.

It's mostly black and white, but it has specks of color inserted into the image. The colors are textured and tasteful, they remind me of old Technicolor films (which are referenced in this film!) Interestingly, the guy who's behind Pleasantville also brought as Hunger Games, though these movies are hardly comparable.Pleasantville is a charming film which shows us how an utterly conservative, closed universe goes through some major changes. As always, there are those who can't stand change and do everything in their power to stop it -- parallels are drawn to fascism and racial segregation. The force that overcomes the stiff conservatism is, largely, human goodness and art. The film has a lot to do with classic literature and paintings.So it's more than an adventure about teens getting stuck in another dimension, but it's that, too. Pleasantville has good character development, romance and conflict and trouble of all sorts, but it doesn't get too dark. It's got a great sense of humor. While at times it gets almost too clever for it's own good, it still has a light heart and a great emotional impact.

Not strange in it's intriguing plot, but strange in the way the film is set up. It starts off visually ugly and comically overstuffed with predictable and clich√©d fish out of water humor, but by the 40-minute mark, it becomes more serious, and the last hour plus of the film have some really wonderful moments in it, taking an unexpected thematic turn. A magical TV repair man (Don Knotts) places brother and sister David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) into a 1950s sitcom called Pleasantville. The brother and sister are placed into the roles of the son and daughter on the sit-com, complete with their wholesome parents George (William H Macy), and Betty (Joan Allen) Parker. This black and white world soon turns to color as these innocent characters experience newfound passion towards aspects of life they weren't aware of before David and Jennifer arrived. Some members of the town are unhappy at the changes happening and try to stop it.The first act of the film is pure comedy, and by far, the worst part of the film. Whether it's purposeful or not, the color opening before the teens get thrown into the show is just plain ugly. It looks like a She's all That corny comedy, and the lines in these scenes are just as bad. Then we get the fish out of water portion of the film once the siblings arrive in the show, and that is nearly just as bad. Predictable, corny humor everywhere, in addition to almost theatrical overacting. Characters having sex in cars over exaggeratedly, and Reese Witherspoon's horribly written oversexed teenager character mixed together is almost cringe worthy. Then, oddly enough, once the movie settles into dramatic mode, it actually becomes really good. The subject matter becomes more interesting, as thematic connections to race relations in the 1950s show up, and the cinematography is at times really stunning. A scene where David sits with his television girlfriend by a lake in the rain is great looking, and sort of moving in a way. What this last 2/3rds of the movie has, that the first half doesn't is both a point, and a soul. Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), the town soda shop owner, is really a large portion of the heart of the film. He begins to learn about paintings, and color, and begins wondering about what life truly is about, and his character has a completely natural, and unforced progression, with kind of an innocent wide eyed way about him. On the other side, we have Jennifer, who has a corny and stilted progression that doesn't really work, but luckily that's not a huge focus. The movie goes into racism territory, when the newly colored people are treated as second class citizens, by rule of the town council. And the movie goes into completely unpredictable territory, which makes this second half of the film all the more wonderful.The acting is very good, and is only dis-serviced by the script (especially early on). Almost every character is relatable in some way, through their own problems with change and over reliance on nostalgia. Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen are especially good, and work well together in the scenes that feature the two of them. Reese Witherspoon gives as fine a performance as she can, but her dialogue and character arc is pretty lame a lot of the time. She's clearly trying though. The music by Randy Newman is very fitting, and especially fits in during the more dramatic and moving scenes in the picture. The black and white and color mixture is often wonderful to look at, especially in the scenes that are making a point. Director/screenwriter Gary Ross has made a really bad late '90s comedy that turns into a pretty fantastic black and white (comedic) drama about the necessity of change and how people deal with it. After an ugly opening, the film looks great, and once it settles in, it becomes exciting, unpredictable and intelligent. If the first forty or so minutes were better, this would have been thoroughly wonderful. Alas that's not the case.My rating *** out of ****. 124 mins. PG-13 for sexual and thematic elements.

The film feels like it was crafted by someone with year in experience in film-making. Sure he's written stuff before, like the Tom Hank comedy Big, but Pleasantville is something completely different. It's a film that works on so many different layers. It's a beautiful story and craft that work together to give us one of the best film to come out of the 90's.First, the cast is wonderful. The supporting cast is perfect and I thought William H. Macy delivers the hardest performance as the husband who doesn't want his wife to stray from her routine. Joan Allen plays the wife who discovers so many different things, one of them is self pleasure. Jeff Daniels works at a diner, but his true passion is painting.The most notable part of the film is the brilliant use of colour and black & white. If people have never seen this film, but loved the way Sin City was done, check out Pleasantville. It is one hundred times better and actually means something to the story, not just used for artistic flash. Not saying that that is a bad thing. I just think that the use of something as artistic as that that can drive a story is much more interesting that having it in there because it looks 'cool'.Even though it is billed as a comedy, I found it to be much more dramatic and more important that what people give it credit for. I think it has found it's audience now and is being remembered for what it should be instead of that film where they mix colour into black and white bits. This film is much more then that.Yes, this is one of the best films of the 90's and I recommend it with two big thumbs up.

That sounds like a sure setup for some lighthearted comedic fare. But this movie goes in a different direction. Pleasantville has its funny moments but it's certainly not a typical comedy. It turns out to be a rather serious-minded film, a movie with a message. Some may quibble and say the film lays it on a bit thick, beating you over the head with its message. But all in all the film works. It's both enjoyable and thought-provoking and the premise ensures it will be rather unique.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play the central roles of David and Jennifer, twins who have very little in common. Jennifer is concerned only with being popular. Her only goal in life is apparently to date, and sleep with, the resident hunk at the twins' high school. David on the other hand is a little awkward socially. As we meet him his big plans for the weekend consist of watching a marathon showing of reruns of his favorite 1950s sitcom, Pleasantville. To David, not entirely comfortable in the world in which he lives, Pleasantville seems like the ideal, perfect place where everyone is always happy and life is always wonderful. Then a television repairman, played by the always terrific Don Knotts, unexpectedly shows up and gives David a rather unusual looking remote control. One press of a button and David and Jennifer find themselves in Pleasantville. And David will soon see that the residents of this fictional black and white town desperately need some color in their lives. Things in Pleasantville are not as perfect as they seem.David and Jennifer find themselves living as Bud and Mary Sue, the children of the idyllic Parker family upon whom the sitcom centers. Once he comes to grips with the situation David can fall into his role rather easily as he knows absolutely everything about the sitcom, its characters and its world. Jennifer on the other hand is well and truly lost in this black and white world. Her brother insists that she must act as the sweet, innocent Mary Sue Parker would lest she upset the delicate balance of the wholesome Pleasantville world. But Jennifer is determined to bring some 1990s attitude to this 1950s world. And as it turns out that delicate balance in Pleasantville could use a little upsetting. Yes it appears to be an ideal place, everyone seems perfectly happy...but at what cost? They have no free will, no ability to affect their own lives. They go through the same mind-numbing routines day after day and never have any idea what they're missing. There's a great big world out there and perhaps with the influence of their visitors from the future the good folks of Pleasantville will finally have their eyes opened. Maybe for the first time they can really live rather than simply exist.It must be said that the process of bringing change to Pleasantville is a rather slow one. The film does proceed at a rather leisurely pace, seeming to drag at times. And some could have their own interpretations of the film's central message and see it as an attack on traditional values. But that's really not the case at all, it's about personal freedoms. Life is not going to be perfect, you have to take the bad with the good. But enough about the message, the film has so much more to recommend it. Perhaps the most notable feature of the film is the beautiful cinematography and wonderful effects. It may seem now that through computer effects all things are possible but when this film was made it was simply revolutionary. Vibrant color is brought into a black and white world, bit by bit, and the effect is stunning. And the whole story is performed beautifully by a terrific cast. Maguire and Witherspoon are excellent. In playing Bud and Mary Sue's father, a man very content is his predictable black and white life, William H. Macy is reliably brilliant. And Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels do perhaps the best work of all. Allen plays the sitcom mother and Daniels runs a diner and it is the way these two characters react to the changes in their world which gives the film much of its heart. But it is not just the 1950s characters who have changed, our teens from the 1990s evolve as well. It's a very smart, well-crafted story. It's not a perfect movie, there may be a few missteps along the way. But in the end a journey through Pleasantville is an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

What most people don't see, and the country can thank a lack of effective history lessons in schools, is that the entire world in that television show was the United States in the 1950's.Being born in 1983, my first impressions of the 1950's was what I saw on Nick at Nite. The Patty Duke Show, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best and Doobie Gillis made anyone who's parents grew up in that decade think that the 1950's was all white people living in the suburbs, when the children only feared the bully who played football, the teenagers would only be concerned about the football game or just saying hi to the cheerleader, and the mom did nothing but play bridge with the other housewives on the street until 4pm, when she would start making dinner that would be ready just in time for her WWII vet-husband to get home from his decent-salaried job at the financial institution, just so the whole family could eat and spend the rest of the evening watching television shows like The Patty Duke Show, Leave it to Beaver, Father Knows Best or Doobie Gillis. Pleasantville, before David and Jennifer became Bud and Mary-Sue, was inhabited by people like normal Americans of that time, who did not want to know that there was a big, scary world, and only wanted that pristine life.They felt sheltered from, and were almost ignorant of, the Korean War, Joe McCarthy's Red Scare, the quiz show scandals, the beginnings of the civil rights movement, and the Cuban Revolution. To most Americans of that day, they didn't want to know any of those problems, so, they just didn't know of those problems. This is just like the people of Pleasantville, who didn't know of any problems like fire, color, rock music, art, books, and even sex. It wasn't until David's and Jennifer's Bud and Mary-Sue from the 1990's that anyone knew of any of those problems existed. The actions and reactions inside Pleasantville mirrored the actions and reactions of the 1950's America.What's tragic about the movie is that the end result wasn't a full mirror. In the movie, all ended well, things were fine. In real life, the world went from care-free to the 1960's, where things weren't fine.

You all know them and have your own list. I heard this of this film and read a review and thought it looked like fun. Just watched it last night and I was totally delighted. First of all, it is my own personal rule that any film that has a soundtrack by master Randy Newman is already a hit in my house. Newman's soundtrack, it has been argued, are the laces and connectors that hold this film together. While it is true to say this, it can be misconstrued as a weakness of the film; to say, for example that the film would have suffered without Newman's always deft touch is misleading - it has enough depth and strength to stand on it's own. Of course these type of movies work well with lots of music and while not all is Newman's, when his work is called for, he brings all his talents into view. In this film, as in so many other films, he is firing on all cylinders. Think of his great soundtrack work Awakenings (a personal favorite), Toy Story, Ragtime, and so many others. Sometimes a great soundtrack is non-obtrusive, like a soft background glow that we sense quite subconsciously. Other times it's really in your face and that sometimes works. This film has all kinds of period piece music which most viewers will know. Newman's additions finish and complete all the musical color you could ask for. The actors as many reviewers have stated are all superb, with Joan Allen a particularly strong presence. What lends this film to that feel good place in our hearts is the obvious charm of the fable. Only a mind made of stone would not see the parables, the metaphors and moralizing. The script is written to be open and yet with enough complication to make us stick around to see how it all winds up. While it is easy to say that it's a film about how love conquers all, it is more. This film also functions as a mirror and several times in the film a mirror is used to reveal the changes in the coloration of the person. The motif is fitting and again if you're not too dim you can see that the mirror is held up for all of us to look into. This is not a deep film nor is it philosophy for dummies. In the best tradition of classical Greek comedy, we locate our identifications with ease and recognize our own shortcomings. Rarely does a movie present this concept without falling into a morass of preaching and sermonizing. With everyone in the mythical town devoted to making things in life nice, it alone keeps the center, as it expands into awareness and discovery from exploding into chaos and anarchy. If in our own child like state we realize how black and white our own minds are, the alternative (as we gain color and gravitas, as we loose our innocence) to....Fighting in the streets as an outlet....is this movie. (The one overtly violent moment when the men rioted after seeing the naked painting is subsequently handled with calmness. The coloreds are encouraged to just clean up; retaliation is not an option they have grasped and it is wisely not introduced by David or Jennifer. How fitting it was to hear the fabulous John Lennon tune Across the Universe close the film. While he wrote that ...nothing's gonna change my world...we know that this was not true of his life or his philosophy. Lennon strove his whole life to change, to evolve and to shake others up. Maybe the director is saying the same of anyone who claims that nothing is going to change them. It is not possible to be alive and not be affected by change. This film is not a panegyric to revolution; it is the softer awakening of self awareness that can, if people choose, to move with love. This is a really terrific film and everyone shines. Superb.

There was no action, there wasn't any particularly great acting, but there was definitely something appealing about the movie.Well after giving some thought, I realized that it was good because watching Pleasantville go from black & white to color was like watching a child come of age. The movie began with two teenagers from the late '90s being warped into a television town from the '50s known as Pleasantville. The town is just like the name indicates, it is pleasant. The town, and everyone in it, is black and white, everyone is always chipper, and the high school basketball team never loses.Eventually, things start to become colorized, and the town starts to go in an uproar. As characters in the town began to find feelings of passion, lust, anger, desire, and other feelings that lead to immoral behavior, they turned from black & white to color.Pleasantville was a town that just about everyone would love to live in but nobody does. Pleasantville was more than just a perfect town, it was a perfect existence. There was no crime, poverty, or problems. Everyone was happy, polite, and swell. Even though we would all like to live there, we don't want to see it on television. People like to watch programs that are closer to real life, where there are issues, problems, and bad habits; and where the emotions have a wider spectrum than just 'swell' or 'sore'. Now, we are not sadistic, in that we just want to see others suffer, but on the contrary, we want to see those issues, problems, and bad habits overcome. Pleasantville offered none of that until David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) showed up.As the town experienced new and foreign feelings, they also gained color one by one. As each person became hued, the basketball team started losing, the mens' dinners weren't ready, and controversial books got words. It was interesting to see the transformation of the small Leave it to Beaver town if for no other reason than the town became more normal. "},{"Title":"Who are you haters?

Not since The Breakfast Club has such an impressive cast of relative unknowns with great futures and veterans been assembled.CINEMATOGRAPHY Brilliant and deserving of its many awards. You FEEL like you're smack in the middle of a 1950s sitcom, in a way that goes beyond any specific set design.WRITING The writers seemed inspired by many sources, including Rod Serling (Twilight Zone), Gary Larson (Far Side comic strip), and the movies Back to the Future and Last Action Hero for time-travel and injection of real people into the fiction they love. This movie surpasses each of these insprirations in their areas of strength.PLOT The plot is the most open to interpretation, as many read their views of the 1950s into it. The metaphors are deliberately obvious, as the movie touches on issues of civil rights and the general conformism of the era, but the bullseye in its sights seems to be the Hayes Commission, the Hollywood industry group which set the standards for fiction during that time. This film SCREAMS Hayes in its presentation of Pleasantville, a town where the weather is always good, everyone is happy and productive (and Lily white), the music is elevator and not disliked enough by anyone to be banned, and life is predictable.Thanks to Don Knotts' repairman character, the boring David and the slutty Jennifer (who seems to have an unwritten, unspoken crush on the boring David that is hinted at just enough to avoid controversy) are transported into the world of Pleasantville, a soap opera set in middle America in 1958. The time travel is a necessary plot device over which neither the movie nor the characters obsess over, beyond David wanting the remote back from Knotts so he can get back to the present. Since they are in fiction, the space-time continuum is not in constant peril as it was in Back to the Future, and this enables the characters to mess with the past in ways that movie could not.One plot device central to the movie involves the characters changing from black and white into color as they evolve spiritually. For some, sex accomplishes this, but not for others like Mary Sue, because sex was nothing new for her (or for a surprisingly large number of Pleasantville residents). This device enables the film to address the serious issues of racism and civil rights in the context of people not liking what is different. In one scene suggesting gang rape, Betty is surrounded by young thugs because of the color not of her skin, but her dress, but the behavior is identical to that dark side of racism and rape. The courtroom scenes were designed to reflect the many legal battles endured during that era.Despite the political overtones, the movie focuses more on individuals than society. Society will do what it will do, but each resident of Pleasantville reacts to coloreds and their own coloring, in their own way. They realize that a lot of the world has been hidden from them, and become either scared or obsessively curious about what lurks behind the world's curtain. No one is BAD in Pleasantville, but uber-conformism has suppressed everyone's true nature, leaving them as black-and-white shells of their colorful selves, and it is up to all of the characters, including David and Jennifer, to push their own boundaries in order to become whole and spiritually fulfilled.Whether or not you agree with the message or the film, it was an incredible achievement for any filmmaker to be able to blend so many complexities into a single film without boring the viewer or going all over the map.Let's not forget the microcosmic, triple-entendred line from the repairman, commenting on the colored Bud accepting cookies from Whitey's girlfriend Those are WHITEY's COOKIES, Bud! They belong to him! Easily the best picture of 1998.

Not even halfway through a first viewing though, you will feel compelled to rewind (metaphorically in DVD world) and rewatch the film from the beginning, lest you missed something important.Black and white TV sitcoms stand as a symbol of America's recent, modern past. They represent the last age of innocence, just prior to the assassination of President Kennedy, which history books will one day regard as the seminal event that set into motion a new age of disenchantment. Yet, under that veneer of innocence seethed a pervasive atmosphere of racial and religious hatred, political fear, intimidation and the lingering grip of fascism. The veneer was there just to help people escape.Pleasantville revisits that nice world and uncovers it's ignorance and didacticism. That's not so nice. The process never is. But it also uncovers that world's beauty and restores its peoples faith and sense of self determination, as well as their pigment. The film so adroitly handles the issues of racism that one commenter here thought that the issue was entirely missed, merely because a black person was not included. The point missed is that our traditional concepts of what it means to be colored, physically and by happenstance of birth, are not necessarily valid. Merely being the they in a we/they relationship is sufficient to feel the oppression.The change of each character from monochrome to color occurs when the individual grows, accepts knowledge and becomes self-aware. In this marvelous allegory, to be colored is to be whole.

I don't want to reveal how they change because that would spoil the movie. My problem with the film is that the second half seems to lose its way and to not know what it's about. As a result, it tends to drag. The cinematography is clever and Pleasantville is charming. Reminiscent of Back to the Future, in a way, but more serious. The story idea is clever full of potential but the script gets muddled, probably because there are so many characters there is just not enough time to develop their stories properly. Still, Pleasantville is definitely worth seeing.

There have also been films that see outsiders coming into a society; and Edward Scissorhands stands out here, both for the reason mentioned and for it's surreal atmosphere - but there's nothing else QUITE like this film, and aside from presenting some very nice visuals; there's also a good message here, and Gary Ross' film works on a number of levels. The main theme on display is the way that society has undergone massive changes. We follow a typical pair of teenage siblings in the 'real' world, who find themselves in the idyllic TV show 'Pleasantville' after a run in with a strange TV repair man. The morals in their new world are a bit different to their own, and it's not long before the pleasant little town, that is filled with pleasant little people, is starting to discover a whole range of new ideas from their new inhabitants; and most strikingly, they're bringing colour into the black and white world.While I enjoyed this film very much, it's not without its problems. There's so much that can be done with a plot like this, and even with a running time of two hours; not everything can be fit into it. Things such as the relationship between the kids and their parents are hardly realised at all, and the film spends more time on changing ideals, than allowing us to see the difference between then and now. The entire plot is also very pretentious, and really quite closed minded; but it's delivered with genuine emotional and, while watching, it's hard not to be entranced by it. The film benefits from the pairing of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. Neither of these has ever particularly impressed me, but they're very good here. Despite being young, both actors have a sort of old-school look about them, which blends well with this setting. The idea of having black and white and colour, in a film together was met with a lot of praise upon the release of the recent 'Sin City', but this film did it seven years earlier, and the colour scheme allows the director to come up with some very picturesque scenes. On the whole, this is perhaps not as great as it could have been; but Pleasantville is still an excellent surreal drama, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

When the drug store owner painted a naked lady on his drugstore window he overstepped common social values. Liberals have always been looked at as using freedom to impose sexual content on the public, or they're are looked at as being just perverted in someway. Nothing is wrong with sex or nudity, but it shouldn't be displayed openly in public. Pleasantville misses this point. If the drugstore owner hadn't of painted the naked lady on the front of his store, it would have made a stronger point of how conservative, reactionary values are always trying to inhibit life and freedom.

While the element of parody is still there, I found this movie to provide much more.This movie follows the story of David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) as they get sucked into the show Pleasantville (which is named after the town the show takes place in). The two are forced to take on the roles of Bud and Mary Sue Parker. David, a massive fan of the show, struggles to maintain the status quo of the nostalgic land that he loves so much. Jennifer, on the other hand, is out to be her own woman, never minding the ramifications that this may have on her new environment. Along the way, the two find themselves pushing against the rigid social homogeneity and the psychological repression that is unmistakeably characteristic of this TV genre. With each push, the town's citizens and the town, itself, find themselves in ambivalence of the newfound color that the two have brought.The use of color is an obvious technical marvel for this film. The contrast of colored environments and characters with their black and white counterparts is amazing, and it's easy to see why this movie earned so many technical accolades. In addition to the technical aspects, the cast is wonderfully assembled. Both Maguire and Witherspoon give some of the best performances of their career. Joan Allen, Willam H. Macy, and Jeff Daniels adeptly play the 50's character stereotype yet also give a smooth transition for their characters' evolution towards their more enlightened colored selves. Some of the imagery used is both hilarious and insightful, combining some biblical themes with a slightly more modern context.I've re-watched this film several times on DVD, and I never get tired of it. I only wish I could get my hands on the amazing mural used towards the end of the film.

I think a lot of the impression of the film was that it seemed to be a little bit dull, plus the film's main focus is about sex and corruption. The film is about a teenage boy, who is a bit old-fashioned, and his sister. The two get transported back into the 1950s on the set of the show where everything is wonderful and a utopia until they come along. The problems start with the boy's sister, who introduces the old-fashioned and laid back people to sex and fun, which ultimately leads to affairs and prejudice.

In Pleasantville, everything is black and white, a disturbing setting of seeming perfection with the notion of non-whites absent from the setting. Pleasantville is a haven of the myth of all-white, suburban post-war neighborhoods reflected in colonial 2 story houses with gleaming white picket fences but surrounded with gray roses. Bud's TV parents (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) live without problems, concern, need, and sex. The Pleasantville high school basketball team always makes every basket, they always win even without a Kobe or MJ, and the girl's poodle skirt sweater sets and flip hairdos are the convention for every giggling teenage virgin. Enter Reese Witherspoon in 1950 torpedo bra and saddle shoes, headed for lover's lane she initiates the basketball captain (Paul Walker) with flaming colorful results.The perfection of an unchanging society and existence is not Camelot however. Nothing is amiss for Pleasantville until color begins to seep into their reality. Color becomes a means of deviance and normality with implications that arose with the changing social conventions of modern art, abstraction, and the contentions that were brought to the forefront by the Amory Show in the United States in 1913. Through color, the world is enriched and forever changed. Eve's apple is red, so are her lips, and it is obvious to everyone that a new awareness has come into their everyday existence. Color denotes emotion, sexuality, and change for Pleasantville's population.The nostalgia surrounding Bud's perfect t.v. world begins to crumble as color blooms. Perceived with trepidation and reluctance by townsfolk, the growing awareness of difference and changes expressed with the subtle insertion of color becomes a tool the film maker injects. Its first emergence is beautiful but as the color theme spreads becomes a tool for a McCarthy like prejudice and witch hunt. As residents slowly come to see in-color, the difference between the status quo and those colored individuals divides and sorts out who is and is not appropriate in the disintegrating paradise. Happiness is ignorance according to the demonic TV repairman, but the citizens of Pleasantville are further torn by their inability to stop the rapidly unavoidable changes.This is subtle storytelling done with the cinematographer's eye toward how powerful the change created by uses of color to connote difference. With sexual, social, and cultural implications towards difference vividly presented, expectations for thought and acceptance is immediate. Questionable characters and behavior is not an overt message in Pleasantville. As the society breaks down and becomes more McCarthy-like through gang witch hunts and public denunciations against difference, the neighbors turn, suspect, and torment. Ultimately the perfect society is on the verge of fascism as government tries to impose conformist rules a la Nazi restrictions against Jewish communities of WW-II, later the 1950s HUAC hearings, and the 1960s anti-Vietnam activities. Prejudice is perhaps a too simplistic notion in Pleasantville, but the story is told in an altogether solid and entertaining message that deserves attention and is more than time well spent.

It portrays real-life teenagers David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) getting transferred into a 1950's Leave It to Beaver-style TV show. Aside from the fact that everything is black-and-white, David and Jennifer (now called Bud and Mary Sue in the show) have a hard time adjusting to a world of wives wearing fluffy dresses all day and gray flannel suit-clad husbands saying Honey, I'm home! But David and Jennifer's presence just might change everything.All that I can say is that it would sure be neat to experience this movie. More than just a goofy story, there's a clear reference to racism as colors start showing and everything starts changing. And the way that they use the song Take Five is also quite eye-opening. Great performances from the aforementioned cast members, plus Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Jeff Daniels, J.T.

In a world so concerned with self image preservation of youth, people have began to miss out on what is beautiful in life. This movie truly shows what to do and how to change your bad habits. In the beginning of the film, Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are brother and sister. Magurie is the geeky know it all of the classic television show Pleasntville and his sister Witherspoon is the sometimes slutty and always self absorbed teen. Due to the remote control breaking and the coincidence of have a TV repairman right at the door, the new remote isn't an ordinary remote. The two are transported into the television, specifically Pleasntville. The two are changed into character, the two children, Bud and Mary Sue, of the Parker family. Now they must find out how to contact the repairman who is distraught over their anger with their new position. The only way to go on living is as the beloved characters of Pleasantville. Now the real fun starts. They begin to show the town what living really is. Jenny (Witherspoon) shows the town sex and David (Maguire) introduces the world of literature and art to the townspeople. With this new way of life, the black and white world of Pleasantville is beginning to turn into color. The local burger joint is run by Bill Johnson played wonderfully by Jeff Daniels. He brings to life a sort of insecurity to what would be a normal situation like making burgers. Daniels is perfect for the role. Other notables are William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Paul Walker, and J.T.

On how peoples influence change they way others think and act, and how if you agree with the fact that everyone wants to be just like celebrities and if we continue this way than there is no individuality? I believe that the movie dealt with the black and white people not wanting any change in their lives. They were closed to new things and new ideas. On the other hand the colored people felt free and felt as if they were new people and were happier for the change.This film hit on some very important basis, such as racism and segregation. For example in the courtroom the colored people were separate from the black and white people, just like back in the civil rights era in the movie theaters the blacks sat on the top part of the theater and whites sat on the bottom. Also the no colored signs in the store windows. I personally believe that this movie relates to todays pop culture by everyone trying to be something their not. Everyone needs to be their own individual. With out individuality there is no diversity, no change, and no character. If we were all the same we would be like robots, talking, moving, and acting the exact same way. Just like Anthem by Ayn Rand. Without change there are no new discoveries in the world. Without change the world is just a close- minded monotonous place to live.

"},{"Title":"Thought-Provoking Film, Handicapped by the Weight of its Symbolism","Date":"3 November 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Contains SpoilersColour, and the absence of colour, provides the English language with a number of metaphors. To say that a person is 'colourless' or that a thing is 'grey' or 'monochrome' is to imply that that person or thing is boring. The adjective 'colourful', by contrast, when used figuratively, implies that something is interesting. To see something in 'black and white' terms is to make a simplistic judgment about it. 'Coloured' is an adjective sometimes used of black people or others of non-European descent. (Or at least it was so used; in Britain it has largely fallen into disuse). 'Pleasantville' is a film that plays upon these various linguistic usages. 'Pleasantville' is the name of a 1950s television comedy set in a fictitious town of the same name. The town is supposed to be the epitome of the idyllic American small town- an easygoing place where everyone is polite and pleasant to one another and where misfortune and unhappiness are unknown. At the centre of the film are two 1990s teenagers. David and Jennifer are brother and sister with contrasting characters. David is a geeky loner who takes refuge from his worries about the state of the world in the escapist entertainment provided by re-runs of the 'Pleasantville' series on television. Jennifer is the sort of dumb blonde who is less likely to worry about the state of the world than the state of her makeup; her preoccupations are her boyfriends, her popularity with the other girls at her school, and cultivating the art of bitchy sarcasm, with her brother as her main target. The central concept of the film is that David and Jennifer find themselves trapped in the fictional world of Pleasantville, courtesy of a magical TV remote control device supplied by an eccentric elderly TV repairman with strange powers. This world is a very strange one, where anything not mentioned in the TV series does not exist. The series was broadcast in black-and-white, so that is how the world appears. The series is entirely shot in the town itself, so the people know nothing of the outside world; indeed, they do not even believe that there is an outside world. Certain topics were taboo in 1950s television, so the citizens of Pleasantville are ignorant of sex, and there are no lavatories. Nobody is ever seen reading, so the books in the town library all have blank pages. The weather is always sunny, and rainfall is unknown. As nothing bad can ever happen, nothing ever catches fire, so the fire brigade's sole task is to rescue cats from trees. (Something similar occurs in the British children's TV series 'Trumpton', which also features a fire brigade which does everything but put out fires).The arrival of David and Jennifer, however, provokes a number of changes in the town. David tries, at first, to fit into his role, but Jennifer rebels against the town's conformist ethos and seduces her boyfriend, providing Pleasantville with its first recorded sexual encounter. Printed books start to appear in the library. The high school basketball team loses a match for the first time in its history. (One thing that is never explained is where the opposing teams come from if there is no world outside Pleasantville). Rain starts to fall, and a tree bursts into flames. People begin to rebel against conformity and act in hitherto unprecedented ways. Most significant of all, colour begins to appear in this formerly monochrome world. At first only small objects, such as a red rose or pink bubble gum, appear in colour, but soon this spreads to larger things such as a car, and even to people. These changes, however, lead to discontent as the more conservative citizens see them as a threat to the town's values and fight back against the 'coloureds'. Before long, a riot breaks out. The film reminded me of another film from1998, Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show', which had at its heart an inverted version of the same idea. In 'Pleasantville' characters from the real world find themselves transported to a fictional one; in 'The Truman Show' the central character finds out that the world in which he had been living, and which he believed to be real, is actually a fictional one created for the entertainment of others. Of the two films, however, I preferred 'The Truman Show'; although 'Pleasantville' has its good points, it tends to be handicapped by the weight of its own symbolism. The colour/black and white distinction is given two separate symbolic meanings. The main symbolism is 'monochrome = conformist; colour = free-thinking'. Those characters who break away from established habits of thought and action are, generally speaking, the first to appear in colour, while more conservative ones remain in black and white. (I am here using the word 'conservative' in the sense of 'conformist' rather than 'politically right wing'). This theme- the need to be oneself rather than being bound by convention or acting in a conformist way- is well handled, but the treatment of the film's racial and political themes is less assured. The scenes of the riot, in which a group of 'monochrome' youths attack the 'coloureds', seemed to me to be particularly heavy-handed. The breaking of windows, and even more the burning of the books that have recently started to appear in the library, were obvious references to the excesses of the Nazis. Nazi imagery is something that should be used with caution, and its use here gives the impression that Gary Ross is equating the conservatism of small-town America with Nazi ideology. If this impression is deliberate, it is offensive hyperbole; if it is inadvertent, it is an example of clumsy film-making. Although the population of Pleasantville is shown in monochrome it is, in racial terms, exclusively white, but there is nonetheless an attempt to make the film a parable about racism. With an obvious pun on the two meanings of the word 'coloured', monochrome is used to signify 'Caucasian' and colour 'non-Caucasian'. To strengthen this interpretation, there are signs reading 'no coloreds', and references to a monochrome character having a 'colored girlfriend'. Unfortunately, this usage conflicts with the film's other symbolic use of colour. By the end of the film, all the citizens of Pleasantville have changed from black and white to colour, and there are references to 'colouredness' being something that is within us all. Colour is on the one hand used as an emblem of our shared humanity, and on the other as a symbol of racial division, a contradiction that was never really resolved. There were also attempts at religious symbolism (a scene where a character eats a red apple is an obvious reference to the Garden of Eden story), but these are never really developed. Despite my criticisms, my overall impression of the film was a favourable one. It has a visual inventiveness reminiscent of the work of Tim Burton, especially in the scenes which mixed colour and monochrome effects. A scene where pink blossoms fall from grey trees was particularly striking. (The coloured scenes in Pleasantville, although not those showing David and Jennifer in the real world, are shot in not-quite-accurate colour, reminiscent of certain fifties films, which gives them an otherworldly charm).There were a number of good performances, notably from Jeff Daniels as Mr Johnson, the timid soda-store owner who becomes a daring artistic radical, from Joan Allen as the repressed mother and from JT Walsh as the town's authoritarian mayor. An interesting and thought-provoking film. 7/10 "}{"Title":"Nostalgic Sci-Fi Gem.

She told her that her grandmother had always done it that way.  The little girl asked her grandmother who was there for dinner why she always cut a big hunk of ham off before cooking it. The grandmother pursed her lips and thought for a moment.  She called her mother who was 97 and in a nursing home.  She asked the same question of her mother.  Her mother replied, `Well.  We never had a pan big enough to fit the whole ham onto, so we cut off a hunk so it would fit.'This movie asks the question, `Do we do something a certain way without question just because others have always done it that way?'  Is change always good?  This fine ensemble cast have raised acting to a new level. They are true to their characters and evolve in a believable manner. Thrown into the mix are themes of racism, the fall of innocence, and risk-taking at its highest form.  The monochromatic/chromatic characters are shown in a new and fresh approach.

Worse, this new world has none of the 'real' (i.e. unpleasant) things they take from granted - no such thing as fire, sex, bodily functions or changes from routine.Quickly the teenagers exert their influence and their knowledge of what is 'outside Pleasantville' to slowly change things and bring some colour to this literally black and white world.  Of particular note amongst the performers are Joan Allen, as the repressed mother, William H Macy as the bewildered father, and Jeff Daniels, as the art loving guy in the burger joint.  JT Walsh is in there too, in one of his last films, and gets one of the funniest lines in the movie Thank goodness we're in a bowling alley.What really impresses about Pleasantville is the way it uses Randy Newman's wonderful music and the impressive visual effects to paint a picture of a changing world, a new world which is developing and learning to live, in a way which is ultimately very moving.

(For what it's worth I don't think we are a whole lot different than our 50s counterparts, we are just more apt to show our ugly side today via a lack of decorum or simple pride--think Jerry Springer).  So the idea to enter this antiseptic world with real people with modern values was a good one (though not orignal of course).Though this film has numerous flaws (the inconsistency of color-changing, the ever-preaching main-character, the overwrought, forced ending, the silly fact that they were transported into the sitcom world via a TV remote--just to name a few) its overall merit still makes it an important, thought-provoking work.

What better comparison than the utopian view of society in the 50s versus the problem-plagued issues of today?  But as I watched, I couldn't help but feel that there was so much more the makers could have done to explore the world of Pleasantville and contrast it with David's and Jennifer's view of life.  So much untapped potential.  It was cute how there were no toilets and how the bball team couldn't miss; I think the movie could have delved a little deeper into other Pville quirks.Plus, I KNEW I shouldn't have let my mind wander, but I did... I began to see more and more holes and unexplained, fuzzy elements.  So is whether or not someone gains color more dependent on the person himself or the beholders of that person?  The movie would suggest  the subject himself, but then again, how do inanimate objects then gain color?  If these citizens were so incapable of doing anything outside of the norm or outside of the script, then how could they function at any level once David and Jennifer began to affect Pville?  For example, how could they conduct a court trial if nothing had ever gone wrong before in Pleasantville?  Wouldn't the entire town plummet into chaos very soon?  All these questions detracted from the movie for me.  I know I shouldn't have been so critical at a fantasy movie, but then again, the whole movie is about asking questions, right?In the end, Pleasantville is just another movie about challenging norms.  A hero(s) enters a new environment, starts to make some noise, opens peoples' eyes, causes a repressive counterstrike by the ruling conservatives, but then ultimately triumphs.  Hey, that's exactly what happened in Footloose!  Throw in some odd, out-of-place, almost inappropriate references to racism and you've got your typical what makes America movie.But this does touch on an aspect that DOES set this movie apart; because they do not state exactly where Pleasantville is located, the entire story happens in a political vacuum.  Is it in America at least?  Presumably, but then again, the residents of Pleasantville seem to be unaware of ANYTHING outside of town.  This has an odd effect on many of the themes in the movie.  For example, the whole issue of the paintings and the rock music are no longer issues of freedom of speech, since there is no Bill of Rights in this town.  In a way, the issues are more basic and fundamental than typical what america is all about movies.  So all in all, I was a little disappointed, but I still give it a 6/10.

The story is very much about change and the things that happen around us all the time and learning to cope and deal with those changes.  The film takes a very odd and interesting route to convey that message.All the actors did a fantastic job, Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen, Marley Shelton, J.T.

I was fairly certain it would be simply an anti-suburbia, anti-housewife, anti-fifties liberal comedy. None of which I generally enjoy. Frankly, I expected to turn it off within fifteen minutes. Obviously, I didn't.  For one thing, Tobey Maguire was, as previously mentioned, is an Actor.  (That can't be taken for granted in today's movies, unfortunately.)  Also, my mother asked a very relevant question during the five minutes she watched Why do the characters turn into color from black and white?  I said it happened when they changed.  But I don't think that summed it up.  Many of the reviewers mention sex, liberation, and open-mindedness as reasons for the change.  Before I saw the movie, I would have agreed.  I've decided, though, that the difference is in depth. Depth of character, life, emotions -- these were what was lacking in Pleasantville.  These were what was lacking in Mary-Sue/Jennifer and Bud/David.  It was realizing the innate depth of character of Real People, renouncing former shallowness as incomplete life, that made the characters more complete (ie. colored).  How I wish there was a way for real teenagers to discover this as easily!Not a perfect movie, though.  I could really have done without all the sex stuff (along with the lack of morals encouraged by the kids).  The ending was admittedly weak, but not enough to ruin the film, in my opinion.  I especially liked the growth of Bud's character from the standard, shallow-but-pretends-to-be-deep social reject into someone who had a reason for his life.  I thought this was aptly demonstrated in the final scenes, particularly in his choosing to go home.Perhaps this is a film best rented, though not bought.

This seems like territory that would make for great satire, and in the hands of the Farrelly brothers it could have been a great send up of 'white-bread' mores.  Instead it only slightly works as an allegory against bigotry and intolerance.  This is a well-crafted movie. The performances are first rate as are the visual effects.However, it misfires in it's own logic.  If thinking outside of the banality of life in Pleasantville gives color to ones life, why don't the folks who riot and vandalize Bill Johnson's (Jeff Daniels) diner become colorful.  Near the end anger turns Big Bob (J.T. Walsh) into a 'colored'. At the end everything and everyone is in color.  It seems 'unreal' that there wouldn't be at least one person who wouldn't hold on to the ideas/ideals that made Pleasantville, Pleasantville.It's dumb that the diner would have a jukebox that no one has ever used.  How did Buddy Holly get there?  Someone had to put him there, the David & Jennifer didn't bring him with them.  Heck, even Ozzie and Harriet had rock n' roll.And why destroy a marriage.  George (William H. Macy) becomes colorful feeling and expressing the love he feels for his wife Betty (Joan Allen). The very last scene has George and Betty sitting on a bus stop laughing because they don't know what awaits them in this new life.  There's a pan from George to Betty and back.  George has been replaced by Bill, roll credits.I could nit pick more but the real jump in logic is that these pleasant characters in this sitcom would behave in any manner other than pleasant no matter what happened.  These kids from the 'real' world could have had everyone wrapped around their fingers.  It would have been funny for mom to say `Bud, you robbed another bank.

Bigotry, small mindedness, routine bound, denials of emotion, and mostly ignorance are attacked in this film.  The only advocasy is that ideas are not something to be frightened of.We can try to be emotionally safe, but what do we gain and what joy is to be had from this sort of conservatism.  Often, what seems the safest is the most detrimental to us all.When most everyone changed, Mary Sue and Bud turned to each other and asked, why are we still black and white?  Bud had to find his dignity and Mary Sue, her intellectual capacity.  And this begs the question, what is inside us that we need to tap.  Is it a sense of beauty, like the soda shop owner? The revelation when he saw the works of Rembrandt, Monet, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Picasso and Turner.  Most of these artists were scorned during their lifetime by the establishment of art.New ideas are difficult to accept.  That's not to say that all things new are good, but change is inevitable nonetheless, and so with technology. The world of Pleasantville suddenly grew where buses took people off to college, as opposed to a circular street.There are several epochs in human history where change was resisted, but ideas are hard to thwart, and that process of trying to hold back that change sometimes is ugly.  This is seen in the Code of Conduct, but you know this could have been during the sixties when schools measured girl's skirt and boy's hair length.  Why for?This movie offers a great deal to think about.   Read a book, see painting. Get out of your routine lives and LIVE.

However, much like in Time Machine, their prescence upsets the delicate balance of nature and starts a snowball which no-one can stop. Lots of clever use of digital effects enable us to see both colour and black and white images on screen which is used extensively to portray the changes in this otherwise very homogenous and stable environment. Gary Ross uses this situation to talk about the role of society, rules, values, personal freedom and also looks at what would happen if we actually had the perfect idealised world we think we remember...It's beautifully shot and visually demanding with a huge amount of effort going into many of the shots to help tell the story. Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire take the leads and are both great but special mention must go to Joan Allen, who plays their Mom and is mesmorising throughout.

They both lived in a regular house, alone with their Mother and they didn't get along at all. After a fight over the remote control, they both end up magically falling into a black and white T.V. program called Pleasantville.

While David(now called Bud) and his sister Jennifer(now called Mary Sue) try to fit into this abnormal setting, they realize that the town is not really...well real!

I was quite surprised to see young Tobey Maguire play such a role. I haven't seen him in anything else-but am looking forward to it in the future. He portrayed the young, innocent boy Bud very well. His partner Reese Witherspoon who played Mary Jane was a match that I have to give Ellen Lewis and Debra Zane, the casting crew a thumbs up for. Together, Tobey and Witherspoon made the perfect match to show what a good kid can do compared to the bad one!The movie was absolutly perfect. It told a very important lesson that some people forget because it is not seen as clearly anymore. It showed how one family can stick together and fix anything if they work together.

'Pleasantville' is a lot like an actual teenager- bright, amusing, rebellious and possessed of a fierce and passionate sense of personal freedom. This is not a subtle film, but it has a lovely, misunderstood message, cool Crayola effects and nice performances. The point here is not strictly that the 90s and color are better than the 50s and black and white. The point is that black and white can still exist in a world of color, but color can not exist in a world of black and white. The point is not that the 50s were evil, but that the backwards-thinking idealization of that time brings with it the cultural sterilization that flourished then. The 50s were the 50s and they were as they were supposed to be- there's nothing particularly wrong with that. People have responded strongly to this film because the 50s are falsely seen as some sort of promised time for America and there are those who find that image appealing. That was a time when these people think that their morals ruled supreme, and Manon forbid that their morals be attacked as they attack ours. It also takes people of the 90s to task a bit- as Jeff Daniels' soda jerk notes, we don't even realize how lucky we are. 'Pleasantville' is not saying, as has been alleged, that sex equals free expression. The basketball team captain doesn't spring to color after Jennifer deflowers him. He stays in black and white and tries to make her burn her book. Sex is one of many tools used by this bright, passionate movie to metaphor- and *embrace*- the Fall. Sex doesn't make one 'colorful'. Self-awareness and free-thinking do. The idea is that self-awareness and freedom of thought are good things. That's it. Of course, the human being is not a perfect animal, and with self-awareness and freedom of thought come a higher saturation of some things that are problematic- witless promiscuity and drugs. But promiscuity and drugs existed in the 50s, along with racial and sexual hatred, violence, and thoughtlessness. All of these are not reflections on a lack of cultural moralizing- they are reflections on a lack of widespread personal responsibility. They are also not products of the 90s- they are products of the state of being human. But do we really want to give up self-awareness and freedom of thought to live in the 50s again, just so we can cover up all the problems we have now and HAD THEN AS WELL with hypocritical and constricting 'black and white' moralizing? That is the question 'Pleasantville' asks. There is a saying that anyone who gives up freedom for safety deserves neither. This is the message 'Pleasantville delivers. And besides that, it's a really cute fantasy flick. "},{"Title":"Deep in meaning.

The premise is a little old (time travel, back the 1950s America) but it's treated in a novel way - characters go back to a 50s sitcom - that makes for an interesting ride. Tobey Maguire is good in this, more interesting to watch, I thought, than in the later Cider House Rules. Once the initial novelty of the situation has started to wear off, the movie starts to change - now the focus is no longer how to get the heroes home, but how they affect the sitcom characters. It's a culture shock that affects both sides. The gradual introduction of colour into the black and white world is wonderfully done and has dramatic meaning. Some reviewers have seen a political statement in the movie apparently their brains switched off the second they saw the sign in the shop window No coloreds. However, I saw this as a kind of joke, and the point is not pursued, certainly not belaboured. The point, rather, is the age-old story of how people react to change, and how they deal with the inevitable fear and uncertainty it brings. A fun viewing for all, teenagers and older (there are a couple of simulated sex scenes). By the final showdown, the focus has become emotional sterility and how to break through to a more fulfilling experience of life a lot of themes for a comedy, and on the whole very well handled.

The scenes of racism mirror the deep south in the 50s. The idea of change was unexceptable because people were stuck in a routine. Sex was a taboo subject, until the 60s. The screenplay brings out these subjects in the film effectively. It's only once colour is added that things begin to change, a parallel of the enterance to the 60s. The social commentary is very good, I applaud the director!

Every day is nothing but repetitiveness, acting, memorized scripts but nothing spontaneous. No insight into good and evil. I thought the idea of adding color to the scene every time a character had an insight or became aware of what was good and evil was brilliant. The movie is clever! Fun! It can be analyzed multi dimensionally.  One of the most important issues raised in the movie to me is that; for there to be freedom to choose there has to be the ability to think. When one individual thinks, the community can be shaken, so said Aldous Huxley in Brave New World. If one cannot think there would be any difference between such  people and an animal. However, sometimes I wonder about my dog, he is so clever and insightful that I wonder if he really does not think up to a certain level. Somehow he let's me know what he wants, how he feels, and even if he was naughty, I can tell by his face and doggie body language.  Whether this is behavioral or not, I don't know with certainty. The ability to think as given to mankind by God is intriguing as it leads us to things like the woman in the movie giving an apple to her boyfriend to eat and the apple turning red.  This can be traced to the Bible story of Adam and Eve. Then there come the consequences. Colors!!!!!  When they have, knowledge colors will show. I love that!   There is not a good word  in the English language for that - but there a Greek rhema which means that is reality to me now!  It is the wow moment!  I recommend the movie, I found it to be clever, cute, this is a  great movie. Favorite Scenes The red apple; the make up in shades of grey (who would ever think of such a clever thing!).  Grey makeup, that is funny!  Could it be a grey area? Just think! Favorite Quotes  David/Bud Parker They're happy like this.  Jennifer/Mary Sue Parker No, David. Nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.  This quote makes one wonder if mankind could be happy outside the imperfect world we live in.  It seems that the movie implies that a perfect world is possible only with freedom of choice - that is one of the most beautiful gift given to men. Just think about it!

By handing Bud a remote, he admits him bodily to the world of a TV show by which Bud is mesmerized.

It has a lot more than that to say, and says it in layer upon layer.In the Wizard of Oz, color entered because the technology ripened just as the movie was being made... a happy accident. In Yellow Submarine, color was restored, to a world subdued by the Blue Meanies, by a pop music band.

Pleasantville was endorsed by the American Movie Classics channel- so I figured it would be definitely something to watch. I'm still baffled at WHY they endorsed such a horrible movie. I admit, Cinematography was notable, Tobey McGuire is definitely a talent to keep an eye on, but it's not enough to compensate for horrible plot development, lame 50's/90's clich√©s and its confusing and distasteful message.  I can't believe people are calling it original. The the film vomited clich√©s and it was inanely predictable.

It sounds like a reverse Brady Bunch Movie, or Switching Channels gone bad.But this really is a special film with a lot to say about our world.  For years we have blamed Eve for the Apple, but are we really so sure we want to LIVE in an untainted Eden?This film made me appreciate the times in which we live.  It's so easy to say, times were so much simpler long ago, and pine for the simplicity of life in the 50s, especially if you are a white male.  But we mature and develop intellect for a reason.  Clearly, with that intellect, there is a trade-off, and by learning we cash in our innocence.  Some people would rather not know that bad things exist, and live with their heads in the soil, know that their dinner is on the table, and live in the 'burbs with a white picket fence.  But I, for one, would rather see the blue sky, the colors of the rainbow, even if it means that life is stressful and complex.I loved the way that Ross subtly draws analogies to the civil rights movement of the 60s, and the way that Jeff Daniels' character has love of art, even if his eyes can't see the colors to paint them.  And it is not without its humorous moments, with the breakfast of champions and the cubist Santa Claus.But coming back to it, Gary Ross made a heck of a picture to make me realize how great life really is right now, despite the hassles.

There, the basketball team of the city always wins, the only work that the fireman have to do is to take cats out of trees, there isn't sex... Everything is pleasant in Pleasantville! But everything was also black and white.David should act now as Bud Parker and his sister as Mary Sue Parker. For David, a fan of this sitcom, everything was OK but for Jennifer, one popular girl, being in one place so calm was very boring. David tried to keep Jennifer doing everything as in the sitcom but she didn't want. So she started a revolution in the city. In each demonstration or discovery of a new felling, the person would get colored.As Gary Ross said, this movie is about people that can't behave, act or adapt with their own changes. It's about people that want to stay in black and white and people that wish the color. It's about people that want changes and more than this, people that do something for that changes to happen and be real.The sexual theme is very explored by Gary. One of the first changes for color happens when Jennifer shows her boyfriend that there are a lot of different (and more interesting) things to do in the car than only hold her hand. Then, she shows her mother Betty (played by Joan Allen, great as ever) how to masturbate. When Betty try to practice it, the tree in the front of the house explodes and burns. This scene is very funny as the fireman had never seen one fire before and he didn't know how to  act in the situation.For me, one of the best scenes is when Joan Allen doesn't want to stay in color and asks Bud to make her up using gray lipstick, powder, you know, gray make up. But why did she want it? Because after more than 90 minutes as a comedy and romance, Pleasantville turns a choking drama. Many people (as me) that read only a few comments about it might be surprised with its end. A enormous revolution happens with blood, fights, fire, protests, stoning and discrimination against coloreds. I loved its end. In fact, I didn't like a single detail of it but even so it's not so important. How can someone dislike one so happy end with the music Across the Universe playing in the back? Well, what I know is that Pleasantville is a small masterpiece that will be forever in my mind and in my heart too.    ** I have to say that the Academy Awards had been unfair with Pleasantville.

Some filmmakers have tried to do the two-teenagers-sucked-into-a-TV-show movie before and failed (miserably), Stay Tuned being a horrific example.  So when I started to watch the film, I was interested because it it's quite a gripping theory, but I was apprehensive about the way it would be handled.Happily, the film manages more-or-less to fall into the category of a successful teenagers-sucked-into-a-TV-show movie.  The performances by all are good (but a special mention must go to Joan Allen for a wonderful display of talent as the repressed housewife who discovers the beauty of life, love and the female orgasm Oh my goodness!), and a great deal of attention has gone into the set and props to make them authentic for the period in which the TV show Pleasantville is set.  On a negative note though, the camerawork just isn't authentic for a fifties TV show - normally, this wouldn't have bothered me much, but as I had just finished watching and reviewing The Elephant Man (which makes good use of camerawork in just this manner), I was aware of it.The use of colour is very well done, and the concept of people being susceptible to colourisation when they become passionate (for whatever reason) is simple, clever and competently exercised.  There are also certain points in the film which create quite surprising reactions in the audience for example, a friend of mine described the scene in which Joan Allen uses grey make-up to conceal her colour as very sad - and she was right.  At face value, there is little that is moving about the scene, (it is perhaps almost comic), but it is well played and directed, and evokes a great deal of empathy for the character.It's now time for me to jump on my Equal Opportunities high horse, and explain that the film is also a subtle exercise in discrimination and racism, in the same vein as Disney's The Fox and the Hound.  The signs begin appearing in windows saying No Coloreds, just to make the point staringly obvious for those more excited about the toffee popcorn before the movie (optional).  It makes the point simply and effectively, and it's also worth thinking about.  It also talks a great deal about change, traditional family values, and the society in which we live today (the montage at the beginning of the film through various different High School lessons is a good example, and very grimly comic).Unfortunately, I must also point out two negative points about the film firstly, that the film is a little over-long at 124 minutes, and secondly, that the absolute ending confuses the hell out of me.  There are probably thousands of you who understand the last and final camera shot - it probably ties the film together beautifully and is the best part of the film - but not me.  Maybe I'm being thick.  I'm not going to describe it for fear of spoiling it for those of you who haven't seen it before, but it left me scratching my head after an otherwise pleasant and simple movie.In total, though, Pleasantville is funny when it should be, moving when it should be, and above all, simple.  This isn't a bad thing, by any means the points are clear and effective, but it is also very possible to watch Pleasantville without giving much thought to these issues - it is a light, fluffy comedy/drama, which is ultimately very enjoyable.  Excellent for a Sunday night in front of the video.

But, after just a few minutes of viewing I was captivated; completely sucked in for the length of the movie.Most teen films (by teen films I mean films with a primarily teenage teen-to-mid-twenties cast) drown themselves in mindless, annoying canter and have no plot. This, I feel, is because they're aiming them at a teen audience. This film seems to be an exception, and I believe that's due to the fact that this one isn't really aimed at the youth demographic. That's not to say that a teen audience couldn't enjoy it, but it's not as generic and mindless as most of the films that they seem to thrive on are.Reese Witherspoon is generally very, very annoying. But recently she's score some good roles (Election is the best example), and she seems to be performing pretty well. Tobey Maguire is excellent as usual. Not to mention the supporting cast, William H. Macy, Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels are all excellent. Even Don Knotts turns an unusually pleasant character.Now, on to the story... Not only does it manage to keep the viewer's interest, but it also maintains humor, depth and warmth. Being that I don't want to wreck the film for anyone, I won't go into a description of the goings on in the film.In conclusion Everything about this film is pleasant, and enjoyable. It's late, so you can't catch it in theatres any longer, but definitely go grab the DVD... It's well worth the time, effort and money.

The premise sounds corny enough- two teens from the 1990s are transported into a 1950s black and white sitcom. However, this movie has so much more depth, in telling us, as Tobey Maguire's character, Bud, says, You can't stop something that's inside of you. My father, when discussing this movie argued that they taught that sex made the people colored, and hence better. But it wasn't that (after all, as Reese Witherspoon's character pointed out, she had sex before them & didn't get colorized at first). It instead teaches us not to be someone you aren't. When you're true to yourself, you become colorized. This movie is also made better by the wonderful performances of everyone from Maguire and Witherspoon to William H. Macy and Joan Allen. Also, little literary allusions- like the To Kill A Mockingbird court room scene, are wonderful little bonuses. All in all, I can't say enough good things about this movie- it's wonderful.

There's also some subtle scenes to be found in this movie like  the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce logo looks nice but later turns out to look like a Swastika in the trial or the scene where Bud's girlfriend offers him an apple and homages to past movies like To Kill a Mockingbird. As the story goes,  it's interesting how Pleasantville is also so much like our world.  The disturbing part is that I wonder with all the things David and Jennifer introduced that Pleasantville could also be less than pleasant community.  This is especially so, when you see the ending.

Pleasantville is a really smart movie, and I'm not one to particularly enjoy fables (I loathed Benigni's Life is Beautiful and I thought Ever After was only mildly amusing).  Gary Ross, along with being a great writer (the disc indicates he has written presidential addresses) is a great visual storyteller.  The film is a work of art, equal to those in art book Tobey Maguire's Bud gives to Jeff Daniels.The scene in which Bud takes Margaret to Lover's lane is one of the most striking, and the most impressive balance of black and white and color in the film.  Also, Margaret herself, as played by the beautiful Marley Shelton (the only reason I can think to sit through Trojan War and Never Been Kissed) is a work of art herself.  Those eyes.  That neck.  Those teeth...Anyway, if you're a DVD buff, you'll love also the inclusion of Fiona Apple's video Across the Universe directed by Paul Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights.  The Pleasantville package also includes an edifying commentary track by Gary Ross, and a second commentary by seasoned score composer George S. Clinton.  There are also featurettes on art design, special effects work, and the complete screenplay which you can print on your PC.  Keep up the excellent work New Line, we really appreciate it.

The supporting cast (which includes Don Knotts, Jeff Daniels, and J. T. Walsh in one of his final roles) is wonderful.

But I question the simultaneously auteristic and totalitarian in-your-face message. I'm not angry, just disappointed with the demagoguery, no matter how creatively employed.My guess is that most audiences do not like to feel preached to, even if, and particularly if, the message is the force-feeding of tolerance.Many films, such as A Clockwork Orange, more matter-of-factly explore repression, self-repression and the consequence of blindly accepting loaded imagery.Unlike Kubrick, Pleastantville gives the audience very little credit.Nevertheless, the shot of J.T.

Like I said the point doesn't come across as clearly as it could have.  For example when the teenage boy reads the beginning of books and it begins to fill in.  What point does that serve?  The movie tries to parallel people becoming passionate about something with the discrimination of people becoming newly colored.  There is a scene where a couple of black and white boys are taunting the other boy and his colored girlfriend.  Now at the end everyone finds out that colored and others are really alike, yet it isn't exactly the truth in the real world.  We will all have unique experiences that make us perceive life in a certain way.  As a society we should all accentuate our strengths, yet accomodate our weaknesses, however, this film doesn't really dwell on this aspect as it should.  Color will always be a race issue which has nothing to do with the issue of all of us having passion or compassion towards any type one type of entity or another.

A Leave It To Beaver clone, constantly watched by the hero, played by Tobey Maguire, represents an innocence and perfection he just can't find in his broken world.   His divorced Mom argues in the kitchen and Tobey turns the volume of Pleasantville up.  A Nickelodeon type marathon of the show is starting and the 2 kids (the sister played by an adorable Reese Witherspoon) argue over the remote control.  You figure out what happens next.The first portions of the film are very engaging, especially the absurdity with which the Witherspoon character sees this new black and white world. Slowly, she realizes there is a lot she can do to spice things up, like along the sexual vein.  The predictable world of the 50's sitcom, where the people know only what is possible on the show (similar to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO), generates laughs.  No one misses a basket, breakfast is always served, dinner on the able at 6, separate beds, and no knowledge of sex whatsoever.  We see the funny differences between reality and innocent fiction (even the books are blank inside) and people begin to turn to color after certain character traits are satisfied.  This is all hunky dory and sometimes wondrous to watch.  The weight Ross' screenplay takes on during the final third of the film is too heavy for the lightness of the previous acts.  I thought of Ray Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 during one obvious scene and felt they should have left it a light-hearted charmer.You certainly must remember this is a film you must watch with an open imagination and a will not to ask questions.  There are many great things about the movie.  The black and white mixed with color is striking in appearance and the art direction and photography are absolutely beautiful. Some good performances, especially from Witherspoon and Joan Allen, are fitting.  Ross makes it all too serious when things start to turn racial. People with color in the pleasant black and white town are segregated and one question must be asked.  If the people in the town knew nothing about sex or anything else worldly, how do they know to turn aggressive and even violent when things start to change?  I know, disbelief must be suspended, but this was such a promising movie that lost its legs from the weight of the overblown message.

This is the premise which Pleasantville addresses. I found the film both fun and enlightening. What a long way we have come since the black and white days, when bodily functions were never acknowledged on tv! One could argue that we have gone too far in the opposite direction; but I believe that one of the main points made in Pleasantville is inherent in suppression of depiction of sexuality and other difficult topics is an underlying, unspoken, and largely unconscious intellectual fascism.  It is preferable to risk over-saturation, than to repress discussion in the first place. As the characters in Pleasantville become more rounded and human, influenced as they are by the 1990's aliens, they take on hue. As they become colored they suffer fearbased bigotry. It is only education which relieves their plight.

Yet this movie was overlooked in the best picture category, not only at the Oscars, but also at the Golden Globes, which has TWO best picture categories.  Virtually every review I saw for this movie placed it ahead of The Thin Red Line (including the ratings here on the IMDB), yet it got nominated and Pleasantville got shelved.This movie was original, and NOT a carbon copy of the Truman Show, as some have suggested.  I found it a clever approach to exploring such issues as racism, and I found most of the characters to be rich and diverse.  It was funny and yet poignant at the same time- a combination of comedy and drama that I believe tends to make the best movies.  And I never thought someone saying Where's my dinner? could be so funny.  William H. Macy was also robbed of an Oscar, once again.  The rest of the cast was good, too.As far as the comment that Joan Allen turning into colour didn't make her radiant what movie were you watching? We were not supposed to view her as the next supermodel.  Attaining colour was not about physical attractiveness.  This movie was about discovering yourself, which is what she did, and as far as I am concerned, that was all that was supposed to make her radiant.  Her beauty laid inside her.  If this is not the message a person took away, I could understand them not liking the movie, just as I have not liked movies that I did not get the point of.  If you did not get the point, maybe it would be worthwhile to watch the movie again, because it really is excellent.I also found the notion of the people in Pleasantville only becoming real throughout the course of the movie intriguing.  It is interesting to think of an entire world being created right before your very eyes, to watch the townspeople evolve and develop and mature, a miniature version of our own world, plagued by the same problems and enriched with the same joys.  I've found it interesting to imagine what might happen if such a world were to be created- how quickly would that world become like our own, or would it become that way at all? I don't think the goal of this movie was to instill such thoughts in people, but it did so in me nonetheless, and that is one thing I enjoy in a movie, for it to be thought-provoking.  And Pleasantville, being the intelligent and complex-yet-simple film it is, accomplishes this nicely.  And this is why it deserved an Oscar nomination, aside for for best costume design.  I am not saying it should have won (I haven't seen Shakespeare in Love yet), but it certainly deserved the honour of a nomination.

And when we look at today's politically correct society, which tries to make everything banal and harmless (much like a 50's TV show...) we begin to see the little bits of color peeking through the black and white, and we realize that it won't be long before the world we're living in changes into something that really will bring about racial and gender equality, rather than just give things a new name...

Some viewers, particularly those who see life in black and white terms, will not understand this film or find it boring. There is a lot of social and political  commentary but it is indirect. The film is a metaphor of American history form the 1950's to the present. It addresses conservative and progressive thinking, feminism, racism, diversity and sexism in subtle ways. People change to full color as they grow and their potential for free expression awakens in ways that often challenges the conventional.Some Generation X's may have trouble understanding this film. Many Baby boomers will love it because they were growing up during them 50's and understand the transformation that has occurred in the US.The brother in the film is cautious and conservative and admires life in the TV series. The sister on the hand is very daring and uninhibited. When the two are propelled back in time, the sister becomes the initial agent for change in Pleasantville. The brother is much more cautious and initially tries to keep things as they were. By the end of the show the son becomes the force that transforms Pleasantville into a modern town that has many possibilities. The sister in contrast chooses to stay in Pleasantville and matures into a better and more conventional person.This file can be appreciated at different levels.

PLEASANTVILLE is a wonderful laugh-out-loud satire that deals with issues such as racism, fascism, artistic freedom, individuality, sexual mores, 90's amorality, group control and some other things I probably missed. But Ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and, most importantly, entertainment. Any movie that uses Don Knotts effectively has really got its wits about it. The performances from every single actor --including extras-- are Kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious. Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon and Joan Allen are standouts in this standout cast. Maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes. Witherspoon's vixen is devious without being mean. And Allen, like she did in FACE/OFF, brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her. This movie tops THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY on the laugh meter and furthermore the way Allen's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ...MARY's hair gel scene. The first hour of this movie is as funny as anything I've ever seen. I haven't even mentioned the look of this film yet. It is fantastic. The seamless blend of color and black-and-white ceases to become an issue very early on. You accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew. Fortunately Ross doesn't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment. Some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to, but I feel that any ambiguity that Ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means. My only real criticism of PLEASANTVILLE is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good, but I'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little.

(i.e the violence, disease, and divorce) So he picks up the remote and turns on a cheesy old 50's show called Pleasantville to escape reality. His sister, Jenifer, is a super-popular slut who gets mixed up in the whole sucked into the t.v. business. But when the brother and sister duo start adding some life to the card-board cut-out characters and things start to turn colors does the real meat and brilliance of the movie begin.When things start to turn colors, life starts to breathe into the characters of Pleasantville. The color, of course, is symbolic for life and imperfection. Sure in black and white everything is nice but there is no joy and understanding. The color is the spice of life, like reading and music. For instance when David starts talking about where he comes from to a girl from Pleasantville, who's enjoying the colors and life, he tells her how horrible it is yet she says to him, it sounds exciting!This film asks the question, is perfection what it's cracked up to be? The answer is no. It shows us that the colors and souls and decisions of life are wonderful, even if the side products like war and poverty aren't that great.

Citizen Kane and Network are examples. Well, add Pleasantville to the list. In this fascinating and troubling film, we learn how comformity and familiarity can breed fascism. We also learn the pleasure and triumph of free thinking and of striving to explore new possibilities. We also learn the rewards, and the price, of enriching our lives and encouraging others to do so. Pleasantville is much more than a spoof of '50s TV sitcoms. Viewers who consider it so are missing a much greater point. It's really about how we are condemned to a life of bliss on the surface, yet much deeper emotional blandness. We are condemned, that is, if we don't cherish individuality and dare to recognize our differences as our strengths and use them to better ourselves.

Not only is the movie a technical marvel, but the story is fantastic.  Blending elements of such historical events as segregation and McCarthyism, this movie tries (and wonderfully succeeds) in showing us what happens when a perfect little black and white sitcom community begins to turn to color, simply because its citizens begin to act like real human beings.  The movie isn't without it's flaws, is probably fifteen minutes too long, and in the year of Saving Private Ryan it's a shame this movie will be overlooked come Oscar time (for Best Picture and all-around great performances, particularly Jeff Daniels).

Don Knotts of all people actually puts more life into this film than all of the young whippersnappers. However, what starts off as a nice silly little premise turns into something extremely flawed.There's one major fact that almost everyone forgets about this movie, especially when all the racism stuff starts and the film gets all preachy. The fact is, it is NOT about two kids going back in time to the nice and innocent (and white) 50's where their 90's ways clash, and when they turn colored the racism preaching begins. No, the truth is, the film is about two kids WHO GET INSIDE AN EXAGGERATED 50'S FAMILY TV SHOW. That is what everyone seems to forget when talking about Pleasantville.The show in the movie is supposed to be a takeoff on such shows as Leave It To Beaver, Donna Reed and other shows from the 50's which show the perfect white suburban life where mom cooks, dad goes to work, the boy plays ball and the girl thinks holding hands with a boy is going too far. However, those shows were exaggerations of their time, just like other shows in other decades were. How many times have you heard, about The Huxtables (The Cosby Show) in the 80's, that aw, no family I know is like that (especially black families, which even black people said many times over about the family)? How about The Brady Bunch, and countless other TV families? It's the same thing. Sure, the 50's were a more innocent time and morals were different, kids were better behaved and life was better...for some. Believe it or not people, Leave It To Beaver and Donna Reed were fantasies for an awful lot of people back then, just as family life in The Brady Bunch and The Cosby Show were fantasies for many people years later. That's why when the film starts with the racism stuff, where people who turned color from black and white (the coloreds in the movie), it is not a fair thing to do. Because the film is set in this unrealistic 50's TV show, and not just the 50's itself, it is not right to inject such real-life lessons where real life doesn't exist. And when the film actually imitates the shot from To Kill A Mockingbird where all the coloreds are all in the top seats in the courtroom, you can choke on the lessons being forced down your throat. It's during all this that the film gets real confused. All of a sudden it wants to preach, instead of entertain. Why didn't the film just somehow get those kids into the real 50's instead of a TV show? Because then there'd be no b/w people turning colored, which is an easy chance to do some preaching that racism is bad. It's odd that the best way to teach this lesson was for the movie to go into an exaggerated 50's TV show.For a film that tries to be so smart and clever, the film just kinda becomes, well, really dumb. You can see where everything is going miles and miles before it gets there throughout the entire film. This just may be the most blatantly predictable film I've personally ever seen. If there are any positives, it'd be that there are a lot of cool old cars to look at, as well as some pretty girls in 50's attire. But that's it.

So I finally decided to rent it five years after it came out and I'm been regretting that decision since.Firstly, the fact that they get transported to Pleasantville via a remote control pretty much destroyed any credibility that the movie had. Throughout the movie, it seems like they want you to take it seriously but it is almost impossible given the far fetched premise. Why didn't they just make it so that Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon were originally from Pleasantville?Secondly, I kept thinking to myself the whole movie Why should I care about these people? They are from a sitcom. They are not real. I don't ever like remember watching The Brady Bunch or Leave It To Beaver and thinking Oh I feel sorry for these characters, I wish I could change their universe.Finally, nothing made any sense at all. They always ate and didn't go to the bathroom. They went to school but had no books. They never heard of sexual intercourse, yet how were they born? It made no sense when certain things changed colors.I can't believe how some people have raved about how great this movie was. Sometimes I think that if you get people to watch a blank screen for two hours, you'll get people who'll write in and say that was a cinematic masterpiece.

True, movies that try to rise above the screen should be praised for what they're trying to do, but when the motion is so blatant it just boggles the mind why they wouldn't come outright and say the things that they want to say in some other medium than to try to weakly conceal their commentary behind a feel-good flick. A major theme seems to be that sex adds color to your life, no matter what the potential repercussions. Pleasantville was so completely pleasant that kids can have rampant sex and no one suffers any consequences--only a little color. Or a woman can cheat on her husband and their only consequence is a little color and laughter. Come on. The movie seemed to really enjoy a portrayal of conservatism equals bland, boring and black and white while liberalism equals color and enjoyment. It took it to the level of some insane Do The Right Thing scenes in reverse where I was reminded of early south anti-Afro-American bias and hatred...but in this case it was the evil black and whites versus the good colored folks (referring to those people of Technicolor leanings). A few notes would be the performances of the entire cast . They were all simply astounding in their roles. Randy Newman's soundtrack was a bit upsetting, but then again that usually is. Without giving anything away, the ending was very flat. It seemed to me that the writer had no idea where he was going but he knew he wanted to make this social statement. With that accomplished, Gary Ross was stuck story wise, so you'll likely forget the last 20 minutes and remember the movie fondly or not. Simply put, I would tell persons to see the movie, you may even enjoy it...but don't let it desensitize you to the truth of reality. Like I said earlier, the feel good aspects of the movie may make it enjoyable for many, but that doesn't excuse the movie for what it's trying to say (and that quite poorly). You may think oh it is like real life...just remember, in the real world, there are consequences, in Pleasantville, there's just color.

Somewhere else a person has commented that this is the usual Hollywod left-wing drivel, and while I certainly do not agree with the sentiment, there is the beginning of a pertinent point in that the film fails to be a two-way street vis a vis its critique of the respective eras that it pictures. While portraying the fifties as shallow and repressive and sexless it fails to address how changing that is necessarily an improvement, given the times we are living through, and the concerns we are living with. There could have been both a pleasant comedy, and a nice dialectical argument in which neither side wins but both benefit from the investigation. Instead, it is a rather flat-footed film, happy to settle for an easy answer. In truth there ARE very real advantages to the fifties lifestyle, as there are problems.

Tobey is wonderful and perfectly cast as he issues just the right amount of awe and wonder for the role. Reese and Marley Shelton (Sandlot) are both very beautiful actresses who further heighten the mood for me. The movie as a matter of fact returns the silver screen to the magic and innocence of movies from the Forties. A few dangling plot points leave me wondering if the Reese and Tobey's mother (Jane Kaczmarek, Malcom in the Middle) ever realize they are gone ? Is this like The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe where no matter how long you're gone, you only return a few minutes after you left ?

The 50's atmosphere of it is simply wonderful.The story is a bit lame and easy at times and filled with some plot holes but however it doesn't take away the fun from the movie. Still it's a shame that they didn't used some more interesting elements that easily could have been used for the movie. There are some serious missed opportunities. Still the story has some great elements and moments that are at times almost magical also thanks to the wonderful musical score by Randy Newman. The story also has some nice references to the bible and even the WW II Nazi regime.The cast is good, especially the male cast of which I especially will mention; Jeff Daniels, William H. Macy and last but definitely not least; J.T. Walsh in an enjoyable role as mayor of Pleasantville, which was one of his last roles before his sudden death in early 1998.As last I want to mention the subtle special effects that were quite good and unique especially for 1998 standards.

The effective use of DeLuxe color blending with black and white takes on a character of its own and helps enlighten views on independence, bigotry, liberalism, sex, censorship and even rock & roll. The small town begins to change, but not all of the townsfolk are happy with the changes. Change and color come slowly. The soundtrack is great...featuring the music of Dave Brubeck, Gene Vincent, Etta James, Buddy Holly and Elvis. The more than apt cast includes William H. Macy, Joan Allen, J.T.

At first glance it might be confused for another cliched teen comedy (which is what irritated me so much about the tag-line, From the Co-Creator of Big and Dave!), but it is an entirely different story. The story itself is as follows two bickering siblings are mystically transported into an old TV show named Pleasantville, which follows in the tradition of Leave it to Beaver and I Love Lucy as being a virtually flawless world where couples sleep in separate beds and children use the word swell. Suspend all suspicious disbelief for a moment, however, and try to see beyond the surface once the film picks up it's pace, it becomes less of a fish-out-of-water comedy, and more of an examination on the issues and imperfections of life. In fact, it is one of the few movies that dares to examine every aspect of life -- INCLUDING political correctness -- without being politically correct itself. What I mean by this is that prejudice, sexuality, love, and humanity are for once portrayed as they really are, and not as society forces us to view them. This alone should have garnered it an R rating in my opinion, which would have aimed it at more mature audiences and convinced the Academy to take it more seriously. But the most intelligent thing about Pleasantville is that it refuses to impose a certain belief on the audience. It never hesitates at questioning the laws of society, but it also never attempts to answer them. Instead, it forces us to simply look at them from a different perspective, which is the smartest thing any movie could ever do... though very few have actually done. The BEST thing about Pleasantville, however, is the cinematography. In all honesty, it is the finest filming I have EVER seen. And it's not just the brilliant combination of color and black and white, it's the sheer focus of the picture as well each frame we watch is carefully balanced, making the film both an intellectual AND visual pleasure. Other highlights of the film are the acting (Joan Allen at her very best, William H. Macy playing a character slightly resemblant of his role in Fargo, and Jeff Daniels actually doing something GOOD), the soundtrack (which earned yet another Academy nomination for Randy Newman), and the editing (if you watch carefully, there are very brief blurs in between each major cut, as there would be in any old TV program). While I am disappointed that so few people loved this film as much as I did, I wouldn't have it any other way it is one of the few independents that hasn't gone mainstream or been spoiled by public hype.Grade A "},{"Title":"A great movie that teaches and entertains","Date":"17 September 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  It's amazing how a movie that starts out playing for laughs can turn to a dramatic commentary on society.

As they bring their own brand of beliefs and values into their new world and others become curious, take notice, and ultimately change their routines, and begin showing their true colors, quite literally.  The result is simply one of the most emotionally touching movies ever filmed.The entire cast is in top-form here.  William H. Macy does an effective job of playing the father-knows-best, and Joan Allen simply shines in her portrayal of his wife, whom is at first ashamed of her new-found, unexpected radiance, but finally realizes it is much more worthwhile than her former predictable dullness.   Jeff Daniels is deeply touching as the soda jerk turned artist.  Paul Walker as Witherspoon's timid beau is himself very cute and plays the role with a enjoyably goofy hilt.Wherever a shred of color is present in an otherwise back-and-white setting, emotional depth is invoked by it. Some terrific, smart, heart-felt and magical scenes include all the basketball players making and missing their shots, non-consecutively; Jeff Daniels being proud of the fact he closed the diner down without Maguire's help; Maguire helping mom Allen apply grey makeup to her colored-face, and both William H.

Very original.  So much has been written here about it already by others.  I am amazed to see some people didn't get it, but then some people think Claude Monet paintings are worthless too so it takes all kinds.  At times this film is just out and out funny (my favorite comic moments are when Macy comes home and says where's my dinner? and then the following bowling lane scene.)  The whole point of the film is that when these characters/people get in touch with their inner feelings then they are in color and a true person, not a caricature of a human who just goes mindlessly through a boring routine life.  When they get in touch with their *dreams and feelings* then they are truly alive for the first time.  People who don't get this message from the film no doubt are leading boring routine lives and are not in touch with their true self...and they probably won't ever be. I've met many a person in my life like that and it's quite sad that they will exist for ___ amount of years but never be *alive*.  Gary Ross did an excellent job of conveying his serious message amid the comedy in this film.  And the special effect photography is marvelous!  Other films that have similar ideas and messages I'd say were  Groundhog Day, Field of Dreams, Enchanted April and Purple Rose of Cairo....I loved all of those too!

The begining of the movie starts off describing the life they live in.  A school counsleor lectures them on how the chances of them finding a job when the graduate after college (assuming they can pay for it) are to decrease with time, 1 in 150 Americans will contract AIDS, and that the ozone layer will be gone within 15 years.  Dave lives with his divorced mom and finds solace in an old TV show.  David watches a TV show on a station that specialises in old 50's tv sitcoms.  The show that David knows everything about is Pleasantville an old total Leave it to Beaver type show with, the perfect plastic family, including the twin beds and white picket fence of course..  A marathon is about to be on the show which also has a contest where someone could win $1000 dollars.  Hence Dave is set to watch the marathon and escape the world he lives in, and to favour a world where everything is perfect and nothing goes wrong.  However, he and his sister end up in Pleasantville when a repair man comes to fix their TV and are magicaly transported there.  Thus the kids 90's value system clashes with old 50's standards as they try to figure out how to survive.The thing about this movie is that it sets itself up first as a goofy stupid comedy, like that John Ritter movie Stay Tuned, where he got trapped in TV as well which was HORRID.  However, I kept reading reviews about how everyone loved this film and that it was the most overlooked movie of 1998.  And this movie is very special, it evolves into something else.  As Jennifer ends up sleeping with the head of the basketball team, things change.  Colour starts to appear and people start questioning things particularly the kids.  Why do all the books have nothing printed in them?  What is sex?  And what is outside Pleasantville?This film is really sly, I loved how it kept surprising me all the time and evolving.  It sets itself up as a comedy and you think you're going to get a lesson in how things back then were better since the movie starts off so pessimisticaly.. but then it digs more.. You learn things back in the 50's WEREN'T that great.. McCarthyism, sexual represion, cold war hostilities, juvenille delinquecies, and racial tension that had yet to explode.  It is awesome.  Toby does a good job here cause he plays an insecure teenager and it works unlike his role in Cider house rules (which was a total disaster). Resse is good as the permiscouous teenager (Election) who tells her brother that these people have no life in them and that they should wake up.Brilliant overlooked film.Rating 9.5 out of 10.

Initially everything seemed fine - the premise was good, the performances above-average and I settled back for some low-key but worthwhile entertainment.The story involves a brother and sister who become transported into a 1950's black & white sitcom. Here they are able to influence the limited TV-existence of the people and literally bring some colour into their lives.It's difficult to know what precisely sinks this ship - but I really found it an ordeal to sit through. Firstly 'Pleasantville' is at least 30 minutes too long, the narrative becoming patronising and preachy with scenes added just to force points home. The film tries to convince itself and the audience that it has a profound statement to make, which it clearly doesn't. It certainly has some poignant social comments but as Dirty Harry would say, you have got to know your limitations. By wanting to convert the world, 'Pleasantville' turns into a rampaging, out-of-control, maniac.

It all drags on too long - and the annoying half-wit in the soda shop really slows things down. There is also a mother character for whom your flesh crawls with embarrassment. These people spend far too long on screen in drawn out scenes. Even the normally immaculate William H Macy is made to suffer the scene where he comes home to find his wife is not there just keeps on going. We got the idea as soon as he came in the door, but it went on for about two minutes - either the director was desperate to flog a grin out of the audience, or was just asleep at the wheel.Well, the black and white photography is crisp and attractive (especially when offset by the colour). Reese Witherspoon is delicious, and it was great to see Don Knotts again, but that's about it.The values the movie preaches are just as priggish and tendentious as those of Pleasantville.

The film's agenda, however, is clearly to promote multiculturalism.In their present surroundings, the kids live in a neighborhood patrolled by security. Their mother is a divorced woman more interested in her own sex life than the welfare of her children. The cool kids smoke, do drugs, watch MTV, and sleep around. They consider David pathetic for being a decent young man.In Pleasantville, life is harmonious. Children are well-mannered. A family consists of a man, his wife, and their biological children. People are friendly and courteous to one another. With the arrival of the two teenagers, however, things change.Some parts of Pleasantville and some of its residents change from black-and-white to colored. The result? A grocer quits his job because simply because he doesn't feel like it anymore. Betty becomes selfish and belligerent; being a housewife is no longer good enough so she abandons her family to be with someone else. The tension between the traditional black-and-white residents and the colored residents soon comes to a head.The traditional black-and-white people want things to remain pleasant. The coloreds want to expand their horizons even though they know that things will become louder, scarier, and a lot more dangerous.The black-and-white people are invariably portrayed as evil, dim-witted bullies. They gang up on a colored woman in what might have been a gang-rape had they not been stopped by her son. They riot and smash a window-front in a scene reminiscent of one forever burned into our collective consciousness Germans destroying storefronts of Jewish-owned businesses. Not wanting to leave the African Americans behind, the director also places a no coloreds sign in an obvious attempt to remind us of segregation.A colored man, naturally portrayed as genuine and kind (never mind that he's with a married woman) spray paints the brick wall of a police station with graffiti. This artwork shows fires and smoke, couples having sex in cars, snakes, and the town hall sinking. The black-and-white bad people are at first outraged by the vandalism but quickly come to their senses.In the end, the coloreds win. Somehow, I doubt that everyone lives happily ever after.In real life, the coloreds have already won - with more great treats in store. Mutliculturalism and race mixing are glorified by the media. This country has become morally bankrupt. Places that were once safe are now dangerous; even convenience store clerks have to hide behind bullet-proof glass.

Or, rather, a teen-age boy who is clearly the writer's alter ego.Just because adults in the 1950s were not blatant and overt about their sexuality doesn't mean that they weren't sexual beings. It means that they understood the difference between public and private. Just because teens have a difficult time accepting that their parents are sexual beings does not mean that they are not. Just because adults in the 1950s were adults, not neurotic messes, does not mean that they were emotionless. And just because teenagers think that sex is the be-all and end-all of life doesn't mean that it is.In typical adolescent fashion, women are depicted as loving and nurturing and weak, while men are domineering and rigid and authoritarian. What woman wouldn't think of putting make-up on to hide a blemish? She wouldn't need her oh-so-wise son to think of it for her, and certainly wouldn't need him to apply it.What was the point of sending them into the television show? Yes, the t.v. repairman nattered on about something, but what was the real point? The television show isn't real.

They'll still be ageless fictional characters. Why try to force them to think beyond the boundaries of their fictional town, when it will remain a studio set? Yes, I understand that it's a metaphor. It's a particularly clumsy, awkward, and ham-handed metaphor.If we are to accept the characters as real, with lives that are not depicted on screen, then where are those lives? The movie can't have it both ways -- that they are real, but only exist when one of the main characters is around. That sex is unknown, but the town is populated with teens who had to come from somewhere. That the men's bland, placid exteriors cover a seething, hateful exterior, while the women are depressed and unfulfilled -- but they have no emotional life until awakened by their teen-age savior. That there is no world outside the town, but they have food, clothing, utilities, etc. Oh, and how was the town going to deal with the rash of teen pregnancies that were bound to occur?

I did a two year hitch in the U.S. Army, serving in France. I was an apprentice at one of the best regional theaters in the country. I have now been married for forty-six years and raised three sons. None of this was forced on me by society, the culture, a church or some silly symbol like Big Bob. I haven't always walked the straight and narrow but within my moral code I have no room for some of the freedoms espoused by this film. Most of the folks I knew in the fifties welcomed and embraced change almost daily. We were all very much in favor of retaining what was good in the society in which we lived. As I see cultural development over the past forty years, much that is good about individual responsibility has given way to a kind of selfish indulgence and the results have been anything but good. Yes, the McCarthy era should have been controlled sooner and civil rights came slowly, but only the people most responsible for these wrongs and who profited from them opposed those changes. This film would have us embrace sexual irresponsibility, adultery, lies, cheating, etc. as acts for the common good. Nonsense! There are some polished performances, notably Macy, but they are truly wasted on this trash.

The only consistent theme it seemed to have is change for the sake of change is always a positive thing.I can see some of the positive points the film was trying to make, but these were overshadowed and outweighed by the pseudo-philosophy and blatant extremism of the director, who mixes up and muddles his message and isn't consistent about how and why things change to color.The movie doesn't show any negative consequences to promiscuous sex and adultery and treats them like acceptable things. The movie lost all sense of perspective when it started treating B&W versus color as black versus white. The writer obviously didn't have a clue that using more moderate subversions would have been more subtle and interesting than using aggressive provocations which might have gotten people killed in reality. The movie cops out on a lot of things like that. The enlightened revolutionaries are never forced to question the consequences of their actions.The most disturbing thing about this movie is the contempt and hatred it seems to have for innocence. The worst part was the scene with last B&W guy, when his innocence is forcibly taken from him, and we're clearly given the impression his humiliation from that is an amusing and laughable thing.Those people who think they're more literate and philosophically inclined should be able to infer what that subtext implies.

No, self restraint is a social evil that must be stamped out, like the annoying insect that it is. See Pleasantville, and you'll understand what I'm saying. In this film, two teens are magically sucked into a 50's sitcom through a remote control that a mysterious stranger gives them. And you thought Last Action Hero was corny! Inside the 50's world, everything is black and white. Life is simple ,and very happy. Everyone has a loving family, there's no crime, no depression, no drugs, no poverty. Just a happy town. One of the kids, a young girl, seduces one of the innocent townfolk. Shortly thereafter, he turns technicolor. Before long, teens EVERYWHERE are fornicating. The innocent TV mother of the film is corrupted by her new daughter from our world, and ends up touching herself in the bath tub. Then she goes to the local diner, and has her new lover paint a picture of her naked. Meanwhile, more teens fornicate. The young man from our world, who until now was relatively decent, is sitting in a park with his girlfriend, when she offers hima red apple. He takes a bite, and everything goes crazy.

It argues that to live life properly, in color, you must listen to your inner desires and wants.  While this is a legitimate (yet disputable) argument to make, it fails to take its premise to the logical conclusion.   Essentially the movie was a contest between hedonism and order/traditional morality. This is fine, but such a game must be played by the appropriate rules of logic.   The concept that Pleasantville could flat-out endorse hedonism (with teenagers engaging in promiscuous sex) and maintain order is ridiculous.  The two are a trade-off.  *You cannot have both.*  The film does not recognize this fact.  The creators stray from the logic of their premise and in the end Pleasantville became a world without consequences.  This is even more illusory and illogical than the television world at the beginning.It could not even get its fundamental premise correct, yet it tried to offer commentary on such a broad array of topics as racism, woman's rights and Nazism.  It failed even more miserably at offering some sort of edifying perspective.  What was with the To Kill a Mockingbird rip-off?  Talk about trite!  I was ready to walk out of the theater.  That was a horrendous comparison.  These issues should not have been introduced at all.  They were not even introduced in an original format; the creators just re-hashed old, long-established concepts.  What's worse, they implied that individuals who prefer an ordered society (a society where you don't have to be afraid to walk down the street at night) burn books and segregate people!If living in color means living in true happiness, perhaps the creators of this film should read some Plato, who argues quite convincingly that living a life simply for gratification of your desires does not make one happy.  It also does not create an orderly and peaceful society.  In fact, it does the opposite.  If you choose to endorse Nietschze's view that morality is relative and up to an individual choice, then take Nietschze to the end - that this creates a world without order.  Nietschze and Plato cannot be mixed-and-matched.Not only that, but the film insults individuals who prefer order and stability over rampant individual liberty and hedonism.  Those people are squares who don't really see things the enlightened way.  The fact of the matter is that freedom v. order is a legitimate value choice.  One side has no right to criticize the other as being idiotic or stupid.Overall, I felt the film insulted my intelligence.  It tried to show me something which I know is obviously false.  Simple logic dictates this.  And it seemed to assume that I would buy it.  Having my intelligence insulted is one thing, but paying $7.50?  I'll pass, thanks.

I just couldn't keep it on any longer.The amount of suspension of disbelief that is required for this film is beyond reasonable - not because 2 'real life' people get transported into a TV show, but because of what happens once they are there. In particular, Toby Maguire's character, who continuously insists they must act normal so as not to upset the fictional Pleasantville world is nonsensical. They is no explanation of why he feels they have to fit in rather than go crazy at the absurdness of the situation. And the idea that the fictional world carries on and people live their lives once the show is off air is more implausibility, especially since they do not lead normally lives but seemingly repeat whatever their character does while the show is on air, ad infinitum.Not a lot of sense to it and not very engaging.

Sometimes, the premise of a movie itself is not acceptable to a viewer, and the critic will take on that question.Here's where I feel PLEASANTVILLE should be criticized for what the filmmakers did not attempt to do it missed an enormous opportunity. Its plot deceit is creative if far-fetched even for a fantasy--two teenagers from the 1990s being stuck in a 1950s black and white sitcom, and manage to liberate the town from 1950s sitcom thinking by introducing color, and, apparently, sex and art.The opportunity missed--and I believe it to be one very close to the heart of the film's main idea--is that the entire question of race was absent.Perhaps one can bring up the Technicolor aspect as suggesting race, as it suggests racial prejudice. But ... the transformations our society was to go through post 1950s has largely or everything to do with race--the music, the liberation, the insistence to change and include. It was really the Civil Rights Movement, and the gradual change in r attitudes that really changed us, made us different from the 1950s. The women's movement, sexual liberation, a critical analysis of America's role in the world through the anti-war movement, all had vital roots in Montgomery and Selma and Watts.What if, for example, the film were to end by introducing to black-and-white land a true colored, an African-American? The all-racially white world of Pleansantville would have had a whole new set of dichotomies to deal with.PLEASANTVILLE is clever, technically adroit, has some good performances, and a number of other things going for it, but it misses an obvious chance to add a dimension that was definitely there in the 1950s but left out of a film depicting the era.I also agree with some of the critiques of the film it's preachy; it seems to embrace sexual infidelity as liberating non-conformity; it wrongfully shows the 1950s to be far more devoid of passion than they actually were. Even some of the sitcoms criticized, as one commenter pointed out, had more heart to them than was given credit to in Pleasantville. The filmmakers had every right to show things their way, and it's a legitimate position, I suppose, but one that rings a little hollow and facile.PLEASANTVILLE is a good movie, with some extreme strong elements and even some touches of magic, but it is hard to forgive it for ignoring the question of American apartheid, as if that had nothing to do with the limitations and blindnesses of that era.

Then I watched the film...It turns out this movie's message is Life before the sexual revolution was gray and insipid.  Living a life of convention values is a dull, dorky way to live.  Casual sex and violating the sanctity of marriage is the way to happiness.  This is the attitude that brought the world the AIDS epidemic, massive teen pregnancy, single parent homes, and multiple generations of black inner-city families living in poverty with no way out.The point-of-view in this movie is deluded.  The black-and-white people are vicious caricatures of late 50s/early 60s conservatives, and the colored people are self-aggrandizing portraits of the New Left of the 60s.  You wouldn't know that the motives of the New Left were, in fact, to destroy the American way of life and bring about a socialist state.I am not speaking of the original Martin Luther King-led civil rights movement when I speak of the New Left; instead, I am speaking of the post-King Left that not only did not uphold Americanism as King did, but in fact reviled King in favor of Malcolm X, until King became a folk hero in later generations.For more on this, I recommend you read the autobiography of one of the primary intellectual leaders of the New Left who saw the folly of his ways, Radical Son by David Horowitz.  Also, his slim volume The Politics of Bad Faith is worth reading as well (all of his books are worth reading, to be honest).

The premiss for the movie seemed to have potential but it turns out to be a disaster. I'm watching the movie and I'm thinking what is the point?, if I watch it a bit longer it will go somewhere, have something to say, something, anything. I (painfully) watched it to the end and nope, nothing. The movie is a desert, there's just nothing there.Let me explain, what DOES the movie say? From what I could gather the message seems to be that human beings have good and bad in them. Not only good and bad strictly speaking but also somethings that lie perhaps in some gray area and some others that have nothing to do with morality such as artistic drive. In short, human beings are what they are - a mass of contradictions with many different facets, so on a so fourth. Further the message seems to be that we are better off - that it is better (?) - as such than as one-dimensional characters with only, shall we say pleasant, characteristics.And that's it. I looked, I tried to find something more, but there is nothing else. Now, I ask my self how retarded is that? That insults the viewer's intelligence, even. Do we really need a - however long this movie is - to tell us the above? Without bad there can't exist good, right? As obvious as that is the movie doesn't even make that point. It's too much of a barren wasteland. It just seems to make the point that we are better off the way we are than as some sort of one-dimensional automatons. Which is in-itself debatable because if the so-called automatons are happy and it is a well known fact that humanity at large for the most part isn't, and I personally see no point nor meaning in life or existence anyway, perhaps it would be better to just be happy.But such considerations, or indeed any others, never get any air time.
