The first film (The Granton Star Cause 8/10) is a pleasant surprise and high comedy. It is a take on Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis mixed with God, elderly S and M, and a football team. Outrageous and funny it is great black comedy involving a bloke named Boab who is having a very bad day indeed. And as God lovingly points out it is his own lazy incompetence that is basically responsible for his troubles. The second film (The Soft Touch 10/10) is a top-notch drama that, for me at least, hit close to home. Kevin McKidd portrays a get along cuckolded husband with perfection while Gary McCormick, as Larry is stunning as the upstairs neighbor. American audiences are not used to seeing their protagonists pushed this far without pushing back but to this ear it rang realistic and very sadly true. The third film(The Acid House 2/10) is a very overlong train wreck that may have worked on paper but fails miserably in film. It includes such Trainspotting regulars as that horrible mechanical baby (Like a demented Chucky) and brainless Coco who amuses for about five minutes before becoming tiresome. Add horrendous dialog, endless poop jokes and an acid trip left over from a Peter Fonda film and you have one great mess. As a five-minute bit it could have worked but time seems to stand still while it drags its bloated carcass on the screen. God (who appears in all 3 segments wonderfully played by Maurice Roeves) may seem vengeful in the first film and carelessly sadistic in the second, but this viewer was praying to him during the third segment to make the pain go away.

This film needs to be watched during a particularly bad hangover, wearing only underpants with holes in them, while eating cold pizza from the night before and sucking on your first hair-of-the-dog beer.The second segment is the best one, and also the most realistic one. A pathetic, hopeless man living a grim, hopeless life has his become accustomed to his misery, until a neighbor from hell makes his existence even more intolerable than before. This segment is definitely an allegory of every working class life.

Being a huge fan of Irvine Welsh, I had high hopes for this film, but I was also aware that it would most likely not be as good as Trainspotting. It wasn't, but a good movie all the same.The first story is about a 23 year old soccer player who is booted out by his mates, gets kicked out of his parents house, looses his girlfriend, and looses his job all in the space of a few hours. After all this, he meets God. The second concerns a very disturbed couple with a newborn baby, and their wacky neighbor who moves into the flat above them. And the third, and best, of them is about a young man who is struck by lightning after taking a hit of acid and his soul is transfered into the body of a newborn baby. Very strange stories, only Irvine Welsh could have done these.As a movie, it has all the basic ingredients, save for a few dodgy dialogue bits here and there. All the actors involve give their best, and it was a pretty satisfying and mind boggling experience. It isn't as well laid out as Trainspotting, though, so people expecting a new Trainspotting might not get what they expect.

I've never experienced anything quite like this. Expletives abound in every sentence. Fast-paced dialogue is sub-titled. It's just as well and so necessary with the strong Scottish accent.Story 1 is a tale about revenge. When all seems lost, God makes it possible for Boab Coyle to avenge himself on numerous people who have been more than unkind to him. It's strong stuff and at times you may wish to vomit at what you see. Ugh! Story2 is about Johnny and Catriona and the new baby. Larry, a most despicable neighbour who lives in the upstairs apartment has eyes for Catriona who enjoys what seems like non-stop sex with this lascivious creature, while Johnny is literally left holding the baby together with all the household chores. There are some very funny scenes including an ingenious answer to a lack of electric power and a stupid argument about the colour cerise.Story 3 is more of a character study of a young man called Coco suffering from a drug over-dose. There is ample opportunity to use special effects such as distorted images. Another story of a couple rushing to hospital for the birth of their baby is cleverly intertwined with sound effects of shouting and screaming common to both. As for the precocious baby, I found it rather weird and unsettling and one that only a mother could love.Don't be put off by the dirty talk and blasphemous conversation. The characters seem so real to me. Their lives are a sad reflection of a miserable existence of the lower classes sweetened by only one thing......the love of football.

If you are easily offended then be warned - you will see things that you will not expect, but the great part is that you never feel that anything was cut out - this film goes there and then goes further.Fantastic performances by the actors, a brilliantly well selected soundtrack and truly terrifying storytelling by the master Irvine Welsh, this is a great example of British Filmaking at its best.I am intrigued by the fact that the US version needs subtitles, and i am glad that so many people outside the UK have had the chance to experience some no-holds-barred modern British storytelling.

Enter the world of Irvine Welsh...","Date":"10 July 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" In between the publication of his amazing debut novel Trainspotting in 1993 and it's film adaptation by Danny Boyle in 1996, Welsh published a collection of short stories, called The Acid House. Welsh is my favourite writer and Trainspotting is my all-time favourite novel, so I eagerly finished The Acid House a few weeks ago, but approached this film adaptation with some trepidation. This was mostly because of the three stories that Welsh chose to be adapted, and I was disappointed that my favourite story from the collection, which happened to be the novella, A Smart C**t, was not included. Instead, the stories The Granton Star Cause, A Soft Touch and the title story The Acid House were used. I was worried that maybe this wouldn't look good on screen. And I was right, it didn't and I was actually quite disappointed. But I give it a generous rating of 6 because this really is an absolutely disgusting and horrendously disturbing film. It achieved what it obviously set out to do. Where Trainspotting as a novel disturbed me more than the film did (Generally, the novel shocks more and has more power than the film), The Acid House was actually more unsettling and disgusting than the book.In the first story, The Granton Star Cause, we are introduced to Boab Coyle, who loses everything in one day - he is kicked off his soccer team, his girlfriend dumps him, his parents kick him out, and to top it off, he is arrested and beaten by the police. Boab sits alone in a pub drinking, when a scruffy man comes over and starts talking to him. The man knows everything about Boab, because he is God. God turns Boab into a housefly. And so we have the first half an hour of the film which is pretty insane... The next story, is more brutal. A Soft Touch sees Kevin McKidd (Tommy from Trainspotting) marrying a rough girl who he has a child with, only for them to live in a run-down apartment and for her to go out selling herself and cheating on him with the new, hooligan tenant who moves in just above them. And since Johnny is too much of a 'soft touch', he doesn't panel this scumbag or stand up for himself. We watch him suffer... In the last segment, The Acid House, which is actually more disturbing than the previous two combined, Coco Bryce (Ewen Bremner who played Spud in Trainspotting) is struck by lighting while tripping on acid, causing him to change places with a newborn baby. This last segment is extremely disturbing and horrific.I'd love to give The Acid House a much higher rating because of how shocking and disturbing it is, but the reason I don't is because it really doesn't transfer onto the screen very well, or it just goes to show me how mediocre these stories were in the first place. Definitely, they were a let down compared to Trainspotting, and nothing compared to Welsh's next novel Marabou Stork Nightmares which was absolutely amazing. What this film adaptation of The Acid House succeeds in doing is being more hard-hitting and disgusting than the Trainspotting film. But the film is lacking in any real passion or sense of actually achieving something. It's just random and mindless suffering, brutality and sex. There are some really well shot scenes, and the derelict buildings all helped to give this film the feel that it was representing some sort of purgatory. Welsh wrote the screenplay himself, and you can tell he did because it's not very well done. He's an amazing novelist, but as a screenplay writer, I don't think he's much good.It's Irvine Welsh, so there is some brilliant humour amongst the hell that is being thrown at us. The baby in The Acid House was very funny, but at the same time, almost gave me nightmares. The language is brutal, but like Trainspotting, the superb acting delivers it with such brutality that you get used to the hard accents after awhile and find yourself submerged in them. It's a good film, but it's far from brilliant. It's actually quite boring and to be honest, if I hadn't read the short stories, I don't think I would have had a clue what was happening in some parts. For Welsh enthusiasts only, who like myself, will probably be disappointed with this adaptation.

I'm no prude and whilst black humour and the darkness of human degradation often inspires and moves me, The Acid House just made me feel quite ill.

McGuigan's take on Irvine Welsh's Acid house stories avoids this pitfall handily and features three of the stories in Welsh's collection of the same name.   While I would have chosen to adapt a couple different ones in addition to the god and the fly sequence (the story about the sad barwench in Amsterdam and that of a family who's da knocks out Mickey Mouse in Disneyworld come to mind), McGuigan does a fine job with pacing, editing, and directing his talent.In particular, Ewen Bremner as Coco Bryce is vitally funny as the raver transplanted into the body of a bourgeoise baby, and assertively foul in a well-needed antidote to the all-too-kind doormat in the preceding story.

It's completely inaccurate as director Paul McGuigan was offered the job before that movie was even released and deliberately held-off on watching so as not to be influenced by Danny Boyle's overrated drug-fest. The Acid House is actually a very colorful, sporadically atmospheric, and so totally over-the-top movie experience that it makes Trainspotting look pedestrian.Adapted by Irvine Welsh himself from his own outrageous short story collection the film features three 35-minute stories of depravity, revenge, existentialism, and nihilism. Dark matter indeed, especially for a comedy, but there's literally not one minute without a moment of humor.The first story features Robert Anthony Coyle, more commonly known as Boab, a fat, lazy, unambitious loser still living at home with his parents at the age of 23. In the space of a few hours he loses his place on his football team (the pretentious Granton Star), his friends, his girl, his job, and is kicked out of home. Feeling sorry for himself over a pint of lager in a scummy pub he meets God, who is none-too-pleased with Boab for simply folding with the cards he has been dealt in life instead of playing the game. He punishes Boab by turning him into a fly. Because God is evil.The second story is about the enduring romance of Jonny and Catriona, a spineless door-mat of a man and his utterly disgusting, horrifically common wife. They have a baby, but the odds are very high that it's not even his, and live in a squalid flat in the now-demolished tenement rows of Niddrie in Edinburgh. Life is miserable enough until Larry, a wacky, aggressive, hedonistic playboy moves in upstairs. Within moments he's taken a shine to Catriona and wastes no time taking over Jonny's life, who just lets it happen. Larry is one of the funniest, most realistic, characters I've ever seen in any movie and Gary McCormack plays him to absolute perfection. His impromptu musical number as he sings 'Hot Love' by T-Rex and Marc Bolan is just plain brilliant.The third and final story features Colin 'Coco' Bryce, a Hibs casual who takes an acid tab and has a very, very bad trip, hallucinating his tyrannical father before being actually struck by lightning. When he comes to he is in the body of a newborn child to a middle class couple (played by Martin Clunes and Gemma Redgrave). The baby is in Coco's body, and Coco's gorgeous girlfriend Kirsty is taking full advantage of the situation by recreating him as her perfect man.It's all very funny, highly surreal stuff. And despite the metamorphosis, body-swapping, magic, and a truly repugnant production design I can't help but find it an accurate depiction of Scottish life. Spend five minutes in a deprived area of this country (and believe me there is a lot of deprivation) and you'll encounter half of the cast of this film.One of my favorite movies, and I am virtually word-perfect. There are many other stories in Welsh's collection that can be made into short movies. I wonder if we'll ever get a sequel.

Praise the Lord because the product was a much darker, grittier second film called The Acid House, three short stories whose common ground is the Scottish working classes.  In truth the third segment is actually a sprawling mess but it at least shows how horribly wrong some of Welsh's bizarre story lines translate to the screen.  In spite of this, director Paul McGuigan, superbly brings Welsh's other two stories to life and it's surely praise indeed when one can exclude a full third of a movie and still class it as one of their all time favourites. The first segment, The Granton Star Cause (named after a football team), is without doubt the most sidesplitting black comedy that this writer has ever seen.  It follows Boab Coyle who is about to have a couple of days from hell.  He loses his home, his girlfriend, his job, his place on the football team, gets a criminal record, and gets beaten up by a prison officer into the bargain.  Welsh not only simulates real life brilliantly with these scenes but he also shows an immaculate contempt for political correctness and human nature in general as the selfish protractors of Boab's grief, all with their own agendas, insist on blaming circumstances rather than their saintly selves.  His parents need space because they are going through `a dangerous phase'.  His pretentious boss Rafferty tells him `it's important to remember it's not the person we make redundant, it's the post'.  The police officers are perfectly understanding about a rape because `the hoor was askin' for it' but not so understanding about Boab smashing up a telephone box since one of the officers happens to be a BT shareholder!  The hilarious coup de grace occurs when Boab, in the middle of drowning his sorrows, encounters a chain smoking, lager-drinking beardie who turns out to be God.  It is here that one realises how much the Scottish brogue adds to the already colourful and entertaining dialogue (witness the brilliant Maurice Roeves  `that c**t Nietzche was wide by the mark when he said I was deed.  I'm naw deed, I just dinnae give a f**k').  God takes his own self-loathing out on Boab, turning him into a fly and Boab himself then returns to haunt all those who caused him grief, lacing his ex-girlfriends curry with dog s**t amongst other things.  But as if all that wasn't enough laughter for one day the film offers up a riotously funny finale whereby Boab catches his parents in the middle of a kinky sex role-play in the living room accompanied by Barry Adamson's suitably seedy The Vibes Aint Nothing But The Vibes.  These &#145;what goes on behind closed doors' scenes are really where Welsh excels himself, portraying them as he does with hysterical imagination.  The sweat dripping from his every pore Boab Senior, reminiscent of a circus strong man complete with black leotard, is admitting to sexual liaisons with Dolly Parton, Anna Ford and Madonna as his wife Doreen punishes him for his sins with a strap on dildo.  Mercifully (even for the most hardened of Welsh fans) she is saved from delivering the ultimate punishment (to `S***e in your mouth') when forced to answer the phone to her `pester' of a daughter Cathy.  But before getting back to work on her husband she knocks the final nail in Boab's pitiful coffin, swiping him dead with a newspaper, the melancholic Nick Cave by now drowning out the proceedings perfectly.The second segment, A Soft Touch, never quite lives up to the first but is still very good and shares many of its themes.  The victim of the piece is the gullible Johnny who is married to the detestable Catriona, who in turn is screwing the equally hateful new neighbour from hell Larry.  The only light in Johnny's life is his daughter Chantel, who as it happens isn't really his daughter at all.  This is Welsh at his very darkest.  It is his commentary on the frustrations and consequent suffering of the working classes.  At times it shaves so close to the bone as to feel utterly depressing, an effect driven home by Beth Orton's Precious Maybe and Arab Strap's I Still Miss You.  However there are enough comic moments to lighten the burden, most notably when the cocksure Larry is dancing by himself in front of a mirror to the strains of T-Rex's Hot Love.  Furthermore, Larry's sheer atrociousness is a source of much amusement during the film even if the cruel mental torture that he inflicts upon his neighbour is beyond what any decent man should have to bare.  The tense encounters between Larry and Johnny turn into a gripping survival of the fittest contest.  In a tragic but wholly realistic conclusion Johnny welcomes the pregnant and rejected Catriona back into his life, reflecting the vicious circle that Welsh is so keen to portray.

The Scottish accents are pretty strong, however I can understand the dialogue quite clearly because I'm English and they are speaking English, but in a local style. For those who live outside the UK, knowing how to turn your ear to Scotch English would be an unusual talent.Luckily, there are subtitles for English speakers who are not British. Unfortunately, these subtitles are off key, off kilter - the characters are not REALLY saying those things in that way... They certainly weren't done by a Scottish nor an English person... So, beware of the subtitles, they are a bit on the clueless side! The characters are great! They totally do your head in! LOL! The situations just make you feel filthy, depraved and highly amused. The lovely wedding, for example, is straight out of a Disney romance - not! The movie is full of quotable lines that when expressed in front of people who have seen the movie, they start nodding and laughing. Coco Bryce's father's request for cigarettes was used by my friend as a greeting to his friends for a while! He's a GP, by the way (a doctor).I just love this movie.

It's about a guy who is used by everyone (that's why he is the soft touch).He is played by Kevin McKidd (Tommy in Trainspotting).But its the 3rd part of the movie I'm looking forward to Acid House it was really funny to read and hopefully it will be as funny to watch as well it's about a character called Coco (Spud in Trainspotting) who while taking drugs one night swaps places with a new born baby.

Remember the 'worst toilet in Scotland' scene in Trainspotting? The Acid House sees its characters pretty much inhabit locations akin to this one 80% of the time and the characters get up to all sorts of equally repulsive activities like unknowingly eating food covered with essence of dog faeces and being buggered by a woman complete with strap on. But Trainspotting wasn't all gross out and allowed us outside into public parks and streets; it allowed us daylight and, to a degree, relief from its content. The Acid House grants us outdoor scenes but has the characters spinning round uncontrollably and presents a lot of its shots in close up format complete with odd angles and fast edits - you could be forgiven for feeling sick.The Acid House was penned by Trainspotting writer Irvin Welsh and follows a similarly dank and downbeat style of storytelling and setting. This time the film is split up into three shorts rather than one continuous narrative alá Trainspotting which some others might tell you felt like two stories given the path involving the drug deal the film decides to go down right nearer the end. Visually, The Acid House is very similar to Trainspotting but it also blurs the boundary between realism and surrealism in the same fashion Trainspotting did. If there's one thing I enjoyed Trainspotting for, it was the use of the everyday; of the mundane in locales and dialogue as people spouted Sean Connery trivia and made reference to famous goals in World Cups gone by.But Trainspotting also incorporated a fair amount of surrealism or of the impossible in real life. The Acid House adopts this combined approach and Welsh often uses drugs as a catalyst once again to get across the odd content. A lot of the ambiguity is missing in The Acid House; whereas when Renton went down the toilet and came home soaking wet, there's no obvious link that he literally went down the toilet in order to get wet whereas when the character of Coco (Bremner) is struck by lightening, he has transformed into someone else's body and that's a clear cut reason for the story to even happen. It's not so much a criticism as it is a perspective; the ambiguity worked well in Trainspotting and added to the overall tone of the humour whereas The Acid House crosses the line and tells us that this sort of thing is possible in the film's universe. I have to say that I preffered it when it was ambiguous.The Acid House's first story provides good ammunition for Claire Monk's theory about the British male in crisis in the 1990s. Boab (McCole) is a young, British male whose life systematically falls apart within an hour or so &#150; he is a man in crisis. He is humiliated and dumped by his partner down the phone for being unable to 'satisfy' her thus rendered inadequate and unfit to adopt the role of a male partner in a relationship. He also looses his job thus becoming unemployed, another ingredient to Monk's theory to do with a male 'panic' in contemporary British cinema. But a meeting with God (Roëves) in a pub, again giving the film a clear cut surrealistic feel rather than ambiguously so, sees him changed into a fly to wreck revenge. This seems to have sparked some controversy given it presents 'God' in a less than flattering manner and has him swear a lot. But more so from my perspective, God is a character that gives certain individuals the powers to maim and harm, something Boab takes full advantage of. The first story whilst beginning interestingly, minutely fails dramatically with its close ups of half eaten food, dog excrement and fat, sweaty men being penetrated with a dildo in their living room. The second story is easier to identify with in the sense there is a clear source for antagonism and its lead character is put in a position we may feel sorry for. Johnny (McKidd) gets a new neighbour in Larry (McCormack) who doesn't take long to become the crazed individual we sense upon the first meeting. The story is more realistic in the sense it focuses on a lower class part of society as they live in cramped and downbeat living conditions with frequent long shots of other buildings and people looking out of their windows as one. The situation and the manner in which it plays out with people at stake and a distressed baby making itself known at certain times keeps the story routed and somewhat humbling.The third story is the most outlandish and sees football obsessed Coco struck by lightening thus switching mindsets with an unborn baby. The idea is interesting in the sense it's an adult in a baby's body and vice-versa. But the scenario is played for laughs disappointingly so; Coco can't wait for the next breast feeding session and watches his newly adopted parents go at it in the bedroom with perverted glee. The Freudian elements begin to crop up here to do with a babies mapping on and attraction to its mother but it's a little weak. On the flipside, the film takes a good actor like Bremner and has him lie in a bed screaming for most of the time. I've seen a lot worse but The Acid House isn't a great film; it's grimy and unpleasant but isn't as brilliant as it might think it is.

The DVD transfer is nice (came along with the theatrical trailor, a commentary by Irvine Welsh and an interview with him also), but there were a few flaws... The movie comes with subtitles because sometimes the Irish accent makes the characters nearly unintellagable thru parts, which is a nice touch, but it would've also been nice to be able to shut them off after the first viewing.'The Acid House' is a movie based on the Irvine Welsh book of the same title, using 'The Granton Star Cause', 'A Soft Touch', and 'The Acid House' as the basis for the movie.  The first of which shows how the character Boab completely gets screwed over with his life and then how he seeks revenge because of it. 'A Soft Touch' is about Johnny and how he's constantly taken advantage of by his wife and his neighbour upstairs. The third is about Coco Bryce and his experiences on acid and the lightening storm that follows...The movie itself is great. The shots fit what's going on on screen, the atmosphere is brilliant and the actors/actresses fit their parts wonderfully. (I have to give props to Ewan Bremmer when playing Coco.  As in 'Trainspotting', he has that balance of sanity/insanity of a drugged out person down to an art form, knowing how to act and all.)The only real issues I have with the movie is that there were a few differences from the book and also a lot of detail was left out that would've made the movie clearer for those who haven't read the book. (I.e. The ending of 'Acid House', the details in 'Granton Star', all of the other crap that the neighbour partook in 'A Soft Touch') I could see in my mind's eye what happend while the movie was running as it happend in the book, but there were parts that my boyfriend was lost in because he hadn't read the book.In conclusion, I gave this film an 8, which isn't as high up as Trainspotting (a perfect 10 is how I would describe it), but by far isn't a waste of time.

How sorely disappointed you are. I know, it does happen in movie world. With Jackie Brown, you thought it was gonna be another Pulp Fiction. With The Acid House, you get something completely different, which will have you questioning where did the movie go. The movie you could say, is absurdly compelling, in trying to understand where the movie's coming from. Does it have a point? Running short of two hours, we have three stories, them themselves not that interesting or absorbing in that 112 minute grinding stretch. It would be hard for me, in fact, to tell you which one I like the best out of the three. We have a couple of stars from Trainspotting, which I will tell you, the third one I did like the best, but we'll get to that later. First story has an overweight teen who plays soccer. Things really go bad for him. He gets fired for playing shi.house, get kicked out by his parents and dumped by his big breasted girlfriend, oh yes, and he becomes a fly, at the hands of a god, masquerading as a bum, who even spouts Vengeance Is Mine. On the whole, this is just a weird concept with hardly any potency. Moviong on Story 2, I guess the real acid house which involves a squabbling young couple. The girlfriend has the hots for the new beef head who's doesn't have many brain cells left. He's just moved into the building and starts taking over the relationship in many ways. This story is comical, but the beefcake is played with a such a engaging performance, so this story doesn't count as a total loss. Now story three, involving our Spud, much more fu.ked up than in Trainspotting, supported by her girlfriend. Look, just watch it if you love Spud, as he is comically captivating. At the end of this movie, you'll be in wonderment, or stupefaction, a film slightly better enjoyed on the second view, but The Acid House sours, no Trainspotting. I found it a disappointing watch, despite it's oddity and originality which I approved of. It's just a really disappointing comedown, with no morals.

Never the sharpest or most driven of lads, he finds himself dropped from his local football team (a team that can only dream of playing a match with proper nets), forced to move out of his parents' house, beaten by police for vandalism, dumped by his girlfriend and fired from his job all in the space of a day or two. Sitting alone in a pub with a pint of lager for comfort, Boab is surprised to find himself approached for a chat by a man claiming to be God.Although it was made as one film with three stories, I actually saw the first part of this as a standalone film so my comments can only be about that first part. So I'm not sure if the rest of the film was pointless but certainly I can vouch for the first part being just that. The story of Boab appears to be building up to the meeting with God and, although foulmouthed, I thought at first that this would be the guts of the film and would produce some interesting ideas and dialogue. In His own words &#150; did it f***. Instead this is a few minutes of the film and it builds to a rather crude conclusion featuring graphic sexual acts and scenes of excrement and bodily functions. It is all delivered with the air of something trying to just shock and hold an audience that way rather than have much of substance.The script is full of energy if not substance and it rattles along really well, although I suspect that even some Scots will struggle to catch every word thanks to the speed of delivery and the accents. The cast are reasonably good but aren't sure what to make of the material at times. McCole just flops around the place and doesn't seem to understand his character or motivation. Roëves is good as God but is poorly used by the script &#150; it would have made a better double-hander in the second half of this story. Sweeney, McCrindle and others all spit their dialogue with passion and do OK as such. McGuigan's direction focuses on the crudity and excess of Welsh's script but forgets anything else.Overall then a fairly pointless and crude story that left me wondering what happened to the substance.

Why? There are just some films out there that are this solid mix of great and average that it is difficult to give a definitive answer. Did I like it or didn't I? The lines are getting more and more fuzzy as the films continue to pour on. The only ones that I do not have trouble with are the uncreative lacklusters that Hollywood is notorious for releasing. Thankfully, that is not the case with The Acid House. Considered by some to be Trainspotting 2, I think that in actuality it is below Trainspotting. While Trainspotting had a definite plot and characters, this one is simply random stories that have come together in the end. There is no doubt in my mind that Irvine Welch's stories are superb. The styles in which these are portrayed and carried out are very imaginative and realistic (in a surreal sort of way) which really kept my attention. What they do lack is structure. That is why I have added this collection of stories to my list of books that I would like to own, but not the film. I cannot read the other stories that Irvine Welch has imagined for his home country, sadly, I am not interested in seeing anymore short stories theatrically released. Don't get me wrong. This was my type of film. It was graphic, yet poignant, subtle yet powerful, and very brilliantly written with some interesting messages about life, it was just that I think it was too much for the director to handle. This was director Paul McGuigan's first film, and you could tell that he was just a little rough around the edges. He has transformed into a brilliant director since this film, but it just seems like this first film was pushed and again, rough around the edges. For example, the child in the final story eerily resembled Chucky from the Child's Play films. This cheap way of creating this character thoroughly distracted me from the story, but McGuigan was able to redeem himself with the final scene of this film when CoCo comes back to his body. This was the type of 'give and take' that you had to accept with this film. While there were some horrible scenes, there were equally amazing scenes. I almost felt that I was watching a rough-cut of a Guy Ritchie film. There were just scenes that stood out that seemed like they were his classic moments.I enjoyed the way these stories all came together. I loved the second story the most because it was so brilliantly depressing that you just couldn't help but find a piece of you somewhere in there. The first story was decent, but a bit too grotesque for my liking, while the third was surreally comical. I loved the subtitles (that were random throughout my version of the film) that allowed me to fully understand what these characters were saying. It was a good film.
