[{"Title":"The issue of blondeness is important only to one man but not to the story","Date":"25 March 2001","Score":"17 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"     When I looked at the poster for this film at the theater in Brandon, Florida (I believe the only theater in Florida to show The Real Blonde) one would assume that the only blonde in the film was Elizabeth Berkley. Elizabeth is the only person displayed on the poster (four times as a matter of fact). Actually there are three blondes (Elizabeth, Daryl Hannah, and Bridgette Wilson) but only one is a real blonde(I won't say who). But the issue of blondeness is important to only one man (Maxwell Caulfield)and strangely considering the title not of any real importance to the story. The story instead revolves around a man (Matthew Modine) and his live in girlfriend (Catherine Keener) who are having problems with their relationship and their individual lives. The film centers around the resolution of their problems making various side trips on the way. Some of these side trips are entertaining and help the basic story. Other do not. Yet the film moves at a nice pace and while sometimes a little confusing is never boring.    All persons involved with this film perform very nicely. Bridgette Wilson plays the dumb but loving blonde very well. Darryl Hannah for the first time I know of plays a rather bitchy character but does so with style. Elizabeth in a role smaller that her billing would suggest never-the-less brings life to her character of a young woman who seems to be always left behind. I found this film worth driving 40 miles to the theater.

Like them his films are light, socially critical and above all reveal a genuine affection for his characters so often lacking in the films of his contemporaries.This is a world of ruthless superficiality. Appearance iseverything and hence the ultimate prize, a real blonde.In this world we find Joe (Matthew Modine) and Mary (Catherine Keener), he a somewhat gawky 35 year old struggling actor waiting tables while waiting for his big chance for a real acting role, preferably  Death of a Salesman. But instead there's a role in a Madonna video, the chance of a soap opera part, and maybe a serial killer in the offering.Mary is a makeup artist for photographic models  needing constant attention as well as emotional support in their delusional lives. By night she attends  a self defence class to deal with men on the street who see her as a female for their pleasure.The problems of their survival in  such a world, both as individuals as well as a relationship in danger, are dealt with insight and above all affection. In true Hollywood tradition the true values prevail.Both Matthew Modine and  Catherine Keener give marvellous performances and their are some fine cameos from Marlo Thomas, Dennis Leary and Steve Buscemi.DiCillo is a director to watch and hopefully he will continue to develope and make movies as charming as this one.

Joe's actor friend Bob has just got a job on a soap opera but is caught up in his desire for a `real' blonde despite having fallen for the available model Sahara.  The films follows their lives in the world of minor celebrity.Despite having done good with the subject of film making in `Living in Oblivion', the director doesn't do as well when it comes to the world of the minor celebrity.  The plot is a little jumbled &#150; it wants to make fun of the world but also seriously follow the people it makes fun of in their relationships.  Also it makes fun of Bob's acting but yet has plenty of respect for Joe simply because he keeps quoting `Death of a Salesman'.  The satirical edge is nice and produces some funny moments but the relationship stuff is muddled.There are plenty of famous cameos and most are good.  Lloyd, Turner, Leary, Buscemi, Chappelle, Von Bargen etc all show their faces.  In the leads Modine is OK but because the director doesn't know if he's part of the joke or a serious character then we don't know how to approach him either.  Keener tries hard and is OK but Caulfield is the best of the bunch simply because we know he's meant to be a bit of a comedy figure.The film manages to loose it's laughs in a sea of serious asides.  The worst being the theme of the old black woman and her dog getting stolen.  We keep going back to her and she has the last theme in the film &#150; why?  If there was a message I must be too dumb to get it and it certainly didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.Overall this has enough good moments to justify watching but it clearly lacks focus and loses it's way really easily.

It's well-written with good performances by its large, mostly younger cast. The humor is for adults, so if you're looking for big belly-laughs and gross-out situations, you'll be disappointed. The number of characters threatened to be a bit too many but that's not a major problem. I found 'The Real Blonde' funnier and more entertaining than lots of comedies that get far more publicity and have much more box-office success.

As he has demonstrated with his previous films, he is a man that brings a great dimension to the subjects he selects for his movies. Mr. DiCillo's strength lies in the magnificent performances he gets from his casts by making them underplay their roles and the irony behind his plots.The Real Blonde was Mr. DiCillo's third film and he shows a firm hand in moving all the characters in so many interesting ways as they go about their lives in this complex city of New York. The film deals with the way young people are trying to cope with careers and relationships in this complicated city. At the center of the action we find Joe, a good guy who works as a waiter in order to pursue his ambition of becoming an actor. Joe seems to be a bit confused about what he wants to do and doesn't have his feet planted on the ground. He doesn't have anyone pushing for him, no experience to speak of, yet he perceives himself into doing roles such as Biff in The Death of a Salesman. Talk about reality!Joe is living with a down to earth woman, Mary, who is a makeup artist and knows her way around the city and the people she has to deal with. Bob, who is Joe's best friend, and fellow waiter, lands himself in a soap opera that nets him a lot of money. Joe, the idealist, believes Bob is selling out, going too commercial. Mr. DiCillo brings together the different worlds in which these characters are living into perspective with great style in a fun movie that is a lot of fun, at the same time.Catherine Keener, who has worked with Mr. Dicillo in several films, comes out the best in her role of Mary. Ms. Keener is one of the best actresses working in films today and has a natural charm that graces everything she does. Matthew Modine gives a good performance as Joe. Daryl Hannah, Maxwell Caulfield, Elizabeth Berkley, Marlo Thomas, Bridgette Wilson, Buck Henry, Christopher Lloyd, Katheleen Turner and Denis Leary, are seen in supporting roles.A charming film by one of America's best kept secret director Tom DiCillo!

The cast all did an absolutely fine job of bringing their characters to life, despite the fact that some didn't get a lot of screen time. Honestly, I had no idea that Bridgette Wilson could be so funny! I've only ever seen her on TV a few times, and she didn't really strike a huge chord with me there. But in 'The Real Blonde'... wow! Kathleen Turner, Daryl Hannah, Christopher Lloyd and my favourite, Elizabeth Berkley, are nothing short of hilarious as well. The satire was excellent and the ending was practically inspired.

The acting, for the most part, is excellent. Modine does a great job of seeming clueless and clumsy in his approach to his acting career, but I rooted for him because his character REALLY wanted it, he just hadn't figured on how to get it.  Keener was at her sparkling, sassy best.I think it's main problem is not so much the meandering, or the foibles of the characters it's that the entire setting is so particular to New York I'm unsure about how much of the humor translates. This is not a patronizing jab at theuniverse beyond the five boroughs; my experiences made me howl at thingsthat others may find completely stupid. Anyone who's ever been an actor or in the fashion industry in NYC would find so many scenes uproariously funny. The catering scenes, especially, would be dear to the heart of any working actorwho's struggled in New York.This, by the way, was not an independent movie, it was a Paramount release.DeCillo, after the dismal box office, is back on the indie side of the fence.  Good luck to him, I hope he continues to make movies.

Perhaps those people were the type of audience expecting lots of action scenes and explosions. (Or maybe they're just too young to understand a character-driven plot!) This was a great satire on the Entertainment Industry, and what kept it all together were the characters. Joe Finnegen (Played by Matthew Modine) was not too bright, but there was a good cause in his character which made it sympathetic. The plot may be a little thin but it was more of a series of interwining characters and their everyday occurencies.Forget the negative reviews about this movie and check it out, there's nothing to dislike about it.

It's actually a fairly decent movie about relationships and how losing, or gaining, them affects our daily lives. The movie starts out with an elderly lady walking her dog which then gets stolen and she's crying out for her Buddy. The woman and her dog are a relationship, as throughout this movie we see her now and then watching TV (more relationships, if only fleeting) and it's obvious she is all alone and all she had was her dog. The main relationship in the movie is between Joe and Mary. They have been together for 6 years and are experiencing issues. The 2 actors worked well together and actually this was one of the better performances I have seen from both actors. I liked how Joe and Mary worked out their issues and knew when to back off. Then we have fringe relationships and shallow characters who only want one thing. In one case, the woman must be a real blonde (hence the title), and in the other, the character, played by Hannah, just wants sex. Another surprise was Denis Leary in the film and his character as the teacher of a self-defense and self-esteem class for women. All in all, everyone portrayed a character that was real and with plausible lives.

A testament to the pulling power of a respected director instead of the usual Hollywood hacks perhaps. Catherine Keener is magnificent as always - see Malkovich and then this for an example of what acting is all about. Elizabeth Berkeley even gets a chance to show that once out of the clutches of Verhoeven she can actually act.After de Cillo's Bunuel-esque flourishes in Living in Oblivion this quiet little comedy about artifice, authenticity and relationships was perhaps a slight disappointment, however this is no doubt due to approaching it with preconceptions. It's a quality piece of work throughout, an affectionate satire of the entertainment business, and a cautionary tale about not giving up what you need to get what you want. I liked it.

This one works as a waiter. The writer- director managed to get a large number of talented name actors, some with fairly brief parts, to appear in this. It is just a fun viewing. I found it on Netflix streaming movies.My sole reason for seeing it was for Daniel von Bargen, who died way too young last year. I knew Dan in college, we both were in a long running student musical at Purdue in 1969. He was an actor, I became a Scientist. He has a role here auditioning actors for a movie, the whole scene at about 90 minutes into the movie is only 4 minutes long but it is a good glimpse of von Bargen.The nominal star is Matthew Modine as Joe. He and his long-time girlfriend, Catherine Keener as Mary, share an apartment in Manhattan.

It's always a hefty clue when a filmmaker places something at the beginning or end that it IS something especially significant. In this case it has to do with the entire meat of the story (not to be confused with its distractions) and is emphasized by its placement at BOTH the beginning AND the end of the movie. The tiny, seemingly random tale of the old woman and her dog thereby brackets everyone else's story. Why?The central question of the movie is, is simple comfortable domesticity with another being enough? Enough to give up your ideals, however out of whack they may be, enough to really confront your personal issues, enough to turn down the chance to explore intriguing new territories with someone else? Is it worth everything you go through and give up just to save a relationship that seems closer to mere companionship than to your earth-shattering romantic fantasies? One look at the old lady's face when she stares at her dog's empty dish, and then again when she sees him limping back to her, will give you the filmmaker's answer.

It was a highly symbolic, magical experience that had almost a spiritual feel to it.          I knew his 1998 release, probably an attempt to return to his Living in Oblivion themes, The Real Blonde wasn't going to be nearly as good, and I was right. It was a good film, don't get me wrong, but I just couldn't help but be disappointed.    His signature style is ever present here, and that is one of the delights about The Real Blonde.  There is a lot of clever, almost subliminal use of devices that require a second, third, (or sometimes more) viewing, great dialogue and dead on satire, and great acting and photography.    Matthew Modine (an actor I never did care for) wasn't bad as a man struggling to make it big, and fed up with the sickeningly fake and shallow people that make up the entertainment and fashion industry.  His girlfriend (Catherine Keener, great as always) shares his pain, although she is the only true, genuine character in the entire movie.
