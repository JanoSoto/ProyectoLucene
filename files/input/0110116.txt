[{"Title":"Oldman Brings Beethoven To Life","Date":"19 March 2001","Score":"87 out of 106 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  	Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the greatest composers-- some would say THE greatest-- in the history of the world.  But what of the man himself?  His passions, his loves?  The humanness behind the genius?  `Immortal Beloved,' written and directed by Bernard Rose, examines the man behind the music in a dramatization focusing on the mystery behind a letter-- written by Beethoven-- found among his effects after his death in 1827.  The letter bears no name or address, but was written to a woman to whom he refers as his `immortal beloved,' with nary a clue as to her identity.  But in his final will, it is she to whom he bequeaths his estate, and it therefore falls to Beethoven's secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), to unravel the mystery and discover her identity.  And as Schindler pursues his quest, a portrait of Beethoven, in his most human aspect, emerges. 	Reminiscent of the approach taken by Orson Welles with `Citizen Kane,' Rose presents a riveting study of the enigmatic genius that was Beethoven.  He suggests a man driven by passion and ego, who was under appreciated during his lifetime (as great artists often are), and who grew bitter in the wake of the slings and arrows fate so surreptitiously hurled at him.  The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note). 	As Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming.  His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding.  It's puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time.  Besides this film, consider his work in `Sid and Nancy,' or more recently in `The Contender.'  He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun.  As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes.  You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite.  Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on.  It's quite simply a remarkable performance.  Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven's life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven's sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider).   	The supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz).  Beethoven's renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact.  But with `Immortal Beloved,' whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it's heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting.  It's a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman's performance and, of course, the music.  And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention.  One depicting the debut performance of the `Ode to Joy,' and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him.  Then slowly the camera pulls back until the young Ludwig blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament.  It's a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.  And it's but one of the more astounding moments from an astounding motion picture that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.

I have spent hours reading reviews on this film, stating how awful it was, because it was not true to the real Beethoven's life.... Well, I believe that early on in my life, I learned about some- thing called Poetic License....and, in fact, this film IS, basically, a poem. The movie is BASED on a letter that Beethoven actually DID write, to his mystery lover.  No one knows, for sure, who the woman really was.  And, this is simply a beautiful interpretation of someone's dream of who she COULD'VE been.This was regarded as an AWFUL thing to do, by many Beethoven authorities - and by people who simply DOUBTED.Yet, what went overlooked because of these critics' lack of open-mindedness - was an exquisite blend of glorious music, and SUPREME acting.Once again, Mr. Oldman gave a performance like no other actor in the world can quite match.  His style, sensitivity, andgenius as the Tragic Beethoven, was magnificent.Jeroen Krabbe's portrayal of Anton Schindler, Beethoven's friend and champion - was marvelous.Johanna ter Steege - who portrayed Johanna, Beethoven's sister- in-law - was exquisite.  Why did they ignore HER?  It would've been nice to have her stay here, rather than return to her Dutch homeland - to become a major motion picture star, as well. She had one special attribute  - she could ACT.The sets, costuming, sound, and editing were all BEAUTIFUL. But the film was ignored.Above all, however, Gary Oldman's performance ranked among the best in the world - but it, too, was ignored.Give the film another chance.  It deserves FAR more than it GOT. It was, simply, beautiful...

I thought the music was well done, and I don't understand the criticisms I've read in this forum at all. The central idea of the movie is just one man's theory of who the immortal beloved was. No one knows who it actually was, and most theories I've read disagree with the film. No matter! I thought the premise was interesting, whether or not is was true. What was factual is that Beethoven WAS grouchy (wouldn't you be if you couldn't hear but music was your passion, your life??), and that he had digestive problems. Also factual was that he won custody of his nephew, Karl, and that his relationship with his brother's wife was antagonistic. The other people (countess Erdody, Schindler, etc) were factual people...of course any script written would have to put words in their mouths...big deal. I guess some people just are passionate about what their idea of the truth is (even though NO ONE KNOWS in this case) that they are blinded to the rest. The director is a Beethoven fanatic, and I found this movie to be a loving portrayal. Gary Oldman was absolutely fantastic! He learned to play the piano (spent months doing it) in order to be authentic. Thumbs WAY up on this one.

The director's episodic screenplay relays events in flashback, as Beethoven - played with multilayered conviction by Gary Oldman - is inspired to new heights of artistic endeavor by the three women who dominate his life (Isabella Rosselini, Valeria Golino and Johanna ter Steege), and rendered increasingly bitter by encroaching deafness. Just as tellingly, Rose's handsome film details Beethoven's stormy relationship with a favored nephew (Marco Hofschneider), who was driven to extreme rebellion by the composer's overreaching ambitions. The music is arranged with exquisite grace by Georg Solti, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra Standout episodes include the moment when Beethoven first plays the 'Moonlight Sonata', and the breathtaking 'Ode to Joy' sequence, framed against an unhappy memory from Beethoven's youth, which culminates in a moment of supreme cinematic glory, one of the most beautiful images this reviewer has ever seen.

No one then, or now, knows who the 'immortal beloved' is...Director Bernard Rose decided it might be interesting to take a guess... So he framed his film in a puzzled story with Beethoven's confidante searching across Europe for clues...Determined not to rest until he discovers the maestro's greatest love, Schindler travels to see several ladies in an attempt to learn the identity of the woman who meant so much to Ludwig van Beethoven...Along the way, he meets with three candidates Giulietta Guicciardi, Beethoven's attractive piano pupil, to whom Ludwig dedicated his 'Moonlight' sonata; Johanna Reiss, Beethoven's immoral sister-in-law, who 'could not hate the man who could write such music;' and Anna Marie Erdödy, the beautiful Hungarian Countess, who opened her heart to the German composer...All of the mentioned women loved Beethoven, and one of them could certainly be his angel, his all, his other self...With the use of the Ninth Symphony's Ode to Joy, there is a beautiful shot of young Ludwig floating in the firmament, lost thereafter between the luminous celestial bodies... Another scene is quite poignant of Beethoven, unaware even that the music had ceased, is also unaware of the tremendous burst of applause that greeted it... 'Immortal Beloved' is a love story which not only captures the ideas of early 19th century romanticism, but ultimately attempts to fasten the emotional state of the music to the events that Beethoven lived through... We are given a look into the composer's personality... Beethoven is seen impatient, impulsive, unreasonable and intolerant; deafness adds suspicion and paranoia to these attributes... We are invited to watch his treasured feelings... We are even touched by an artist who yearns to express himself creatively through music... He is an hostile, obstinate lover who would fly into a rage at the slightest provocation, but a sensible human being who carries the music in his heart, and whom the thorns of life had wounded so deeply... Like all pianists of the late 18th century, Beethoven is raised on the sonatas of expressive music at a time when music was regarded as the art of pleasing sounds... The dramatic scene of his 'Moonlight Sonata' communicated to a deafened ear, expresses all his emotional pain We listen beautifully what he cannot... He reveals, through his delightful piece, his soul and the inner torment he is suffering... We perceive what the music is evoking in his mind... we also find that he is a temperamental lover who seeks to reach the perfect love... With finesse and style Gary Oldman stars as the first composer, always stubborn, unyielding and struggling against destiny... Oldman seems to feel the brave, the commanding, and the impetuous of the virtuoso pianist more than what is reassuring or gentle... The muscles of his face swell, and its veins start out... His wild eye rolls doubly wild... His mouth trembles as he looks overpowered with the character's deafness, strengthened by a stubborn nature...Set in Vienna, but exquisitely shot in and around Prague, 'Immortal Beloved' concentrates on Beethoven's women, his cruel battle for custody and control of his little nephew, his constant fight with himself, with the sound of agitation...'Immortal Beloved' is a film enriched by a passion, drama and turbulence of an era... The scenery of the aristocratic palaces, elegant middle class town houses, churches and chapels, monuments and fountains are beautiful and exquisite... Beethoven's compositions (wonderfully performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) are splendid and voluptuous...

So far, so intriguing.With the casting of versatile British actor Gary Oldman as Beethoven, there was potential for a lot of depth of character (which we get, as the passage of time convinces throughout as Beethoven moves from skirt-chasing youth to crabby and deaf old age).Also impressive within the cast are Jeroen Krabbé as Schindler, Johanna ter Steege as Johanna Reiss, and Isabella Rossellini as Anna Marie Erdody. What could have been a stodgy film is buoyed up greatly by their presence, but it is the central performance of Oldman which counts (he really is a peerless performer of real-life characters - Sid Vicious, Joe Orton, Lee Harvey Oswald ...).My only gripe would be that the music is sometimes given short shrift, but when it is there, it is wonderful. You get the emotional impact in the snatches of sonatas, symphonies and concertos you hear - but it would have been nice to acknowledge that the film was about a creative artist and musician and let us hear a bit more of his work!

Taking the mysterious letter which Beethoven wrote to his  Immortal beloved as the starting point, we follow his  secretary's attempt to identify the person to whom the  letter is addressed. No one knows, to this day, who that  person really is, but the film offers an interesting  theory. The letter, however, is just a device to tell the story of  the wild genius who personifies the Romantic movement in  art. The letter serves much the same purpose as does  Rosebud in CITIZEN KANE -- a method of stringing together  a series of flashbacks that reveal the personality of the  central figure. The acting is wonderful and the music is powerful.

Gary Oldman portrays Beethoven with all the warts, near-madness, rage and passion intact. Unlovable almost, except for the sympathy and compassion engendered by his deafness which humanizes him. The music is wonderful here and tries to explain the emotions behind the man. The McGuffin of the plot hinges on a letter that was never received by his immortal beloved. I may have missed something along the way, but how did the narrator of the story get the letter ? That point aside, this is a well done story and captures the era perfectly. Ibelieve Prague was used for the setting and it is beautiful. This movie could be a matched set to Beethoven Lives Upstairs another film which captures his turbulence and frustration and the triumph of his composition of his 9th.

Like Citizen Kane's Rosebud, this becomes a device to see the life of Beethoven through flashbacks. This interesting mixture of fact and fiction provides a portrait of the composer's social life but sheds little light on his genius for writing music. The soundtrack is all Beethoven (except for a little Rossini), as we get to hear bits and pieces of many of his works. The Ode to Joy sequence is well done, juxtaposing the premier of the 9th Symphony with flashbacks to Ludwig's childhood. However, the disjointed structure makes for a somewhat unsatisfying experience. Oldman certainly looks like Beethoven and manages to convey the anguish of a man who never heard most of his greatest works due to deafness, the most cruel fate for a composer.

This is the only instance that I can think of where the screenplay and plot were manipulated to fit with the music and not the other way around.  Oldman gives an outstanding performance.  He evokes passions similar to those conjured by Beethoven's music.  He was the perfect choice for the role.  I cannot praise this movie enough without sounding like an executive from Columbia Tristar.  Watch the movie.  Some scenes are simply inspirational.

Director Bernard Rose has filled his movie with such top-notch European actors as Johanna Ter Steege, Valeria Golino, Marco Hofschnieder, Miriam Margoyles, Isabella Rossellini, and particularly in the choosing of his two leads--Jeroen Krabbe(my favorite actor) and Gary Oldman. I have seen and enjoyed all of these actors in one or more other project, and to have them ALL together is just wonderful. Plus the director genius, Bernard Rose, also wrote a great scriptthe flashback sequences give us a great look upon Beethoven, and they very carefully fit around the search that Beethoven's secretary embarks upon to find the mysterious woman, the Immortal Beloved, whom Beethoven left his entire estate and music to in a letter. I like how he narrows he is able to narrow his search to just three women, after finding a nearly illegible signature the woman left behind at a hotel(is that a G or a J? Schindler wonders. Looks like an A to me, he is told by the hotel worker). I like being able to learn the impact Beethoven left upon all three, and the accounts of Schindler and his nephew provide some great insite as well.

Also, many have rightly objected to the distillation of the master to his romances. Truly, his Spirit, while passionate, was so much more than this. Many of you may stay away from this movie reading some of the, admittedly, apposite objections. Do not deprive yourself, Oldham nails him so well. His life is in there amongst the search for the Immortal Beloved. You see his idealization of Napoleon with his disillusionment and tearing off of the dedication sheet of his third symphony Eroica. His open contempt and disdain for hereditary nobility, and the saddest part of his life his tragic tutelage of his nephew Karl. Rossellini does well in her part but everything and everyone is background here to Oldman's Beethoven. The main focus of critical attack, I must admit, I agree with. Whether or not he had this earlier relationship with his brother Kasper's wife, Johanna, is like asking me whether Eintein liked spaghetti, forgive me, who cares? The man's music is one of the greatest treasures of the human race. From the first note of a piece, the musical ear can hear his powerful Spirit. Play the first few notes of his Emperor piano concerto number five; tell me if that isn't Ludwig Van Beethoven? For those of you who have run, at high speed, from this movie because it was rightly marketed as a romance; you will miss the best rendition of Beethoven and his tormented soul.The tutelage of Karl will make sense to you when you understand how cruelly he was contrasted, as a boy, with Mozart the boy prodigy. The movies addresses this also. He is ghastly to everyone from his servants to his long suffering assistant Anton. The movie is full of his music, I know, detractors, the focus upon the romances bored me also. Yet, Oldman's delineation nails the tempestuous Soul that composed the most beautiful music the ear has ever heard. I, like other philosophers, hold that music is emotion in mathematical form. Within the romances, his loss of hearing and estrangement from all others is well shown. The movie's portrayal of Beethoven is not an idealized one; his cruelty to others is not hidden from view. The core of the movie, for me, was never whom the Immortal Beloved was but the man himself. Oldman has always been such a gifted actor; you will hear his music differently after viewing this. The movie follows the tracking down of a famous love letter which just sent musical people ballistic for its prosaic reductionism of a musical legend. It would be commensurate with reducing Stephen Hawking to a letter he wrote some woman in college. Ergo, I understand the spleen vented upon this movie but, truly, until a better movie about Beethoven is made, like Amadeus for Mozart, this is what we are stuck with. Oldman's delineation rivals Scott's of Patton. It is so convincing that you will have to remind yourself that this is an actor playing Beethoven. I love when Golino asks him, in a sitting room, if that is Beethoven's music playing. He unleashes a stream of invective about the butcher's son pounding out his notes like a brute. There are scenes of great visual beauty such as when the Ode To Joy is playing and he runs from his abusive father out into the woods he loved so much. He reaches a star-filled pond where he is one, existentially, with the entire universe free of his earthly pain. The reflection of him in the starry pool is the quintessence of the majesty of the movie. I took two stars off in agreement with the criticism that romances are not the proper way to do the biography of a genius. His life was so much larger than this. Germany's greatest gift to the world, followed by Kant and Nietzsche, his music united all people, of every race, when they join within the unity of his harmony. I will not lie to you, do I wish it had been a pure biography like Amadeus? Yes. Does Oldman allow us, who are temporally bound, to see him as he was? Yes. Oldman's portrayal will stay with you apart from whether the romance aspect blows your skirt up or not. One of God's greatest gifts to man was Ludwig Van Beethoven whose music's harmony is a hoped for collective dream for the entire human race. A Flawed, But Good Movie. Q.E.D.

The scene as well of a young Beethoven fleeing from his drunken father, and then floating in the pool of stars as the choral part of the symphony erupts, bought me to tears and will remain with me forever.

This is not so much a film about Beethoven, so much as the way in which he effected those around him, and inspired a devotion among his followers which lives to this day. If you consider a movie like, for instance, 'Shakespeare in Love'--- it's quite apparent to anyone who knows anything about Shakespeare that the film has only the faintest correlation to Shakespeare, which didn't seem to get in the way of people awarding THAT movie, and lauding praise on it, because Shakespeare was played as a hopeless romantic that everyone WANTS to believe in. While Immortal Beloved may share a similarity to S.I.L in it's, shall we say, creative interpretations, Immortal Beloved is a far superior film because it shows Beethoven in all aspects of his humanity. There's Beethoven as a Romantic rock star, there's the tender friend, the arrogant drunken bastard, the possessive misogynist, the pathetic misanthrope, all of it. Gary Oldman's role is superb. It is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role after seeing this movie.The acting is top-notch, albeit a bit melodramatic at points (Beethoven's assistant especially gets a bit heartfelt a bit often). There are a few scenes in this movie which are truly tearjerker moments. The scene in which 'Ode to Joy' is played is predictably great, even though it (like a lot of the film) feels a bit dated now.All in all, a rewarding and thoughtful piece on a man whose life was indeed complicated and monumental.Highly recommended.

Why? Because this movie has numerous historical inaccuracies aka no chronological order Ludwig van Beethoven's (17 December 1770 &#x96; 26 March 1827) total deafness occurs far too early, LvB is conducting personally works he actually never did, composing works in the wrong time order, etc. In addition to that, the movie takes too many liberties, to my taste, about the biographical facts, and to imply that that famous love-letter, written by LvB to his 'Immortal Beloved', would be ultimately his sister-in-law is just utterly preposterous. That letter was written and could have been addressed to several very well known ladies, we meet some of them during the movie, nevertheless no absolute certainty was proved until today. But it's most certainly not his sister-in-law, with whom he had so many conflicts and legal battles over years. The idea that LvB composed the 9th for his sister- in-law as a-forgive-me-for-making-your-life-a-hell is the director's personal fabrication and so is the feeble ending.Also, there is much more to LvB than his 5th, 9th and the Pathetique and it's a shame that even these were cut into bits and pieces and added here and there without any musicality to the frames, but rather as background music.There is short scene when a white pianist is accompanied by a black violinist playing the Kreutzer Sonata; it did ring a bell but I had to look it up. The 'mulatto' violinist was supposed to be George Bridgetower (11 October 1778&#x96;29 February 1860) an Afro-Polish-born virtuoso who had a quite tempestuous professional relationship with LvB. Such a shame that this was not more elaborately depicted in the movie. That could have been a great instructive scene.LvB is quite distorted here and even the great actor Gary Oldman can't save his dignity nor the voluptuous and expensive production. Actually Mr Oldman is over the top but I blame it on the pathetic direction.Watchable for the young, but not very instructive.p.s.

The movie is a beautiful pretext to dissect Beethoven's tormented personality and love relationships to the three women.The flashbacks are vivid and intense, beautifully shot and acted by all(Isabella Rosselini and Valeria Golino-both classy as always)with a special mention for Gary Oldman who delivers the performance of his career, delivering intense and haunting images of Beethoven's advancing deafness and alienation from the outside world, the descent into inner darkness and culminating with yet one more proof of his genius when he reveals his masterpiece, composed in absolute deafness, the musical setting of Schillers An die Freude. Listening to Beethoven's compositions, superposed on this beautiful and haunting movie, made me reflect on how unbelievable it is that so much beauty can come from so much suffering(probably are inseparable), and how people generally try to avoid suffering at all cost, thus denying themselves intense emotions and gradually distancing themselves from creative inspiration. When Beethoven's nephew Karl tells him that he wants to be a soldier rather than a composer, in my opinion marks the point where the path of genius and common diverge, because extraordinary creative power is not a matter of choice but a path of its own, and because being a soldier besides being a trivial path is destruction directed outwards, opposed to creation, which comes mostly with destruction directed at oneself, because it's a deep search that's bound to stir the psyche and bring everything to the surface, dusky aspects of the personality included.

Too many historians worry about minute details in a famous person's life - and discredit stories that take a more artistic approach to revealing something about that person.No one knows all there is to know about a man from the 18th and 19th centuries - especially about his inner soul and what drives him to brilliance and raging behavior. The idea that there could have been someone unknown is enticing, and the concept of a film telling about Beethoven through the eyes of others is not a new one, but a format that allows more flexibility. I personally am glad they took this approach. Character development was therefore much more interesting.Oldman's performance was brilliant - and as is often the case with Oldman - you come to feel you are really watching Beethoven. The other personalities also were developed well - and his music was shown in the context of his times - sometimes harsh (his father's beatings) - sometimes tumultuous (the Napoleonic Wars) - sometimes full of love ( the women in his life who did adore him), - and sometimes driven by personal disappointment and anger (the onset of deafness and possibly an unrequited love.....) Beethoven took music to the next level - adding emotion to the beauty and structure already employed by others..... Some are shocked when I say that he was like the Led Zeppelin of the 19th Century - evoking new responses from listeners then, and still one of the few classical composers that you can play for anyone today and they will say WOW!. Even those who really aren't fans of this kind of music. That is why they chose the 9th Symphony to celebrate the new millennium in 2000 GLOBALLY. Beethoven is universal and timeless. The movie is a wonderful way of sharing a moment with the maestro.

Beethoven's music, of course, is the soundtrack and also the main plot point, as the writer/director speculates on the events in the maestro's life that inspired each piece. The movie goes back and forth in time to each of the important people in Beethoven's life and we see his music evolve from much tragedy, some euphoria, and most of all, his passion for life. There is even a persuasive scene accounting for his deafness.With lavish costumes and picturesque Czech locations, it's lovely to look at but even more impressive is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Beethoven.

Writer/director Bernard Rose did a fantastic job of piecing together scraps of history and filling in the blanks with an outrageously clever theory. Make no mistake; this is NOT a biopic. So don't think you can cram for tomorrow's Beethoven exam by watching this movie... your teacher will flunk you right out of the conservatory.But if you approach this film as a sort of conspiracy theory, and if you have a reasonable--but not too precise--familiarity with the facts of Beethoven's life, you will be very entertained, shocked and intrigued at the story.Real quick historical synopsis In papers found posthumously, Beethoven did indeed mention an immortal beloved, much to the surprise of the world which thought him to be a solitary soul. The identity of this person has vexed historians for centuries, and speculation has been the cause of many a knock-down, drag-out fight amongst them (those historians can be pret-ty feisty). Here we have a possible explanation which pulls together several interesting episodes from Beethoven's life and weaves them into a believable plot. The historians can duke it out whilst we can enjoy the show.Gary Oldman, as always, delivers a fantastic performance which elevates this film to classic status. Sure, there are flaws in this film, but nothing that cannot be overlooked in light of the acting and of course the music. My only gripe is that the film focuses very heavily on plot (and rightly so, I guess), but in so doing, it sacrifices the poetry of the situation. We rarely get a good, quiet, reflective moment where we can look into the tortured soul of the composer. Instead we get plenty of fiery episodes and situational drama, which is good but can leave us exhausted after a while.Contrast this with the film Amadeus which breaks up the action with carefully crafted monologues and time to breathe & reflect. Immortal Beloved can seem like a fast paced action flick compared to that--but again I suppose the complex plot demands it. This is really a minor criticism. Although Amadeus needn't worry about losing its place in my list of best movies ever, Immortal Beloved is certainly worthy of playing in the same league.

Oldham may not have nailed the great composer but he is a reasonable representation and the director's method of presenting his affliction is poignant.To the negative the film is a bit clunky, continuity seems just a bit off, and some scenes could have been omitted or edited to speed things up. Beloved is not a character study as everyone is pretty much a caricature. It is a mystery and as such works pretty well even though the basic plot might have been written to the lives of less formidable personages without changing the real story. Beethoven's involvement provided additional depth and interest but no more sense of tragedy, and ham handed direction/editing watered down the impact even then.That said, I'm glad I saw it and would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind considerable artistic license being taken with the life of Ludwig Van.

All right I will give you that this is Hollywood, it's entertainment, it's not scholarly and not a documentary. However, as a passionate lover of Beethoven I take issue with a writer who given the opportunity to dramatize the life of one of the most important artists to ever live, takes unnecessary leaps into fantasy; Beethoven's life, with all of what we do NOT know is very exciting as it is and in my view there is no need to make things up just for dramatic purpose. Why not, I ask you, just leave it as the unknown (it still is) for who the Immortal Beloved was? Why can't a mystery just be what it is? I did read and thoroughly enjoy the incredibly deep and scholarly book Beethoven by Maynard Solomon and he presents what might be the most probable candidate for who the Immortal Beloved was. However, I'll leave that up to students of Beethoven to pursue on their own time. Let's get back to the film. In what looks to be historically accurate in terms of dress....the movie certainly does look lovely. However, if you really know your Beethoven history (read the Maynard and you'll know what I'm going to refer to) then there are all kinds of things wrong with what we see Beethoven go through. (Before I forget, there is a scene in which Beethoven rides furiously on a horse to get somewhere...I had never read anywhere of his ever doing so.) Some of the things that are problematic Beethoven's hearing was inaccurately portrayed throughout the whole movie. Not only that but the director completely forgot to show the many instruments he used in order to try and hear. I'm referring to what were called 'ear trumpets' and the like. Sure he used conversation books. That he got right. But, he also used a wide assortment of other devices and it should have been included. There were scenes where Karl was living in his apartment and the place looked largely in pristine order and very clean. From what I've read, Beethoven was slovenly and looked like a 19'th Century beatnik, often not shaving for days on end, even to the point of looking like he had a beard. In short, he looked way too well made up and this was not the real situation. There was a scene in which he tried out a new Broadwood piano and leaned his head on the piano to hear it better. That was not recorded as far as I know; even more is that if he could not hear a person talking to him behind his back, leaning his head onto the piano would have only let him hear the most muffled sound. There are other occasions when Beethoven is playing outdoors at a time in his life when he was effectively deaf; not likely to have occurred. In short, we are confused as to when he could no longer hear with his ears; we do not know when he was suicidal and it's not even mentioned in the film (a key moment in his life). By far the most problematic event of the movie is the choice of his sister-in law as the I.B. There is no evidence to support this wild idea. The writer tries to make it plausible by showing a series of misadventures and mishaps that led Beethoven and she to believe that each had turned against each other - very far fetched, the theory just is not held up by any evidence. If you want to just accept it as a drama borrowed from his life then sure it's all dramatic and moving. I would have preferred to see a more detailed exposition of his life. The actors are excellent, the story full of holes, lacking key details.

As a pianist and classical music lover, it should come as no surprise that Beethoven is one of my favorite composers, having written some of the greatest works in the repertoire. Ergo, this film, which combines two of my great interests (history and music), is one of my favorites. By no means is it perfect or, to be honest, historically accurate (the film's central conceit mostly), but it paints an interesting portrait of a tortured artist. The premise behind the film, faulty though it may be, is that Beethoven, upon his death, left his entire estate to an Immortal Beloved, and Schindler, his secretary, spends the bulk of the film going around to find out who this mysterious person is. Thus, Beethoven's story is told in flashbacks by people who knew him, not unlike the similarly themed AMADEUS (although this film is decidedly less comical). As such, we only get fragmentary glimpses into who Beethoven was a person. However, Gary Oldman makes up for this narrative/structural issue by giving a very humanistic portrayal of someone, who by many accounts, was very difficult to get along with. And by the end of the film, with the central question (sort of) answered, we have reached a deeper understanding of what drove and motivated him, regardless of the historical accuracy of what we have seen. From a technical perspective, Bernard Rose put together a film that is beautiful to behold, with exquisite period detail and cinematography. The score is composed entirely of Beethoven music, and I thought that his more well-known pieces were put to good use in various scenes. In particular, his Pathetique Sonata and Choral Symphony were quite moving in the context of the film. Finally, everyone in the cast gave excellent performances, but especially Gary Oldman, who disappeared into his role like he always does. His vocal delivery did have shades of Count Dracula (at least in terms of register), but it really wasn't too much of an issue. Ultimately, IMMORTAL BELOVED is a sumptuous period drama which, although playing with the facts, provides some keen insights into artistry and the passions that compel us.

This is perhaps Gary Oldman's very best movie (and that's saying a lot, because he is, of course, a brilliant actor and great chameleon, able to play any kind of role) - you really believe you're watching Beethoven himself. And Jeroen Krabbe is incredible, too - what a moving performance he puts in as Beethoven's loving assistant. Isabella Rosellini puts in a fabulous performance, too, (perhaps her best) as does Johanna ter Steege.

One, every element of this movie, from the acting,flashbacks, elaborate locations, ornate costuming and exceptional photography was well integrated and developed as a whole.This is not a chronological account of Beethoven's life but rather a pastiche centered around the plot.Two,the acting was superb, not just the main players,Oldman,Krabbe,Rossalini and Golini.But the minor roles especially Johanna Der Steege showed great skill in their portrayals.Two small but important scenes demonstrate the sheer emotive quality of the film.

This electrically charged linchpin scene is extraordinary when you realize what's gone before. Not a single word is uttered by the visitor but facial expressions convey everything.We get a strong sense of pity for Betthoven's prior actions.The other clip entails Beethoven testing out a new pianoforte at the residence od Countess Guicciardi, brilliantly played by Valeria Golino who strongly carries the entire scene majestically.We also experience Beethoven's 'affliction' as he termed it. The white noise of deafness with the faint music hovering in the background.We can then understand his humiliation and embarrassment.We see how the Countess Maria Erdody cares for his vulnerability,conversing with him through a chalk slate.The music takes a subordinate role here, the director wants to ask his audience ,What do you think of Beethoven as an individual? Did he conduct himself well in the company of others? Why did he alienate those who cared for him the most?Do we understand the motives behind his behaviour? Do we accept them? ...some may call me obstinate.. ..perhaps even misanthrophic.... ..but they do not understand...He destroys one family to set up a surrogate replacement and then when its members leave him, he descends into depression and self neglect.Some described him as a monster, others the opposite.We get a sense of the complexity of the man.It has to said that this is Gary Oldman's best role to date.From the emotional outbursts of indignation,facially expressive inner pain to the sly, satirical tormenting of fellow pianists,Oldman covers it all with equal evocation.Some are born to genius, others must suffer through it.Rent it and understand how excellent movies can be.

Amadeus focuses on the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri, where their music seems to be a circumstantial element in the drama (in simple terms the underdog hates the genius because he will never be that good, hence the dramatic starter). The music of Ludwig Van (as Alex, from A Clockwork Orange  would say) is central in Immortal Beloved, and parts of the movie focus on what drove this genius to create some of the greatest musical compositions of western civilization.From a strict cinematographic standpoint, the sequence that shows an episode on Ludwig's childhood that allegedly inspired the Ode to Joy, the last movement of his Symphony no. 9, simply put, PRICELESS. Although the film as a whole may have a few flaws and its screenplay could have used some improvements as far as silly love story and dialogs are concern, that sequence alone is an example of outstanding filmmaking.As a film school graduate I believe that sequence should be shown to film students anywhere. It's simply put, brilliant.2- Gary Oldman. He just plays a fantastic role, his best since JFK and Dracula. After all, Gary is much more believable as Beethoven than Hulce was as Mozart.

It is the performance of Gary Oldman, as Beethoven, that makes this motion picture a marvel.  Gary Oldman is perhaps, one of the greatest actors ever, and yet the appreciation for his genius is lacking.  I can't understand this. He portrays Beet- hoven with such purity, one nearly forgets it IS a portrayal. It is a beautiful film, worth seeing and worth several awards that it did not, sadly, receive. The story is so tragic, and written so well, that one can not help but be touched deeply. The entire cast is marvelous, and to have such an ensemble is a rich and wonderful feast. If you want to see a motion picture that has drama, culture, and beauty - if you want to see a motion picture that has the performance of a lifetime, by Mr. Gary Oldman, then choose this one. I cannot understand why this movie was not a major success. It is truly a beautiful film.

His factotum Schindler determines to find this woman, and solve the mystery of the great man's passion.This is a wonderful picture, brilliantly written and directed by the gifted Rose, which cuts right to the heart of the joyous, explosive, passionate music of Beethoven and presents his astonishing, tortured, evocative life with candour, elegance and deeply heartfelt drama. Most costume dramas rely hugely on their opulent design to carry them, but whilst this is a fine production, it is much more a celebration of Beethoven's work, a thrilling mystery in the classic Citizen Kane style with several profound revelations and a great character piece. Oldman is wonderful as the cantankerous genius - he disappears into the part with tremendous intensity but never plays him too dogmatically, and for every sharp moment there is also a bawdy, lusty sense of comedy. Krabbé holds the film together, captivating us with the intrigue and Ter Steege (a terrific Dutch actress, who is also in Spoorloos/The Vanishing) and Rossellini are both superb. There are also lovely comic bits by Margolyes and Humphries (aka Dame Edna Everage) and Rose himself turns up as an unimpressed nob at an early recital. It doesn't matter what you think of Beethoven or classical music in general, you should see this movie - it's fun, fast-paced, and if you give it a chance it's deeply moving. Its detractors have claimed it takes liberties with the truth, but what movie doesn't ? It's quite impossible to say who the Immortal Beloved really was, but the movie paints a touching and thought-provoking scenario as well as weaving a wonderful story, and asks many intriguing questions about the great man's life (for example, could his tinnitus have been exacerbated by the undoubted beatings he suffered as a child from his father ?). If nothing else, Rose's use of the incredible music is inspired - the maestro playing Moonlight Sonata with his head on the lid, a disastrous recital of the Emperor Concerto, playing Für Elise to his nephew, and especially an exquisite visual memory accompanying the Ode To Joy, culminating in an incredible shot of the boy Ludwig spinning through the heavens. A fantastic production by Mel Gibson's Icon production company, beautifully shot (see how many sly references to A Clockwork Orange you can catch) in Prague by Peter Suschitzky. Sadly, this movie angered cultural historians and was neither critically nor commercially very successful - especially in comparison to the inferior Amadeus - and has since become rather hard to find (my wife managed to get me a Dutch DVD copy). This is all the more reason to see it - it's a masterpiece.

Starting with  Beethoven's will being probated the executor had  to find out who was the immortal beloved. Very solid story telling.  I play the piano and  I love to play Beethoven. One of the reasons I do is because unlike Mozart's work few can tell when you make a mistake, the audience immediately cannot hear the mistake. With Bach's and Mozart's music, if you make a mistake is easily identifiable, but  Beethoven's work is so full of dissonant cords that I know when I make a mistake, and perhaps musicians that are familiar with his work do, or perhaps critics (frustrated musicians) would know, but the average audience would not know. The level of difficulty is high, and that intricate work makes want to make sense out of it and keep going. Perhaps that is parallel to his own life that had more discords than accords. I don't want to give the movie away except to say that Gary Oldman (JFK) is fantastic playing  Ludwig van Beethoven.  Isabella Rossellini (Blue Velvet) is perfect for the part of Anna Marie Erdody because of her European flair, and her parents that we all respect a lot. At least I do.  Beethoven's life had a lot of sadness and anger to it, on top of it all he became deaf, and still did the 5th Symphony. The theme of the movie is from one of my  favorites pieces, Sonata Pathetique, op.13, the Adagio cantabile,   The more I play it the more I understand the nuances,  Beethoven himself said  music carries  one directly to the mental state of the composer.  It is like understanding his soul. I find it amazing,   the more of  Beethoven I play the more I feel that I understand his soul, his pain, suffering, his anger  and also his few moments of joy. I believe were those moments that  he wrote his music.  Favorite Scenes When &#145;Anna Marie Erdody joins  Jeroen Krabbé (The Fugitive) Anton Felix Schindler  to search for the immortal beloved.

Bernard Rose, and I hate to use the word director, tries to defend his abomination by saying It is all about the music! Then why does he treat Beethoven's music with such utter contempt?Amadeus (1984) is an anachronistic movie but it had one strong vain of integrity. Milos Foreman, the director of Amadeus wanted Neville Marriner to be the musical supervisor, and he agreed only on the condition that Mozart's music would be unaltered, meaning that the music in Amadeus is basically not messed with.Immortal Beloved breaks that all-important rule and for every scene Beethoven's music simply becomes background muzak, brutally edited or remixed for the emotional or micky-mouse effect. For example, at least 4 times at different points in the movie we hear snippets of Beethoven's 7th symphony to evoke sorrow and tragedy. Da Da Da Da of the 5th Symphony is used for the horribly cheesy beginning and then again later for Napoleon's cannons firing! The abridged version of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, which is supposed to be the climax of the film, is a joke that makes no sense at all! Gary Oldman was one of my favorite actors. He is brilliant in Alan Clark's The Firm (1988) and as Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987). He is simply amazing as Sid Vicious in Alex Cox's classic Sid and Nancy (1986) but as Beethoven, Gary Oldman fails miserably. The blame has to fall at the feet of the director.Immortal Beloved is on the same level as a badly directed made-for-TV costume drama. The scene with Beethoven 'explaining' his music while George Bridgetower plays the Violin Sonata No.9, more popularly known as the Kreutzer Sonata, is nonsense and a missed-opportunity, as the relationship between Bridgetower, a black virtuoso violinist and Beethoven, was a stormy, intense and very creative. I was hoping for some close-up shots of a virtuoso pianist's fingers dexterously playing Beethoven's music. There are none and Gary Oldman does his own miming, so it is easy to see that the music and actions don't fit. Also what accent is Oldman trying to pull off? Did he feel he was still playing Nosferatu?On the DVD featurette, there are interviews with some of the cast and they struggle to say anything positive about the 'director', his methods or the final result.

Ludwig Van Beethoven is my all time favourite classical music composer, and having watched Eroica with Ian Hart and the 3-part BBC dramatisation of Beethoven with Paul Rhys, I wanted to see what this film was like. My conclusion is that Immortal Beloved is a visually audacious, musically majestic and imaginative near-masterpiece.Immortal Beloved certainly looks stunning. The scenery is gorgeous, the costumes sumptuous and the cinematography fluid and beautiful. Seriously when you are transported to 18th century Vienna you feel like you have just come out of a time machine. There are also many effective scenes such as young Ludwig running away from his abusive father, Johanna visiting Beethoven as he lies dying in bed (one of the few times when a piece of classical music-the String Quartet Op.130 here- reduced me to tears in just one scene of one film), Beethoven resting his ear while playing the Moonlight Sonata, Beethoven with his back to the audience during the performance of the Choral Symphony and the performance of the Emperor concerto(I did read somewhere that during a concert when the orchestra wouldn't play the piece right, Beethoven stopped it and ordered for it to be played again). Even the use of Missa Solemnis was beautifully done, so hauntingly beautiful.The music is a revelation, pretty much the heart and soul of the film. It is a true delight from start to finish, I loved hearing the Moonlight and Pathetique sonatas, the Choral Symphony(the Ode to Joy movement has always been my favourite work of his), the Emperor Concerto,the violin concerto, Missa Solemnis and the 2nd movement of the 7th symphony as it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Georg Solti.Bernard Rose is an unusual choice for director, having directed the gruesome horror film Caddyshack, but he does respectably as he seeks to identify the immortal beloved of Beethoven's will(to this day we don't know who Beethoven is referring to). The scripting is intelligent and moving, one might say it doesn't say much, but it has heart, and the story is solid, deep and doesn't meander.The acting is uniformly excellent. Jeroen Krabbe is fine as Anton Schindler, and Isabella Rosselini, Johanna ter Steege and Valeria Golino look beautiful and act very convincingly as the suspects of Beethoven's affections. I have to say though Gary Oldman does give the best performance of the film, while some scenes could have done with a touch more moderato it was a superb, charismatic and moving performance. I have read complaints that Oldman overacted, complaints I don't agree with at all. Just because Beethoven shouts a lot here, doesn't mean Oldman was overacting, and he certainly didn't overact in the final scene between him and Johanna, his acting was a masterclass of sheer poignancy there. Beethoven wasn't exactly a knight in shining armour now was he? He was rude, aggressive and reacted vehemently to even the smallest thing and probably traumatised by the memories of being abused by his alcoholic father. Beethoven also encountered alcoholism and increasing deafness, and by 1812 or so he was deaf completely.Overall, this is a wonderful, underrated film. Only problem with it? I did feel the ending was a little too open-and-shut, but maybe it is just me. I cannot deny though that this is a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"You, sir, are no Amadeus!","Date":"19 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" This is a very interesting film...Obviously, the comparisons are going to be made to Amadeus.

Whom he fought the rest of his life in legal battles to retain custody, even with Prince Metternich of Austria's consent (Conqeuerer of Napolean). Didn't i see Johanna Ries in 'The Wizard of Oz,' as the Wicked Witch of the West ?I give Gary Oldman the 'Most Underrated actor' Oscar for my generation. What an impassioned, ethereal performance of the true nature of the artist, and that final buoyant scene in the river, i am speechless. Oustanding performances too by Rossalini and Krabbe. I always fealt comparing Mozart to Beethoven was like comparing Rembrandt to Delacroix. On the one-hand clear, and harmonious and the other vehement and grandiose. I would have given this 10 stars but the libs got to it first. If this were made during the time of 'The Life of Louis Pasteure' (10) it would get the deca-stars.

What a delightful surprise that they haven't idealized Beethoven, like in the other movies! He was hardly bearable even by his nephew and brothers and not at all a role model for good manners. But I don't buy it when they showed him laying drunk in a dubious liquid, while mocked by street boys. He did have his heavy hours, but such degradation in no way becomes that great spirit.

At the point where Beethoven is playing Giulietta Guicciardi's new piano I was moved to tears because of the action of the way he played the piano. Granted, the music was dubbed over, but you could still see emotion within Oldman. Another part that sticks out in my mind is after he has the heart attack when he is looking for his nephew Karl.

In the latter category Verdi, Bach, Mozart, Rossini. Pre-eminent in the former category Ludwig van Beethoven.How right he was! Did ever a composer more overtly set his own life to music than Beethoven? The pain and despair, the tragedy and misfortune, the ultimate triumph over his deafness.It is all reflected in his music. Listen to the Piano Sonatas, the String Quartets, the Symphonies, without knowing anything about Beethoven's life, and you will hear only music.

Director Bernard Rose overcomes the pitfalls of many biographies of composers,in particular two. Biographies by their very nature are very predictable in structure,Rose overcomes this by using a flashback scructure familiar from Citizen Kane. This makes the film a little confusing at first but really works by the end. The other main flaw with composer biographies is that the music is very rarely used as well as it could be. Here,the music is part of the fabric of the film,with some music repeated like a proper score.It is in the combination of music and image that the film really soars,without the need for dialogue,some might say just as well because the dialogue is sometimes below-par e.g.I forgave him everything be cause of Ode For Joy.One sequence,which depicts Beethoven at the only time,perhaps,when he was truly happy,set to the above-mentioned music,is simly astonishing,but here as elsewhere the power comes from not just the melding of sound and film but also because there is so much emotional investment in the story. By the end,the director has dazzled me with his mastery of the cinema,but also really moved me.Gary Oldman is extraordinary in a role which pretty much runs the gamut of every emotion,you would think the Oscar voters might have at least recognised his performance but it was not to be. At the time of it's release the film was intensely criticised for fabricating too much. These critics missed the point. Bernard Rose has simply offered his own interpretation of the many unanswered questions about Beethoven,using the deep emotions and awesome power of his music as a starting point.Maybe one day this great film will get the appraisal it deserves.

A nice analogy can be made with the movie. Because of the half biographical, half fictional nature of the story it is impossible not to compare it to Milos Forman's Amadeus. And where Beethoven (in my opinion) surpassed Mozart later in his career, Immortal Beloved does not. I'm not saying that Immortal Beloved attempts to mimic Amadeus, but the comparison is certainly unavoidable.If, however, we judge Immortal Beloved in it's own right, it comes out quite well. Gary Oldman's performance is spectacular to say the least and carries this movie. Since I am dutch, Krabbé's accent, for me, was rather annoying, which blinded me somewhat to his acting. When I, at times forgot this, it seemed that his acting was honest and better than his average. The third performer that needs individual mentioning is Isabella Rossellini, who is at the same (high) level as the rest of the crew. So, overall, the acting was very good. It seemed like all members of the cast were enthusiastic about the film and put all their energy into the project.The story is very well constructed, although it is sometimes snowed under by psychological complexity. It seems to want to focus on to many aspects of Beethoven's personality, life, and surroundings at once. A little more simplicity might have served this movie well. The plot, though historically probably inaccurate, has enough impact to satisfy all the mystery and questions that arise in the plot. And though (as said) it very probably didn't happen that way, it serves very well to explain Beethoven's psychological problem (those of the movie-Beethoven that is), and, in all fairness it could have happened. All this makes the script one of the more well-constructed scripts in the past 10 years.So if all this is so right, what's wrong with it? The flaws of this movie, I feel, lie mostly in the often unjustly ignored facets of cinematography. The (visual) composition though never irritating also never stand out. The same goes for the colors. They are always good enough, but are never as power a reflection of the emotions in the scene as they could be. This applies to the editing and use of music as well. And it is in these respects especially that Immortal Beloved does not reach the greatness of Amadeus.All in all A very good movie with several amazing aspects. Tons of praise to Gary Oldman in one of the best performances of his career. The movie is very well researched and epic in it's ambition. That these ambitions aren't completely fulfilled is, tragic though it might be, only natural.For those who are interested what parts of the movie are historically correct (which one tends to wonder when watching a biopic like this), all major characters are correct, as are the basic relations between them. the letter around which the movie revolves actually exists, and most anecdotes truly happened. Historians and music scholars are still unsure about the identity of the immortal beloved.

I loved it then and I just saw it again. This is a rich, superbly told story of epic proportions about the very tragic life of one of history's greatest geniuses. The story hinges on a cryptic letter Beethoven left behind after his death where he made a cryptic reference to his immortal beloved.The film's story is told from the standpoint of his friend who was acting as a kind of self-appointed executor of Beethoven's estate, searching for this immortal beloved person to fulfill his last wishes. The story that unfolds rivals Romeo and Juliette as a great but tragic love story, told against the backdrop of early 19th century Vienna. I have heard women audibly gasp near the end of this film; it is that tragically shocking.The great points in this film is Gary Oldman's acting, which is superb as usual and also very excellent performances turned in by Isabella Rossellini, Johanna ter Steege and Jeroen Krabbe as the loyal friend. The international cast adds considerably to the effort here, giving an air of authenticity and talent to the fine film.The art direction, sets and costumes were equally magnificent, blending seamlessly into the rich tapestry of the story to give a feel of realism to the period.The final and most conspicuous star of this film is the continual background of the music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The music is rich, complex and quite breathtakingly beautiful.This, the final testament to the life of this great talent, reveals an even greater genius of almost incomprehensible depth in how a such a tormented deaf man steeped in such mind numbing tragedy could have produced the staggering magnificence that is the Ode to Joy.

The filmakers don't attempt to explain this enigmatic process, or the effects upon it of Beethoven's upbringing and erotic life, only suggest, lyrically, the pieces of the puzzle; the music triumphantly and magnificently speaks for itself.

Is it natural ability? Or is it the people, friends or enemies, around you the create genius?  Is it you're body of work?  Or is it the way people perceive your body of work?  These are the questions I found myself asking while watching IMMORTAL BELOVED.  An interesting if flawed motion picture.IMMORTAL BELOVED is the life of 19th Century Composer Ludwig Van Beethoven (Gary Oldman, Leon) as told by his friends, enemies, and his lovers.  Days after Beethoven's death his secretary, Anton Schindler, (Jeroen Krabbe, The Fugitive) discovers a letter that leaves everything in his will to an unknown women.  She is his Immortal Beloved, and so Schindler goes on a quest to discover just whom this mystery women is.The film can and probably is compared to two far better films, CITIZEN KANE (for it's setup) and AMADEAUS (for it's chronicle of a famous composer) and while I would never put IMMORTAL BELOVED on any list close to those films, it uses the ideas from both films in a compelling manor.  As Schindler visits new people the genius of Beethoven is discovered.  The Immortal Beloved, like rosebud, merely a mcguffin, an ends to a means of the plot.  When you finally discover the answers, you've already kind of guessed it.  But it's well worth the ride.There are some really great moments in this film.  I loved it when Beethoven plays a piano for the first time.  I love has the camera shows us without telling us just how deaf Beethoven is.  The pain and anguish telescoped in the music, and yet for a small moment he's happy, it's been so long since he's played and it all comes flooding back.  Then everything is dashed.  I also loved the thrill of Beethoven's 9th as we see a glimpse of his childhood and then we hear the silence through Beethoven's ears.  These scenes are powerful and gripping, very good stuff.Gary Oldman delivers most of the films great moments, himself.  He for the most part plays against type.  This film calls for him too be very introverted.  His performance is kept very much at bay.  When he gets a good role, Oldman fills it with so much love, this is a great perfomance.It's the ensemble and some of the special effects that let me down.  There are moments in this film that feel forced and fake.  Especially early on, the first few people we meet are kind of dull.  Especially Valeria Golino's (Rain Man) scenes, I love Golino but her story did very little to move the story along.  I would have removed most of it.  There is also this scene on a carriage, that uses some of the worst back projection ever.  It pulled me out of the moment.  It was so bad.But fortunately when Isabella Rossellini shows up, the bulk of the film begins to unfold, that's when the story gets good.  That's when director Bernard Rose (Candyman) begins to craft a fascinating mystery.  Being that I know very little about Beethoven, I'm not quite sure how much of this film is true.  But if it is, wow what an interesting life Mr. Beethoven had.  I only know his music and it's nice to see why these songs were written.  This is what makes this film really great.  Beethoven's music has been reproduced faithfully, and it's never wasted.  What a soundtrack!I really liked spending time with Beethoven's IMMORTAL BELOVED.

Immortal Beloved would without a doubt have pleased Beethoven historians more had it been more true to history - but would it have increased their appreciation of this great musician at all?  Probably not.  Would such a historically accurate depiction catch the interest of people who are not Beethoven fans already?  The answer is again probably not.  Some people forget that this is a film, and hence an art in itself.  The point is not to depict reality as it is exactly or historically, but to incite a reaction in the viewer. This film in particular excels in creating a character of incredible intrigue out of Beethoven.  It presents us with an unsolved mystery in the man's life, and it offers an unlikely, yet still highly interesting theory regarding its solution.  In the end we are given a story that is both entertaining and engaging, it makes the audience want to go out and pick up the soundtrack of the CD immediately after watching it.  There is no movie that has been made about this man that more perfectly represents the passion behind his music.  Gary Oldman was the most perfect casting choice to play Ludwig; he is the only actor who could have pulled off the madness juxtaposed with the passion of this composer.  This is a wonderful film, though as a musical piece its direction and editing is imperfect, and this is the only flaw.  There are too many cuts during performances, which distract from what could plausibly have been wonderful visual statements juxtaposed to the musical experience.  Directors and editors of American cinema need to learn that a shot can last for longer periods of time without losing the attention of the viewers.  I also wish that I could have seen the hands of the musicians performing the instruments a little more, it is disappointing to hear this astounding music and not be given a proper glimpse at the virtuoso skill of the musicians who perform it.

Most notable is Wilhelm Kempf, pianist, whose recordings of his music have been commented on as, On hearing Kempf's recordings of Beethoven's works one feels they could not have been performed in any other way, so true is he to the original interpretation of the composer. I have found that so.I hope to see this film quite a few more times and absorb more from it than just one viewing can give. A musically very worthwhile biography of a great soul.

However, I still have a couple of minor complaints that I should address, but in short, I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the general premise, which I will tell you right now.  The true story goes that Ludwig van Beethoven bequeathed most of his earthly possessions to an unnamed `immortal beloved', as he called her.  This questionable letter disgruntled Beethoven's family, as they wanted to inherit his fortunes now that he was dead.  In this beautifully filmed picture, Jeroen Krabbé plays Herr Schindler, Beethoven's secretary, who wishes to honor Beethoven's dying wish by finding this `immortal beloved' and rewarding her with the fortune's her lover wished her to possess.  A noble quest, admittedly, but historically, Beethoven was in love so often that this would be a difficult task.  From this point on, I found that the movie was at its best for awhile, as the performances given by both Oldman (Beethoven) and Golino (Countess Giulietta Guicciardi) are splendid and delightful.  Certain points in the movie are, honestly, a little slow and confusing, but by the end, it all makes sense.  Other actors who turned in marvelous performances, in my opinion, that deserve commendation are Johanna ter Steege and Isabella Rossellini.  Bernard Rose, the director of this piece, has not directed many notable pictures, but I was particularly impressed with Immortal Beloved, and I wish he'd work more.   The flourishing, colorful filming is very attractive, even if you don't like the movie's plot.  My only negative comments concerning this film are that the plot can get a little too confusing, and, though I understood most of it by the end of the movie, it took another viewing to notice ALL the details.  The story kind of wanders around a little too much, but it complement the beautiful music (conducted by the late Sir Georg Solti) wonderfully.  My suggestion if you don't like the idea of a movie about Beethoven, especially a ROMANTIC movie about Beethoven, don't watch it.  I wish everyone would give it a chance, but I know that enjoying it is too much to ask of some people.   All in all, I give this movie a 9/10 rating.

Starting with  Beethoven's will being probated the executor had  to find out who was the immortal beloved. Very solid story telling.  I play the piano and  I love to play Beethoven. One of the reasons I do is because unlike Mozart's work few can tell when you make a mistake, the audience immediately cannot hear the mistake. With Bach's and Mozart's music, if you make a mistake is easily identifiable, but  Beethoven's work is so full of dissonant cords that I know when I make a mistake, and perhaps musicians that are familiar with his work do, or perhaps critics (frustrated musicians) would know, but the average audience would not know. The level of difficulty is high, and that intricate work makes want to make sense out of it and keep going. Perhaps that is parallel to his own life that had more discords than accords. I don't want to give the movie away except to say that Gary Oldman (JFK) is fantastic playing  Ludwig van Beethoven.  Isabella Rossellini (Blue Velvet) is perfect for the part of Anna Marie Erdody because of her European flair, and her parents that we all respect a lot. At least I do.  Beethoven's life had a lot of sadness and anger to it, on top of it all he became deaf, and still did the 5th Symphony. The theme of the movie is from one of my  favorites pieces, Sonata Pathetique, op.13, the Adagio cantabile,   The more I play it the more I understand the nuances,  Beethoven himself said  music carries  one directly to the mental state of the composer.  It is like understanding his soul. I find it amazing,   the more of  Beethoven I play the more I feel that I understand his soul, his pain, suffering, his anger  and also his few moments of joy. I believe were those moments that  he wrote his music.  Favorite Scenes When &#145;Anna Marie Erdody joins  Jeroen Krabbé (The Fugitive) Anton Felix Schindler  to search for the immortal beloved.

It's not a great film, but it's good.  A movie is ultimately reducable to the power of its moments, and 'Immortal Beloved' delivers several mesmerizing scenes, boasts an unparalleled score (Okay, I prefer Beethoven to Mozart), and a riveting performance from Oldman.It isn't overly-ambitious in terms of scope, stopping just short of an epic, but still gives more than just a worm's-eye-view of the nature and surroundings of the great composer.From a photographic perspective, this film is nearly flawless.  It's rich, textured, and evocative without being pretentious or artsy.  If you believe most American films are overlit, then the true blacks and amazing contest of warm and cool tones will refresh you.The direction is more than competent.  This film has more humanity than 'Amadeus', if not as sharply written or observed.  This, and the fact that it's superficially derivative, explain the mediocre box office performance.This film also fails to capture the mystique of genius that 'Amadeus' is able to, though much of that might be attributed to Hulce's endearing, quirky portrayal of Mozart.  Though, in fairness, I don't know whether elucidating the mind of a musical giant was the intent of the filmmakers. The film doesn't suffer for lack of it.The film might have profited from a more conclusive ending, a few more original devices, and a departure from the parallel story structure used in 'Amadeus'.In the end, this is the more mature film, the one less anxious to impress you with its cleverness, and more reliant upon old-fashioned craft than an appeal to people's fascination with the genius.  'Good Will Hunting' was too slick in this regard it tried to sell the experience of being brilliant to the envious like a seat on a carnival ride.  And it appeared elitist.For me, when the visual aspects of craft are executed this well, and the story is at least average, a movie is certainly worth seeing--more than once.This is one for DVD.

Not theatre, or literature, bucolic paintings, or sculpture. Music. As far as film is concerned, one might predict that nothing could match the emotional resonance that Beethoven sonatas and opera inspire. That directors/writers should be unable to rise to the awesomeness of Beethoven's melody and harmonics, if it weren't for one thing.Images. Bernard Rose is a very good writer, and when his climax plays out to the soaring accompaniment of the 'Ode to Joy' sopranos, I felt as though one of Beethoven's equals had made a legitimate comment on that galaxy of sound. I won't describe it, 'cause I'm using language, which wouldn't do it justice.Great cinema has rarely been distinguished on the basis of dialogue, which could never be juxtaposed to the work of a great composer, because it is too narrowly defined, too political. Dialogue is useful for advancing plot, images are about theme. Dialogue was essential in the halcyon days of the theatre when the narrative was limited to a stage in a theatre, with the inherent boundaries on visual storytelling. The difference in expounding a theme through dialogue, or through image is the same as explaining something through principle or example. Postulate or proof.Anyway, if I've been too glowing, then I would like to suggest something. Anyone who watches Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' and Rose's 'Immortal Beloved' in rough proximity to one another is going to learn a lot about composition. Kubrick's movie isn't about the 18th century, it IS the 18th century. However, the great adapter (Kubrick) was remixing somebody else's dream (Thackeray) in Barry Lyndon, whereas Bernard Rose has given us something else again.10/10 "},{"Title":"kinda interesting","Date":"2 March 1999","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  Upon the death of Beethoven, a friend, and executor of his will, sets out to track down the Beethoven's beneficiary, identified only as his Immortal Beloved.

There are fantastic visuals, great actors, great music and a plot line to hold it all together. So where did it all go wrong? I suspect that some compromises had to be made for the mass-market. In general the way Beethoven's music was used for the the score was badly done. Hearing snippets of his piano-concertos used as background seemed a little unfortunate. The emotional impact of the pieces is lost if the attention of the viewer is focused elsewhere. There are exceptions to this, the scene floating in the water for example. But there is so much more to Beethoven than symphonies 5 & 9. To people unfamiliar with his music, the film will provide an introduction of sorts and the music will still provide some impact.

Sadly, the story is sloppily told and relies too much on its inherent drama to develop interest instead of developing its characters. The only character with any real development is Beethoven - the rest of the cast is terribly misused and marginalized. Krabbe's character could have been interesting - but was relegated to milquetoast for the purposes of the story. He's not a bad actor, but the portrayal is so flat that you have to blame the director for not giving him any direction. I could say much the same thing for anyone not named Oldman.There are some nice touches, few of which have anything to do with the rest of the movie - like Bonaparte's assault on Vienna or the late No. 9 scene (which could be a nice piece by itself, but somehow ended up in this movie).The movie starts out well enough and manages to be interesting up until the pianoforte scene. After this, however, the story is drained of all tension and interest. I love Isabella Rossellini, so her scenes have her redeeming features, but her character is just a cheat device to tell Beethoven's life story without actually having to make it into a story.There are some real dead spots and most of them come in the second half. Curiously, this is where many of the best scenes are, which can only lead me to believe that much of the movie was inexpertly sculpted around a few key moments and it was hoped that these would be enough.

This is not a work of genius, instead a very expert construction using the standard filmmaker's playbook.It has the by now canonical Wellesian construction. It contains lush photography, some lovely women, passion, the passionate music leading through a maze of lust. It contains a great actor.But that photography has neither style nor passion itself. It mistakes passion in music for some sort of soap operaish angst -- it in fact employs the cinematic device of showing the depth of music through the mooneyed swooning of superficial women. Alas, this joins other examples where films about other arts somehow forget about the soul of those arts. So we have films about writing, dance, music, math, chess which have nothing to do with the essence of those things. ter Seege was in Altman's van Gogh which DID understand painting and was itself painterly. This film has music in it, but it is most unmusical. Rather like a wellmade musicbox.And then we have Oldman. Oldman himself is a passionate performer, but we end up watching Oldman's passion and not Ludwig's. This is an oversight of a weak director I think, but only could have been avoided in the casting. Oldman has such flourish, such flash in his work that he can only effectively play characters who are performers themselves, like the smarmy republican in `Contender.'So what we end up with is a crisp confection, with no soul. I suppose people who like music (but don't understand the danger of real music) will probably like it. Try `Hilary and Jackie' for a mainstream film about music, which does have soul, where all the acting is invested in the characters not the applause, where the story is actually more true, and where the passion of music is shown more aptly.

It's just that Salieri never said that.Mozart's only flaws were remarkably similar to those of a later, great U.S. President, William Jefferson Clinton those of the flesh...and let's face i if you are NOT a Repressed Republican...WHO CARES??!

Mozart is for women and more enlightened guys, like Venus (or Dionysus...or for compulsive gamblers!).Wolfi...you were SO right about that dolt, Ludwig!
