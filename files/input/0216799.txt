To my surprise, the Harrison flowers turned out to be very accurate in portraying what it was like. The details, such as locations, army uniforms and equipment, names, places, scenes and the geographic and historic facts, are pretty much all spot-on true. There are few barely noticeable mistakes, but it'd be nitpicking on my behalf even mentioning them. So, to anyone interested in seeing what the end 20th centuries warfare really looks like, I highly recommend it. It's miles ahead of Holywoods cheezy Rambo-style war movies and by it's ruthless realism it really is a visual kick in the gut.As for the plot - the love story that serves as a guideline seems pretty much unnecessary and hard to believe. It has occurred to me that it'd be far more believable if Andie MacDowel was the photojournalist lost in the war-zone and her husband goes to get her out, not the other way around. So, those looking for a warm love tale, this will hardly be the best choice. Those interested in seeing the insanity of the easter-Europe 1991. war conflict, the cruelty and danger of modern photojournalism - I can hardly think of anything better than this.

I don't recall it getting a cinema release here in the UK - but caught up with it on DVD.The 'hook' of the story is that Sarah Lloyd (Andie MacDowell) travels to Croatia in 1991 to try to find and rescue her husband Harrison, a prize-winning journalist who is missing, presumed killed. (The flowers of the title are those in his greenhouse - tended in his absence by their young son). It's a contrivance - indeed, because we don't see the characters together for long, it's difficult to invest much in their relationship - but functions as the plot mechanism (however creaky) to get the heroine away from her safe life in the US into the war zone, where her adventures really start. So it's essentially a classic quest-and-rescue narrative - unusually, with a woman doing the seeking. (Hence, I suspect, some of the criticisms about Sarah's search risking orphaning her children; I'm not sure this would be raised if the sexes of missing person and seeker were reversed.)The film does not glamourise the realities of late 20C Balkan warfare, graphically depicting the atrocities perpetrated by all sides in the wars which engulfed the former Yugoslavia. The story reaches its dramatic climax with the siege of Vukovar. Adrien Brody gives an outstanding performance as the bitter, troubled but brave young front-line photojournalist Kyle Morris. Like many in his profession, Kyle takes drugs and swears like a trooper - but he also has courage, integrity, and the face of an El Greco saint. He is the real hero of the story, and Brody, a truly remarkable actor, comes to dominate the film. Brendan Gleeson is also excellent as his older colleague, Stevenson. It is refreshing, too, to see Andie MacDowell in a role in which she is not simply eye-candy/cute chick-flick heroine. The fact that Sarah is not always likable is one of the strengths of the film, and surely a sign that it is a European production Hollywood films seem too hamstrung at times by worrying about making their protagonists 'likable' - flawed, difficult characters are more human and more interesting. Gerard Butler and Alun Armstrong, among others, provide good support.As to whether Sarah finds Harrison, or if she and her friends make it home in one piece - I'm not saying see the film! All I will say is, it did not turn out how I had expected, and my h/c complex kicked in significantly at one point.On DVD, get the French 2-disc Special Edition if you can. There are deleted scenes (mainly Sarah and Harrison, family and friends in the US), cast interviews, a digital effects feature, theme song video, & c.. Sadly, the only UK release was a single disc with just a trailer. One of the deleted scenes addresses an issue which concerned some reviewers - Sarah's guilt-feelings about leaving her children. The interview with Adrien Brody (looking very handsome) is interesting he discusses how he sees Kyle's relationship with Sarah, and also how he drew on his photographer mother's colleagues in portraying the character.

While some may feel that the premise of the story is rather lame and confabulated, it serves a purpose. To show the human side of the photo journalists who bring the horrors of the world to those of us who, as they noted in the movie, are just worried about getting a parking ticket.Too often when we non-journalists see photos of war zones we are horrified and, at the same time, we are dumbfounded as to how someone could be so inhuman and unfeeling as to photograph such graphic examples of man's inhumanity to man. Harrison's Flowers is excellent at showing us that just as a reader we can't stop looking at the horror even though we are revolted, the journalist cannot stop photographing and documenting it even though the human side of them is revolted as well. As for Andie MacDowell's so-called wooden performance, one must remember that in this film she is seeing her husband's and his colleagues' world through their eyes for the first time. How quickly would any of us be able to break out of our shock-like trance and be totally outraged or emotional if this were the first time we were seeing it? Even the veteran photo journalist portrayed by Brendan Gleeson was paralyzed with shock more than once in the film. Andie MacDowell's character came from such an insulated world that seemingly emotionless shock was the perfect way to portray Sarah, who simply cannot fathom what she sees unfolding around her.Harrison's Flowers is an excellent portrayal of the Serbo-Croatian hell that descended upon that part of Europe and irreparably tore apart the life of anyone in its path.

I only suspect that much of the press was based on the fact that it came out only a couple of years after the end of that terrible war in Bosnia. Just as in Welcome this film also depicts the life of journalists, trying to understand and convey the happenings in a country once believed to be almost western. (Which, I suspect, is the reason that it had such an impact on the western psyche.) As everbody else has pointed out this is where the best characters are found, especially Adrian Brodys character.Several others have already pointed out that the main story revolving around a lost love and an heroic wife trying to save her husband is really awkward. But since you need somekind of story, that might just as well be it. I saw this film a second time just recently and actually managed to ignore the plot and focuse on the description of the madness that was eastern Croatia in the early 1990Â´s. This film has an incredible feeling, the settings, the photography and the score makes it come really close to being in an actual war. I cant really praise this enough. Compared to Welcome this film hits you in the guts as it shows the brutality of urban warfare and the senseless killings that occur in all wars.Other films about Bosnia that are recommended if you like this one, No mans land, Pretty Village, Pretty fire and Savior. And why not give Welcome a chance too.

However, to get an accurate picture of the war between Yugoslavia and Croatia, Harrison's Flowers is not suited. Those familiar with the history of the former Yugoslavia know that war crimes took place in and around Vukovar, and in 1991-92, Serbian nationalist paramilitaries of Arkan were responsible for heinous crimes. However, the movie is very one-sided, and Serbians are presented as half-drunk criminal villains while Croatians get the image of brave freedom fighters. In fact, the vast majority of movies portray Serbians as the villains, but I would claim that Croatians are maybe even more nationalistic than the Serbs. Those who watch the movie should know that Croatians were also responsible for killing civilians, especially during Operation Storm in 1995.I have gained operational experience myself as a war correspondent, and I know what is like to be under fire from mortars, artillery and snipers. Therefore I was very surprised to see how the reporters and photographers from the movie entered Vukovar wearing military camouflages trying to hide from snipers. I don't know any reporters who would do it like this because it makes you a legitimate target, and I doubt experienced reporters from Newsweek would do it like that. The goal of a journalist in a war area is to be seen. Yes, sometimes you have to avoid checkpoints to get to the other side, but to wear a military uniform is very, very stupid.Now it has been a couple of days since I wrote my review, and there was another thing that bothered me in this movie. Sarah lands in the city of Graz in Austria making her way all through Croatia to get to Vukovar. If she really wanted to save her husband, it would have been a lot easier to get to Belgrade. From Belgrade there is only a two-hour drive to Vukovar, and the city was controlled by the Serbs at this point. I just spoke to a friend of mine who was an officer in Vukovar, and he said it would have been no problem for the character in the movie to get to Vukovar. Even if there were some paramilitaries present, the Yugoslav army, JNA, was in control.For more about the Battle of Vukovar, Wikipedia has an interesting article, http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vukovar "},{"Title":"Andie MacDowell in a warmovie ?

However, if you want comments, then consider these While the movie does have a love story plot (wife tries to find husband in war-torn Eastern Europe), the presentation of the war scenes within the movie are phenomenal, giving it a Saving Private Ryan feeling.As Sara (the wife) and the photographers look for Harrison Lloyd, not only do you see how far a wife will go in order to find her husband, but you also witness just how far photojournalists will go in order to save their own.And if you ask me, the Hollywood Ending was absolutely necessary in order to justify showing the rest of the grim war scenes throughout the movie (they can be disturbing, but they aren't gory).  Had the movie ended any other way, I think that the majority of the viewers would feel extremely depressed after sitting through a two-hour movie.Definitely a great movie!

Here's the plan--the first time through, watch all of it.  But on subsequent viewings, just watch the stuff that happens in Yugoslavia. Except for the men's room scene after the Awards Banquet.This movie is really, really frustrating to watch because you can't help but feel that the directors and other creative parties associated with the actual film were very dedicated to telling the story of the journalists and photographers who were trying to bring the truth of what was happening in the early days of the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia to the screen.  They were fascinated by the people who would willingly risk their lives to obtain images of the horrors and atrocities being carried out to the rest of the world, and what motivated them--made them tick.  And they were enamoured of the character of Kyle Morris, as portrayed by Adrien Brody, and wished to showcase him in some way in order to drive the point home--that people like him were brave and admirable, no matter what their personal demons and failings.Unfortunately for those of us who were hooked on this POV, they were also hamstrung, utterly, by the source material, which was a love story about a woman who would not believe her husband was dead, and whose dedication to finding him and whose devotion to him was convincing enough to cause persons such as are described in the preceding paragraph to risk life and limb to try to reunite this couple.I don't want to use this space to snark.  It's unseemly, given the seriousness of the subject matter.  What I want to highlight is the way in which one of the performances affected me.  The central figure of this movie from a standpoint of character arc is not Harrison, or his wife, Sarah, but Kyle Morris.  We first see Kyle at a Pulitzer Awards dinner, where a grief-stricken, coke-addled Kyle Morris goes off on the Harrison Lloyd character. It's a show-stopper, and drenches everything else that happens in Yugoslavia with layers and layers of bitter irony. The great stuff in this is movie is all about Adrien Brody's character Kyle Morris. This is probably the sort of character that a young actor just dreams of getting his teeth into. Kyle is one of those bundles of contradictions and contrasts that fascinates endlessly. He is an angry, foul-mouthed swaggerer with the gentle hands and soul of a poet, and a kind heart too easily touched. He is a drug user, which is usually portrayed as a character defect which goes along with being weak or afraid to face reality, but in his case, it is probably more a result of his trying to cope with having too MUCH courage and desire to walk into the bowels of real-life hells, like war-torn Yugoslavia. He is both cocksure and certain, and insecure, terrified he will never get recognized for what he is doing in trying to record the truth. He takes rebellious pride in being an outsider, but he churns with jealous resentment against those who seem to have made it. This character is BRAVE, quick, resourceful, clever, with a crackling energy that suffuses every line, every expression, every move he makes. Brody brings a wild animal's instinctive quickness and 360 degree awareness of the environment to the role; you can almost see his large but sensitive nostrils quiver as he tests the wind for the scent of danger, and the way to safety. If I were going deep into the heart of the battle zone with nothing more than a camera bag and a sense of purpose, I would want no one else to take me there. When he wraps his arm around Sarah, and tells her to move, she obeys. I would, too. He seems to be tapped in to the undercurrents that flow beneath the reality that they see and hear around them, and sense shifts in the flow and direction that the others cannot, and acts on a combination of instinct and intelligence to get Sarah into a city which has become a charnel house where no badge or profession is respected or spared from the snipers and the bayonets.I was fascinated by this character. It was the sort of portrayal that made one want to know more--what drives someone like that? What was his childhood like? Why did he risk all for someone like Sarah?Unfortunately, this portrayal and character threw the whole film off-balance, and made the putative heroine seem self-absorbed and unlikable in the end. I recommend this movie for the brilliant footage of the journalists and Sarah working their way through war-torn Yugoslavia, for the harrowing urban combat scenes, and for Brody's performance.I can't, however, give it more than 8 stars, since it committed the primary infraction of rendering its heroine unlikable in certain ways, without redemption or the change brought about by a true character arc.Also, Harrison and Sarah's son was sort of creepy.  Sorry, but there it is.

On one hand, the performances by Andie MacDowell and Adrian Brody are very good, maybe even Oscar quality, and the cinematography is truly excellent, capturing the horror that was Yugoslavia.

Second, it is VERY unlikely that anyone as naive as she is could make it through to Vodrosnik, regardless of who was helping.  Third, the opening scenes in New York/New Jersey are not very watchable, with most of the actors trying too hard.  It has a Lifetime movie feel to it.  Once the film gets to Europe, however, a different sensibility takes over and it becomes riveting cinema, if you can suspend your disbelief of the general concept.

She has consistently proven her inability to pull off even the simplest of dramatic performances. It is, at times, excruciating to watch her fail.

Those aren't exactly strong reasons why I shouldn't miss it and yet I was willing to give it a try, probably because I hoped to be surprised by it. And that's exactly what it did.Harrison Lloyd is a photojournalist who has already won a Pulitzer price with his photographs of several wars. But he now has a wife and two children and he doesn't want to go to another war-zone anymore, because he is afraid that he might die while doing his job. He wants to change jobs, but his boss has given him one last assignment. He'll have to travel to ex-Yugoslavia, where the civil war has just started. What appears to be a small incident at first, quickly proves to be one of the most gruesome wars in recent history and it doesn't take long before Harrison is missing, presumably dead. But his wife Sarah refuses to believe that he's no longer alive and decides to go after him and to look for him. As she penetrates deeper into the war zone, she is confronted with all the horrors that were committed in this war random executions of soldiers and civilians, rape, snipers, the uncertainty of where and who the enemy is,...At first I must say that I didn't like this movie all too much. This seemed to be like yet another Hollywood product about a perfect and happy family who is all a sudden thorn apart by some unfortunate event, who learns to deal with the pain, building up a new life without the missing person and so on, and so on. Nothing new, nothing special. But then it all started to change... a lot. As soon as she is in ex-Yugoslavia, being confronted with all the horrors of that civil war, it was as if I was struck by lightening. Never have I seen so much realistic images in a movie about this war. This started to feel more like a documentary, rather than like a movie. It was all so incredibly realistic and I can't say that they have left anything out. Young children murdered and raped; soldiers and civilians, man and woman, old and young,... executed in front of your eyes; all the explosions and the attacks;... It seems like you're all witnessing it live, as if you are seeing it through the eyes and the lenses of the photojournalists yourself. It was incredible...The performances in this movie are more than OK and Andie MacDowell was a pleasant surprise in this one, although I must say that I liked her performance a lot more once she was the journalist in ex-Yugoslavia. Before that I sometimes found her acting a bit too much and quite unrealistic (take for instance the several scenes in which she is constantly falling when she hears bad news). I didn't really have the feeling that the wife of a war photographer, who constantly lives with this kind of uncertainty, would act and react the way she did. But as I said before, I forgot about that as soon as she was in Europe. However, the best performances in my opinion were those of Adrien Brody - who was excellent as the drug using, alcohol abusing and cynical Kyle Morris - and Brendan Gleeson as Marc Stevenson.In the end this is a very fine movie about the Yugoslavian civil war. It's too bad that the first part of the movie didn't convince me all that much, because in my opinion it wasn't all that strong, but overall I really liked what I saw. That's why I give this movie a well-deserved 7.5/10.

The cast, leaded by Andie MacDowell, Adrien Brody and David Strathairn, is excellent and the unknown (at least for me) director Elie Chouraqui offers a very realistic great production. The story is not corny, and the crazy and sensitive search of Sarah is very touching. I highly recommend this film for any audience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil) `O Resgate de Harrison'  (`The Rescue of Harrison')  "},{"Title":"Skip the mushy love stuff...brilliant and realistic hardcore war atrocity film like 'Salvador'","Date":"30 May 2002","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  Forget about all the love stuff...rather thin love story at the most. This movie really shines in the portrayal of the Yugoslavian war. Genocide, nowadays eufemistically named 'ethnic cleansing' (I spit on those two words; only a politician could have used the word 'cleansing' as a substitute for 'mass murder') is very realistically portrayed in this movie. War doesn't get any dirtier than this. The movie focuses however neither on the victims nor the butchers, and in fact makes very little effort to which side is 'the good side'. This is very close to the actual truth, which is that there was no good side. In war there are only two sides The people with the guns doing the killing and the people who want to live in peace who take care of the dying part. This movie focuses on two things; the journalists and the victims. The very natural and realistic acting results in three real, lifelike journalists, much more down to earth than the ones in 'Salvador'(1986) and closer but still better than the ones in 'the killing fields'. There are times when you can almost see them s****ing in their pants out of fear.Only Andy MacDowell character is truly unrealistic in her fanatical search for her lover and should have been shot halfway the movie if she was to have any realism about her. Sorry.Because the journalists are all such real persons the whole movie gets a new kind of realism. Strong acting and grim settings are combined to create a true and realistic atmosphere of desperation, hopelessness and grim determination in the whole of the war zone scenes. Only a few war movies succeed in coming close to showing the truth about war It's mindless, senseless, immoral, clinical, and chaotic way of destroying everything and everyone in it's path, without remorse, pity or hesitation.In the past few years movies are getting better in portraying the true face of war. 'The thin red line' , 'Saving private Ryan' and 'Enemy at the gates' spring to mind. Of pre-1980 movies most american war movies are basically gung-ho crap. Notable exception is 'Go tell the Spartans' (1978) with Burt Lancaster. Remember to watch 'the killing fields' and 'Salvador', as they both center on journalists, just like in this movie.I gave this movie an 8. It would have gotten better if the love story part would have been anywhere near as realistic as the war stuff. But you can't blame the director for skipping on that to concentrate on the realism in the war stuff. It's to his merit that he knew his priorities.PS bad acting by Andy MacDowell. This movie would have been better with a capable but lesser well known actrice in her part. Now her bigger-than-life 'Hollywoodian' image conflicts with the role she is playing, and sharply contrasts with the brilliantly presented, down to earth journalists. She is too unrealistic as a character to play in such a realistic film.

It gives no clue as to what we are about to witness once the heroine decides to trace the whereabouts of her journalist husband in war-torn Yugoslavia, circa 1991.The idea that a loving wife would put herself and everyone else around her in constant danger in the midst of a savage civil war raging all around them, in order to reach the side of the husband everyone tells her is dead, is even more ludicrous on film than it is in the pages of a script. Nor is it helped by the disturbing performance of Andie MacDowell who puts herself in the kind of situations that would turn a normal person into a basket case, but plods on determined to find the missing husband.To make matters worse, her missing hubby is played by David Straithairn, an actor with all the charisma of a wet mop, who has been neglecting his wife and children due to the pressures of his job as a photojournalist for Newsweek. His wife seems oblivious to the danger she heads for, even after a traveling companion is abruptly shot in the head by Croatian soldiers. A more compelling actor cast as the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist might have made MacDowell's mission more credible.Given short shrift are actors in the supporting cast, with the exception of Adrien Brody as a scruffy looking coke-sniffing hipster who is so sorry that he dissed her husband at a social event that he is willing to make up for it by escorting her through battle zones. He uses the f word as an expletive every time he utters a thought. At one point, asked to explain his actions, he says cynically I always wanted to be a boy scout. But short shrift is indeed the fate of Diane Baker as MacDowell's mother and Gerard Butler in a brief supporting role that has no function at all in the plot. No wonder Butler, who had only a few good supporting roles before his stint as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, was so little known to most film fans.The war zone scenes are gripping and powerfully filmed, but the slim love story that holds all the threads together is a weak one and most of the scenes leading up to the street battles are so poorly paced that tedium sets in and never quite lets up.All of it is handsomely photographed but it seems like so much care was wasted on a story that limps to a less than satisfying conclusion.

Sarah (Andie MacDowell) has suddenly mustered the inconceivable courage to track down her husband, Harrison, who is presumed to be dead in Yugoslavia. Harrison raises flowers, but Harrison is out of touch with his son. We know this because, until a final predictable moment, his son (a thankless role given to Scott Anton)just sits around staring at his busy dad like a forlorn puppy. Harrison is brave, but he has lost touch with his inner man.But Sarah stands by her man &#150; big time. So big in fact that she practically becomes Bruce Willis, except that off the set Andie MacDowell has two personal assistants and two hairdressers (Bruce Willis probably does too for that matter). Not that that should matter to the reality of the movie, of course. But the explosions, atrocities, emotion devastation, snipers, rapes, murder, and bad driving do occur, somehow seem just a bit beyond the ability of the average housewife to contend with. And how DID she know where her husband was anyway? I won't give a way whether she finds him or not. Let's just say there are forces at work here bigger than you and me. I don't mean to pick on an otherwise serious movie filled with important issues and concerns. But beneath the gritty realism and jolting camera work is a tawdry and predictable, implausible and manipulative melodrama. McDowell does her best with a poorly written character. The other actors don't fair as well. Elias Koteas as Yeager, the drug addled &#145;second tier photographer who transforms into a hero' is so overplayed as to appear truly ridiculous. The wonderful Irish actor Brendan Gleeson as Stevenson fairs a bit better with the clichÃ© riddled script. As Harrison, David Strathairn - who is always a credible and earnest performer - is reduced to the most maudlin lines that finally topple the film.At one point the four stalwart comrades need to cross a line of rough and brutal Serb soldiers. They decide just to act casual and ridiculous and they might get through. Yeager says, `It's stupid but it just might work'. The same could be said for this earnest and implausible movie. Predictably for our heroes, it does work; unfortunately for the movie, it doesn't.

My husband, accustomed to seeing him as bad guys in DOLORES CLAIBORNE and others, found it refreshing to see Strathairn in a sympathetic role for a change), who's a prize-winning photojournalist on one last job for Newsweek.  Brody's Kyle is a fascinating bundle of contradictions, in a realistic way.  (For one thing, it's kind of refreshing to see that Kyle is not immediately vilified for abusing cocaine at one point in the film -- although my smart-aleck hubby couldn't resist a wisecrack about the amount of coke needed to fill a nose like Brody's! Men! -)  As a mom, I was troubled that Sarah was willing to leave her two children at the drop of a hat to go to Croatia to look for Harrison.  Yeah, she left the kiddies with her mom (always nice to see 1960s fave Diane Baker get work), but what if Harrison was indeed dead and then Sarah went and got herself killed, too?  I can hear the kids now `So we're orphans because Mom loved Dad so much she went off to the war zone herself instead of getting the Red Cross or something to help her find him? Thanks for nothing, Mom!'  (BTW, HARRISON'S FLOWERS is the second film in a row -- after BREAD AND ROSES -- in which Adrien Brody sports bedhead and a beard, lending him a cuddly look even in his most intense moments, IMO.

Set in contemporary Yugoslavia (I can't keep track), it is basically about war journalists covering the conflict. A lot better than Welcome To Sarajevo, a lot more realistic than Salvador, I was surprised not to have heard of this movie. Because of dramatic reasons, it has to have a narrative of Andie McDowell trying to find her husband, who has gone missing and has been declared dead. As opposed to Saving Private Ryan, it isn't too far fetched and actually works, because it gives the movie direction and resolution. Otherwise, this movie would just be a litany of war crimes. Unlike many comments here, I think Andie McDowell did a really good job, portraying a woman who is determined, but at the same time still sensitive and feminine. David Strathairn gives a great performance too. I last remember seeing him in a more comedic role as Whistler in Sneekers. Great acting, as well as nice acting from the supporting actor Elias Koteas (The Prophecy). However, the little boy Cesar had me going 'aaaargh...' because of his creepy, smug look I'm on film smile/smirk he doesn't let go of through the entire movie.

She's not prepared for what she sees when she gets there.This is a good movie about a heroic, determined woman, and what she has to endure to find her husband. The depiction of the warring factions and photojournalists is highly inaccurate, though the actual scenarios of death, bombings, and shootings are probably right for any war.I didn't mind Andie MacDowell as much as some, presuming that any woman thrown into this kind of situation is going to experience some kind of traumatic shock - heavy emoting would probably be inappropriate. Nevertheless, she doesn't have much presence. Adrien Brody is excellent as Kyle, and David Strathairn is wonderful as Harrison. The flowers analogy is quite moving - Harrison is depicted as a gentle man who has a greenhouse, and in his absence, their son works in it. The flowers become a symbol of hope.With some research for accuracy and the casting of a stronger actress, someone like Michelle Pfeiffer, perhaps, this film could have been much better.

Together with three other friends-reporters (one of them is another Pulitzer prize), she gets inside Vukovar exactly during the final Serbian army assault and, while Serbs are  massacring and raping everyone all around (her friends-reporter taking picture in the meanwhile of  these super-cruel facts), she gets inside the city Hospital well in the middle of a bombing. Of course, she finds her husband and saves him. I think that this movie should not deserve any comment. The story is mostly unrealistic and some times absolutely ridiculous. But beyond this, the movie is also actually inciting to hate. So something must be said. Every time Serbs appear, they  always do a lot of extremely nasty things, while our brave quartet, during its journey towards Vukovar, passes several time through a benign, or at least not malign, Croatian army (the one with the red and white chessboard flag). This manicheistic  vision, Serbs are the bad guys and Croatians are the good guys, reflects the West version of the conflict. Indeed Serbs were responsible for terrible massacres, including in Vukovar where they were accused to take away and kill more than 200 people from the city hospital, but  Croatians were also accused of mass killings (e.g. , the facts  of Paulin Dvor  and Gospic in the same year of Vukovar, 1991).For people interested in the Yugoslavian conflict, I suggest to avoid this and watch instead two great movies, namely Vukovar by Boro Draskovic, and Bure baruta by Goran Paskaljevic and the  good movie No man's land by Danis Tanovic.  The first two are from Republic of Yugoslavia while the third is a French-Bosniac coproduction.

Amidst the current abundance of war movies (Hart's War, We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk Down), this film reminds us that soldiers aren't the only ones that go to war. It paints journalists as warriors with cameras instead of guns.  They, too, often they are casualties of war.The mortality rate among journalists is high. The International Federation of Journalists reports a total of 91 journalists killed in 2001, and at least eight have been killed in Afghanistan.This is the premise upon which Harrison's Flowers is based.  The film is a love story set against the backdrop of the 1991 war in the former Yugoslavia.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the premise.The film opens with Pulitzer prize-winning Newsweek photojournalist Harrison Lloyd (David Strathairn) returning home from an assignment in Africa.  In the opening few minutes Harrison appears rough-housing with his two children, is captivated by a television news report from Africa, tends flowers in his greenhouse, and presents an award to colleague Yeager Pollack (Elias Koteas) at a Pulitzer awards ceremony.Yet, Harrison is not content.  He's dissatisfied with his distant relationship with his son Cesar (Scott Anton) and he tells his editor, Samuel Brubeck (Alun Armstrong), that he's giving it up.  `I never used to get clammy hands, and I wasn't afraid of anything.  All I can think about now is Sarah and the kids.'  At the request of Brubeck, Harrison agrees to stay on a while longer.At the awards ceremony, a bitter, foul-mouthed, drug-using Kyle Morris (Adrien Brody) confronts Harrison in the men's room.  Morris explains that his colleague, `a tiny little photographer in a tiny little country with a tiny little war' was recently killed overseas while `you are giving each other awards.'When a conflict breaks out in Yugoslavia, Brubeck asks Harrison to go for what is to be a one-week assignment, introducing the viewer to a war we never fully understood and that we would rather forget.  The film taps into that when while watching the first footage from Yugoslavia, the newsroom staff misunderstands the conflict.  `It's just an ethnic skirmish,' Brubeck remarks.Brubeck later informs Harrison's wife, Sarah (Andie MacDowell), that he has apparently been killed when a home he was in collapsed.  `We were wrong,' he admits.  `It's not just skirmishes.  It's a filthy war.  We were all wrong.'Sarah, however, refuses to believe her husband is dead.  `Something would have broken inside if he were dead,' she tells her brother.  Becoming self-absorbed, and ignoring her children, she sets up camp, living and sleeping in front of two television sets hoping for help from the footage. It is there, during a news report, that she thinks she sees Harrison among a group of refugees headed toward Vukovar.Leaving the children in the care of her mother, she heads to the war-torn country, picking up a Croatian hitchhiker heading home to his wife and child on the way.  Shortly after they cross the border, she receives a brutal introduction to war. Their car is shelled, the Croatian student is killed, and Sarah is nearly raped by a band of Serbian rebels.  Here the focus of the story shifts to an action film, with Sarah saying little.The film makes it virtually impossible to distinguish between one side or another in the conflict, suggesting there is little difference between the two.  After being rescued by a TV crew, she is introduced to Morris.  He tells her, `You can't stay in this country.  No one knows what this country is.Serbian, Catholic, Croatian, Orthodox. there's no bad guys, there's no good guys.  They'll shoot you first and think about it later.  This is no place for the living.'  In doing so, the film attempts not to take sides. Yet, the gruesome atrocities which are apparent at their every turn makes everyone in the film seem like a `bad guy.'Sarah will not take `no' for an answer.  This sets up a series of narrow escapes as Morris, Sarah, and Marc Stevenson (Brendan Gleeson) make their way toward Vukovar, where the fighting is fiercest.  At one point with tanks rolling toward their car and shells flying, even the optimist Morris admits, `We're dead.'  In the next scene they're shown driving the car, with never any indication of how they made it out.  Such scenes make the film seem both unrealistic and unbelievable.In yet another unrealistic scene, the four don camouflage to hide from and outrun Serbian snipers.  When they finally reach Vukovar, Pollack explains, `It wasn't fighting that was going on, but extermination.'  While everyone around them is being massacred, the journalists wave their cameras like passports, and endure one casualty as they make their way to the hospital.The film is one of contrasts.  On one hand we are treated to the atrocities of a civil war.  Yet, amidst it all is a woman who will seemingly stop at nothing for her husband.  Unfortunately, it's less than convincing and not worth spending $8 to see.The film tries too quickly to establish a loving relationship between Harrison and Sarah.  In the only way that Hollywood seems capable of portraying intimacy, Harrison and Sarah make love.  However, in the absence of any real communication, the attempt is unsuccessful.  In addition, the viewer fails to truly identify with any of the film's key characters. Lacking that, it is later difficult to become emotionally vested in Sarah's overriding passion in her search for her husband, or Morris' desire to take up her cause.Had the film spent more time up front developing the characters and establishing a truly intimate (emotionally and intellectually, not just physically) relationship between Harrison and Sarah, the rest of the film might have been more believable.Pervasive profanity distracts from the film's dialogue.  It's as if the journalists, faced by the chaos of war, know how to do little else but swear.Co-written by French director Elie Chouraqui and photojournalist Isabel Ellsen, the film accurately captures the realities and dangers of photojournalism.The film also captures the chaos and the gruesome senselessness of war. Fortunately, unlike the Daniel Pearl story, this one has a happier ending.

Yes, Harrison's Flowers gives you the unimaginable hell of modern day civil war right in your face, and minors should stay well away from it, but what the f*** is war anyway? If any one film deserved to come to a screening where I live, it would be Harrison's Flowers, but instead I got to see big buck, sweet ass, easy morals Behind Enemy Lines on the big screen - and to tell you the truth, that just plain sucks! I had to se Harrison's Flowers on DVD, witch isn't half bad, but the 2.351 ratio doesn't quite come to it's right on a small TV set.First of all Harrison's Flowers is a remarkably well told story about photo journalism, all though I doubt it really is as violent an occupation as depicted in this film (although people like Frank Capra prove otherwise). Second, the film paints the violence of the Yugoslav conflicts in a way I find similar to the insane portrayal of Vietnam in Apocalypse Now (although without Lt. Col. Kilgore), and that's pretty good. What can I say? If you plan to see Behind Enemy Lines, don't bother. Rent Harrison's Flowers instead!

This once beautiful and proud city was mercilessly razed to the ground in 1991 by the Yugoslav National Army and their cohorts, the Chetnik irregulars. Chetniks being nothing but lowly murderers of the innocent.Whilst the movie holds the savagery true to life, the story needed more development from the War aspect. I think that some film maker may want to take this subject in and of its own and develop a film about the demolition and siege of the city itself.In the area around Vukovar there were over 600 tanks and armoured carriers, as well as several thousand well-armed Chetniks and mobilized reservists. There were large numbers of all kinds of artillery weapons, the enemy had an abundance of ammunition, and there was no way to stop the Serbian warplanes.On the other side, Vukovar was defended by several hundred Croatian Guardsmen and policemen, as well as about 1000 volunteers with no military experience. The defenders had modest weapons semi-automatic and automatic guns, several machine guns and artillery guns, and some simple armour-piercing weapons. Weapons, food and medical supplies were brought in for a time through a narrow corridor through the maize fields near the villages of Marinci and Bogdanovci.Data of military statistical character help to explain the contribution of Vukovar to the defense of Croatia and illustrate why Vukovar was in the focus of media attention from all over the world and why it is being studied as a special phenomenon by military therorists.About a 1800 defenders took part in the defense of Vukovar while it was under siege. About 60% of these were citizens of Vukovar, while the rest were patriots from other parts of Croatia and from Bosnia and Herzegovina. A third of the defenders managed to break out of Vukovar in small groups, about 500-600 were killed, while the rest were imprisoned or wounded. Fascinating results were achieved in battle using the meagre weapons described above over 300 tanks and armoured carries were destroyed, about 25 warplanes were shot down, while the number of dead Chetniks is estimated at 5000 - 7000, with 20000 - 30000 wounded.Vukovar and the rest of the aggression was Serbia's version of The Final Solution as far as the Croats were concerned. A little known fact about this city is that the Serb had bombarded it with the destructive force of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 19445. Can anyone imagine the destruction?!!!One of the reviewers on the page said Army men don't shoot at the sky when they are working (that is what they do when they're bored). Nobody commits rapes in the streets where soldiers are fighting.  And you know this because you were in this war and have sen the ravages?The Croatians were not angels and I don't approve of any atrocity.  It seems to me that the Serbs always portray themselves as the victims and the angels  when in fact they are the ones who always start up the trouble and never have the balls to finish.  Oh, they are a brave bunch when there is no opposition and when there are only women, children and the elderly opposing them.  When they are met with a real force, they cower and run like the cowards they are.I am rambling. Andie MacDowell did an excellent job. Her acting was superb. Save for some plot holes, it was a good movie.if anyone in Hollywood reads these reviewed, please consider making a complete story of the sad story of Vukovar and her proud and brave defenders.

Andie MacDowell, David Strathairn, Brendan Gleeson, Adrien Brody, Elias Koteas, and all the rest of the cast, are marvelous, of course, and ultimately the way they threw themselves into their characters made the movie what it was--stunning.Harrison's Flowers is not just a love story, a war movie, or a point-blank tragedy neither is it simply an explanation of why photographers aren't as insane as we think. Certainly it contains elements of all those ideas. The incandescent relationship between Harrison and Sarah Lloyd is beautiful in its simplicity, though it is certainly not the main thrust behind the movie, as the title might suggest; war is obviously portrayed as bloody, destructive, and painful; the photographers/photojournalists focused on in the film are gorgeous characters, all with intense motivations and ideas. But Harrison's Flowers goes beyond any of that, becoming--I think--one of the best films ever made about a civilian's perspective towards war. Because it primarily concerns civilians, it doesn't follow along the lines of Behind Enemy Lines or Saving Private Ryan or even The Thin Red Line, which all concern the soldier's perspectives watching your comrades die, following orders or doing the right thing, living as a coward or dying heroically.... No. Harrison's Flowers has nothing to do with fighting for a cause, or with warrior-bonds between men, or even a statement against war. It is a beautiful, graphic, tragic explanation of why photographers and photojournalists do and should continue to do what they do capture the world of war in Kodak, to remind us of it when it is gone, to remind us of destruction in times of peace, to remind us why war between men happens, to remind us of who really suffers during war--not just the soldiers, but the civilians, as well. The film's dedication (to the photographers and journalists who died in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995) reveals this further. If you're anything like me, after seeing this film you'll feel motivated to better the world and reveal evil, not matter if it means starving, freezing with fear, being wounded, and perhaps even dying--like the very, very human photographers and journalists in this film do.

It tells how it really was in the way the Serbs invaded the town and the resistance the Croatian people offered in protecting their town for three months until they were eventually overran. Hopefully this movie will open up people's eyes to this event which was largely ignored around the world at the time it was taking place. The director did a fantastic job in settting the atmosphere and creating realism which really added to the movie. Vukovar was a symbol for the croatian people and their resistance against the advancing Serbian invaders.  By the way, if you were curious to know what the Serb army was singing at the end of the movie it was - bit ce mesa, bit ce mesa, klacemo hrvate (meaning There will be meat, we are slicing up the Croatians!)

In Four   weddings and a funeral I wanted Hugh to dump her. In Sex, lies and   videotapes I knew she was frigid before they told us. It has something   to do with those intense brown eyes being too close together, and her   pent up, whiny angst.    Now she plays a woman so obsessed with finding her (given up for dead   famous war correspondent) husband that she roars off to a war zone   without a backward look at her children. She then allows her husband's   fame to sucker 3 other reporters into acting as protectors and guides,   and when one of them gets killed she watches silently as another   reporter apologizes for the death. She doesn't have a clue that her   irresponsibility is the root of his death.    This is supposed to be a love story but how can one tolerate a love   from a mother who never shows any concern for the consequences to her   children and those around her?    Who needs another soul-less war movie these days anyway. They have so   ground into the dirt the images of hell that they appear dispassionate.   The hell of war is the damage it does to the human soul not just the   damage it does to the body. When you show only the latter you're   showing off technique and side stepping creative bravery. "}]
