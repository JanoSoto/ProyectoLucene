Instead of being a slacker, buddy comedy, it's an action cop film similar to 48 Hours or Beverly Hills Cop. It isn't necessarily bad, but it takes a path I didn't expect. How could you blame me for mistaking it was a straight forward comedy? It's in a four pack that includes all Ice Cube movies, and it stars Mike Epps as well. The same characters that portrayed Craig and Dey Dey are in a movie that is included in a Friday four pack. Can't be that far off.Sadly, it takes the path and cliché of every cop movie out there. There's explosions, swearing, two friends, etc. It gets old very fast. There's not much new or fresh utilized here. If there is a low six star movie rating, this is the one. It's not a five star film, but it's not a seven or eight star film. It's kind of tilting on the edge.Bucum (Cube) is a bounty hunter who's goal is to get money to open his own investigation firm. Reggie (Epps) is a con artist that somehow escaped Bucum's clutches three times. After winning big on the lottery, but losing the ticket in the back of a van with diamonds thieves, Bucum and Reggie have no choice but to work together to get the thieves and retrieve the lottery ticket so Reggie can claim his riches.It reminds me of a film I watched not too long ago called Lottery Ticket that also stars Cube, about a young man trying to survive a weekend with a $370 million lottery ticket the whole neighborhood is aware of. The only difference is the ticket never leaves the man's possession. In this one they need to get it back.The film has frequent chases and action moments, but I find them unappealing and just a little much. I would have liked less of the over exaggerated, played out action sequences and more of the witty dialog. Ice Cube and Mike Epps made a great duo in Next Friday and Friday After Next, and had numerous dialog scenes in the film that were utterly hilarious and clever. This film relies too much on action movie clichés, and a drawn out plot. You know they'll retrieve the ticket, and most likely fight towards the end. The suspense is none.You may say it's my fault for comparing the film too much to Friday, but I'm not analyzing the film based on my first impression. I'm grading on behalf of the film's plot, characters action scenes, and suspense. The film had everyone of those in decent context. But so decent they were forgettable.Starring Ice Cube, Mike Epps, Eva Mendes, Tommy Flanagan, Carmen Chaplin, Valarie Rae Miller, Roger Guenveur Smith, and Anthony Michael Hall.

I bought in on DVD and I have been entertained since. But last night I watched from a more critical stance than usual and found some flaws in this movie that I thought was very good. First of all, I love Ice Cube and what he's done with his career and how he branched off from music to movies. He's one of the few rappers that can hold their own on either side of the camera. He also seems to know his limitations. He enlists others to handle the over-the-top comedy for those qualified. Mike Epps was a very good choice. At times his jokes can fall flat, but the hilarity of his funny moments make up for the missteps.I watched 'All About the Benjamins' last night and I was in stitches laughing at the shower torture scene. I rewinded that bad boy at least five times and watched it again once more before I went to sleep for one more chuckle. Oddly enough, it wasn't Ice Cube, Mike Epps, or even the torture that I found funny. It was the torturee (Julian Ramose played by Roger Guenveur Smith). When he mouthed off at Mike Epps' character (Reggie) I was rolling all over the place uncontrollably. This movie's script could have been better, but I've seen much worse. I was never bored and I will watch this movie many more times in the future. Ice Cube should employ better writers in the future. This could be a gem with smarter dialogue. We watch movies too, you know. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. That one scene getting rewound so much was a HUGE factor. See this if you get a chance.

I'll admit Cube is really showing his talents as an actor, screenwriter, and producer. And, Epps, is real hilarious in this movie. Cubevision projects have been getting better. And, Ice Cube shows a lot more comedic talents than he did in the last two Fridays.  I also like the bad guys, especially the ring leader of the heist.  I feel that this is one of the most plot-driven movies Ice Cube has done since Players Club.  And, if you look hard at All About the Benjamins it's not just an Ice Cube movie.  It's an actor/screenwriter hard at work.  But, only one thing this sounds more like a movie that would be released in the summer, not early spring.

The movie overall though was fairly entertaining. My game ball for best acting goes to Eva Mendes who played Epps' character's girlfriend Gina who wins the lottery at the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately for her, Reggie (Mike Epps) loses the ticket while being chased by Bucum (Ice Cube). It becomes kind of a running gag thorough the movie that he is always looking for his missing lottery ticket. I heard ahead of time that Tommy Flanagan was supposed to play a different kind of tougher villain from Ice Cube, but frankly I was not impressed. With the exception of one scene where he cripples a guy, he didn't seem especially threatening, and his accent was just getting on my nerves. Enclosing, I wouldn't run out and drop $10 to see it immediately, but it's more than entertaining for you and your stoner friends to have a laugh on a Sunday afternoon.

But the other half of the time, I'm exactly right and the movie turns out to be just as bad as I assumed.  This is a case of the latter.  I was looking to be oddly surprised, but unfortunately this clunker is just as lame as it appears in the trailers.  Prior to watching the film, I wasn't aware that Ice Cube co-wrote the script.  After I saw his writing credit, I knew this definitely wasn't going to be topnotch material.  Sure, I liked the first two Friday movies, but they're simply guilty pleasures.  Cube may write some good rap songs, but he could probably never write a quality script.  Also, this is an action movie.  An action/comedy, yes, but comedy is what Cube specializes in.  I'm not going to say it's his forte, because that would put him on parallel with Mel Brooks.  Rappers can barely write comedies; they sure as hell can't write action movies!  I hope and pray to God that Mike Epps doesn't become the next overnight comedy sensation.  After the film came out, I heard people raving about him left and right.  One thing's for sure  he's no, and I repeat NO, Eddie Murphy.  I tolerated him in Next Friday and Bait, and even got a few laughs from him, but now he's really getting at my nerves!  He's filled with comic energy, but he doesn't know where the hell to focus it.  You watch Eddie Murphy's invasion of the redneck bar in 48 Hours and you compare it to any of the low-brow antics Epps pulls off in this movie, and THEN look into my eyes and tell me he's the next Eddie Murphy!  I'll go as far as saying he's the black equivalent of Pauly Shore!  I wonder if he's related to Omar.  If he is, the talent gene sure as hell didn't get passed on to him.  Every one of his lame one-liners mirrors any lines you hear from every other black comic that appears on Comicview or Def Comedy Jam.  Nothing but stale white stereotypes and cheap sex jokes.  I don't detect a lick of intelligence in his humor.  And I'm not saying this because he has such a foul mouth.  Murphy's mouth is ten times filthier than his, but his humor is often at least somewhat intelligent (if you watch the films of his hayday like Coming to America and 48 Hours, and not some of his lame recent work like I Spy and Showtime).          I can't blame Ice Cube much in the acting department.  He's not a bad actor, though certainly not a great one.  However, I do have the right to blame him for the material since he co-wrote the script.  There's even a gag in which two old ladies swear and try to speak ebonics.  That gag is about as moldy as a loaf of bread 3 years past its expiration date.  Old white people acting black  not funny anymore!  Get with the freaking program!  And since there's not much of a casting call for senior citizens, these old-timers will probably accept any role that flies their way.  If that's not taking advantage of the elderly, then I don't know what is.  One of the film's minor saving graces are the appearances by beautiful Hispanic actress Eva Mendez.  I remember her back from Children of the Corn Part 5 which, needless to say, went direct to video.  She seems to be appearing in more mainstream work (i.e.  Training Day and Exit Wounds).  Hopefully, she'll receive much better scripts than these in the near-future.  I don't mean to stereotype, but if there's truth to it, then what the heck am I supposed to do?  Shy away from it for the sake of political correctness?  This movie recycles the same material from almost every predominantly African-American comedy in recent years.  And I'm not insulting Afro-Americans; movies like these are insulting them!  These movies are making us think that only low-brow comedies like this can make black people laugh.  That they can only laugh at jokes involving sex, toilet humor, misogyny or crude racial/ethnic stereotypes.  I'm pretty sure there are blacks out there with a more refined sense of humor, but not too many black movies cater to their kind.

It overextends its constricted script with excessive amounts of strained comedy and hackneyed action, and as a result it winds up sacrificing the proverbial feet of efficient storytelling and character development.Ice Cube (who co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Lang) is Bucum Jackson, a Miami bounty hunter who hopes to someday open his own private investigation agency. (In the meantime, he complains about his low-paying assignments while buying $600 tropical fish.) One of his menial jobs includes relentlessly chasing con man Reggie Wright (Mike Epps). On the same day that Reggie wins a $60 million lottery jackpot, he stumbles upon a combination diamond heist and triple homicide while being pursued through city streets and back alleys. He then leaves his wallet - with the winning ticket inside - in the thieves' van. To compound his misery, he is nabbed the next day by Bucum, who expresses interest in his plight only because he sees dollar signs after hearing about the diamonds.Benjamins is a failure on so many levels. It fails as a comedy, a buddy movie, and an action thriller, and it most definitely fails as quality entertainment, relying heavily on endless chase scenes, Epps' grating slapstick routine, and Cube's scowling facade in order to conceal the numerous absurdities and lack of suspense in the plot. Director Bray uses every means possible to (unsuccessfully) liven up the flat action sequences, such as using over half a dozen edits to show a car smashing through a window and unnecessary freeze-frame whenever someone fires a gun, the latter which causes the film to resemble a bad '70s cop show. The foot chases suffer from a combination of slow motion and weak cinematography; why show characters vaulting over a wall in the exact same manner?I didn't laugh once during the entire picture. The film's idea of jocularity consists of people aggravating a gunshot wound with a screwdriver, pointing a gun at a kid and activating a taser in a man's crotch, not to mention having two old ladies cussing up a storm and grown men engaging in bouts of unintelligible slang-ridden drivel every five minutes. Epps tries in vain to be knock-down riotous in tiresome scenes such as when Reggie horses around in a Bentley and sings loudly off-key while he imitates smoking a joint.The bad plot spells equally bad performances. Ice Cube has nothing to do here except stare angrily at Epps' overacting in between knocking a few heads. The script is loaded with racist and misogynist stereotypes. In the opening scene, Bucum arrests a redneck bail jumper who has a Confederate flag hanging full-view in his trailer window. The theft ring is led by an abrasive, scar-faced Irishman (Tommy Flanagan) who wears ugly suits and has a thick brogue that becomes a target for parody. At the same time, the N word flies left and right. Meanwhile, Bucum's accomplice Pam (Valarie Rae Miller) and Reggie's girlfriend Gina (Eva Mendes) are unfortunately nothing more than armpieces in skimpy outfits who spend time looking offended at their partners' actions.It's appropriate that a boat storage warehouse plays a significant role in this movie that ends up sinking in an ocean of implausibility. For instance, would a street-smart bail enforcement agent actually team up with an uncooperative loon who deems it necessary to act like a goofball while being pursued by killers? When a handcuffed Reggie falls forward off the top of a boat, he miraculously walks away with both shoulders still intact. After he loses his wallet, he's distressed more about his missing lottery ticket than the fact that the thieves have access to his name and address. Reggie and Bucum get into an altercation in the parking lot of the bad guys' headquarters in a display of sheer incompetence - and in clear view of surveillance cameras. (It also spawns the film's only line that contains a shred of humor You bite my nipple again and I'll kill you!)Benjamins'  greatest sin, however, is that it's a blatant insult to viewers' intelligence that's encased in a box of cheap laughs, due to the fact that it tries to make heroes out of two greedy individuals who commit murder, assault, burglary, and wrongful imprisonment, among other things, in their pursuit of stolen diamonds that don't even belong to them in the first place - and then treats their mission as if they're participating in some great cause. They're no better than the crooks they're trying to outsmart. Even worse, the filmmakers shamelessly want us to empathize with these guys during an obligatory moment in which they spill their deepest feelings to each other during a lull in the action.One of the worst films of the year, All About the Benjamins will appeal to those who have an affinity for movies with appalling storylines chock full of abysmal dialogue and repugnant characters. The rest of the general population will consider the removal of their feet less torturous than subjecting themselves to this refuse. 2/10  "},{"Title":"NO MORE EPPS!!!","Date":"12 April 2002","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  this movie was not as good as expected. why ice cube would do another movie with mike epps is baffling to me. this guy is not at all funny. you would think after next friday flopped, they would have got chris tucker again. which is who everyone wanted to see (including myself). this movie was a money talks rip-off. if you have not yet seen this movie i suggest you wait till it is ava. for rent.

Ice Cube in the lead role proves his action star status and his writing talent(he co-wrote the sciprt.) Mike Epps in the second lead continues to make a name for himself as a very funny comic and sidekick. The very lovely and sexy Eva Mendes is good in her role as Gina and Tommy Flannigan makes a good villain. Kevin Bray who has directed videos for N'Sync , 112 and Jagged Edge makes a good debut with this fun, upbeat action comedy. New Line has a sleeper hit on their hands with one. I give it 5 out of 5 for being a fun flick.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in and got pretty much that.  Not as funny as you'd think, especially from the constant annoyance from Epps, but the movie provides basic entertainment and accomplishes it's goal- obscene, action comedy for a weekend afternoon.  Funniest scene goes to Epps first scene in the convinience store.

Not Flanagan's best nor Ice Cube's.  Mr Epps needs to consider a new career. His one liners weren't worth the effort it took to say them.  Could have been funnier if more effort was spent on comedy but definately doesn't qualify as an action film "}]
