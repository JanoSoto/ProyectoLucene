I missed it during its theatrical release (as so many others did) and had the hardest time finding a copy of it at our local video rental stores.  Not because it wasn't popular but b/c, according to the clerks, people kept stealing or losing their copies...especially around Valentines Day.  When I finally got my hands on a copy I was blown away.  I had thought this was going to be just another in a long link of Pretty in Pinkish movies with predictable characters and a bad case of puppy love, but what I got was a surprisingly refreshing, unconventional story with a complicated and well-developed emotional depth flawlessly captured by the actors and Cameron Crowe.And talk about role reversals!  I'm so used to seeing the man take the assertive and mature role while courting a woman of limited financial or intellectual means...but in this film it's the girl that's got her future together and the guy who's more than willing to concentrate his attention on making her happy.  And Lloyd Dobler isn't just a shiftless man with no future.  He's an eternal optimist who lives in the present and recognizes, admires, and compliments the qualities in Diane that go beyond her amazing intellect.  She becomes his dare-to-be-great situation and his absolute love and devotion to her is anything but unmanly.  The force of it is palatable and immensely erotic without being reduced to cheap teenage lust.  The sight of Lloyd in the shadows defiantly blasting out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one.  It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up.  This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love.

You remember the 80 teen romantic comedy genre. It was a nice idea that became an epidemic, but once and awhile there was a gem like Some Kind of Wonderful. But here is the major difference, the lack of cliche, the lack of formula, the lack of cute dialogue, and saying things without any words. Instead it is said with a look, a touch, a smile, and a tear falling down a face. It allows these talented young actors to _act_!John Cusack plays Lloyd and it is the fact that Lloyd dares to be normal that explains why the film works. Lloyd is just a regular guy who dares to just call the beautiful class brain Diane (Ione Skye) after they graduate. It is the genuine niceness and persistence of Lloyd's phone call, that is responsible for her caving and saying yes. And it goes from there. What is a friendship, a respect for each other, grows into friends with potential, and then goes even farther. Writer-director Cameron Crowe is famous for not pushing it and he perfected that style here. He doesn't try to make John and Ione look and feel hot, he lets them continue to play young adults, who would by all rights still be awkward, nervous, testing the waters of life, love, and trust.In a brilliant parallel, we learn of Diane's relationship with her father Jim (John Mahoney) which she has always been sure of, even when she needed to chose between her parents after their divorce. The subtle and detailed scenes between Diane and Jim are important to the twists in the story when Diane grows to trust someone other than her father and finds deceit with something she had faith in. Jim, is not your typical teen movie father. He's real and normal as well. His car is not backed into a house, he is not thrown into a great body of water, and he is not a typical ogre. He is allowed to be a three dimensional character, a driving force and an obstacle in the teen romance. Jim runs a nursing home and wants the best for Diane. He holds their relationship very dear, as it is all a part of Diane being the best she can be. That desire will end up being a double edged sword as Diane's growing pre-occupation with Lloyd the summer before she is set to go to England, threatens his plans for her. And although Jim seems to respect how Lloyd treats his daughter and him, he is bothered by Lloyd's lack of drive, that the only thing that drives Lloyd is the then almost unheard of sport of kick-boxing and Diane.When the story comes to important moments that changes Jim, Diane, and Lloyd's world, this is when the story shines. This is when Lloyd's rambling and desperation to re-define his life due to his despair is a welcome change from the overbearing or over brooding of most teen flick heroes. This is when Diane's confusion and discovery is so wonderfully done with little dialogue. This is when Jim, feeling his world is spiraling out of his control, grows quiet, and the power of un-showy direction from Crowe says all we need to see.The supporting characters as well are gems, who are true supporting characters. Joan Cusack appeared uncredited as Lloyd's single mother sister who, once a blast is now uptight, but is still a supportive guardian for Lloyd. Lloyd's girl friends D.C. and Corey are like salt and pepper for Lloyd. Corey (played by Lili Taylor) is terminally depressed. She previously had attempted suicide due to fellow classmate, Joe, playing with her heart like a yo-yo and is always being the voice of negativity for Lloyd, always telling him what will go wrong, what can't happen, what should happen, and how he is different from Joe. D.C. is practically dwarfed by Corey, never being allowed to talk and never being able to steer Lloyd in a much more sane direction which Lloyd usually discovers on his own anyhow. All of the supporting characters of friends, former classmates, and residents at Jim's nursing home, are important, none are cardboard cut-out cliches. They all have dimension, depth, feeling, and we can understand their motivation, what drives them with carefully crafted scenes and dialogue.When the ending comes, it is the subtle way they foreshadow the future instead of the standard frantic pacing most romantic comedies have when it comes to a conclusion. That in itself pretty much sums up the beauty of the film.It is pure genius, this film is pure genius.

After numerous valiant attempts and apparent successes, the two fall in love; however, while Lloyd is head over heels, Diane seems hesitant to maintain their relationship considering her recent fellowship at an acclaimed university and her father's trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. The romance between Cusack's Lloyd and Skye's Diane, although seemingly coming from out of nowhere, is still palpable and, as far as teen romance is concerned, very believable, and writer-director Cameron Crowe's bizarre and motor-mouthed dialogue perfectly suits the character of Lloydl; however, most of the scenes are stolen by John Cusack in what likely is his best performance to date; he fumbles over his words to accentuate the attitude of his character, and there are other moments when Cusack suddenly becomes the ultimate hero, even more involving than Rocky Balboa or Luke Skywalker at times; through the climax of the film it seems impossible not to root for Cusack, particularly the iconic scene forever cemented in teen movie history in which Lloyd stands outside of Diane's house next to his car, holding a boom box over his head and blasting Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes with a look of desperate heartache and lost pride on his face.

On the surface, this movie would appear to be about high school, or growing up, or the 'loser' guy dares to get the 'winner' girl. This movie is about truthfulness and it's liberating qualities and also about the price one pays for success or greatness.Diane Court is the valedictorian and the most likely to succeed in her high school. Lloyd Dobler is the well-liked underachiever with good character. Lloyd's low-pressure friends accept Diane at a party and she, at last, gets to let her hair down. This launches a romance that Diane's father disdains.Always quick to shower her with praise, encouragements, and gifts Diane's father has visions of her earth-shattering success. On her part, Diane is getting a little self-conscious over her father's incessant chatter about what HE wants her to be.Lloyd's attentions to Diane grow inconvenient to her father perhaps less for his romantic interest, but worse he's diverting her from her greatness. Simultaneously, Lloyd has no outward indicators of achievement. He lacks direction and can't really say what his next moves are. Diane's father's agitation grows when investigators from the IRS launch a criminal investigation of him. The acting in this film is so believable you feel like you are in the movie yourself. John Mahoney (the father)makes this role look so easy and his face conveys every emotion so clearly. John Cusack nails this role as the anxious-to-please, smitten teen with a sincere heart. His dialog sounds very natural. Ione Skye is lucky. Not many female rolls for teenage girls are as juicy as this one no nudity, no ax murderers, and no entering into talent competitions. Additional endorsement I danced with a naval officer from a nuclear sub to the main theme of this film and he immediately asked me if I had seen this film.

How does he do it? Simply by avoiding sappy moments, by creating a script that more or less mirrors the bittersweet experience of first love, and by simply, but tastefully guiding the film's visuals and outstanding acting.Say Anything is not completely anti-conventions, and actually uses some wildly popular rom-com conventions to its advantage, but the role reversal (Dobbler being the 'lost' one), interjection of successfully genuine drama, and simple, understated romantic moments make this a wild success. That's not to say that Crowe isn't successful when he goes for the wildly over-the-top sap, because he knows it's sappy, but it does happen in real life. I mean, the over-the-top gestures like the stereo outside the window do occur in reality, and they guys who do them usually are just like Lloyd Dobbler.Great characters, a great cast, really good writing, and simple but solid direction make this a real winner that is deservedly recognized as a romantic classic.8.5/10 "}{"Title":"I tried desperately hard to like this, but... (possible spoiler)","Date":"26 January 2000","Score":"12 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Like most 80s high school movies, this has sadly, badly dated.  Sadly, because it stars the incomparable John Cusack, the only reason for still watching this, giving a typically rich performance alternating nervy confidence with masked vulnerability.  He plays Lloyd Dobler, an average(ish) high school student who is about to graduate.  He lives with his single mother sister Constance and her young son, while his parents are with the American army in Germany.He is besotted with Diane Court, an apparently beautiful brainbox whose astonishing academic success has been achieved at the cost of peer contact. She lives with her father, James, who runs a lucrative old folks home, and who comes under investigation from the IRS for mismanaging and defrauding his clients' money.  Diane is awarded a prestigious scholarship in England, but becomes derailed by her relationship with LLoyd, who, for all his aimlessness, offers her an emotional security she never had with her acrimoniously divorced parents.  She is seemingly obliged to decide between Lloyd and a glittering career, until shock revelations about her father force things to a head.There is nothing offensively wrong with SAY ANYTHING.  There is vague pleasure to be had in spotting future minor celebrities (Eric Stoltz, Jeremy Piven, Lili Taylor).  Writer/director Crowe tries to incorporate a few formal devices into a generally naturalistic framework, such as the pseudo-Greek chorus of Lloyd's three girlfriends counterpointed with his late-night advice session from his male friends.The film is also mildly subversive.  The scene seems set for a reactionary tract about broken homes - Lloyd's parents are absent, Diane's are divorced. It might be suggested that the fears and aimlessness felt by the young in the movie arise from a lack of direction offered by the parents.  The parents are the culpable ones here, in Diane's case horrifically, unexpectedly so.  Lloyd is a thoroughly decent and dependable, as a surrogate father, as a kick-boxing coach.  Diane is finally able to make a decision after the burden of parental pressure is lifted.  It is seen as right to abandon the tainted tradition of the past.This is figured in the wonderful role-reversal ending.  All the way, as Hollywood convention decrees, it seems as if Lloyd, as male hero, is going to be Diane's teacher, despite her brains - he shows her how to fit in with her peers, how to achieve independence from her father, how to drive etc. But at the end, he goes to England with her; she is allowed fulfil her career; he is the, usually female-coded, hanger-on.  An 80s film about leaving America for Europe suggests an anti-Jamesian quest for freedom from corruption, uncertainty etc.  Happily, the film ends on unbalance and doubt.ANYTHING's problems are two-fold contrivance and lack of humour.  There is an air of phoniness about the whole thing, from the tried and tired 80s high school movie rituals, to the gropings for emotion (using sub-Phil Collins music as signifiers for emotion is really tacky and distancing).  The whole film, as my wife pointed out, is shot in a flat, TV-movie style, which focuses the now embarrassing 80s detritus.The lack of humour is the fatal flaw for a supposed comedy - anything that could be satirised is turned into melodrama; the fratboy slapstick has been done better elsewhere, the determination to take these characters oh-so-seriously lessens any attempt to see their angst as faintly ridiculous.  Which leaves verbal comedy.  As the title suggest, there is a running thematic motif concerning communication, truth, concealment, the ability to formulate emotion in words.  You can't say anything, it must be the right thing.  But too much talk and too little visual distance results in a very dull film.  It IS interesting that middle-class white boys wanted to be black so early as 1989.  Of course, there isn't a single black character in the film.

Yeah it was a movie aimed at teens but this movie was much deeper than a teen movie. In most teen movies the main couple has a fight, makes up, and kiss right before the credits start to roll. However in this movie the couple, Lloyd and Diane, actually break up and they both emotionally almost break down. You see ALL the aspects of their relationship The initiation, the big first date, the sex, and all the other BS that they have to fight through before they really start to be a couple. That's the great thing about this movie, the depth. The thing I did notice about this movie is that it suckers its viewers. You THINK that you are seeing the average guy getting the girl of his dreams but in all actuality Lloyd isn't an average guy. He kickboxes, he is very loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about (Diane, his sister's kid, Corey), he is very selfless. He drove that guy around the city of Seattle all night just to drive him home safely. He visited Diane's father in jail even though he knew the dad hated him. Lloyd was a really good guy, a great guy, but he didn't believe it and Cameron Crowe wrote the Lloyd character so that we wouldn't get that right away and John Cusack executed the part so well. Cusack is awesome. Enough said about that. Another commenter said that they didn't enjoy the movie because of its lack of humor. Hello? This movie was supposed to be serious. It's a romantic comedy with more emphasis on the romance element. Case in point The boombox serenade with In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel, NOT PHIL COLLINS. That scene was the most brilliant thing I've seen in movies. I tip my glass to Cameron Crowe for coming up with that. A great thing about watching this movie on DVD is that you can still see the 80's quality video which shows that this movie is timeless seeing that all of the people I lent my copy to related to this movie or REALLY enjoyed.

It serves as both title and a summary. The characters have such charming and open communication lines with one another. Most notably was the relationship between Diane and her father. A child of divorce, Diane was forced to choose with which parent she wanted to live. She chose her father, and this led them to build an amazingly close and unique bond. They talk about anything and everything with little to no hesitation and feel nothing but relief and acceptance after they share the information.Lloyd has a similar bond with his female friends. They are brutally honest, yet lovingly supportive, a beautiful combination that makes every on screen conversation a joy to behold. They two groups have plenty of hearty discussions as Lloyd and Diane progress from near strangers to teenage love birds. Lloyd, who initiates the contact with Diane, uses a remarkably simple approach to winning her heart&#x97;he asks her out and then spends time with her. All he needed was the courage to pursue what he wanted. No one else had the guts to ask out the beautiful and mysterious Diane. Lloyd gained her affection with the simple act of effort.That's the most fascinating thing about Lloyd&#x97;he is clearly an underachiever, but this seems due almost entirely to lack of desire rather than talent or skill. In the entire film he cares about only two things Diane and Kickboxing (the sport of the future, he claims). He pursues those two passions with prodigious vigor and eventually reaches laudable success with both. Desire is the key for Lloyd.In congruence with the charming bonds in the movie is the theme of love, or more specifically the question, is love enough? The relationship between Lloyd and Diane seems to suggest that the answer is yes. Although, Diane and her father hit a massive speed bump that threatens their relationship, despite the obvious love that they have for each other. Perhaps love is enough as long as no one completely screws it up.SPOILER ALERT I must briefly talk about the ending. Diane and Lloyd are on a plane to continue their life together in Europe. This is clearly going to be a tricky situation with Lloyd looking for work while Diane is in school. Any number of issues could potentially jeopardize their relationship.Shortly after the plane takes off, Lloyd comforts Diane, who fears flying. Lloyd tells her that they just need to wait for the 'ding' because once that sounds they will know that everything is going to be okay. They anxiously anticipate the sound and the screen cuts to black just at the 'ding' is heard. I understand the metaphor, and it's a good one. I was merely disappointed that we were not given a chance to view Lloyd and Diane in their new life together. This new atmosphere could have created endless conflict and watchable circumstances.

He's a master screenwriter that injects heart and smarts in the traditional rom-com and crafts characters that anyone can relate to. When you go see a traditional romantic comedy, the target audience is usually women. Say Anything has Lloyd Dobler. Besides being the nice guy girls like, he's an honest strong willed dreamer. He's cool but not in the typical tall dark and handsome cool but in the outsider, marches to his own beat cool. He's very nontraditional for the genre and an example of why Crowe triumphs in his films.Diane Court is also atypical. She's the good looking brain, who is not really popular at school, as is traditionally found in teen rom coms. She's also torn between what she wants and what her father wants. Her father's questionable dealings with a nursing home he runs also creates a serious situation for Diane. She deals with her decisions post high school, her father, and her love for Lloyd. That Crowe creates such complex conflicts for Diane in 100 minutes is nothing short of brilliant direction and screen writing.This was Cameron Crowe's directorial debut and was a very promising one. It's still my favorite film of his if for no other reason than John Cusack delivers some of the beautifully written dialogue so well. But it IS so much more. Say Anything came at the end of the 80s. Teenagers grew up with the characters in John Hughes films, dealing with those high school problems. I love those films and love how Say Anything provided the wonderful afterthought to those films. Life after high school, dealing with our parents vs. our own desires and coming into our own as adults. Say Anything is often cited as a teen romantic comedy, often mentioned in the same breath of many high school romcoms. Yet the graduation and party are just a small tiny bit of the film. Crowe's characters are deeper than that. The story, dialogue, and acting helped jump-start Cameron Crowe's career yet is still my favorite of his films.

The script has such a freshness, and honesty that its impossible to brush it aside as a typical romantic teen comedy. Instead it gives you truly believable characters going through very believable situations. Some of the most important points of the movie were some of the most honest and overlooked parts.  Like when Loyd and Diane make love for the very first time(for each of them as well)  loyd begins shaking and though he tries to deny he is, and then says its because he is happy that you see one of the reasons the movie is so great.  The break-up seen in the middle of the movie is so heart breaking that you almost want to reach out to loyd to try and help him and all of this movie and all are done with a script I wish most teen movies would have.  Its intelligent, funny, honest, and precisely written with all the characters being three-demensional even down to bits parts.  And the famous scene where loyd stands in front of his car and holds up his boom box with your eyes blasting out of it is one of the most memorable and great scenes of any movie. . . ever.John Cusak who is one of the most underrated actors of all time plays Loyd Dobbler with such  delicacy that you would not be surprised if he was just playing himself. Ione Skye is perfectly convincing as a girl who is as intelligent as she is beautiful(and she is very much both) who doesnt realize how beautiful she really is. The honesty with which both of these actors played and poured themselves into the roles are admirable.

It was almost as if the plot created a relationship that was improbable in its conception, but got a little too good. They had to slap together a way to make that mid-film falling out, and it didn't quite work. The controversy with her dad's business created more drama in Diane's life than perhaps it should have, and created an unwanted dragging effect 3/4 of the way through.

Small-town girl smartie Ione Skye wins a scholarship to an exclusive college in England, much to the delight of her doting father, John Mahoney. Skye herself is thrilled and can hardly wait for the summer to pass.Enter John Cusack, who begins to woo her. (And why not? She's delicious.) She begins to respond to his importunings and finally gives it up in the back seat of his car. Now she finds herself torn between her desire to advance herself while pleasing her father, and her growing attachment to the blunt, candid, but perceptive Cusack.This displeases Mahoney mightily. Cusack lacks enterprise. He's marking time as a kick-boxing instructor until he decides what to do with his life. Mahoney knows all about the affair because she tells him everything. They have a pact that they will always tell each other the truth. This would never work in real life but, okay, this is only a movie. After her father's earnest pleadings she cuts it off with Cusack who can find no solace elsewhere.Then it turns out that the retirement home run by her father is a fraud. He's been milking the clients, stealing their Social Security checks, and I don't know what all -- a terrible guy and a liar. His only justification I took CARE of them! Mahoney winds up in the slams and Skye and Cusack take off for England together.It's a not exactly inspiring story of class conflict. It's as if she's a Capulet and he's a Montague, only the Capulets have more money and a brighter future than the Montague. (Low point of the movie Cusack stands outside Skye's bedroom, apparently all night, holding a boom box above his head playing their favorite song.) Pretty dumb. But it's not nearly as dumb a movie as Cameron Crowe's Fast Times At Ridgemont High, which was populated by thirty-year-old high school boys and the only redeeming features of which were Phoebe Cates' ample bosoms.Its values are those of late adolescence rather than post pubescence. There is little in the way of the kind of invented semi-witty slang you find in some movies about school kids. And, while some of the characters have goofy hair, none of them approaches the perpetually stoned Sean Penn in Fast Times. Even so, it does pander. After all, the two lovers are right and the old man is a fraud and pretender. That outcome is the sort that gets them right in the middle of the good old demographic.The acting on the part of all the principles is pretty good. Mahoney in particular does well in a complex role. Ione Skye is beautiful without being stunning and gives the least accomplished performance. John Cusack seems to fit his role more naturally. Worth watching.

In the last twenty years, there have only been a handful 'Real Genius', 'Some Kind Of Wonderful', 'Running On Empty', 'Scream', and this movie, 'Say Anything'. It stars John Cusack, one of this generation's most interesting actors, as Lloyd Dobler, a kick boxing grad who decides to call up the cutest girl in school just because it feels like the right thing to do.  The girl, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye), is not only beautiful, but smart enough to be valedictorian.  They both happen to be outsiders for different reasons, and as they get together, their relationship blossoming, they find they have nothing in common except love.  Sometimes, that's all you need. As the movie continues, we meet Diane's father, who will do anything for his daughter (a fact that comes back to haunt him), and finds himself in competition with Lloyd for his daughter's attention.  The screenwriter /director, Cameron Crowe, handles this competition and his characters with a deft, realistic touch. The title of the movie, 'Say Anything', refers to the relationship that Diane has with her father, in that she can 'say anything' to him, but the title is ironic, because it is what he doesn't tell her that turns the plot in a surprising direction. Crowe would go on to make 'Singles' and 'Jerry Maguire', but it is here that we first see his insight into characterization.  The performance that keeps you watching the screen throughout the movie is Cusack's, because his mind keeps working; you get the sense that Lloyd has a lot more to say, but is far too interested in Diane to focus on anything else. 'Say Anything' makes a good date movie because both sides are represented fairly, and while the resolution is a romantic one, the viewer gets the impression that it's the logical choice, too.

Seems to me that even though John Cusack is a very good actor, every character he played during the 80's was exactly the same. He always played the quirky, self effacing guy who dressed funny. This character is exactly the same as the dude he played in The Sure Thing. In the scene where he's holding the ghetto blaster over his head, I was hoping someone would shoot it out of his hands. I liked him a lot better when he was an extra in John Hughes' movies.It's no wonder the girl's dad didn't want him around - what dad would want a 19 year old loser who's career goal is to be a kick boxer or his daughter's full time boyfriend to follow his daughter to England where she's going to be studying at a prestigious university? They should have made a sequel where they continue their relationship for a couple of months before the girl realizes what a loser this dork is and dumps him for an intelligent, ambitious guy she meets at university.Then, Cusack's character could have wandered around Europe for awhile, being a big baby and then joining the Army.

Ignoring any career prospects, he sets his sights on a brainy valedictorian, played by Ione Skye who is set to fly to England with a scholarship.

Her parents are divorced and she lives with her father, played by John Mahoney, who runs a nursing home where he is investigated on charges of pocketing the cash of those in his care. The screenplay has funny moments where Cusack expresses himself as he does, but the serious undertones are convicting with solid performances by all three principal actors as well as Lili Taylor as Cusack's love sick friend who once attempted suicide.

It surprises just about everyone when she returns the same sentiment. But Diane's overly possessive, divorced father doesn't approve and it will take more than the power of love to conquer all. The charm, the desire that brought this charming film to life is to hard to believe, the romance that is brought on to the screen is unlike no other romantic film. It's full of wonder and belief that bring these two teens that attract one another that bring you to understand that they won't abandon their love for each other even If it kills them. What this film gave to us is a certain spark that no other ordinary romance film hasn't gave us before, a unpredictable kind of approach to its story, you don't really know what to anticipate to each scene handed to you in your first viewing. The characters brought on upon John Cusack and Ione Skye (Lloyd & Diane) at the ritual ages of 22 & 18 gives you a sense of wonderment that gave these youngsters with such a sense of accomplishment to their acting capabilities and give us a straight forward way to render in such characters as the ones they were approached too. Predictable requirements you are trying harbor into this film is brought up so wrong because you are shown with surplus storytelling with no cliché's in sight, the story gives you encouragement to root for the main characters of Lloyd and Diane because you just know these two are mean't for one another and you don't want them to see them give up. The witty and sharp dialogue for each character is done so proper to fit them with such whimsical attributes that make each and every one of them carefree or unpleasant. The love story that is brought along in this is not your usual kind of romance, the love is brought on with such realism that can relate, it does have its moments with things that couples would do but that's fine because Cameron Crowe brought you feelings to such dubious storytelling.

Whether it be parents to children, unlikely friendships, or just great romance, Crowe always finds a way to get the best out of actors and that always starts with his scripts. Say Anything tells the story of Lloyd, a well mannered 19 year old who lives in the now, and Diane, a valedictorian with everything good coming her way, and how a relationship like that may blossom over the course of the summer before college.Some may shrug at the fact that Lloyd may have no business in being with a girl of her stature, but the film does a nice job of making the romance believable. Having not known each other in high school, Lloyd decides to take his chances and just call and ask her on a date. Of course, she's very hesitant at first but by simply saying he made me laugh was enough for me. It's true, a laugh can go a long way in getting to know something in whatever aspect possible. Now 26 years later you can definitely feel the influence that this film had on coming of age films even to this day. The Spectacular Now takes a similar premise and also was very successful. It's hard to nail a high school film, but Say Anything did a pretty good job. I also appreciated the way they portrayed Diane's relationship with her father. It was clearly a close bond they had, and for 3/4 of the movie I felt like it wasn't clichéd at all. There wasn't the typical Disney moments of it's my dream dad, not yours. Now, towards the end of the film I think that same relationship was sacrificed for certain plot points. Knowing that the film isn't all that unpredictable, I should have guessed certain things would happen, but I felt like the last third of the movie felt too much like all the other Hollywood films.There are a lot of classic Crowe moments like when Lloyd is constantly getting advice from his close girlfriends or even his guy friends, so there's no shortage of laughs or fun moments. The film also contains a fantastic score and soundtrack, which are also Crowe trademarks. The famous boombox scene is shorter than I thought and doesn't hold as much of a bearing on the film's outcome as I had heard. But Say Anything is still a well done coming of age film with real characters with real moments.+Soundtrack/score +Real romance +Everyone is well written +Felt like I was living it with them -3rd acts left turn 7.7/10 "},{"Title":"sincere teen rom-com","Date":"16 March 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" It's graduation at a Seattle high school.

Except he doesn't realize he's got it all figured out. He's just graduated high school and now what? He aspires to be a kickboxer which is a way of saying he has no prospects whatsoever, no future. But he knows what he wants. And what he wants most of all is to be with Diane Court. Diane is the school's golden girl. A brain trapped in the body of a game show hostess is the way her classmates describe her. She's the class valedictorian, winner of a prestigious fellowship which will have her leaving her Seattle home at the end of the summer to go study in England. Which leaves her with very little time to forge a romantic relationship. Not that she has any real chance of a relationship anyway. Intimidated by her brains and beauty guys find Diane unapproachable. Her classmates know of her but they don't really know her. So caught up in her studies and so seemingly unattainable, she never really had any friends, certainly no lovers. But Lloyd Dobler is ready to reach for the unreachable star. He calls her up out of the blue and, never mind the fact she really has no idea who he is, invites her to a graduation party. She says no, he persists, she says yes. And a love affair is born.Lloyd opens Diane's eyes to a whole new world. She allows herself to love and laugh, to really live for the first time. Not particularly enthused with this new relationship is Diane's father. He's always been the only man in her life, her only true friend and confidant. When her parents divorced Diane chose to live with her father and their lives proceeded according to his plan. He would do anything for his daughter, always be there for her to push her towards her dreams. But were they really her dreams or his? And how exactly did he finance these dreams? The IRS would like to know. Her father's under investigation, she's just fallen in love and she's headed for England in a few months. Diane's life is in complete turmoil. But Lloyd can be her rock. If she'll let him.Lloyd may seem to have no future but he has a wisdom beyond his years. Listen to the speech he gives Diane's father about what he wants to do with his life. Or more accurately, what he doesn't want to do with his life. It may not be a good enough plan for Diane's father but Lloyd knows the path to happiness. And for him right now that path involves spending as much time with Diane as possible. But her impending departure and her father's legal travails put pressure on the relationship and it all falls apart. Again though Lloyd has it all figured out. Certainly more than the guys hanging out at the Gas 'n' Sip do, as Lloyd drops some more precious wisdom on them. And then, urged on by his female friends to be more than a guy, to be a man, Lloyd goes about reclaiming his girl with the help of film's most legendary boombox.And they all lived happily ever after? Nope, this film is smarter than that, doesn't take the easy way out. Writer/director Cameron Crowe takes his time bringing the couple back together, to the point you wonder if they're actually going to get back together at all. This is no cheap, easy, formulaic teen romantic comedy. The characters have depth and brains and the central relationship is allowed to run a realistic, natural course. Nothing is rushed. And there is room for some wonderful, witty and in some cases now iconic dialogue along the way. Crowe wrote a terrific script, guided his actors with a strong hand and produced a real gem. John Cusack as Lloyd and Ione Skye as Diane are terrific in the key roles and are ably supported by a number of other fine performers. John Mahoney gives off such a good-at-heart vibe as Diane's father and then when things turn for the character Mahoney's performance evolves beautifully. Lili Taylor plays Lloyd's quirky musician friend. If you wrong this girl she's gonna write a song about it. Or 63 songs about it. Your heart breaks for her even as you can't help but laugh at her snarling musical missives to her ex. Other familiar faces like Joan Cusack and Philip Baker Hall pop up in small but important roles. It all comes together with a story which entertains, captivates and warms the heart. There are laughs but there's plenty of drama too all the way right up to the final scene, one of the best movie endings ever which has your heart right up in your throat to the very last moment. Lloyd and Diane went on a magical ride during their summer of love. Crowe took his audience on quite a ride as well.

SAY ANYTHING (comedy-romance, 1989) Lloyd (John Cusak) is graduating from high school. His main interests in life include kick-boxing, and having fun. Diane (Ione Skye) is the smart and beautiful genius of Lloyd's school, so he calls her up for a date. She accepts only because he made me laugh. Since they lead very different lives, it comes as a surprise to all when the no-so serious Lloyd gets Diane to fall in love with him. But Diane suddenly has to decide whether to leave for an exclusive college, or stay with the man she loves.CRITIQUE Starting out as another one of those 'sex-teen' comedies that were popular during the 1980s (i.e. 'Meatballs', 'Porky's'), the film surprisingly settles down to a wonderful coming-of-age romance. Cameron Crowes' witty script and direction helps to lift it above those inferior flicks. He gives the characters clever lines (so how did you get Diane to go out with you? Lloyd I called her up. Thanks, that gives me hope), along with a story that touches on the complicated aspects of young love.It also examines their emotions and thoughts as young adults, not just sex-starved teens full of hormones. Best of all, Crowe gives the oftentimes-miscast John Cusak a perfect role. His on-screen romance with the beguiling Ione Skye has to be one of the sweetest in cinema memory.QUOTES Diane Why are you shaking? Lloyd I don't know. I'm just happy.

I don't consider myself critical of date movies per se, but this one changed my  entire perception of the chick flick genre.  It's one of those films which, for me, don't seem that profound until a few days after you've seen them.   Then you start thinking about certain scenes or feelings those scenes provoked in you.  The more I watch this film, the more I enjoy it.  The famous scene  (anyone familiar at all with this movie knows the one I am referring to) inspired me to do the same thing for my ex-girlfriend when, in May of 1998, she left me because she hadn't grown up to want what we had.  This film holds a special place in my heart, as does its love theme (which broke through the night air  at 1230am when I stood outside re-enacting the sweetest, simplest, most heart-tearing demonstration of love I have ever seen in a motion picture).  I am not  writing this review to comment on one scene, however, but rather on the brilliance of it as a whole and that of its director, Cameron Crowe.  He never  forgets that life is made up of moments and as such includes scenes which, while they don't necessarily advance the plot, stay in your mind and your heart  long after you've forgotten the film's title and story years afterwards.  Say Anything... is one of my favorite movies because it explores things that have  always been close to my heart (the possibility that adults, though older, may not be able to understand certain places of love when they've never had  anything so intimate to relate to, the insecurity and mixed emotions that go with being your own person, and the kind of selflessness, spontaneity, and  tenderness that define what real love is all about).

Given my usual aversion to any film described as a teen romance, it may be that I was just in a good mood, but to my surprise I rather enjoyed it.A large part of its appeal undoubtedly lies in the fact that John Cusack and Ione Skye do make a genuinely likable couple, helped out by an understated script that allows them to be just that. In a number of other films by Cameron Crowe, I've felt the emotion was cloyingly overdone. However, although Say Anything, with its central premise of nice guy gets nice girl, occasionally teeters on the brink of such sentimentality, it never quite topples.There's a pleasant naturalistic quality to the film. Not what you would call realism, just an unforced emotional sincerity. Despite the fact many of the characters could, on the face of it, easily be slotted into familiar stereotypes of the genre, the script ensures they diverge just enough to keep things interesting.This is particularly true of Ione's father, engagingly played by John Mahoney, better known as Marty Crane on Frasier. At first I assumed he was going to be the standard domineering dad, putting his foot down to prevent his darling daughter consorting with a guy who just wasn't good enough for her. And to an extent this does happen, but it is all a good deal more subtle and nuanced than I had been expecting.Elsewhere, the film could be accused of leaving a number of the supporting characters underdeveloped, and some of the subplots unconcluded. Yet I actually didn't really mind. If anything it helped add a kind of authenticity to the story. After all in reality people can drift in and out of our lives quite haphazardly, without providing us with in depth looks into their character, nor any neat endings for their stories.In summation then, although Say Anything is no cinematic masterpiece, if you approach it in a relatively uncynical frame of mind, you should find it an engaging and sincere romantic drama.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just felt like you were watching real people, not actors. I think its the manner in which a series of those uncomfortable, sometimes even awkward moments were strung together to form a plot. The characters seemed to have this desire to relate to each other by creating a collective cohesive set of performances that individually might seem out of sync, but combined together are in complete harmony. The selection of music was also just fantastic. That moment when John Cusack is holding the ghetto blaster,standing outside of the house, while In your eyes is playing, sets the bar of excellence for romantic comedies to come. It really doesn't matter if this scene is plausible or not, its symbolic, everybody should strive to have a moment like that at least once during the course of their lifetime. Its about self-expression, its about clichéd expression like wearing your heart on your sleeve and putting yourself out there. Its a moment that will make you remember this film. A reminder to all of us not to lead a life of quiet desperation. John Cusack is simply outstanding as Lloyd Dobler, John Mahoney (The dad from 'Frasier') turned in an incredible performance. This film wasn't your typical eightes teen romance flick, but it definitely left me with a great vibe at the end. It left me with, as cheesy as this might sound, that nice guys don't actually finish last and they do get the girl at the end.

On the outside it's nothing more than a cookie cutter version of a love story.  It follows the same basic trajectory as every other romance story I've seen and the screenplay is nothing out of the ordinary.  But there is something about Lloyd Dobler's (John Cusack) unfailing optimism that you can't help but route for him.  Diane (Ione) may make you want to throw something at the screen at times for not grasping how truly special her relationship is with Lloyd, but it's the fact that you feel impassioned enough to actually throw something that shows you really do care about the fate of these characters. Plus, if someone didn't go crazy and doubt the relationship there wouldn't be much of a story, and it's about time it's not the guy who messes up. Beyond the care this film evokes from the audience for the characters, Say Anything also includes one of the all time greatest scenes of any love story (or any movie, for that matter) ever created.  If you've seen the movie you know which scene I'm talking about.  If you haven't, you'll realize it when you have to mold your melted heart back together (hint Peter Gabriel lends a little help).  Once again, I don't understand why I love this movie because I usually don't get into shallow chick flicks. Say Anything, though it epitomizes the chick flick genre, stands head and shoulders and  boom boxes above most other love stories because Cameron Crowe masterfully weaves a love triangle between Lloyd, Diane, and the audience. "},{"Title":"Ultra-charming, the height of '80s teen movies","Date":"5 April 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  John Cusack is one of the most enjoyable actors alive. It's a shame that he's most well-known from semi-terrible action movies like Con Air (worth watching for an amazing cast -- Steve Buscemi, Nicolas Cage having fun with a bad southern accent, Ving Rhames, and John Malkovich chomping the scenery) and so-sweet-they'll-make-your-teeth-rot romantic comedies. When he's in a good, even great, role as he is here, the pleasures he brings are endless.The so true tagline of the movie is To know Lloyd Dobler is to love him. Diane Court is about to know Lloyd Dobler. Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler as an optimistic, verbose charmer of a 19 year-old longing for Diane Court (Ione Skye). Diane is an overachiever -- not a snob, but she's afraid that people see her as prissy. In the film, we never see her with her friends; rather, we see her working at her father's (John Mahoney) old folks home. Dobler, on the other hand, we see with his friends like the great Lily Taylor, as a forlorn girl who sings Angry Chick music -- 65 songs written about the guy who dumped her. (She encourages Dobler to be a man, not just some guy.)Diane's not a long-legged blonde or a bombshell by any means, but she is cute. She's a social outcast of sorts. While she's been accepted by a fellowship in England, she doesn't have a clue socially. When she reluctantly agrees to go out to an after-graduation party with Dobler (after one of the all-time classic phone calls, in a constraining bathroom space), she overdresses terribly for the occasion. Dobler isn't a stud, but he's instantly likeable and spending time with his presence is a joy.As Diane's father, John Mahoney gives a subtle, hopelessly un-hip portrayal of an emotionally open father whose pride is his daughter (and will do whatever he can to secure her happiness). At first, he's indifferent towards Lloyd, although he does question Lloyd's career prospects (just as Lloyd's friends question why Diane is interested in him at all). In the most heartbreaking and perfectly handled scene in the movie, the divorced Mahoney tries to pull a Lloyd Dobler and charm a store clerk, only to have two credit cards denied, and have the clerk pity him by saying she won't confiscate his card as she's supposed to.I've always had an affection for '80s teen movies (even though -- or maybe because -- I'm too young to remember them first first-hand). Many of them -- particularly those by the King of '80s teen movies, John Hughes -- have a strange self-awareness and a weirdness that's really unique. The two reining favourites remain The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, both by Hughes. But Say Anything... wasn't a John Hughes movie, it was Cameron Crowe's first as a director. It doesn't have that weirdness of many '80s teen movies; instead, it's got an honest charm (as opposed to, I don't know, a goofball charm). It's genuinely funny (Cusack's dead-on timing is a major asset), and ultimately the perfect date movie. The only thing I'd worry about is your date falling in love too much with Lloyd and his bumbling eloquence. After watching Say Anything..., she might see you as second rate.There's one scene in the back of a car (yep, you guessed it) that seems as if it were directly thieved by James Cameron for his vastly overrated (but sill enjoyable) Titanic. (I know it's not just some coincidence either -- there's more than one Bob Dylan line stolen and reworded for Cameron's film.) Also, I'm fairly certain that The Simpsons paid homage to Say Anything... and Diane's fear of flying, in an episode where Marge is calmed by Homer, naming all the completely ordinary plane noises. (Diana also retells a story in the film of how she screamed so loud that she and her father made a plane turn around -- in The Simpsons, it's actually shown.)In this, one of the great romantic-teen-comedies -- a masterwork, and Crowe's crowning achievement with Almost Famous trailing close behind -- it's great fun getting to know Lloyd Dobler.**** "}{"Title":"The movie still rocks, but the commentary is why to buy...","Date":"24 April 2002","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  There's little I can add about this film that hasn't already been said.

Meanwhile Diane has a bright future in front of her but yet managed to go through school without really being friends with anyone but her father. When Lloyd finally gets the courage to ask her out she accepts and finds that she enjoys her company and that this is the world she has been missing out on. However will their growing friendship go anywhere with Diane destined for a scholarship in England?Like many people I knew this film from the famous image of Lloyd holding a ghetto-blaster above his head, but I had never seen the film or known anything about it until recently. The film opens on fairly typical teen territory and I settled in for what I expected (knew?) would bring just what I expected from it. In a way this is what it did do because the basic narrative arch and characters are familiar and it is solid and enjoyable in this regard. However the film is better than the basics would suggest because it has a smart script in Crowe's impressive feature debut. The story has more to it than the romance and in this way it deepens the characters. Of course it is still a teen movie so it is not as deep as all that but it is refreshing different from the majority of the films where the action focuses entirely on the young couple.With this approach Mahoney works well with a character that has real interest and complexity and his character is much better than I expected as a result. Cusack does equally as well with a gently quirky character with dignity and humour &#150; he contrasts well with his peers, most of who are the clichés associated with the genre but are mocked a bit for it. Skye is good but takes a while to get to the good material &#150; for the majority she does what the genre requires but is better with better material later on. The support cast features mostly solid performances from a cast of actors on their way to fame &#150; Taylor, Piven, Hall and others are surprise finds.Overall then this is a genre teen romance and is good on that level. However the writing and performances are better than the genre average and make for a much more interesting and engaging film that should be liked by the majority of viewers as long as you don't dislike the genre itself.

This being known as one of the best teen romances of the '80's makes me not want to see the others. It was fine but wasn't rewarding enough, didn't leave enough to ponder on after the credits were rolling.

They feel genuine, like real people, not like archetypes like in most teen movies (I love The Breakfast Club, but literally every character in that movie is an archetype). There is no nerd or jock character, and their dialogue doesn't feel like movie dialogue. The chemistry between the characters is (intentionally) awkward at first, but as they come to know each other better it becomes more relaxed and natural. Lloyd is not a perfect guy, he gets easily anxious, isn't very smart, and has absolutely no idea where he is going in life (but he doesn't seem to care). But he also has good intentions and is easy to like. Diane is VERY connected to her dad, and her dad try's to plan out her life for he because he wants her to have everything. But this results in her not really having much of a social life, which pretty much leads to her decision to go to the party on the night of their graduation with Lloyd. At first she doesn't like Lloyd, and it seems she even thinks about ditching him at one point, but from talking to one of Lloyd's best friends she decides to give him a chance.All of the characters in this movie end up learning one thing no matter how much you plan for something, a simple feeling that you have for someone can completely change it, so really, you can't plan for anything. Diane's dad, James, is arrested later in the movie for essentially stealing money from people, and his plan to raise money for when his daughter comes back from England is completely foiled. Even though Diane thinks it's best for her not to be with Lloyd, she inevitably comes back to him. Lloyd has the easiest time adjusting, because he had no preconceived plans. He simply focuses on the moment and I think thats the lesson of this movie. No matter how much you plan for your life, anything can swoop in and change that plan at any moment, so we might as well just stay closest to the people we care about and just worry about things as they come. And the closet we get to realizing that, the happier everyone's lives will be.

It's early in the morning when he's decided to pull off this little stunt, and, standing next to his car, he's holding up a huge boom-box over his head blaring Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes.This is the most iconic and famous scene in Cameron Crowe's Say Anything..., his 1989 debut which he both wrote and directed. This is a movie I've seen in clips over the years but have never actually sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. I've read the critical praise (the most significant coming from the late film critic Roger Ebert), Entertainment Weekly naming it the greatest modern romance AND ranking it at #11 on their list of 50 best high school movies, and a Valentine's Day article in The Washington Post from 2006 titled What I Did For Lloyd. Now I've finally sat down and watched the movie and understood where it's all coming from.The 1980s were a wasteland of teen comedies. John Hughes (1950-2009) was behind the best of them (The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles). At the tail end of the decade, came Cameron Crowe and his Say Anything.... This film is much like any teen comedy/romance to come out at that time (and ever since) and begins as such, with a noble underachiever who falls for an ultra-intelligent, if socially unskilled, beauty who seems way out of his league. The movie also seems to at least partially pre-figure the Seattle grunge era of the early '90s (which was spear-headed by the legendary grunge band Nirvana), but the exact details of this implication are part of another discussion entirely.Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is the noble underachiever who dares to ask out the beautiful high school valedictorian Diane Court (Ione Skye) the day after their graduation. Lloyd's ambitions are pretty slim, since the only thing he can really see himself doing in the immediate future is Kick-boxing (which at that time was still a relatively new thing). So at least he's honest about his life's aspirations he knows what he wants to do, and he especially knows what he DOESN'T want to do - which does shock some people and makes him the most truthful character in the entire film. But it's an even bigger shock when he decides that he wants to go out with the lovely Diane Court.Diane, on the other hand, has her whole life set out before her. She's worked hard her entire life to work her way up to the top of her high school graduating class. And all that hard work pays off when she learns she's been granted a fellowship to further her studies overseas in England. And she'll be leaving at the end of the summer. And then there's Lloyd, who impulsively asks her out on a date and much to his surprise, she accepts his invitation. They do go out, they enjoy one another's company, they connect, and their feelings of just being friends with potential do gradually deepen into love. While Diane's over-protective father James Court (John Mahoney) seems to like Lloyd, he mostly sees him as a distraction and someone who's going to steer her away from the future she's worked so hard to achieve.We like Lloyd and Diane both, and we want them to be together. But like any good love story, there has to be roadblocks, and these roadblocks hurt...In a major subplot, however, James, owner of an elderly-care facility, is also being investigated by the IRS for tax fraud. This subplot would be a most unnecessary distraction from an otherwise touching teen romance, but the way everything turns out and why it's even happened in the first place is just one of the many unique charms of Say Anything... and why it stands out amongst most teen romance films made before and since. A less ambitious movie would JUST be about Lloyd & Diane's relationship and nothing else, but Say Anything... has other things on its mind beside those two - even though it still hurts us when outside forces cause them to separate for a time. Say Anything... wants to show us how their relationship is affecting everyone around them, and how everyone around them is affecting them, as well.Say Anything... is a wondrously scripted, acted, and directed film; it's definitely an early indication of the skill of a writer and director with huge ideas, huge potential. Crowe knew his characters well and chose his performers even better. John Cusack and Ione Skye are the dynamic young stars playing Lloyd and Diane. Like John Hughes before him and who dominated the early portion of the 1980s teen scene, Cameron Crowe knew how to make a smart teen film one that is not filled with stupid sex jokes and even stupider characters - teens and adults alike.With that in mind, I can see how an audience so cynical in 1989 after being bombarded with teen comedy after teen comedy throughout the earlier portion of the decade can very easily write off Say Anything... as just Another Teen Movie. It's a teen film, yes, and an occasionally very funny one, too, but it's also an extraordinarily moving and compelling one, as well. So I can also see how that cynicism would wear off once the movie really begins to reveal itself to the audience - especially with its emotional honesty and maturity, and the fact that it's actually a very well-written and acted little piece of cinema.So it's really no wonder why you can Say Anything you want about Say Anything... but you cannot deny that it is not a great movie!10/10 "},{"Title":"A Teen Rom-Com That For Once is Approachable and Cringeless","Date":"9 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is One Smoothie Movie.

Boasting an energetic performance by a very young and exuberant John Cusack, Say anything is an interesting foray into the world of young romance Circa 1980 something.The story follows Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) as he falls hopelessly in love with Diane Court (Ione Sky). The pair meet during high school graduation and all manner of relationship dynamics come into play.Featuring a bold example of gender role reversal in 1980′s U.S. culture the film chronicles Lloyd's attempts to woo the woman he loves, his subsequent continual rejections as Diane tries to stay focused on her career and the upset of the class divide between them when troubles arise with Diane's father.I found the entire film to be extraordinarily interesting and engaging, the director turns traditional romantic stereotypes on their head and reveals the tender side of male teenage head space.Say anything represents an egalitarian attitude towards romantic idealism in film, something that I consider not only to be very entertaining but also unique in its delivery . The film premiered two years after Dirty Dancing, which was a throwback to an earlier era and mindset but was hugely popular and I consider Say Anything to be a sobering antidote to the usual female Cinderella stereotype. (Uhhmmm Sixteen candles .yawn).Say anything contains THAT BOOMBOX scene and John Cusack won the Most promising Actor Award from the Chicago Film Critics Association for his portrayal of Lloyd Dobler .I highly recommend this film, it's an absolute treat, especially for those of us who endured the DIRTY DANCING craze and subsequent or previous Cinderella style stereotypes in popular culture and film.Read my reviews and join in the fun banter at filmstvandlife.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Illustrating All Kinds of Love","Date":"25 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Say Anything&#x85; (1989) is one of those rare late-eighties, early-nineties romantic comedies that can appeal to both men and the fairer sex. You know the type When Harry Met Sally&#x85; (1989) Pretty Woman (1990) Sleepless in Seattle (1993) et al. Yet Say Anything&#x85; is one of the few exceptionally good and mature love stories that takes place in the torrid-love-affair-overload land of high school. Well maybe not, it more takes place in the insular time between high school and college but let's not split hairs for the sake of the kids.John Cusack plays an eccentric yet well-meaning goofball whose been pining for the school's valedictorian for a good long while. His friends played by Amy Brooks and a singularly jejune Lily Taylor think she's out of his league; brains stick with brains, she says while strumming her guitar. Yet Lloyd Dobler takes a chance anyway and to his great surprise gets a yes from Ione Skye's ethereal ingénue. They then are given the summer to bond before she goes to college in England.The start of the movie lulls you into a false sense of knowing. Of course Lloyd Dobler is going to end up going out with Diane Court. Everyone including her father (John Mahoney) doesn't think it's going to work out. Their names are even phonetically at odds. Diane? Lloyd? Might as well call them Joe and Princess Ann. Yet this movie isn't about falling in love, it's about being in love and believe me there is a big difference.Dobler and Diane grow to love one another by relating to each other and have a mutual interest in learning about each other. Lloyd looks out for her and accepts the goals she has made for herself and adapts accordingly. While we do see less adaptation from Diane it's hard for her to accommodate Lloyd when his life plans are so up in the air. Yet even with his tacit inkling towards a career in kickboxing you can tell Diane would be there to support him when push comes to shove. They have a good thing going and quickly shed the clique dynamics of high school in exchange for something more real.Real and less volatile as evidenced by the juxtaposition of Lily Taylor's obsession with a two timer named Joe (Loren Dean). That single relationship informs her worldview and is the impetuous for her songwriting yet at first glance he clearly isn't worth the heartache. It's a childish obsession at odds with Lloyd's commitment based interconnection with Diane. When Diane describes her first sexual experience with Lloyd to her father, it wasn't a decision wholly based on a whim. She put thought into her adult decision and Lloyd was right there, chomping at the bit like guys would, but still being an adult about it.Diane is given abundant support by her loving father who is displeased with her choice in boyfriend. Lloyd might be sincere but his ambitions are nebulous which would concern any protective father. Yet don't think for a moment John Mahoney's Mr. Court is the bad guy, even if the subplot involving money laundering feels skivvy. The very fact that Diane could confide in him when she loses her virginity should be evidence enough of their special bond. Even Lloyd picks up on the supportive relationship saying You two are amazing, you know? The way you talk&#x85;I'm not even like that with anybody. Say Anything&#x85; is a romantic comedy in the classical sense. In one exchange Diane says Nobody thinks it will work do they? to which Lloyd retorts, No, you just described every great success story. Yet director Cameron Crowe probes deeper than frivolity. It's a love story that examines love through sacrifice, commitment, compromise and growth. There are many films that express the elation of falling hear over heals, the serendipity of forming close bonds and the promise of romance. But few ever give you the true meaning and consequence of love. Ultimately it's not about a sentimental letter or sending flowers, mostly it's about holding someone's hands and telling them things are going to turn out alright.

Oh, and she has a father (John Mahoney) who gave her the best of what life has to offer but turns out to have some flaws that threaten their relationship. That's all I'll mention of the plot. Now I just want to say that I love the whole vibe that went on during the movie.

The film was shot in the Seattle area and the story involves a group of youths after high school graduation.Ione Skye plays Diane, a misfit preppy girl who suddenly comes alive upon graduation after striking up a relationship with Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack. Diane has a scholarship to a prestigious college in England and her Dad, played by John Mahoney, doesn't want some aimless drifter getting in the way of her success.The second half isn't as entertaining as the first half because it leaves the high school graduation antics behind to focus on Diane and Lloyd's increasingly intimate relationship, as well as unexpected revelations about Diane's father. Those who like stories about romantic relationships will no doubt appreciate the second half more than I did.A handful of things I appreciated about the film (1.) The situations and relationships all smack of real life and you can tell that the writer, director and actors all put some quality time into creating this reality. (2.) For instance, two of Lloyd's best friends are girls, Corey and D.C., who try to advise him on his new relationship. (3.) Although I'm not a fan of Cusack by any means (nor am I not a fan, if you know what I mean), his character of Lloyd Dobler is excellent and memorable. (4.) The first half is filled with laugh-out-loud scenes, like Corey playing her guitar at a party, still venting her emotions regarding a past flame. We've all seen this at some of those parties, haven't we? And (5.) unlike, say, Porky's and American Pie (Widescreen Unrated Ultimate Edition) there's thankfully no childish raunch.

He's likable, as is usual with John's characters, portraying zestful youth and who is basically a good guy.Joan plays his sister, which is a minor role but she still shines. The basic story is that Lloyd sits next to Ione Skye (who came up with these names?), a pretty Diane Court, who her father James, (John Mahoney, Martin Crane, Dad in Frasier) calls 'Prissy'.He's a bit old fashioned and understandably protective and wonders if Lloyd as Prissy's boyfriend would be any better than any of the others. There's some great chemistry between the leads, dating in cars and 'hanging out' together that reminds one of more youthful days (in my case!) and is all quietly uplifting. There's also that juicy complication used in modern rom-comes - Prissy is off to England, to study, adding dilemma and complications all round.That part works well. The sideline about James and his embezzling was a surprisingly effective one, that added meat to the bones and made the film more rounded and helped us to understand his protective nature. That it's Mahoney, a superb actor and making it look so easy, helped enormously.Cameron Crowe's film, apparently never made it into cinemas in the U.K. Heaven alone knows why not, considering the utter dross that does.Say Anything is probably considered a minor film and whilst it's not great and won't be remembered as much as some, it certainly was an enjoyable little movie.

I had thought this was going to be just another in a long link of Pretty in Pinkish movies with predictable characters and a bad case of puppy love, but what I got was a surprisingly refreshing, unconventional story with a complicated and well-developed emotional depth flawlessly captured by the actors and Cameron Crowe.And talk about role reversals! I'm so used to seeing the man take the assertive and mature role while courting a woman of limited financial or intellectual means...but in this film it's the girl that's got her future together and the guy who's more than willing to concentrate his attention on making her happy. And Lloyd Dobler isn't just a shiftless man with no future. He's an eternal optimist who lives in the present and recognizes, admires, and compliments the qualities in Diane that go beyond her amazing intellect. She becomes his dare-to-be-great situation and his absolute love and devotion to her is anything but unmanly. The force of it is palatable and immensely erotic without being reduced to cheap teenage lust. The sight of Lloyd in the shadows defiantly blasting out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one. It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up. This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love.

But truthfully, it wasn't uncommon for an eighties film to do moderately successful at the box office, then become a classic in later years. You'd call that a cult classic, a film cherished by a specific group of people, but I don't think Say Anything would fit in that category. It's cherished by pretty much everyone who saw it, and I think that's larger than a cult.Our lead male is Lloyd (Cusack), an aspiring kickboxer who has just graduated high school and hopes to date valedictorian Diane (Skye). Lloyd calls Diane's house, gets her stern, overprotective father (Mahoney) on the phone, and manages to sort of charm him in a strange way.Lloyd is persistent when he finally talks to Diane, and finally encourages her to go to a party with him. They continue to see each other, much to the father's dismay. Diane likes Lloyd because he's able to see the other side of her. Not just the brainy side, but the honest, beautiful side of her.The subplots involve the struggle to maintain a healthy relationship and embrace the future since Diane is moving to England for College, and the fact the father is accused of tax violations at the nursing home he owns.The story is overall beautiful, touching, and many other things. Especially because it's honest and believable. This was made back in time when romantic comedies weren't cliché stories, but had a script, a cast, and a heart. It all works here because it wants to. It wants to make a good film, and does.Even though Cameron Crowe directed this gem, I had vague images of John Hughes's name being on this film. Maybe because since he was known for every fantastic teen comedy of the eighties, he'd be a name to look for on everyone. But it turns out this was a film that jump-started two careers without having any mention of a great coming-of-age director. Say Anything is on a road all its own.Starring John Cusack, Ione Skye, John Mahoney, and Joan Cusack. Directed by Cameron Crowe.

(complete with, count 'em, three periods) begins in a teenager's bedroom as they sit there with two of their closest companions, at that stage in a conversation during which the knocking back and forth of ideas threatens to escalate into arguing. The disagreements are over words, or more specifically, words that define what it is certain actions of a romantic nature ought be labelled &#x96; there is enough pressure in these people's lives, it seems, when it comes to one's peers; maintaining reputations and the overbearing issue of studies to have to worry about without getting your words and terms right when speaking openly to high school chums. It is the first instance in Cameron Crowe's delightful little teenaged-young adult comedy during which we observe youngsters confused, bewildered and in angst over romance or items more broadly linked to romance. What the film eventually comes to do is branch out into a charming piece about a young man's feelings for another girl, as the clock ticks down to her leaving and a proverbial net of all things pressurised and unenviable appear to close in.That young man is Lloyd Dobler, John Cusak's likable; softly spoken; kick-boxing fanatic high-schooler in his final year based in a suburban America with his family. Far from a slob but a long way from what might be perceived within the film's realm as academically imbued, Dobler's somewhat happy with being an easy-going and kind young man who has penchants and interests as well as a fondness for his close relatives; a man not afraid to confront another male if it transpires he made ill of another woman's feelings for whatever reason, yet is humble enough to have to give his automobile's cassette player a good whack if required when desiring to operate it. Principally, above all else; above the university places some have and above the goal to get as drunk as possible whilst one is still able to at this delicate stage in your life, Dobler's key interest is in Dianne Court (Skye) a young woman at Lloyd's school who's mostly everything Lloyd is not.Dianne is described, whilst off screen and with we the audience having yet to observe, as a girl with the body of a game-show hostess; ear-opening when we realise these are words from the mouth of another young woman and is not a mere jibe from that of a male with nary much else but you-know-what on his mind. Dianne lives with her father, a rich rest home owner, in a large secluded home with its own gravel driveway; one of those which reaches the house and then finds enough time to spin around into a circle with a centrepiece in the middle. She has a place abroad, such is the way these things work in films such as these, a place in what is commonly used as the land of academia, in that she's on her way to a university in England for some studies of a prestigious sort. When we first observe Dianne, she is driven to her graduation ceremony by her father who's extremely proud; a leavers speech which she provides has everybody seemingly at her command, the film centralising the point of focus on Dianne without ever objectifying, as she finds the entire occasion very moving &#x96; moving in a way everybody else seemingly does not when they perhaps ought to, something that infers a person in touch with themselves and their emotions, and somebody perhaps a little above the rest of the graduates in this regard whom watch on before catching on.Through some brave and rather lucky means, Lloyd snaffles a date with Dianne; but surely, going by the opening scene of definition arguments and whatnot, it more than resembles something else close to a date but just not quite a date. He calls her house, gets put on with her father; already as nervous as anything, the insinuation that many-a male attempts as such what it is Lloyd's trying now is humorously put across when it transpires Dianne's father recalls attempted dates and so-forth by calling to mind what it is the various men drive. The night out itself is fraught with the potential of something going catastrophically wrong without anything necessarily going catastrophically wrong; a rather loud party fuelled by alcohol and large groups of youngsters huddled into rooms inside of a house that is made to look a lot smaller than it is. We don't feel as if this is exactly Dianne's scene, while Lloyd himself appears elusive; the pair of them coming together as attendees thin out and a small group of whom Lloyd knows congregates as the night draws to a close &#x96; Lloyd's role there ultimately seeing him put people straight and aid in the safety to prevent drink-driving, more than anything, in what might have been a more lewd display in more contemporary films.Say Anything... eventually mutates into a really quaint, really rather remarkably played love story between these two people whom at first seem at odds, but through spending enough time with each other, come to understand the authenticity of one another. In one scene, each party are asked on respective career and potential marital relations; neither party can give concrete answers that please the enquirers but both can reply honestly to the best of their own ability, something which binds them in this sense as Lloyd is granted deeper access into her home and her life which reveal minute flaws and such from her past deconstructing or demythifying prior perceptions he had that yet goes on to retain fondness. Crowe allows things to progress and naturally develop competently and engrossingly, a plot to do with tax evasion and the fall out that arrives with that melded into proceedings in a slick and pleasingly unassuming manner in conjunction with the primary material; the film coming to resemble a remarkably played coming of age film which works.

Why wait that long?I admit until tonight, December 23rd 2010, I had yet to see Say Anything&#x85; Sure, I've been cited as a non-movie critic for not watching certain movies, such as this John Cusack-boombox-wielding 1980s iconic film.

I was blown away at what I thought would be a VERY dated movie. It was not, indeed.What a smart and timeless movie this was. Writer/Director Crowe (Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire) is certainly known for his soundtracks and incorporating his music into the storyline. While he doesn't make the most memorable album here, it's certainly noteworthy, especially during the sex and later-boombox scenes.Beyond the tracks, Crowe writes an intelligent and post-high school movie when most filmmakers make films of that time that involve just high school'ers and their ailments. His characters aren't brilliant, but human. His dialogue is noteworthy and sharp. And he made people who watch this for the first time, 21 years later, appreciate his work for the first time. That's talent.Lloyd (John Cusack) falls hard (in the eleventh hour of high school) for Diane (Skye) who's headed to Europe for college from her divorced dad's (Mahoney) hard work. She shares everything with her dad, even when Lloyd starts dating her&#x85;and more.He's concerned about her throwing her life away on just a boy, who happens to have a self-proclaimed aimless future. All Lloyd knows is his deep fascination and love for this very pretty and extremely smart dame.Here comes the (now &#x96; 2010) clichéd courtship, eventual downfall and (possible) reconciliation of the budding relationship and the victims along the way. Well, watch it, as I did &#x96; for the first time and see if there are really any victims.Back then, or 1989, it wasn't so much a cliché so they can't be held accountable. Take away what might seem that way today, and you'll have a great script with Cusack (both him and his sister, as usual) carrying the movie. What a model actor he is? He's surrounded by multiple, already-established talent and future talent (SEE Piven) and yet, he's the driving force of this movie. He's the one that shows true love on screen.Whether you've seen this movie a while back or considering for a first time &#x96; like me, tonight, it's thoroughly recommended. Allow yourself to remember the 80s, its wonderful tracks and what it feels like to fall in love again.Always hold onto what we cherished in the past. And always remember, we're living in memories.

By the film's end, we're neither happy that our couple has hooked up or sad that a young woman's father has been imprisoned. Instead, Crowe gives us something a bit more ambiguous a couple on a plane, nervously holding hands and waiting for a fasten seat-belts sign to flicker off. Their future destination is uncertain, their journey forever dependent on faith and trust. Cue seat-belt sign. Cut to black.8.5/10 &#x96; A good ending (always the hardest part of a romantic movie), deft writing and another likable performance by John Cusack, help elevate this above most 1980s teen flicks.

Diane's father James (John Mahoney) has landed himself in trouble for tax violations at his nursing home Diane works at, so the IRS, run by boss (Philip Baker Hall), are on to him. Diane is worried she is not spending more time with Lloyd and not enough with her father, and James obviously doesn't approve of the dating. So Diane makes a pressured decision, not long after receiving a touching love letter from Lloyd, to end it with him. Diane finds out about her father James's money stealing, and Lloyd wins her back playing a love song on his stereo radio, and they go to England together.

Cusack is great as the slacker and charmer for Skye's affections, she meanwhile is nice as the well educated Miss Priss, and Mahoney gets his moments as the concerned and not very honest father. Obviously this is filled with the usual teen movie clichés and predictable moments, but with a good cast likable cast, and a reasonable love story, this is a good fun comedy drama.

It's a lovely film with a simple plot and sincere characters. It's one of the classic '80s films that should never be forgotten.I believe the best thing about this movie is the lead character, Lloyd Dobbler. I love him; he is the sweetest movie character that comes to my mind right now. He was so well-established&#x85;John Cusack did a really spectacular job portraying him. If Lloyd were real I would love to date him. I know for sure I would not like this movie without him.His lover in the film, however, was not so impressive. I didn't really like her too much, but it seems like her interactions with other characters in the story and the descriptions of those who knew her were meant to show her as a like-able presence. To me, this is a failure. I thought she was boring, confusing at times, and annoying. I just didn't like her. I believe she is the only problem with the film, and I think she is what's keeping me from making the jump from liking this movie to loving it. Too bad.Another aspect of this film that I really liked were the extra characters, like Lloyd's friends and fellow high school graduates at the house party. They were really funny to me, and much more interesting to watch than Diane Court. His friend's obsession with Joe was really fun, haha. I loved it.The plot is simple- it's mainly the blossoming love between two teenagers and seeing if it will survive through the devastating drama of finding out a beloved father could be criminal. It's cute, easy to follow. The music is great, peppy '80s. I liked the dialogue, mainly just Lloyd's though. Everything he said felt so genuine and sweet. I loved every time he talked.So pretty much, I really like this movie a lot. Very rarely do I see a film where I wish I could date someone in it, but this is definitely one. It's a really sweet movie, a date movie perhaps.

Where's the conflict? There's really no drama, only the budding romance of Lloyd and Diane in their last summer as teenagers and the few complications that arise from it. While the last half hour or so adds a bit more, the truth is that Crowe gets you hooked on a film solely about a guy and a girl falling in love. That just shows the power of relationships in film.Say Anything... is about those two characters, played by John Cusack and Ione Skye, an unlikely couple that forms out of a desire to make the most of what little time they both have at home before entering the real world. Their chemistry is simply fantastic in being both natural and believable. Things aren't so straightforward in love, however, and the bright future on Diane's horizon and her very close relationship with her father (John Mahoney) complicate things with Lloyd.Lloyd and Diane seem perfect, and the secret is that Lloyd's a little neurotic and Diane is the smart girl that thinks no one cares about her and their union is representative of how both get what they want despite their self-perceptions. As viewers, we see our own relationship flaws in them and that's what makes them lovable.The relationship between Diane and her father is also an incredibly strong one that gets established so well at the beginning that when the slight conflict of the film arises, it has a very strong impact. That's really what makes Say Anything... an instant classic in ways, the strength of its very normal characters.Crowe's script is very real yet very profound in many ways. Up front it's about trying to make love work, but the fact that it's only about Diane and Lloyd and Diane and her father sets up a parallel between the two relationships to show how they're more alike than Diane thinks as she tries to reconcile them both. It's very simple, but really excellent on Crowe's part, and that really sums up the film.

I'm a fan of 80s romantic comedies anyway but this one was more sweet and poignant than it was a comedy I believe. John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler, a free spirit with no goals in life who has just graduated high school. He falls for Diane Cort (Ione Skye), the career driven valedictorian who is about to go off to college. They begin a relationship after Lloyd calls her and they go to a party. Diane ends up enjoying herself more than she thought she would and falls for Lloyd. The movie basically showcases Lloyd and Diane's relationship during the summer before Diane leaves. They make up, break up, begin a physical relationship, have parent drama, make up, break up, and suffer much heartbreak. But just when you think it's over for good and you think that Lloyd just doesn't want anything to do with Diane even though she won't give up on him, the two find a way to bring each other back. There are several scenes where Diane is so confused about her feelings toward Lloyd but deep down you know she truly loves him. You realize that it's just her father's personal and financial troubles that are getting in the way of hers and Lloyd's relationship. The boombox scene was a classic and it was so sweet. You cannot find that particular scene duplicated in any other film. It truly stands out. And another scene that really stands out is the scene where Lloyd and Diane are in the backseat of his car. It is just precious. I love this movie and I'm glad I bought it. I had never seen it and I saw it on sale and decided to buy it. It is a great film and should be viewed by anyone who is a fan of 80s romantic comedies or fans of John Cusack, or just fans of romantic comedies in general.

Nobody wrote dialogue for teenagers as he did. In his films they talk like actual people. (I have never written a screenplay myself but from the evidence of the sheer number of filmed screenplays, that fail absolutely at this, I would gander that it is quite difficult.) While Fast Times at Ridgemont High created his reputation, Say Anything cemented it. There simply is not a false note in the entire film. All three leads (Ione Skye, John Cusack, and John Mahoney) are pitch perfect. The situations are realistic and flow well. The support cast is also excellent. The ending is both realistic and sweet.While Say Anything is without faults, it also is not very memorable. Unlike the previous Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there are only a few scenes that stick out. It is a pleasant story and certainly worth a revisit if it has been twenty years since you saw it.I on the other hand saw for the first time a few days ago. Unfortunately, I was to busy watching movies like Less than Zero in the late eighties to see Say Anything.

Skye's character doesn't have the usual facade we see in movies like these, but her disapproving father does, and it plays itself out quite dramatically. Some of Crowe's writing is still a little precious (as in a half-hearted joke dealing with a letter-writing pen) and he's too embarrassingly enamored of rock music as everyone's salvation. The opening moments with Cusack and friends at a party are strung together rather carelessly without much guidance from Crowe (and the affection he has for these lovelorn kids doesn't quite come through), but the movie improves tremendously and becomes a confident examination of two younger people outgrowing their doubts and moving forward together.

This is a wonderful movie that I just don't know how anyone can not absolutely love when they see it. John Cusack leads the way in a role he was born to play, the humble, loyal, kind, soft, gentile, uncertain, young man with a heart of gold Lloyd Dobler. He is a likable kick-boxer with no idea about what his future may hold. It's wonderful to see a teenager like this one in a movie give a message that it's okay not to know what you want to do, as long as you go with your heart.Ione Skye is the sweet, smart, loving, warm, amorous, and don't forget, beautiful, Diane Court, who steals Lloyd's heart. She is the class valedictorian who wins a fellowship to study in England. John Mahoney is equally convincing as a loving, insightful, concerned, but overprotective father, James Court, who will do anything for his daughter, the latter which proves to be his undoing. He runs a nursing home and cares for people, but he has a dark secret that is revealed by the end of the movie.Lloyd is smitten by the beautiful Diane Court, he wants very badly to take her out. He is somewhat shy, and, as his friend points out, he has this nervous talking thing. He calls Diane, and his persistence pays off, as she seems to like his wit and tenacity and agrees to go the big graduation party with him.This is where the movie really begins, and also where we begin to identify with the characters fears, feelings, and pain. Diane is thrilled to finally be a part of the social life she missed out on, yet sad that she kept everybody at a distance. She sees what she could have, and perhaps should have, been a part of. Lloyd is scared and uncertain about the future, with no career plans. Diane's father is feeling threatened that Lloyd will take his only daughter away from him.Diane begins to fall for Lloyd because she trusts him and feels safe with him (pay close attention to the scene where he drops her off at her house after the all night party). Lloyd admires Diane because he finds her interesting, smart, and beautiful. The only problem is, Diane's father doesn't approve of Lloyd. He has the typical father's reaction no one is worthy of being with my daughter. What I loved about her father is that he isn't an idiotic parent who can't understand the feelings of his daughter or other teenagers. When Diane and Lloyd spend a night together, and she comes home late without calling, her father is upset and angry, but wise and caring enough to discuss the situation with his daughter.We later learn a secret about Diane's father, that I will not reveal, after the IRS comes knocking at his door. What made this aspect of the movie so insightful, was that it didn't make us hate Diane's father. It simply portrayed him as a good man who made a mistake. Sometimes good people can do bad things for a good reason. It doesn't make it right, but it makes it understandable. The movie makes that very clear.Say Anything's biggest strength, though, may be that it gives a subtle message about listening to your instincts. When Diane breaks up with Lloyd after being pressured by her father, we can see that she is going against her feelings. Lloyd seems to know this too, and makes a reference that she is just blindly following her father, and not her heart. This is one of the scenes that makes us fully aware Lloyd's inarticulate side, and how a lot of the time his words are being wrung from his emotions. We feel the pain that both of them are going through.Lloyd uses every tactic to get Diane back, from playing Peter Gabriel on his boom box outside her bedroom window, to long-winded (and funny) phone machine messages. Eventually, she has a change of heart, and realizes that Lloyd is everything she imagined, and her father is not. I liked when Diane went to defend her father, and an IRS agent she spoke with was kind enough to detach himself from the situation and give her advice. Don't let your father's business affect your life. He later tells her, very kindly, if not very wisely, if I were you, I would take that fellowship. When Lloyd finally wins Diane over, it is one of the film's sweetest moments, and we know that all will be well for this unlikely, wonderful pair. Perhaps the greatest line is spoken by Lloyd, when Diane tells him that nobody ever thought there relationship would work, and nobody gave it a chance, he replies You've just described every great success story. I loved that line, because it's the truth, and great writers can say it all with one line. Say Anything made me laugh, cry, and see what life is really about. It was released in the spring of 1989, the tale end of my high school career. This made me love it all the more because I could identify with teenagers and high school in the 1980's.

I've been subconsciously borrowing DVDs which has John Cusack starring in them, and this time, it's John Cusack together with one of my favorite storytellers (storyteller, cos he wrote and directed his own films) Cameron Crowe, in Crowe's directorial debut with Say Anything.From this early work, you can't help but notice the foundations laid for Crowe's later works, with the loads of music incorporated and some moving the narrative forward, and the enjoyable characters he creates - some seem so ordinary, yet so real and special, the idiosyncrasies that have, the quirky situations they're put in, the character development.Ordinary, identifiable characters have become hallmarks, and in this film, it is no different. Perhaps what made this simple story endear itself, is the chameleon John Cusack. Here, he plays average joe Lloyd Dobler, who has just graduated from high school, but has no big plans for himself in the aftermath. He's at a lost at what to do, but had stunned his cohort by dating the school sweetheart, and the brainiest scholar at that. That unattainable beauty with brains, Diane Court (Ioan Skye), the object of every schmuck's desire.But then you have her overprotective father who objects to their relationship (don't they always?) and a looming corporate scandal (like NKF's) which questions morality between two different camps of thought. The bigger picture might already seem familiar given that the boy-meets-girl-love-breakup-reconciliation theme has been done to death, but what appeals is the really witty dialogue amongst characters, despite some stuff looking out of date (hey, it's a 1989 movie after all).The Special Edition Code 1 DVD comes with so many extras, check this - 13 extended scenes (those shortened to speed up the pace, so it's included here instead), 10 deleted scenes (those that didn't make the final cut, which explained in more detail certain subplots like the corporate scandal cum investigation), and 5 alternate scenes.

She ends up with all the attention once again. And back to Lloyd--while success in life is defined for us by the media, culture, and unfortunately, our families, Lloyd defies it all to be a true success. Everyone likes him (even if they don't get why he and Diane are together), and he's just so real.He's thought about life and made decisions, they just aren't what anyone else may have decided for him. It's an interesting contrast to Mr. Cort, who has the material success that Lloyd lacks, but is completely devoid of integrity. Lloyd is vulnerable and completely masculine all at once. I think it was very honest the way Diane felt so betrayed by her dad and didn't even know if she wanted to see him.

She is a pretty young girl who only has been focused on her studies and didn't had a social life.

Cusack is just terrific. Although it isn't a typical feel good movie, what is it that makes this movie worth seeing? It's the honesty of it. It isn't the typical perfect story of two perfect people who meet, fall in love and live happily ever after. It is a realistic and recognizable story about two young people, finding their way through life and trying to make the right choices.It isn't a typical feel good movie, but it does make you feel good. That's what is so great about the Cameron Crowe movies They are all very honest and recognizable.If you liked this one, I absolutely advice you to see Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, two other great movies of Crowe's hand.Say Anything... is a must see, certainly for Cusack fans.

It deals with real issues like teen love and hard choices in a serious and in a manner with which we can relate to. John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler. He's not your typical man because most of his friends are women and he does live with his sister. Also Lloyd doesn't have any career plans except kick-boxing. His dreams all lie in a honor student, Diane Court(played by Ione Skye). Diane is a Straight A student with a scholarship to a university in England. She's very beautiful but doesn't realize it because she's so strenuously involved with her studies and dedication to her father(John Mahoney). Her father, later in this movie, will come upon hard times as he will have to deal with the IRS and being incarcerated. Lloyd and Diane eventually begin seeing each other and do fall in love but when Diane's father tells her not to have any attachments or distractions going to England, Diane breaks up with Lloyd in his own car. Perhaps one of the most engaging sayings of this movie lies after wards when Lloyd(soaking wet) is standing in a phone booth talking to his sister. I gave her my heart.... she gave me a pen... His character is so sincere we fall in love with him. We hope and pray during the second half of the movie that both of them will get back together. Every thought is carefully plotted out until the very end. Both John Cusack and Ione Skye are brilliant and if you haven't seen this movie yet go out and buy it. Yes, buy it because you won't be disappointed you did.

Lloyd doesn't even know what he wants to do now that he's out of high school, while Diane has it all figured out. She even received, and accepted, a fellowship to attend college in England. Though they both know this, Lloyd and Diane begin to get pretty serious, and end up falling in love. However, Diane's father James (John Mahoney) soon becomes wound up in financial problems, and Diane decides that, with all the trouble and her leaving soon to England, it would be best for her and Lloyd to split up. This decision devastates the both of them, but maybe it ends up being for the best... or maybe not.SAY ANYTHING... could very well be the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's actually more of a romantic drama than a comedy, but whatever. Instead of most modern romantic comedies that are about nothing more than puppy love, this film instead focuses on real love and strong bonds and relationships. The story is extremely sweet, almost so much so that it would have made an inevitably cheesy movie, but it didn't. It's carried out perfectly, and I literally can't find a single flaw in the execution. There are tons of memorable scenes, namely the classic boombox scene, which is incredibly sweet and touching and even made me cry.The acting in this movie is exceptional. John Cusack is absolutely perfect as the hero Lloyd, creating the movie's most likable character, and I'm sure he made many women wish they could find a guy just like him. Ione Skye and James Mahoney also put in wonderful performances, and many of the members of the supporting cast are good and fun as well. But I definitely think Lloyd steals the show.In short, SAY ANYTHING... is, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies made so far, and certainly the best one I've ever seen. The story is timeless and sweet, and hopefully will hold up as the definitive classic it has been regarded as. 8.5/10.

Today's teen movies generally fall into one of two categories 1) farces that involve crude jokes, body humor, excessive sexual innuendo, and characters that exemplify the worst teen vices (think Slackers or National Lampoon's Van Wilder), and 2) chick flicks that involve stereotype boy-meets-girl, popular-falls-for-outcast types that rely on emotionally manipulative the most vulnerable of viewers, and sickening the rest of us (think A Walk to Remember or She's All That). The movie Not Another Teen Movie sought to poke fun at this nonsensical trend, and it saddened me. Because there was a time and era where likeable characters, a solid romance, real drama, and a basis in reality were the staple of teen movies, and Joel Schumacher's `Say Anything' was the hallmark of that time.The basic premise here is that John Cusack's Lloyd Dobler, a teenage kickboxer and eternal optimist underachiever who has just graduated high school, is desirous of dating the lovely valedictorian Diane Court, a girl who has never allowed herself to have any real fun outside of her academic studies. Dobler is well-liked, but he's seen as a slacker, a guy who everyone knows and can turn to, but who has no real future. But he crackles with nervous energy and a belief that he and Diane are meant for one another, if he can just get her to spend some time with him. The only major obstacle for him, aside from Diane's plans to attend college in England at the summer's end, is her overprotective father, who sees Lloyd as nothing more than a mere 'distraction.'The title `Say Anything' refers to two things Lloyd's penchant for fast-talking his way in and out of unpleasant situations (he'll 'say anything' to get what he wants), and Diane's father's motto that his daughter can 'say anything' to him, that no secrets will be hidden between them. It's a movie not just about love and confidence, but also about trust, and Diane is the central figure. Lloyd gives her absolute love and trust, and her father tries to do the same thing, so the movie is very much about the competition between the two of them. And the final resolution is both atypical and satisfying. There is no easy ending, no `father completely accepts Lloyd' or `father tries his best to foil Lloyd but ends up with his foot in his mouth.' I won't ruin the ending, but suffice to say, it will leave you content if somewhat disillusioned (you'll have to see what I mean here, but there's lots of warmth and fuzziness!).I don't know what's more memorable, the scenes (Lloyd holding a boombox belting out Peter Gabriel's `In Your Eyes') or the lines (the now famous `I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen!'). But this is a must watch, with friends, lovers, or family. I can't imagine anyone but the most hard-hearted who won't fall in love with this movie. It is, simply, put, a story as well cast as it is written and told.Grade A "},{"Title":"Stands up surprisingly well...","Date":"19 February 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  2004/02/15 I just viewed this film again and was surprised at how pleasing it is after all these years.

If not for the chance to see what a real teen romance is, then I recommend this film soley for the scene where John Cusack stands outside Diane's window blasting Peter Gabriel.

For me, Casablanca is the greatest romance movie of all time, but running a close second for me is Cusack and Skye in Say Anything..., a movie that walks the thin line of being a teeny-bopper romance flick, a goofball comedy, and an insightful view on the relationships between a boy and girl. Say Anything... not only walks this line, but practically dances on it the way Gene Kelly would in Singin' in the Rain, with exhuberance, style, and an overall feeling of joy.The chemistry between John Cusack as the immortal Lloyd Dobbler and Ione Skye as the envious Diane Court is unlike any romance film made with in the past fifty to sixty years. Lately, romance films have been giving us chemistry, but no reason to get behind the lovers and want to see them blossom. This task is flawlessly handled by Cameron Crowe, who gives perfect definition as to why the couple should be together. They open new worlds to each other, he shows her a world outside of books like she's been used to and she, in return, realizes that he is more than some average joe with no recognizable future prospects. Apart, they are talented, but together, they're connection is luminous.I have seen this movie nearly one hundred times and have never tired of it. Not only is this a wonderful romance for the ages, but it is also a clever teenage film, showing the teens in this movie as deep, thoughtful, occasionally exaggerated, but we were all like that at that age, that's what sets them apart from the Freddie Prinze Jrs and Julia Stiles of today. The teens in movies today (outside of American Beauty) have become charicatures. In Say Anything..., they are a world within themselves and we become the priviliged tourists to take pictures as we pass by.Say Anything... is a cult classic now, but as history progresses and movies become video discs in a library some where in the distant future, this one should stand out like Jane Austin and William Shakespeare do today in that this movie analyzes the youth of our time and treats them with the respect and intelligence that they deserve.

The best thing about this movie is that there is actually heartbreak in it and that Diane doesn't come out better than she did before. As good as this movie was, I did have a gripe with it. Everyone who saw it saw Lloyd as average. HE WASN'T AVERAGE, he just thought he was. Think about it. He is this great guy who is responsible. (Think about the party scene where he is the keymaster.) He wants to be a kickboxer and he cares about people more than most people do.(Remember when he drove around Seattle all night just to take that guy home?) He is also very loyal and dedicated. Think of all that bull-s-h-i-t that he had to put with from Diane and her dad. A normal guy would've quit on her, but not him but Cameron Crowe did such a good job writing the Lloyd character that we actually start to believe that Lloyd is average. In spite of this suckering by Crowe and Cusack who is f'n amazing in this movie, I still love it and hope that this movie is not forgotten. I'm doing my part by lending my DVD copy out to anyone willing to watch it.

I thought it was going to be some dopey teen movie, and the only reason I watched it was because it had John Cusack and was directed by Cameron Crowe. I had no idea how perfect this movie really was. When I say perfect, I mean it is perfect. I can't think of one thing wrong with it.Upon just hearing the storyline, most people would think Say Anything was just another stereotypical teen movie. In reality, I think Say Anything is the ANTI-TEEN MOVIE. It's a love story between two characters who are completely different. The girl is smart and serious and doesn't have much of a social life. The guy is a bit of a jock, really cool, and a kickboxer. There's one thing that makes Say Anything different from all other films that seems so similar. What makes it different is how real the movie is. None of the dialogue is forced or overdone. It's all written so realistically. You could almost imagine that Cameron Crowe just set up a tape recorder around a bunch of people and wrote the script based on the words that came out of their mouth. Say Anything is totally believable as a real life story (it probably helps that part of it is based on Crowe's own life).For anyone that's a fan of John Cusack, you must drop everything you're doing and rent this movie RIGHT NOW! Cusack has never topped his performance as Lloyd in Say Anything. Cusack is hilarious when he delivers his long nervous rambling monologues. He's universally cool when he does his back and forth horse-around scenes with the young actor who plays his nephew. But perhaps Cusack's best acting in this movie comes when he doesn't have any lines at all. I'm talking about his one shot close up while holding a stereo over his head, playing the Peter Gabriel song In Your Eyes. Even after 13 years, it's still one of the all time greatest movie moments.Cameron Crowe is an amazing director, but an even better screenwriter. His brilliant script is what really makes Say Anything work. Out of a possible rating of 10, I give Say Anything 10.1.Also be sure to watch for the quick cameo of Stone Gossard from Pearl Jam.

There is a small scene late in the film, when Jim Court(played by John Mahoney) goes to buy luggage for his daughter's trip to England. Unfortunately, he can't because of a problem with his account, and after the embarrassing scene that results, the film cuts to a scene of him sitting in his bathtub, fully clothed, clearly struggling with a situation that's gotten out of hand.I mention it because Jim Court is posited as the antagonist in the burgeoning love affair between his daughter(the ravishing Ione Skye) and Lloyd Dobler, the fast-talking, kick-boxing kid who gets Diane to go out with him just by calling her up. 99 teen romance films out of 100 would go out of their way to paint a disapproving parent in the worst possible light, hoping to win our emotional support for the romance by showing what hurdles it must overcome. Cameron Crowe, though, is wise enough to realize it doesn't work like that-- love, especially young love, has plenty of obstacles of its own, and our parents might object, but they still love us, and their opinions ought to be valued. Jim Court does something very foolish, but the movie doesn't vilify him-- it paints him as a caring man who made a mistake out of love. That ability to empathize with every character is what makes Crowe such a gifted screenwriter, and that level of caring and insight into Lloyd, Diane, Jim, and the rest is what makes Say Anything one of the very best movies about young love that's ever been made.

No real belly laughs, but there are some chuckles in the movie.  The movie delivers on the romantic sentimentality.  The relationships are a little more mature than typical High School romances.  Lloyd isn't trying to get to second base with his dream girl, he knows he is in love with her, he is trying to get her forever.  The girl lives with her father, and of course, the father wants nothing but the best for the daughter, which doesn't include Lloyd.  But, this conflict is also mature.

I just can't get enough of it...it is by far my favorite. And it has developed quite a cult following in my circle of female friends. To us, this movie is not just a heartwarming, mature romance about young people. It serves as a model for how love is really supposed to be...and what we want, and deserve, in a relationship.Lloyd Dobler is an institution. As his best friend Corey would say, in a world full of guys, Lloyd is a man. In my little world, the name Lloyd has become synonymous with the perfect guy . When a friend dates someone new, I ask, is he a Lloyd? And she knows exactly what I mean.Cameron Crowe's script is phenomenal and his use of music, as always, is jaw-droppingly perfect. Thanks to this movie, In Your Eyes is now not just a great song by Peter Gabriel, but an anthem that pleads with you to believe in love for Lloyd's sake.There are plenty of laughs and well-written scenes in the depiction of Lloyd and Diane's high school peers. Who will ever forget Corey's songs about Joe (That'll never be me), or the drunk guy found in the bathroom? (Look at this gentleman here), or even the infamous Gas 'n Sip pow-wow with Lloyd's friends (THAT was a mistake). The real magic of the movie, though, is in the falling-in-love scenes (and later, in Lloyd's heartbroken despair over their unexpected breakup).In small gestures, Lloyd, with no ulterior motive other than to love Diane, comes across as a gentleman. The instances are many the scene where he points out some glass for her to walk around; when he offers her Bavarian Dutch-Style Pretzels? in his car; or, sadly, when he pulls over to give her his full attention when he knows she has something to say....only to have her break his heart with a teary goodbye that leaves him dumbfounded.I gave her my heart and she gave me a....pen, he says, and no more words are needed. We know that he has known love, he has been given a gift that was taken away and it will never be the same for him.Lucky for Lloyd, Diane realizes how wonderful he is...how rare is the gift that they have found. And they are reunited in the end, because they can't, won't stay apart from each other.Lloyd Dobler may be a fictional character...but he is also the dream of real love. The underdog who gets the girl. The boy next door who captures your heart. And Lloyd is a Lloyd, in my humble opinion.-Rosegirl (Elyse)Say Anything 10/10 stars.

Still, as confused films go, this is one of the better ones. Perhaps I am being too critical, and the problem is not so much with the style as with my expectations. I was looking for something rather silly (in the vein of Sixteen Candles or Better Off Dead). What I found was dramatically different. The pacing is different, as is the film itself (by which I mean the actual type of film on which the scenes were recorded) with the outcome seeming rather like a disorganized British television program. Not what I expected at all. In any event, if the goal was comedy, the movie is a colossal failure in that respect (a la Silver Streak, The Frisco Kid, Being There), but there is one particularly funny line in the movie that bears emphasis. Cusack's character has had his heart broken. We see him driving around alone, speaking (notes to self) into a tape recorder and trying to make sense of it all. He decides to seek advice from the guys who hang out outside the Gas N Sip. They dispense their advice, and the whole interaction turns out to be a waste of time. Then we cut to Cusack back in the car and speaking, deadpan, into his tape recorder, That was a mistake. The editing and the delivery of the line are perfect, and this is clearly the biggest laugh in the movie, but the line could also have been referring to Crowe's decision to have three of the (very white) guys in that scene do a rap. This was very big in movies in 1989, but that was a mistake. More generally, the music in the movie is very bad, or at least the original music is. It's hard to ignore. But Take Five and In Your Eyes are both very good songs in my opinion, and are featured (the latter quite unforgettably) in the film as well. The use of rain during the crying scene is a bit tired Hey, let's try In Cold Blood. All the critics loved that, but maybe it was the best thing to cover up Cusack's weakness at acting very sad. And Ione Skye is just not a particularly good actress, period. One other thing &#150; Cusack plays one of these characters who speaks like he's under the balcony with Cyrano at his ear. Naturally, this detracts from the plausibility of the character, but if you can suspend your disbelief about that little detail, it's very easy to enjoy this movie. It's not great, but it's worth a look.

Boy gets girl back again. This formula for a romantic comedy is all right when all you want to do is pass the time watching a mildly amusing movie. But when it is one of the movies listed in Steven Jay Schneider's 1001 Movies You Must See before You Die, you expect a little more. I suspect it is the fact that Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this movie that mesmerized critics into thinking it was something special.In addition to the formula noted above, this movie also employs the standard Hollywood device of having a woman forced to make a choice between love and something else, and then when she chooses love, as the formula requires, she ends up getting the something else too. Usually, the woman's choice is between a boring but respectable man whom her family approves of and who will be able to provide for her in comfort, and a charming man that she loves but who is poor and irresponsible. But when she decides to marry the poor guy, it turns out he has all the money. The movie French Kiss (1995) would be an example of this.In this movie, the woman is Diane, and she herself is the boring but respectable person whom her father, Mr. Court, approves of and who will be able to provide for herself in comfort owing to the fact that she is on her way to having a successful career after she gets out of college. This constitutes a slight variation in the formula. In any event, she must choose between her own education/career and Lloyd, the poor and irresponsible guy she loves whose idea of a career is that of being a kickboxer. Of course, there are movies in which a woman must choose between a career and a husband, but it is usually a glamorous career like show business, as in Imitation of Life (1959), not the kind of respectable career that Diane is pursuing.Actually, Lloyd's charm wears a little thin. He is living with his sister, who is a single mom, and he gets on her nerves with his antics. She makes a mark for the volume knob on his boom box, beyond which level he must not go, because it disturbs the neighbors. But he apparently does not care about that, because later in the movie, he takes the boom box and plays his and Diane's song at volume ten near her house in the middle of the night to prove his love for her, probably waking up all the neighbors on the block. It is one thing to be irresponsible. It is another thing to be an inconsiderate jerk. One wonders just how long Diane is going to put up with him, especially since his plan seems to be to just let her support him, as when he tells her father, What I want to do for a living is be with your daughter. I guess you could say that in this movie it is the man who chooses between having a glamorous career like kickboxing and just being a house husband.Presumably as a way of avoiding the obvious formulaic nature of this film, a little trouble for Mr. Court with the Internal Revenue Service is added in. It begins rather melodramatically, with a couple of IRS agents showing up at his house at night. In real life, an auditor would begin his investigation by showing up at Court's place of business, which is a nursing home, and asking to see the books. In a subsequent scene, an IRS agent does show up at the nursing home and asks ominous questions like, Your income, Mr. Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years&#x85;. Why would you stay so long with an operation that is clearly not a growth enterprise? Wow! Isn't that incriminating!By this time, we are starting to think that the IRS agents are absurd caricatures, and that Court will be vindicated in the end. But it turns out that Court really is guilty. However, if he has been stealing money from his patients, then it would seem he is in more trouble than just not paying his taxes. There should still be fraud charges to deal with. But the movie glosses over that.Once we accept that Court is guilty of defrauding his nursing home patients, there are further incongruities that the movie presents without explaining. For example, Court goes to a store to buy some luggage, but all his credit cards are rejected. At the same time, Diane discovers thousands of dollars in cash squirreled away in a drawer. So, why didn't Court use the cash to buy the luggage? Cash leaves no tracks, and even the IRS would not have been aware of that purchase.Beyond that, the movie seems to at first to suggest that Court was stealing all that money in order to provide for his daughter, and so we are supposed to like him for that. But then it turns out that he was using all of his ill-gotten gains to buy collectibles, like a nine thousand dollar juke box. In other words, he's an idiot. The function of this IRS subplot is to break the excessive attachment between father and daughter so that she is free to leave him for Lloyd. But calling in the Feds so that a girl can leave home and marry the boy she loves is a bit much.

It's a nice film, but certainly not a significant film or a very memorable film. After analyzing it, I think I know the main reason why.Lloyd is infatuated with, and then falls in love with, Diane Court (Ione Skye). For this film to work well, the viewer has to feel that this love is memorable, if not amazing. Lloyd is a nice guy. He has little ambition. But he has this idea that it would be a dream come true if he could get the beautiful, intelligent Diane to go out with him.Diane, as the object of Lloyd's obsession, has to be worthy of that obsession. And this is where the film falls short for me. She is a nice girl. A good girl. A dutiful daughter, academically successful in high school, blah blah blah plain vanilla. I don't see how she justifiably inspires the passion that Lloyd feels for her. Why not? Because she displays little passion herself.Think about it. She has some big issues to contend with. Her valedictorian speech. Life after school (that she is afraid of). Going away to college. A future career. But do we hear her talk passionately about any of them? She is rather docile and meek.When it comes to her feelings for Lloyd, that is where the passion should be apparent. Maybe she was intentionally underplaying it, but the first time she admits she loves Lloyd it is almost an aside, a throw-away line. And he calls her on it. Later, a montage of kissing scenes shows us that they are getting more involved. But do we ever see her proclaim her love the way Lloyd does with the boom box? Speaking of the boom box scene, it is an iconic image, but it falls flat within the story. It starts to sizzle, but fizzles.I can see how this film might appeal more to women. Lloyd is a nice guy they can feel something for. Some guys probably look up to Lloyd as a guy who goes after what he wants. But I feel the object of his desires should be an amazing girl, not just a nice girl.The message boards contain some differences of opinion on this topic. It is a matter of personal opinion, based upon one's personal outlook.The film does a good job of veering from the fairytale path that some teen romances take. And it has a wonderful cast, filled with interesting appearances--like Bebe Neuwirth in her film debut. Unfortunately, it feels like the rest of her performance hit the cutting room floor.This film is okay, but for me it does not evoke universal feelings like most films by John Hughes.

His film pulls the rug out from under most examples of its kind, presenting a High School romance with genuine emotional appeal and with two believable characters an ambitious valedictorian worried about her image as a 'priss' and a hyper-tense but gallant kickboxer (the sport of the future, so he says) with no clear idea where life is taking him. It's as close to an honest depiction of first love as you're likely to see from Hollywood, but the real heart of the film is Ione Skye's trusting relationship with her father (John Mahoney), who may seem too good to be true (because he isn't). Skye's choice between loving father and loyal boyfriend is ultimately made for her by the IRS, but otherwise the film is a welcome relief from the empty packages usually sold to teen moviegoers these days.

It's worth watching if only to watch a few of these scenes alone. Lloyd, our main character, is an atypical leading man. Even more so if you consider the movie's setting. He's not quite total geek, loser, yet he's not quite total campus stud, jock, rebel. He's kind off on a totally different tangent. That's what makes him interesting. And so Cameron Crowe gives those of us, who were also never on either extreme in the high school social food chain, someone to relate to.Can't say the same for Ione Skye's character, however. She's a beautiful valedictorian, but Crowe keeps it realistic.Don't expect a strong story line...watch this for the characters and intimacy between them, and the lack of predictability.

The film by Cameron Crowe is an enduring, romantic piece that can make even the faintest of heart believe in all the possibilities that love has to offer. This all begins with the acting.John Cusack and Ione Skye give fantastic performances, and bring these characters of Lloyd Dobler, and Diane Court to life. Many women still believe in finding a guy like Lloyd Dobler, and that's because John Cusack and Cameron Crowe created a character filled with depth and sensitivity. A character that has his flaws, but still believes in finding something, something that will give him direction and a place in this world, and that something is Diane Court, played by Ione Skye. Although, her character makes questionable decisions at times and the fashion choices show all the big hats we dread to think of today, as ever wearing, the character still isn't one dimensional. She is conflicted not knowing how to break away from her overprotective father and create a life for her own. A father, that is played by John Mahoney, who creates a great portrayal of a man who wants to be everything to his daughter, because he fears that in any moment, she could stop being his, and he would be left alone. Although, the character does not always act honorably, well neither does anyone else in this world. The Boombox scene is infamous by now, being parodied constantly, and spoofed in random unfunny comedies. Although,considered a stalking type of behavior now, watching Lloyd Dobler hold a boom box up to Diane Court's room is easily one of the best romantic moments of all time. It could have easily been cheesy and stupid, but the facial expressions by John Cusack, made us feel for Lloyd and want him to hold that boom box playing Peter Gabriel's In your eyes, one more second Say Anything is a movie for the ages. When Lloyd's friends tell him not to be a guy to be a man, in that moment it was clear that this movie would stay throughout time as a classic '80s movie. A movie that didn't need to resort to sex to make it a staple romantic film. Instead, it was well written, and beautifully acted and deserves to be remembered.

His character is the reverse of Cusack's Lloyd. Lloyd has outward flaws (lack of ambition, direction) that really don't matter because he is, at heart, as great a guy as a guy can be.

John Cusack's character is different and less ambitious than Ione Skye's, but he's not a deatbeat; Ione Skye's character is the perfect girl, but she doesn't feel satisfied; John Mahoney's character (it was refreshing seeing him in a role other than Fraser's dad) is not stereotypically protective of his daughter, doesn't immediately consider Lloyd a deadbeat, and actually has his own problems. From looking at the synopsis (high-schooler seeks unattainable beauty, but overprotective father gets in the way), it doesn't seem very different from other films. But, as I'm sure others have said, it is in its realism that this film succeeds.I'm seventeen, and have grown extremely annoyed by the films targeted to teens that incorporate themes of love (maybe it's just me, but my experiences in this area haven't exactly been the most light-hearted).

The film actually shows a Designated Driver as needed and fitting in the social circle when Lloyd is drafted as Keymaster.  The two lovers in SAY ANYTHING both have their rough edges but are committed to each other, regardless of the Dollar $ign$ that most people have as the ultimate bottom line.  The parents of teens are shown as best bud- wannabe or out in distant left field which leads to joys and frustrations on both sides of the parent-child relationship.  Crowe catches a great song IN YOUR EYES as performed by Peter Gabriel and uses it to maximum potential in the film.  I've never been to Seattle but seeing it as a backdrop in this highly memorable work was quite an enticement.  Taking a risk with life means that you dare to lose a lot, but the open-ended conclusion allows us to view the couple as just getting a start from that summer of true love.

He makes Lloyd and Diane two intelligent people who are interested in each other because of their differences and can appreciate each other because of those differences. I'd have to say my favorite line is what I want to do for a living is I want to be with your daughter I'm good at that. My friends and I freak out every time we see Lloyd standing outside Diane's window holding up the jukebox playing In your eyes. There was question about that on Who wants to be a  millionaire the contestant got it wrong but afterwards Regis called it one of the most romantic scenes of all time and I'd have to agree with that statement.

He isn't an unreasoning jealous monster.  The relationship between him and his daughter is very realistic.  It was hard for me to get the image of his character on Frasier out of mind for a while but he did a good job in Say Anything.Lloyd's love interest was portrayed a little weakly though.  The movie sets her up well as a sheltered daughter but doesn't really give her a huge amount of depth.By the way, I love the comic relief characters.  Lloyd's friends are hilarious.  One of them wonderfully foreshadows Alanis Morrisette's powerhouse of the woman scorned You Oughta Know with the 65 songs she writes about her old boyfriend.As always in 80s movies, the fashions can steal the show.

He should be consumed by his adoration and the object of his affection.  He is romantic, devoted, basic, and attentive.  He realizes the meaning of everything that happens between the two of them.  He realizes that he is only as good as Diane believes him to be.

The geeky loser Lloyd falls in love with the unobtainable dream woman Diane ... and he gets her almost immediately. Her father is over-protective and reluctant to let her date ... but he lets her this time. And so on. Constantly, we wait for the real action, but it just never happens. The characters overcome their obstacles too easily.The drama is supposed to hinge on the fact that while Diane shares such a close relationship with her father that she can `say anything' to him, he is holding from her the deepest, darkest secret of all. But again, when this secret is finally revealed, the effect is anti-climactic rather than bracing. The languid pace, which worked better in Crowe's earlier film 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' (qv), makes the film seem leaden and episodic, and bring the tone perilously close to `After School Special'.John Cusack wanders around with very little to get his teeth into. Ione Skye is a perpetually dazed and listless heroine, reciting her lines as if from an autocue. There are some funny and interesting incidental characters, but the fact they are so inessential to the story and have no well-developed character arc makes it difficult to care much about them (much the same as 'Notting Hill' (qv) ). Lili Taylor as the lovelorn guitarist Corky is the best of these, which makes it even more of a shame that her part seems so tangental.After the edgy and funny 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' (qv), this is a real disappointment. The dreadfully dated late 80's hair band sound-track doesn't help matters at all. Unlike many teen films of a similar vintage, such as 'Heathers' (qv), 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' (qv), and John Cusack's 'Better Off Dead' (qv) it hasn't weathered the years well.Go and watch Crowe's excellent 'Almost Famous' or his uneven but entertaining 'Singles' again instead.

No particular reason why, I just do. There would seem little point in making a movie about my preference though unless there's some kind of interesting rationale behind it.There are tons of guy meets girl stories out there. If anyone had a mind to, they could tell the exact same story over and over again, changing only the names and faces of the people concerned. Generally though, any romance movie tries to have a different element to its story that makes it stand out. The reason this felt so bland is that, if you took away the pleasing efforts of the actors involved, there weren't enough quirks in the tale - and that's because the people it was happening to were all too ordinary and sensible!It's not that what transpires is at all unbelievable, it's just that if I'm watching a work of fiction and I feel that I know people who've said and done EXACTLY the same things, then the entertainment experience becomes ordinary - and I want to see something different in a way that justifies the large-scale expansion of being developed for the big screen.

I couldn't vibe on the chemistry between Lloyd and Diane.I can't quite put my finger on it but it doesn't really resonate with me the way it seems to with other people.That being said, it has it's moment and there were some stand out moments from side characters your an inspiration Lloyd...you should go on the 700 Club and the Gas N' Sip guys.Watch just to say you did. "},{"Title":"Terrible, terrible stuff....","Date":"1 March 2012","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Like a bad car accident, every time this movie turns up on TV I am compelled to watch it and revel in its awfulness. I originally saw this one in a theater in 1989, and what I remember most from that experience was laughing hysterically at the dad sitting in his bathtub with his clothes on, sobbing about his credit cards getting cut up. I actually thought that was supposed to be a comedic moment until I realized I was the only one in the theater laughing and my friend who I went to the movie with was looking at me like I was deranged. But I couldn't help it, it was too damn funny! Now lets cover some of the more obvious plot-holes and blunders... Wasn't it oh-so-satisfying to see these teens being so concerned about drunk-driving that they give all their car-keys to a 'keymaster' at the party, which they aren't allowed to get back until they've spent the entire night getting blotto, because as we all know at the crack of dawn everyone automatically sobers up. Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to drive home at 1am, after having a couple beers, better to confiscate their keys until 7am when they've had 15 more beers....Now here's the biggest problem.. why, oh why, would a cool trenchcoat-mafia-type like Lloyd Dobbler have any interest in the stuck up puritan girl, and why does everyone else seem to think she's out of his league when in fact it's entirely the other way around? Lloyd is supposed to be the 'loser' because he 'doesnt know what he wants to do after highschool'? Here's an idea, Lloyd, why don't you spend your post-highschool life hanging out with people who don't have cardboard-cutout personalities, and haven't spent their entire highschool lives trying to please their dad and their teachers and every other adult in the world... you know, like Jeremy Piven and the 'Gas and Sip' crew, and thanking your lucky stars you never have to fraternize with any more status-quo worshipping WASPs like 'Diane Court' ever again?! I still can't figure out what was with the Dad and his subplot of ripping off old people. Were we supposed to feel sorry for him, or be mad at him, or not give a crap one way or another? Because the latter is how it affected me. In the end Dobbler actually accompanies Diane to England where you can be sure they will spend all of their time sipping tea and admiring fancy doylies, rather than catching a raucous footy match... As the audience we're supposed to be satisfied with that and happy for poor Lloyd who's coming directly out of highschool and aspiring for a life in which every drop of personality has been terminally squeezed out of him. Lloyd, you'd be better off selling something processed than running off to some bizarre Mary Poppinsesque fantasy with your chronically frigid girlfriend. Seriously, what kind of guy in his right mind would relentlessly stalk such a boring girl? And why would everyone else in the highschool, sporting the latest in new-wave and nascent grunge fashion, bow down to the supposed superiority of the illustrious valedictorian Diane Court? The movie establishes that through their highschool careers they hung around in different cliques, but can't seem to explain why that would be, since now that Lloyd is acting as middleman, Diane isn't just accepted in the cool crowd, she's revered, and considered to be TOO GOOD for the cool crowd! Maybe if Lloyd and Diane had smoked a joint and got silly with the Gas N Sip crew it would've been enough of a shoehorn for this to work, but as it is, it's just a mess. The moral of this story seems to be that unless you're a glad-handing junior republican, you are a misfit and a loser who deserves to have low self-esteem, and your only hope for redemption entails a full-time commitment to wholly embracing your potential for sheer whiteness. I liked Fast Times, although it has its share of problems, and I especially liked Wild Life, but it seems like with Say Anything, Crowe wants to compete with John Hughes by offering something 'meaningful'. He fails miserably in that, probably because the material he's trying to copy isn't any less contrived than this knock-off. When I read that Kirk Cameron was originally considered for the role of Lloyd Dobbler, the whole thing finally made sense to me. This movie was supposed to be a bland Christian allegory, but the lead was tragically miscast in John Cusack.

Although Say Anything... isn't any kind of great movie, Cameron Crowe brings the same interesting aspect to everything that he brought to Jerry Maguire. If nothing else, the movie is a look at Seattle. Still, I wonder just how many movies about relationships there can be (obviously, so many that a few years ago, we had Not Another Teen Movie).

Crowe did an excellent job making the main characters believeable and interesting, making it very easy to get caught up in their emotions.  This movie brings tears to my eyes every time I see it as it is extremely easy to relate to Cusack's character, especially if you have ever gone through anything similar to the events that transpire between Lloyd and Diane. Everyone always talks about the famous scene involving the Boom Box, but to me the most memorable part of this movie can be narrowed down to one line She Gave me a pen.  I Gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.  I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, if you can't relate to it right now, you will someday. "},{"Title":"Anything.

I heard it was a tear-jerker, but it certainly didn't work that way for me. Never during the movie did I doubt they would get back together after being separated... what surprised me was how the movie was resolved. The father was too easily turned into a villain at the end. Maybe not a villain in the sense of a man in black, but it still made the final resolution a little too easy. To see the real conflict between Diane and her father as she's torn between him and Lloyd dissolve was disappointing. I was expecting a more Romeo and Juliet type ending but I should have realized that Cameron Crowe movies never turn out bad. Despite my qualms, here were a great many touching moments and scenes. I just didn't like the way Diane's father was pushed aside.

He's Mr. Nice Guy and I have never been disappointed in any of his movies.  He's also underrated, dammit.  It's hard to get an audience to identify with your character, but he does it all the time and makes it look really easy.  Oh, and Ione Sky was cool too and so was John Mahoney.

For one hour and forty minutes, the viewer is allowed to step into the lives of a handful of very interesting characters. Strangely enough, one of the most interesting characters turns out to be the father of the lead female character.  In most boy-meets-girl flicks, the girl's father is merely an obstacle between the young lovers, but in Say Anything... we are shown a real person who is completely developed.  In short, this is a great film that will live on despite whatever it has been dated by.  At its core are some universal truths that will never be dated.

I felt that the sure thing was a much better and more interesting movie. SA just lacked depth,and the dialogue was not up to the level of TST.I also felt that Zuniga was far better than Ione.Cusack was Cusack. SA gave us no indication of why or where Cusack's desire to date Ione came from-and why suddenly now that school was over?Ione also did not show any real depth of feeling.Want to see depth of feeling-watch Zuniga storm out of the party in L.A in a jealous rage shouting out a list of all the things that annoy her about Cusack!Or when she cringes in horror as the English Prof starts to read out loud to the class Cusack's essay called the sure thing.Or when they fight and really go at it at the punch bowl and so on. Ione is just not capable of really putting across the difficult emotions. So,while I thought SA was a nice movie,I wouldn't watch it over again.Whereas I would watch TST over and over no problem.

I hope it's good","Date":"21 October 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" No I wasn't born in the early 80s. I'm a guy that's 38 and I was born in 1975. In 1989 I remember being so excited for movies that year. Batman, Karate Kid Part III, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbuster 2, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, License to Kill, Back to the Future Part II, Christmas Vacation, The Wizard, there were many movies that year I really anticipated. My friends and I spent hours on our Nintendo, Sega and even that ditzy early Gameboy system.Say Anything..., was not one of the movies I looked forward to or even remember hearing about. I don't even remember any of my friends talking about this flick. Now granted I was a young kid, but not a little kid, I was in 8th grade and 13 through most of the year, turned 14 in December. I started high school in the fall of 1989 and I don't even remember *anyone* ahead of me talking about this movie. Not. One. Single. Person. What happened? Why did I miss this supposedly great teen movie? Flash forward to the 2000s when 80s nostalgia is rampant, suddenly this film is on the top of everyone's lists as some sort of life altering game changer. Huh? Why didn't this pop up on my radar? I remember Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Lost Boys, License to Drive, but Say Anything...,just wasn't one of them. I even remember adult romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally, but again not Say Anything...Is there anyone else close to my age that never saw this movie? I've spent years avoiding this supposedly great film from the last year of the 80s b/c I've always felt like some super weirdo for being old enough and being in the right demographic to know about Say Anything...but never watching it or never EVEN HEARING ABOUT IT till the early 2000s when 80s nostalgia documentaries would air on VH1 or something.OK I finally picked this up on Blu-ray and I'm going to finally get around watching this long admired film that slipped past my radar in a popcorn movie obsessed year of 1989. Just by the clips I've seen over the years and the cover art, there was no way in hell this film could have competed with any of the other flicks I mentioned for the person I was at that time. Go to the arcades and play the Ninja Turtle game or watch a movie about people in college in a sappy chick flick? And yes I did venture out of my usual circle of friends occasionally back then too, in the fall of 1989 and the spring of 1990 I took some classes with people older then me and did a summer camp in both 1989 and 1990 with people even 4 or 5 years older then me. NOBODY back then talked about this film. Not even the girls. It almost feels like around the early 2000s everybody decided to retcon what they watched and voted Say Anything... as THE movie that changed their lives in 1989.Plus look at how dead this message board is. If this was truly a beloved 80s movie, it would be as jumping as Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, or Karate Kid. So if you're currently a kid of the 2010s reading this, just remember this movie is way over-hyped, not everyone watched this or even heard about this little chick flick.

I was therefore very much on course to find a new favourite in this product of the 80's, but unfortunately I didn't. This film sees John Cusack before he gained the abilities as an actor that would later go on to make him a much-loved presence. His performance, though not bad, isn't what later films would prove him capable of. The film itself is soaked in a sentiment that feels like it's trying to be warm and friendly, but it never quite captures that which Cameron Crowe so obviously wanted it to be. Crowe appears to have a fascination with teenage coming of age tales, which he showed with his earlier 'Fast Times at Ridgemount High', and the later 'Almost Famous', and though those films worked rather well; this one doesn't. It gets irritating quickly and by the hour mark you'll no doubt be begging for the credits.Cusack plays typical high school graduate, Lloyd Dobler. Dobler is a young man that hasn't yet decided what he wants from life. Other than a date with fellow graduate, Diane Court. It is the characters that are the best thing about this film; the central character especially is very well observed, and most people that have been through high school will most probably see something of themselves in him. John Mahoney plays the loving father of Cusack's crush, and delivers a fine performance with it. Again, many people will be able to see something of their own father in him (though hopefully not too much!), and this character is another example of Crowe's triumph with creating characters. He doesn't follow up on this with the character of Diane. As she's a main character, you would expect her to be well done, but she isn't and that is some of the reason why the film falls down. Rather than giving her a believable and interesting character, Crowe has decided to pretty much give her no character, and the performance by Ione Skye doesn't exactly help matters either.Say Anything certainly isn't all bad. Fans of this sort of film will find lots to like about it, it's just a shame that Crowe wasn't able to deliver a good film with the premise. It could have been on course to be a classic if he had...
