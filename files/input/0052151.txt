Lancaster got the services of Gary Cooper for Verz Cruz and for Run Silent Run Deep, Clark Gable signed on for a hitch in as a submarine captain with a mission that isn't in the orders.Clark Gable has been desk bound for a year after losing his submarine in the Bungo Strait in Japanese waters. He hears of another submarine coming into Pearl Harbor with a wounded captain who will be on medical leave. So with a little back channel influence playing naval politics, Gable gets command of the U.S.S. Nerka. He inherits a resentful crew and an executive officer in Burt Lancaster who thinks he should have inherited the job. Gable's going back to the Bungo Stratis to nail the Japanese battleship that sank his former submarine and it's against orders.The conflict already existing between Gable and Lancaster and the one some in the crew would like to make is what gives the film its spark. Though this is a submarine film, you can see plot elements of Flying Leathernecks and The Caine Mutiny here. Brad Dexter is in the Fred MacMurray role.If Humphrey Bogart on the Caine had had at least one confidant on board he might not have cracked up. Gable's confidante on the Nerka is Jack Warden who is desk bound with him and transferred with him to the Nerka when Gable got command. Both Warden and Dexter are the best in a good supporting cast. By the way what Gable is drilling his men in doing is shooting with precise speed and accuracy into the bow of an oncoming enemy ship and then diving for cover in split seconds. Quite a maneuver. And quite a good film as well.

Sad to say that they couldn't be used in a joint effort again, as the on-screen chemistry was on a supreme height.Gable plays the commander of a WWII submarine that has recently been sunk in an ara referred to as the Bunko Straits, or Area 7.  He has been assigned to a desk job back at Pearl Harbor, and even after a year, is still brooding over the loss of his crew and his boat.  Lancaster has a good part, that of the Executive Officer of a sub called the USS Nerka. This boat has just had a command change, Lancaster desires that position, but is passed over in favor of Gable, who senses a chance to return to the Straits and extract revenge on the Japanese destroyer which he feels certain sank his old command.  The clash between the two men is obvious, but they put their personal differences behind them, and head for a long lasting combat mission, which against orders, will include Gable's return visit to the forbidden area 7 of the Bunko Straits.Besides the pairing of two of Hollywood's screen legends, the film features the realism of using an actual ship of the line, the USS Redfish, for many of the shots.  Also, the viewer has a chance to feel a part of the underwater tensions and claustrophobic conditions that submariners experienced during times of combat underwater.  A must-see, or even better, a must buy film for those that enjoy films of this genre.

Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster star in this epic about a submarine and a mission. Others have commented at length on the basic story, so I'll leave that alone. Only a couple of details bothered me. The men were all too clean and well-shaven to be sub sailors. Some of the last WWII US Subs built had air conditioning, so that could explain the cleanliness and lack of condensation in the boat. Still, the entire crew should have been growing beards for the entire length of the cruise since water was too precious to be used for shaving or bathing while at sea. The only shipboard scene that I felt was unrealistic was one scene in the crew's mess. The space shown is far too large to have been aboard a US Fleet boat. Otherwise, I found the film to be a great depiction of the way life was aboard a US sub during WWII. The acting is superb by the entire cast, but it should be with names like Gable, Lancaster and Warden. This is one of the greats!

Lancaster is excellent, and gives a preview of his Oscar-winning turn in Elmer Gantry, just a year or two later.This is an old-fashioned film made with the able assistance of the U.S. Navy, and one cannot help but feeling a little pride in our nation and gratitude for our brave WW II veterans, after watching it.

It proves without a doubt that CLARK GABLE and BURT LANCASTER were not only genuine classic stars but extremely good actors when given a solid script. And under Robert Wise's no nonsense direction, the cast of submarine sailors delivers the goods in realistic fashion, avoiding the sort of stereotypes often seen in these kind of war stories.The main action involves Gable's revenge motif. He's like a Captain Ahab, fervently determined to sink the Japanese destroyer that took the lives of his former crew members a year earlier, just as Ahab ran after the whale. His motives are questioned by the man originally selected to be Captain, his second in command Burt Lancaster. It's the clash of wills between these strong personalities that gives the film its punch and keeps the situation tense and taut until the final battle.Franz Waxman's score is almost non-existent, one of the chief shortcomings for me, as I always expect great things from Waxman. Here he opted for silence on the soundtrack when the situations get tense, as when the depth charges are sinking to the bottom of the ocean, barely missing the submarine. Perhaps this was a wise decision, since the sounds we do hear are those the sailors aboard the sub are experiencing while waiting tensely in their claustrophobic surroundings.It's an admirable war film, graced by two excellent performances from Gable and Lancaster, both convincing in their display of authority and command. Although models are used in the battle scenes, all of the action looks very realistic thanks to some excellent B&W photography. Kudos to Robert Wise for keeping the whole story brisk and supercharged.It never drags for a moment, as some of the other big wartime movies like DESTINATION TOKYO did. The script is taut and concise without resorting to any arbitrary love interest or humorous shenanigans which would have weakened the drama--and it's all told in a tense running time of 94 minutes.

And while I was in Blockbuster, I saw Run Silent, Run Deep on the shelf and I remembered that movie being mentioned in Crimson Tide during the whole submarine movie trivia sequence on the bus. And the question that was asked was who the submarine commander in this movie was. And the guy answered That guy with the ears and the mustache, Cary Grant. For those of you don't know what the answer was, it was really Clark Gable, and those massive ears and the thin 'stache were his trademarks throughout his career.And once I picked up the DVD case, I showed it to my mother and she immediately saw the two actors on the front (Gable and Burt Lancaster) and told me how famous those two were. But the truth is, I didn't even know who those two guys were, obviously because of my young age at 17. But after I decided to rent it since it couldn't do any harm, my mother told me about the kind of acting legends that Gable and Lancaster were on the ride back home. But of course, it was a bunch of romance flicks that she told me about (Gone with the Wind, Elmer Gantry etc.), but I knew that if Gable and Lancaster were practically legends, and that this was a submarine film, I knew I might've started loving this. And strangely enough, I did. And I didn't even care for the fact that it was black and white, and the fact that it's 51 years old.When it came to movies, I realized for the first time that my mother was right about Gable and Lancaster. Those two had real acting skill and were 2 of the best I've ever seen. But now in Hollywood we get too many male/female models who act and they have no talent. But I get to see what it was like in the old days when Hollywood cared about talent over money, fame and hotness.Clark Gable is the submarine commander named P.J Rich Richardson. Rich is haunted by his memories of a Japanese battleship that destroyed his sub and his crew. For over a year, he dwells on that memory and wants vengeance more than anything. And then when a younger guy named James Bledsoe (Lancaster) heads a new sub that would be heading out into the Pacific to combat the Japanese, Rich abruptly takes command after convincing his superiors. And of course, Bledsoe isn't too happy about it but keeps his cool. And during the mission, Rich disobeys orders just to get the sub into the restricted areas which pushes the crew to planning on a mutiny, and causes tensions to rise between the two commanding officers (and I guess this is how Crimson Tide got that idea&#x85;&#x85;).The acting is excellent, thanks to Gable and Lancaster, we can feel the tension going on between these two. Oscar-winning acting in the 1950's was no different than it is today, and Gable and Lancaster could exhibit powerful human emotion especially when the 2 men clash over the safety and lives of the crew. And you're gonna find yourself siding with the both of them; you might side with Rich because of his quest for revenge even though he has to be doing the unethical to achieve his goal and Bledsoe just cares about the lives of the crew and even risked the sub being spotted when he ordered them to rise up to prevent a crew member from drowning. But by the end, the 2 men basically become each other when Rich realizes that revenge might not be worth it and when Bledsoe decides to go after the Japanese destroyer even when they're on their way home. Excellent character development to go along with the great story.The action was, for its time, very well done. To be honest I expected much worse from the special effects, but you can still see what's going on with all the torpedoes and the subs underwater. And especially the explosions of the ships, while they were black and white, they still captured the grim reality of warfare on the ocean.Also the thrills will make your heart pound like it did to mine and if the thrills were any more thrilling, I would've fainted. The scene at the end when the two subs face-off is among the best underwater battles I've seen in my life. The suspenseful part came when the fighter planes were dropping the bombs onto the sub underwater, and when one of the bombs hits the top of the sub and rolls over to explode and barely misses is when I nearly bit my fingernails off. And this was all perfectly edited and directed by the genius Robert Wise.And another thing, that pin-up girl that the crew slaps on its back-side before battle is a total icon to me and it's hilarious. I wish that I had a poster like that at home, haha, but that's just the boy in me talking. And I think that was even referenced in Die Hard when John McClane pats a similar poster of a girl on the wall, and given Die Hard's reputation, that has clearly gotta be saying a lot about RSRD. And I'm gonna remember that part forever because it displays the crew's humanity as men.I'll admit that I said before that Crimson Tide was my favorite submarine movie of all time, but now I'm on the fence, because Crimson Tide took the idea of two submarine superiors clashing, from RSRD. And I'm not sure when I'm gonna decide. But anyway, this is a classic in its own right with two legendary actors and a great story about vengeance set in World War II.

It's not a flawless film, but nevertheless a very powerful one, and arguably seminal for the genre. This may well be the film which introduced the phrase Ah-OOOO-gah! Dive, dive! into the collective consciousness.Plot synopsis At the start of the film, it's late 1942, and Commander Rich Richardson (Gable) is commanding a submarine attacking Japanese shipping in the Bungo Strait. One of the escorting vessels, an Akikaze-class destroyer, counter-attacks and sinks the submarine with consummate skill. We skip ahead to mid-1943 and find Richardson in a desk job at Pacific Fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor, obsessing over how to take revenge on the destroyer, which he has nicknamed Bungo Pete, and which has sunk another three American submarines in the interim. When the position of commanding officer of the submarine Nerka becomes vacant, Richardson manages to wangle the job on the basis that the Nerka's next assignment will be to Japanese coastal waters, an area with which Richardson is well familiar. This, however, sets him at odds with the boat's executive officer, Lieutenant Bledsoe (Lancaster), who had originally been slated to take over command of the Nerka. Due to the losses incurred in the Bungo Strait, Richardson's orders are to avoid that waterway, but it is readily apparent to the viewer that Richardson fully intends to return to the Strait and sink Bungo Pete. However, Bungo Pete is not the only threat that the Nerka faces...The film's primary flaw is that it places emphasis on the significance of certain facts without explaining why these are significant. This is likely a result of being adapted from a novel. It would be helpful to know, for example, that the Bungo Strait is the waterway separating the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, and is one of the two exits from the Inland Sea into the Pacific. It is the obvious route for shipping to and from the military logistics center at Hiroshima, among others, and would therefore be a target-rich environment for American submarines. Another commentator on this site asks why a Momo-class destroyer merely serves as target practice while the Akikaze-class is considered a serious threat. The answer is that the Momo is a 2nd class destroyer, older, slower and more lightly armed than the Akikaze. Most importantly, 2nd class destroyers did not have depth charges, and were thus unable to harm a submerged submarine. (It should be noted, incidentally, that what is referred to as the Akikaze-class in this film is more correctly known as the Minekaze class. Bungo Pete could not be the historical Akikaze, as this vessel was in the South-West Pacific at the time this film takes place.) As to the question why Richardson opts not to dive when attacked by aircraft, the answer is that a submarine IS visible from the air if it's only at periscope depth, while at the same time, being submerged forces it to run on electric (battery) power instead of its diesels, resulting in less speed and maneuverability. For the Nerka to gain protection from diving, she would have to go so deep that she could not continue the attack against the Akikaze.The pacing in the film is very good, and the story carries no unnecessary ballast. It was probably to maintain this that much of the exposition was cut. However, this does cause certain events in the film to come off as contrived to the casual viewer, which is unfortunate, because actually the story is very consistent. Like a good detective story, the film gives you clues to future events instead of springing them on you (per the dictum attributed to Chekov that a gun fired in Act III should be visible on the wall in Act I). Gable and Lancaster may, strictly speaking, be too old for their characters, but they play them convincingly, and their interaction--especially Bledsoe's grudging but increasing respect for Richardson--is very credible. There are some war movie clich√©s, and you can plainly see the wires used on the sub and torpedo models in the underwater scenes, but this was, after all, 1958. If you like submarine movies, you'll love this one.

Everyone crowded together, sweating, all that obsolete technology, sliding down ladders, hatches clanging shut, the popping rivet, the depth charges, the man left on deck as the sub plunges beneath the waves, the wisecracking crew, and the commands -- Rig for silent running.  Rig for Depth Charge.  Crash Dive!  Take her down to fifty feet.  Open outer doors one and two.  After torpedo room, report damage.  Come right to course one five zero.  It's like going to mass.Run Silent, Run Deep thankfully has no romantic side interest.  The special effects are echt-1950s -- back projections, rather obvious model work.   But it's fairly well done, for its kind.  The major conflict is between Captain Gable (looking puffy-eyed, as if just coming down from battery acid) and Exec Lancaster, who was deprived of the command through direct intervention by Gable, who has his own agenda. Gable's first boat was sunk in the Bungo Straits.  Now he intends to disobey orders and take his new boat back to the same spot, kind of obsessed with revenging his lost shipmates.  The crew come to think of him as just as mad as Captain Ahab following HIS obsession.  Gable drills the crew over and over in order to get them to dive in exactly 32 seconds.  (Thirty-seven won't do.)  He does other odd things without explanation.  He ignores a Japanese sub, ignores a convoy.  He sinks a Momo destroyer with a shot that isn't even in the books.  The purpose of all this odd behavior is to sink the Akakaze, the destroyer that apparently got his last boat, as well as three or four others in the Bungo Straits.  Let us simply say that in the end, Gable enters his house justified, or in this case his ocean.There's a lot of tension aboard the boat, of course, what with the captain keeping his plans all to himself.  The problem is that the story itself doesn't really make any sense.  Here, presented in no particular order, are some questions that kept nagging at me.1.  Gable sinks the Momo destroyer with a down-the-throat shot as practice for pulling the same stunt with the Akakaze destroyer.  The Akakaze is no Momo, someone points out, The Akakaze never misses.  What's the difference between a Momo and an Akakaze?  Why does one serve merely for target practice, while the other never misses?  How can you tell one individual destroyer from another individual destroyer through a submarine's periscope?  We're never told the answer.2.  Gable's plan involves attracting the destroyer, steaming on the surface as the destroyer approaches, firing at the sub, submerging in 32 seconds, then firing a head-on shot at the destroyer.  Why thirty-two seconds?  What's so great about 32 seconds?  Why not dive five seconds earlier and let the process take 37 seconds?  Answer as far as we can tell, it makes no difference at all, except that shaving off the additional 5 seconds enhances the alienation of the crew from the captain.  This is known as a plot device.3.  The boat and the Akakaze finally meet, and the Akakaze turns head-on as planned, but the boat comes under air attack.  At this point, Gable, alone on the bridge, hollers down the hatch, We'll have to make this a surface attack.  Why?  Why doesn't he follow through with his original plan to submerge?  The boat would be protected against air attack and the original plan could be followed without modification.  (As it is, the surface attack fails.)  Why does being attacked from the air compel a submarine to remain on the surface?  Answer Only Gable knows, and he took his secret with him.4.  After each destroyer attack -- whether the destroyer is sunk or not -- some mysterious morse code comes in on the radio.  It turns out to be coming from a nearby Japanese submarine whose presence is unexpected.  Why is the Japanese submarine betraying its presence by using its radio, since its effectiveness depends on its remaining hidden?  Answer They really ARE inscrutable?5.  Just after sinking a freighter and the Momo destroyer, Captain Gable avoids firing at a Japanese convoy they encounter because he doesn't want to give away his position.  What's the point?  He has just torpedoed and sunk two Japanese ships.  The second ship, the Momo, had ample time to signal that he was under torpedo attack and that, therefore, there was an enemy submarine around.  Answer No excuse, sir.6.  At the end, after they have sunk the Akakaze, they hear radio signals that seem to come out of nowhere.  A radioman asks, What is that, sir.  I can't make that out.  Are they all stupid?  The signals are in nice clear CW, although the message is just a jumble of random letters and numbers, nicely transmitted.  Any competent operator would know that they were coming from an antenna that was close by.  If you have a loud transmission coming from a nearby antenna in the middle of the ocean and you sweep the horizon and there are no surface ships, what conclusion is logically forced upon you?  Answer seagulls.7.  The crew has been driven nuts by all those practice dives designed to prune their time to submerge down to 32 seconds.  At the end, with the Akakaze steaming head-on as planned, although they have plenty of time to dive, they take her in on the surface and launch torpedoes at the prearranged distance.  The plan works and the Akakaze is blown to bits.  What was the purpose of all those demanding practice dives?  Why was the original plan discarded?  Again, nobody knows.Nick Cravatt, Lancaster's old circus buddy, is in this film too.  He is even given a speaking part, mostly comic.  He was better in those parts where, like Harpo, he was mute.  His ingenuous overacting was endearing.  Lancaster's performance is toned down.  We don't get to see that mile-wide grin filled with gleaming ivory tombstones.

(i.e., In Harm's Way, Midway, The Caine Mutiny, Pearl Harbor, etc.)Other than Operation Petticoat, which really wasn't a war movie at all, this is one danger that most sub films can avoid. Of course other dangers lurk ahead, like invisible depth charges, waiting to blast a film off course. A submarine crew is going to be doing, essentially, the same thing over and over, with varying degrees of success. This is one drawback of the lengthy director's cut of Das Boot.In Run Silent, Run Deep, though, we have a compact, well-edited little film that tells its story and then shuts up. It may not be the best submarine film ever made, but it would not be torpedoed by any others, either. Directing legend Robert Wise is at the helm, taking a break from horror flicks and musicals, to send Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster into battle against the Japanese.SPOILERS AHEADGable and Lancaster both show why they were top drawing cards in their day, pitted against each other in a battle of wills that needs no plastic romance to break up the scenes. Gable plays Captain R. J. Richardson, a man with a mission to avenge the destruction of his previous sub, at the hands of the Akakazi, a top-of-the-line Japanese destroyer, operating in the Bungo Straights.  He pulls enough strings to get command of a sub which Lancaster (Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe) was scheduled to take over. Naturally Bledsoe is not pleased to see a recent desk jockey use leverage to take the command he rightly felt was his. Richardson refuses to let him transfer, though, so the drama is set to commence as the sub heads for sea.Like the Caine Mutiny, Mutiny on the Bounty, and other films, Bledsoe feels called to `relieve' Richardson as captain, after he realizes Richardson plans to make another attempt at the Akakazi, after narrowly avoiding destruction and losing three men in their first battle with it.Without giving away the rest of the plot, this is a good old-fashioned war movie. All of the action is either inside or on the deck of the tiny sub after the fist 20 minutes or so, yet things never stagnate. The tension builds between the two officers and the life and death struggles of the crew and its machine against the hardware of the enemy make time stand still. Although special effects have come a long way since 1958, sometimes simple is better. The eerie stillness and pitch blackness of the ocean shots as the crew silently waits for depth charges to explode, is riveting. When they do explode and light up the silhouette of the sub, the effect is about as good as any CGI today could produce.The cast is great with wonderful veterans like Jack Warden and Don Rickles adding their professionalism and polish to the production. Of  course, Lancaster and Gable both turn in outstanding performances. Has any captain ever had a more commanding voice for crying `Dive! Dive!'?Run Silent, Run Deep is not as long, nor as complicated as many war movies and also avoids the temptation to tack on an ill-fitting romance or to philosophize about war and peace or US versus Japanese morality. It merely tells the story of a man determined to avenge the death of his earlier crew and another man determined to keep HIS crew from going to the same watery grave. This is one of the better submarine films ever made and is still a fine family film that has lost none of its watchability or poignancy.

They proved to be the death of many submarines in WWII. Destroyers were used as escorts screening supply convoys, merchant shipping, capital battleships, aircraft carriers and oil tankers. Their most effective weapons against submarines were the sonar and depth charges.Commander Richardson (Clark Gable) lost a submarine under his command after firing torpedoes at a Japanese troop and supply convoy. The Japanese destroyer simply run down his submarine as it struggled to submerge. Not quickly enough though as it was split in two. Tragically, Richardson lost some of his men. He was demoted to a desk job and earned the reputation of a loser among sailors. The experience led him to devise a tactic on how to escape after torpedoing an enemy ship. He figured that it was not enough to run away from a destroyer because it can easily hunt his sub down with sonar and depth charges. The pursuing destroyer must be sunk. How? It moves so much faster than a submarine that it is impossible to hit it broadside. It also dropped depth charges as it circled the submarine in an ever tightening noose maneuver.Richardson thought that if a sub charged a destroyer head on firing torpedoes as it submerged, the enemy ship can be hit on the bow sharp. This calls for speed, precision timing and perfect aim. So he drove his men to exhaustion and frustration as he made them do a new drill for the special maneuver he had in mind. The scenario was this Fire torpedoes at an enemy aircraft carrier, tanker or whatnot. Then as a destroyer gives chase, instead of submerging at once and running away, the sub will charge the destroyer head on as in a game of chicken. At this position, the destroyer cannot yet make effective use of its depth charges as they are released at the stern. The front guns of the destroyer are also at an awkward elevation in relation to the sub lying low in the water. The sub may have enough time to fire at least one torpedo or at the most two before it is rammed by the destroyer. The trick then is to fire while submerging at the same time. Remember, this was in the days when torpedoes had no teleguidance and the sub's commander and crew relied entirely on their instinct for the right buoyancy, depth, speed and angle of descent as they submerged as to when to fire the torpedoes at the critical moment for the proper aim. I am curious as to whether this was actually done in WWII. It was bad enough that Richardson's men resented him but his own XO, Lt. Bledsoe, whom he edged out of command of the submarine by using his connections, also hated him with a passion viewing his drills and new tactic as criminally dangerous and unworkable.If you liked this movie, watch The Enemy Below starring Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens for a better understanding of submarine vs. destroyer warfare.

His last command sunk by a Japanese destroyer returns to haunt him; when he and his crew (featuring a marvelous group of character actors led by jack Warden, Don Rickles and Brad Dexter)of run into the same destroyed he obsessively hunts it down and, in turn, is hunted putting his crew and latest command at risk. This puts him into direct conflict with his second-in-command Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster). To paraphrase Lee Marvin's character in the film The Big Red One, in war it isn't murder it's killing. The tunnel vision effects everyone in a crisis but when a commander is obsessed with his own revenge, it destroys the men's morale and puts the crew in jeopardy.A thoughtful, penetrating drama that doesn't have men debating the merits of their morality but integrating it into their actions, Run Silent Run Deep deserves to be a deluxe release on DVD (much like the recent reissue of The Day the Earth Stood Still)but probably won't receive it. Das Boot (all three versions)is a great film looking at similar circumstances but Run Silent Run Deep has the edge because the film rarely leaves the confines of the boat once the drama truly starts. A submarine is a crew member's entire world. Any threat to it could destroy that pressurized hot dog and wipe out everything including their important mission.

Nonetheless this is a good film worth viewing and viewing again.There are some questions that you might be able to be satisfied with  but perhaps it might be good enough to leave well enough alone.Top rate Entertainment!

It's the story of a submarine captain (Clark Gable as Captain Richardson) whose sub was destroyed in the Bungo Straits (I don't know if this is a real or fictional place).  A year later, the  captain gets a chance to take another submarine and crew back to the Bungo Straits to sink the Japanese ship that destroyed his sub.  Captain Richardson is determined to to get back at the enemy, even if it means jeopardizing the lives of his new crew and stretching to the limit his prerogative as captain of the Nerka.  He also infuriates the second in command aboard the sub, Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster) whose shot at being the captain of the Nerka was taken away by Captain Richardson when he convinced his superiors to install him as its captain in place of Bledsoe.Run Silent Run Deep is a strong movie.  It is holding up well after 46 years (it was made in 1958).  I love the minute details that are apparent and the care the director took in setting up each scene.   The quality shines through in this movie.  The story held my interest as did the characters and the action.  As with many war movies which have numerous characters, I had to watch the film a couple of times to figure out who each character was.  To my pleasant surprise, I began to appreciate other details in Run Silent Run Deep.  It is a movie which seems to be growing on me with repeated viewings (I've seen it three times).  Interestingly enough, another film directed by Robert Wise, The Day The Earth Stood Still, is a movie I enjoy watching over again and have seen six times.  There are oceans of things to like about the movie Run Silent Run Deep.  There is a wonderful performance by Burt Lancaster and a very good one by Clark Gable.  The Director, Robert Wise (The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Sound of Music, West Side Story and Star Trek The Motion Picture) did a very very good job of tightly directing Run Silent Run Deep without any major gaffes.  The dialog seems to be just right ... not too much nor too little...  authentic yet dramatic ... not over the top but with some depth to it.  All of the supporting actors including those in minor roles do well.  Jack Warden is on target in a supporting role.  The cinematography is very good.  You will surely love the musical score by Franz Waxman that is perfectly suited to Run Silent Run Deep and which keeps the movie sailing.Who knows but perhaps with a couple more viewings I'll give Run Silent Run Deep an even higher rating than 76/100.  I highly recommend it for anyone who likes war movies and especially World War II movie buffs.

I hadn't seen it when it was first released, nor on any TV broadcasts, nor as a video release.  So I watched it, being a Burt Lancaster fan from 'way back.What a surprise... It's terrific!  Gable and Lancaster play off each other, under Robert Wise's very professional tutelage, with all the aplomb of the ultimately professional Hollywood icons that we just don't have anymore.  There's a not-at-all-surprisingly great Franz Waxman score to enhance the suspense, slick cinematography and special effects that, on a TV screen, didn't look too faked. (Though I'll never understand why, in all those WWII submarine films, the underwater scenes have to look like they've been done in a tank - nothing very realistic about them.)The special pleasure for me, though, was appreciating Gable's absolutely convincing performance.  He's in command, even when it's yanked out from under him, and I can once again understand why he was such a boxoffice champion.  All that, and - MINI SPOILER to follow - HE DIES at the film's conclusion!  That would never have happened had this one been made at his old alma mater, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  But, by 1958, audiences were getting a little more attuned to stories that weren't patterned on heroics of a wishful-thinking sort.  Part of that means that, given the strict limitations of John Gay's excellent script, there's only one early, brief scene with an actress playing Gable's wife.  No love interest.  My gosh!  I found myself missing some mush, such as Anne Baxter waiting at home for the boys in Twentieth's Technicolor submarine extravaganza, Crash Dive.  Is there no satisfying yours truly?!?

There were a number produced during and in the years following World War II, such as this one or the British-made Above Us the Waves, but there have also been more recent examples such as the German Das Boot (also about World War II) and The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide and K-19 The Widowmaker, all with a Cold War setting. Run Silent, Run Deep shares with the last two films mentioned above the theme of a conflict between the submarine commander and his second- in-command. In all three films the two men have very different personalities and in each case the commander is an obsessive, driven character while his executive officer is more relaxed. All three films cast two major stars opposite one another- Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington in Crimson Tide, Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in K-19 and Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster here. Gable's character, Commander P.J. Richardson, is the captain of a submarine which is sunk by a Japanese destroyer in the Bungo Straits. He persuades the Navy Board to give him command of another submarine, the USS Nerka, thus bringing him into conflict with the Nerka's executive officer, Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe, who possesses the necessary qualifications for command and believes that he should have been promoted to the captaincy. The crew also dislike Richardson, a strict disciplinarian who forces them to go through endless drills, and would much prefer to serve under the more easygoing Bledsoe. As the film progresses it becomes clear that Richardson is obsessed with avenging the loss of his previous submarine by sinking the destroyer responsible, even though he is under orders to avoid the Bungo Straits. The purpose of his repeated drills is to perfect a daring manoeuvre which he believes will give him an advantage over the enemy ship. The film is on one level a tense and exciting action/adventure drama, and works very well as such. On a deeper level, however, it is also a psychological study of the two men and a study in style of leadership. Both Gable and the scriptwriters resisted the temptation to make Richardson a simple villain. Certainly, he is a difficult, prickly character, unpopular with the crew and his subordinate officers. His cavalier interpretation of orders would not win him many friends among his superiors if they knew what he was up to. Yet his leadership inspires his men to brilliant feats of seamanship, enabling them to sink three Japanese vessels. Although on a human level the likable Bledsoe is well-versed in the arts of making friends and influencing people, he is also more cautious and pragmatic. There is a strong implication that, had he been in command, the crew might not have accomplished so much. The two men are very well played by Gable and Lancaster. In 1958 Gable was of course coming to the end of his career- he only had another two years to live, although in that period he was to make another five films- but Lancaster's still had another thirty years to run, and the film came at a time when his career was undergoing a change of direction. Although there had been exceptions, such as The Killers and From Here to Eternity, most of his films from the forties and fifties had been action adventures in which he had played physically demanding roles. For a war film, Run Silent, Run Deep does not contain much in the way of physical action- most of the action sequences were created using models- but rather looks forward to the sort of thoughtful, character-driven movies in which Lancaster was to specialise in the sixties and seventies.Robert Wise is today best remembered as the director of those two famous musicals, West Side Story and The Sound of Music, but he was a versatile director who could work in most genres, including films noirs, Westerns, disaster movies and war films. Run Silent, Run Deep is never going to equal something like The Sound of Music in the affections of the public, but it serves as a very good example of another side of Wise's talents. It rates as one of the best submarine dramas ever made. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A submarine movie that echoes Herman Melville's Mobydick","Date":"4 October 2013","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"War, Action, Drama","Review":" Recently I saw the submarine movie, 'Phantom' and I liked it.

Both film and book have their strong points, and a couple of weak ones, but as far as the film goes there're only two major flaws, both of which stem purely from the from the period in which it was made. Beyond that, what we have is essentially a snapshot, an encapsulation of the literary origins of the tale.There's conflict. In Hollywood tradition the show revolves around the interpersonal collision between an experienced veteran officer and a younger officer who has the hearts of the men he commands. But there's also an antagonist. A Japanese naval anti-submarine warfare ace. An expert in killing US Navy submarines. The two US officers must put aside their contention and sync their personalities enough to help spear one of the many tentacles of the Axis kraken that has sent many a US sub to the bottom of the Bungo Straits and elsewhere.One of the highlights of this film is seeing a Gato Class sub in all her post WW2 glory actually surface and dive in the Pacific on film. And it is an impressive anachronism. Another highlight is that the sets for the film (if they are sets) accurately simulate the confined spaces of a WW2 era submarine. The drama that unfolds mimics the literature in spirit, but for the purpose of cinematic alacrity truncates some of the more extraneous elements of the original book.There are of course two thespian giants on screen, Gable and Lancaster, playing the US Navy officers at odds with one another. The performances are of course solid. Lancaster is the well disciplined if ever so somewhat brash CO temporarily turned XO to make way for the troubled Gable, the skipper with a score to settle. There are others here, but will refrain from listing them. There are no bad performances here, just as there are no over the top moments so prevalent in today's films.The flaws; first, the special effects. The technology of the time shows itself with the models on the screen. They get their point across, and that's about all we can ask for. Dated, but functional. We of course understand this, and nod at the effort. Ditto with some of the front screen projection work. Again, we acknowledge the period of film making.The other flaw one might cite is the music. It too comes from a period when the industry sensationalized all aspects of the film, and before certain modern musical trends and sensibilities were introduced. It's very traditional. No chances are taken with the music.All in all an excellent sub-genre film (no-pun intended) of the war film. Some very minor technical flubs that even WW2 aficionados might miss, but should probably forgive. There are also some film particulars that experts should forgive, for they were stylistic choices for the sake of abbreviating both film and the tale it tells.If you're a younger movie fan, give it a chance.If you saw this in the theatre, or grew up watching it rebroadcast in the 70s, then pick up a copy.Definitely one to see.Enjoy.

Therefore, a movie made during the time while the hostilities were on, will of necessity be much more content which is intended to be pro-Allied propaganda.** JUST SCREENING ONE of those films made years after the War's end, one can readily see that there is a greater concentration of objectivity than those made in the years of 1939-45. That's not to say that we weren't aware of the nature of the struggle and just who were the enemies. Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan comprised the Axis Powers and along with some minor puppet state allies, they were the enemy.SUCH A STORY THAT is portrayed in this film, today's lucky 'victim', RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, has the luxury of examining certain other aspects of the military. Just because we are at War, it does not mean hat there are not serious disagreements at the policy making levels and even in the various Theaters of War and in the Battlefield itself. Personal opinion and pride may well be sublimated, but they are still there, under the surface (just like a Submarine).OUR STORY REVOLVES around the aging skipper (Clark Gable) taking it upon himself to change the mission's orders, allowing himself to in a sense, redeem his own previous unsuccessful actions in the same region of the Pacific. In the pursuit of his vindication, he becomes entangled in a dispute with his Executive Officer (Burt Lancaster) and the controversy nearly ends up in tragedy.BUT LUCKILY, ALL'S well that ends well as the sub manages to both complete its objectives and give the Captain of the ship his vengeance on the enemy who cost him hi last command.THE SKIPPER DOES not live out the tour of duty and dies and is buried at sea, along with what could otherwise have been the grounds for a Court Martial.AS WE'VE ALREADY stated, this is one of our favorite War films of that period.

While back at sea, he's itching for some payback, and disobeys direct orders from his superiors to avoid a certain area. Soon, the commander and the crew will find themselves stalked by a stealthy enemy.What's truly impressive about Run Silent Run Deep is how utterly convincing it is. The filmmakers, led by the talented director Robert Wise, were sticklers for accuracy, and everything looks and sounds authentic. There's no melodrama to be found here, nor is there any bloat the film clocks in at a reasonable one hour and 33 minutes. All of the tension is genuine, and the storytelling is done in an efficient, no-frills style. Franz Waxmans' score is excellent, but the absolute best scene comes late in the film when score and sound effects are dropped out. The suspense then becomes extremely palpable.Lancaster, a star who subscribed to the theory of balancing projects done for artistic reasons and ones done for commercial reasons, delivers a wonderful low key performance as the lieutenant who doubts his commanders' ability to lead but never oversteps his boundaries.

In the years since then its reputation has grown and its influence upon other films of the submarine sub-genre are clear, such as in Tony Scott's excellent 'Crimson Tide' from 1995. Both films, for instance, share a similar story line with an Executive Officer and Captain butting heads and the former taking command of the boat. I wouldn't say that Robert Wise's direction is particularly visually dynamic like, say, Orson Welles or John Ford, but Wise always knew where to put the camera and coached great performances out of his actors. Gable and Lancaster are superb in this, especially Gable, whose Captain Ahab-esque character is the most interesting one in the picture.While I wouldn't say that 'Run Silent, Run Deep' is the greatest of all submarine pictures (that goes to 'Das Boot'), I would say it's certainly one of the best. Wise himself was such a versatile director that he made great films in nearly every genre like 'The Haunting' in the horror genre, 'West Side Story' and 'The Sound of Music' in the musical genre, 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' in the sci-fi genre, and 'The Sand Pebbles' in the epic war genre.

The main plot is very powerful, the tension builds steadily and it is highly engaging. Many of the scenes in this movie were copied in later submarine movies, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term. Maybe they are part of the tradition.

Gable is at the end of his career and life, a tremendous star who died a tremendous star. Lancaster is the new breed, the actor and producer whose roles were dictated ultimately not by a studio but by his own talents and ambitions. Lancaster would go on and eventually step into character roles; even if Gable had lived, he would have been like Harrison Ford, always a lead, never shaking the image he had forged 25 years earlier. He was also, of course, more limited as an actor. But as a star, he outshone everyone.Both men in his own way are excellent, Gable as a determined man who wants to make up for a huge loss, and Lancaster as a strict, authoritative man who follows orders and develops a respect for his superior.

I thought it was one of the best war films ever made. It stood out because it was the story the commanders of both ships, not just of one, as most every other naval film is. I felt Mitchum and Jurgens were marvelous. Then, a couple of years back I decided to spend Veteran's Day watching war movies and I decided to rent three submarine movies that came out almost at the same time, The Enemy below, (19570, Run Silent Run Deep, (1958) and Torpedo Run, (also 1958). To my amazement, I like The Enemy Below the least. I found it pretentious and wordy. men of action don't spend much time philosophying about what they do. they rarely say anything they don't have to. they are much more likely to be internal. The windy verbal essays of The Enemy Below seem unrealistic. It's probable that the commanders of opposing vessels felt a kinship on some level but the fact that they were trying to destroy each other would have overwhelmed that. It's true, as one poster says that you'd never seen a film like this in the 40's. That's because the perspective of the time was that the Germans were enemies. The point of view of this film would  not have obtained at the time the action of the film took place. It's outlook is thus revisionist in the worst sense of the word.	Run Silent, Run Deep is the real article. the attitudes of the men- tightlipped, grim faced, worried about their survivals, not the enemies'. Nobody wonders what it's like for the other guys. Right or wrong, that's the way men see war. the crackling rivalry between Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster is much more realistic than the brothers under the skin relationship between Mitchum and Jurgens. 	Torpedo Run lacks credibility. Glen Ford sinks a ship he knows his family was on to get at a battleship he wants to sink. Maybe I'm naive but I don't believe he would do that- even if his family wasn't on the ship. And the ending where they escape by swimming to the surface from the bottom of the seas, (I assume they weren't exactly in the Mariannas Trench), seems unlikely, at best. I checked the web for anything about Momsen Lungs and found nothing, at least under that spelling. has anyone heard of an actual instance  of a submarine crew escaping a sunken sub and swimming to the surface?

He was an aviator who actually flew in PBY's that hunted enemy subs but all men in the Navy had great respect and admiration for the Silent Service. Submariners were an elite bunch. It was dangerous and the subs of the WW2 era were tiny, at least in comparison to modern nuclear subs. They hunted as lone wolves and if sunk, the chances of survival was slim.RSRD stars 2 of the great leading men of the era, Gable as Captain PJ Richardson and Lancaster as his XO, Jim Bledsoe. At 57 Gable was way too old to be believable as a sub skipper as was Lancaster, who was in his mid-40's, although he was in excellent shape and looked 10 years younger. Gable looked every day of 57 and more, this was one of his last films. Hollywood loves to sanitize war by having older men doing jobs that were generally covered by teenagers and guys in their 20's. But if you can buy into the plausibility of a guy of Gable's age being a sub commander, he does an excellent job as a man obsessed with hunting down the ship that sank his previous command. As the Nerka's XO Lancaster has to do a delicate balancing act. He and most of the crew are questioning their Skippers motives and believe he is willing to sacrifice them in order to settle his personal vendetta. But as a loyal Navy officer the notion of taking over command is verboten, until the commander is incapacitated and then he realizes, as commander that he must also take on the dangerous task of sinking the enemy. RSRD has all the elements we love in sub movies. The depth charge attack, the silent running scenes, listening to Tokyo Rose on the radio, the elation of sinking the enemy ships and the dramatic burial at sea. Robert Wise does a great job of capturing both the camaraderie and the excruciating tension of men living in close quarters never knowing if this may be their last day. Wise doesn't spend much time on back story, this is a tight 93 minutes without any wasted scenes. Familiar faces such as Jack Warden and Brad Dexter have good parts and a young Don Rickles provides a bit of comic relief, he incorporates a bit of the schtick that became the basis of his stand up persona.

Unfortunately, Gable, who one year earlier lost his own sub in a deadly skirmish, wrangles his way onto the vessel and takes command, himself. This done, Lancaster tries to obey orders while harboring resentment towards Gable and the rest of the men lean towards his side. Gable doesn't make things any easier when he drills the men in an unusual way and is reticent about sharing the details of their mission. Before it's all over, Lancaster is ready to mutiny, though there may not even be the chance since the Japanese are ready at all times to sink them altogether! Lancaster, who was also co-producer on the film, spars genuinely with Gable (the two didn't get along very well during filming, though Lancaster did give up top-billing to the veteran actor.) Gable is visibly older (and would be dead within two years!), but manages to retain his strength of character and level of acting prowess. The two make a fine, antagonistic team. Warden (who was replacing another actor who quarreled with Gable &#x96; was the man getting cranky by now?), Dexter and Rickles (in his debut film) essay other crewmen with skill. Cravat, who was a longtime crony of Lancaster's and frequently turned up in his films, plays a hapless seaman who nearly gets drowned accidentally. LaRoche has a scene as Gable's wife, playing it in that affected, starchy, 50s way which she would later crystallize in Bye, Bye Birdie as Ann-Margret's mother. Though some of the effects are questionable including obvious model work, torpedoes on visible wires and explosions that don't really demonstrate what torpedoes actually do, the film overcomes these flaws due to the intensity of the story and the enmity of the leads. There is one crewman who man as well have Victim embroidered on his uniform and this clich√© would later be parodied in comedy films of the 80s such as Hot Shots.

Resentment and distrust grows as the Captain passes on an enemy target, choosing instead to keep moving. Lieutenant Bledsoe maintains his calm and backs the skipper throughout.One thing particularly noteworthy as the sub begins to parry with the enemy are the special effects. Of the plethora of marine combat films extant, this one has much more believable footage. This is probably the best use of scale models you'll ever see. In addition a great deal of the camera work focuses on the sub while it is in the open sea.The myriad of problems especial to submarine warfare is well covered in the movie, and the overall feel one gets is the incredible tension that exists during a patrol. Close quarters, rumors, disagreements between crew members, enemy attack, all are mixed in a stew that gives us pause to consider the situation on board the Nerka.One of the aspects of the submarine campaign during World War 2 that speaks to the incredible danger inherent in any patrol was the rate of casualties of U.S. seamen tallied. According to Wikipedia (http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War#Submarine_warfare) of the 16,000 Americans who went out on patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any American force in World War II.There are some small details that don't pass muster, but are not so frequent as to change the overall effect of Run Silent, Run Deep. As usual, it seems our torpedoes never miss (and the usefulness of torpedoes in the early going of the War was suspect - http//www.valoratsea.com). They seem to be always fighting in some kind of murk, so that you aren't sure if it supposed to be night or day.Overall this is a first rate film, with fine acting from all concerned and details of submarine combat life well presented. View it and you won't have to see another WW2 sub movie.Three and a half stars.

When Richardson is assigned a desk job in Pearl Harbor he begins to obsess over the Destroyer that sank him. Within a year another three submarines have met a similar fate in the same area. With this information Richardson requests another command and is given his chance. The command he wanted though comes at the expense of another officer Lieutenant Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster) the ships Executive Officer who had expected the command and has the full backing of the ships crew.Directed by the talented Robert Wise (West Side Stort, The Sound of Music, The Day the Earth Stood Still) who effectively builds both the claustrophobic atmosphere of the submarine and tension of both being detected and being destroyed. While it may have been surpassed in these areas by the superlative Das Boot its achievements for its time are still impressive.While not the greatest performances of either Lancaster or Gable it is still quite intriguing to see these two talented and major Hollywood stars sharing the screen. The cast also includes Jack Warden (12 Angry Men), Brad Dexter (Magnificent Seven) and Don Rickles in his film debut.The film is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Edward L. Beach Jr. a highly decorated submarine officer and author. His father Edward L. Beach Sr. had also been a prominent naval officer and author.It's surprising to see again how many scenes have become standards of the submarine warfare film. From the relatively minor aspects; like tension amongst the crew, the attempts to remain absolutely quiet or the mechanical difficulties that require urgent repair. To the tension filled depth charge scene, and the use of fake debris including the bodies of dead sailors ejected through the torpedo tubes to try and fool the surface ship.

Clark Gable is the hard-as-nails sub commander who clashes with underling Burt Lancaster (who, of course, should have had Gable's command) while battling the Japanese during WWII. THE CAINE MUTINY it ain't, dispensing with any psychological drama in favor of a more straightforward battle of wills. It's exciting, well-paced and very quick, running less than 100 minutes. Gable and Lancaster are terrific and the quirky supporting cast, including Brad Dexter, Jack Warden (a great performance) and Don Rickles(!) is a real plus. The journeyman direction is by that master journeyman Robert Wise.

The performances of Lancaster and Gable are first rate. The plot and the story line require some imagination but the story is quite entertaining and tense. The character actors do well to deliver the internal conflict of their officers. The authenticity of Ed Beach's writing makes this movie worth seeing. While the spacious conditions of the sub and the clean-shaven crewman are not quite accurate, the technical operations of the sub are very accurate. Several of the torpedo sequences suffer from the lack of good special effects but the general ineffectiveness of Japanese antisubmarine warfare can be seen. I never tire of watching this movie and I think sub movie fans will agree that this one of the best ever made.

I don't recall them criticizing Kurt Jurgens and his second in command (Theodore Bikel) for being too old in the movie The Enemy Below as German officers (but they look old to me). Couldn't they find any young Germans to play the part of German naval officers? They could have use Helmut Dantine, Hardy Kruger, and Kurt Kreuger for the roles. The movie Das Boot had some things that was not put in the Run Silent, Run Deep, Destination Tokyo, and Operation Pacific movies such as the submarine creaking and groaning due to the water pressure being exert on it. Another item was the sound of the enemy ships making loud deafening sounds in the water when they sinking beneath the waves and heading towards the bottom of the sea after being hit by the torpedoes. I recall the TV series Victory at Sea. The narrator was using certain words like slaughter and using a harsh, loud tone of voice when talking about the German U-Boats attacking Allied ships; however, when he talk about the American submarines, he use words like sink them in a quiet voice tone when it came to the activities of the American submarines torpedoing Japanese ships. He made it sound like the Germans were monsters and the Americans were guys just doing their jobs, so they could go home.

Nowadays, unpretentious war movies are only made with Segal, van Damme and the like. In fact, anti-war films, which became so damn popular in the 70s, are perhaps one of the main reasons the West has gotten so soft when it comes to solving major conflicts in dealing with tyrannical regimes; the propaganda effect they have is immense. Diplomarum est crapum. Often force is not just the only option, but a very effective one.Anyway... A fun submarine film with Gable and Lancaster which can't hurt. A pity it was made in black-and-white; the 50s b&w movies have a very bland look to them, unlike the 30s and early 40s films. Who wants to watch a gray ocean...?

I thought it was very interesting because it had many different themes and had the thrill and excitement to match with almost any modern day movie! The movie was very interesting and really gave you the perspective of life on a submarine. It was a great movie and I rated it a 10/10! I think that most people think, hey it's old,it has no color, it was made in 1958, how could this be a good movie What most people don't realize is that it has such a huge sense of bondage and what the life of a submariner and what they have to go through in every day life. This movies may be old but it's a heck of a movie. "}]
