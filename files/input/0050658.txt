[{"Title":"An Unusual Combination Held Together By Hepburn & Wilder","Date":"1 November 2004","Score":"46 out of 60 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","Review":" This odd combination of story, characters, and cast could easily have fallen apart irretrievably in the first few minutes. That it holds together is due primarily to Audrey Hepburn's unsurpassed charm and Billy Wilder's resourceful story-telling technique. It ends up being enjoyable most of the time, sometimes very much so, in spite of itself.The story is rather strange - for it to work you have to buy into a number of unlikely possibilities, and even then, you have to accept the main characters as sympathetic even when they don't deserve it. It's the kind of hollow concept that you see much more often in present-day movies, which are made for audiences who don't care about plausibility, and who are easily persuaded that a shallow, pseudo-romantic attraction between two characters automatically makes them sympathetic.None of that is to imply anything against the stars. Audrey Hepburn is so engaging as Ariane that it makes you want her to be happy, even though much of her behavior is fatuous. Maurice Chevalier is enjoyable and is obviously well-cast, and John McGiver also adds some good moments. Gary Cooper's character doesn't work very well, but that should not be blamed at all on Cooper. The character just is not as appealing as the scriptwriters presume him to be, and Cooper should actually be commended for making him as likable (or as un-unlikable) as possible.Wilder's skill made some strange stories work pretty well in his time, and he also deserves much of the credit for keeping this one afloat. There are also some very good sequences in the screenplay, for all that it was uneven in general. The odd thing about Love in the Afternoon is that if you can tolerate the poor setup and get past the obvious flaws, you can really enjoy most of the movie, because it does have several positive things to offer.

At least semi-classic. The story is about a French girl who falls in love with a swinger from Paris. The girl is Audrey Hepburn and the man is Gary Cooper. The first act lags. The only thing keeping me glued to the screen is Hepburn, who has such a screen presence (she's pretty).Recent comments have also noted Gary Cooper's miscasting.  I'm not sure.  I agree it's hard to believe Hepburn's character falls for him.  The movie just doesn't work in his favor in the first act.  It does begin to work eventually.  The turning point would have to be at the picnic where he obviously starts to fall for her.  Cooper falling for Hepburn more realistic.  From that point everything takes off.  Cary Grant could have pulled off the attraction, but I don't think he could have pulled off the 2nd and 3rd act, and Cooper did. When he's sad (dictaphone/wine cart/sauna scenes) he's a top form comic actor.  Anyways - I digress.No one can produce the feeling of heartache with so much sadness and glee as Wilder can. The gypsy band should have earned a best supporting actors nomination.

This French novel Ariane had been filmed before in fact, by the Germans just before the Nazis took over and had starred Elizabeth Bergner.Audrey Hepburn proved to be a worthy successor to Bergner. Whatever success Love in the Afternoon has is due to her performance. She radiates beauty and charm and no wonder Gary Cooper is so fascinated by her. Wilder would consider no one else for the lead and waited for Hepburn to be free while she was on a lengthy location shooting for War and Peace.But it's Cooper who's the weak one here. He was not Billy Wilder's first choice. Cary Grant for the third and final time missed out on being in a Billy Wilder film having previously turned down Five Graves to Cairo and Sabrina. The part was offered to Yul Brynner also. But Gary Cooper turned out to be available when Hepburn was and he got the role. Wilder later admitted the bad casting, but he also said that it was his ill luck to get Cooper at the start of the health problems that would eventually kill him. He said Cooper got old overnight. In fact he looks as old as Maurice Chevalier and Chevalier as Hepburn's father was 13 years older than Cooper.Maurice is a detective who specializes in tracking down and confirming spousal infidelities. He's been hired by John McGiver to find out if his wife has been seeing millionaire playboy Cooper. Daughter Hepburn however is crushing out on Gary big time and unbeknownst to Maurice she takes it upon herself to warn him. The old popular standard Fascination is heard through out the film and in the same year it came out, the 20+ year old standard was revived in a million selling hit by Pat Boone. It was not an easy shoot despite those familiar Parisian location. In a recent biography of Wilder, the story is told that he had tremendous difficulty in shooting the picnic and row boat scenes. It seems as though the location was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and they were unmerciful to cast and crew. Wilder took several takes just to get enough usable footage.Audrey Hepburn fans will be mad for Love in the Afternoon, Gary Cooper's though might wince when seeing it.

Set in Paris, with some scenes filmed there, Director Billy Wilder weaves a captivating, simple tale of a 20ish woman (Hepburn), who lives with her father (Maurice Chevalier), who schemes to snag a 50ish cad (Cooper). At first the age difference is very apparent, with Cooper seemingly mis-cast as a womanizer, but he grows on you, with a sweet, gentle, quiet, attractive performance. Hepburn is stunning and spunky in one of her best performances. The song Fascination is used to great effect. Filmed in 1957, the only way to show the title occurrence is to have a camera shot following Hepburn's dis-robed fur coat falling to the hotel room's floor, as she embraces Cooper. The ending is suspenseful, with cute narration epilogue by Chevalier. A wonderful film.

They make the whole story come alive in their own way. Coop with his dry but lovable wit and charming good looks, and Audrey with her universal charm, wholesomeness and great beauty.     I have read in the book The Complete Films of Audrey Hepburn that Cary Grant and Yul Brynner were the first two choices to play Coop's part. Thank God that neither were able to. Coop as the character of Frank Flannagan makes the film more romantic and his ever-popular sweet-guy, no-airs-of-any-kind persona makes the film less stuffy than it would with Grant or Brynner. Audrey of course is the perfect Ariane and they shine together in each other's arms. Call it a cliche but that comment fits this film perfectly.

The author and director clearly knew a lot about love. I guess my admiration for this film proves that after 30 years in a single blissful relationship, I am still an unabashed romantic.  This film is what it's all about. I feel sorry for those art-film historians who fail to be overwhelmed by the depth and charm of this piece and would rather pick it apart with their overly dissecting, maddeningly analytic tweezers, missing the point entirely. Their lives must be rather cold and empty. This film works.  Wilder's genius pulls it off.  How many among us know of numerous life-long loves where the age difference between the lovers would appear prohibitive but proves to be only a minor obstacle to a lasting relationship. In my experience life imitates art. In this work it is the very difference in their ages and the differing circumstances of their lives that attract Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn's characters. It is the differences that are extra-normal that make this story so believable. He is attracted to her utterly captivating refined insouciance and she to his masculine-straight forward worldly charm. He is the best of the fantasies she has constructed from her father's (Maurice Chevalier's) detective business files, and she is precisely the down home girl with her wits about her who knows his world and his past and loves him anyway.Why is it the desire of all those incapable of suspending disbelief even a smidgen to turn every work of art into a highly predictable, formulaic mouthful of insipid pre-stamped pabulum. How shallow. Or perhaps I am not only overly romantic but additionally overly democratic. I am proud to see that at least the positive vote count for this film, that is the large number of 9 and 10 votes, more accurately reflects the quality of this timeless vignette, than do the rather sour comments that I have just read.

Hepburn plays Ariane, a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases, chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan, a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. A certain Monsieur X has come to Chevasse to catch his wife in a suspected extramarital fling with Flannagan. Overhearing Monsieur X's intention to kill his wife and her lover, Ariane decides to warn Flannagan, and they embark on an afternoons-only affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is. Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious thin girl and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is.Master filmmaker Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever, ironic script co-written with his long-time partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter, and leave it to Wilder to use a Gypsy string quartet to act as a chorus for Flannagan's sexual shenanigans. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane and especially good fun when she layers the deceptions about her checkered past. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch, and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Looking weather-beaten after years of Westerns and adventure pictures, he was given a lot of grief because of the age difference between him and Hepburn, but I actually find the gap quite touching and Cooper surprisingly game. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if has to play down his naturally effervescent manner. Granted the film runs a little too long at 126 minutes, but it is fine, light entertainment similar to Wilder and Hepburn's previous collaboration, the classic 1954 Sabrina. The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is fine though not outstanding. Unfortunately there are no extras included.

Thanks to Billy Wilder's creative genius this film works despite Gary Cooper being miscast as the leading man. Regrettably, Gary Cooper was not only too old, but lacked the charm and suaveness needed for the role. Cooper was also in the twilight of his career and was suffering from health problems when the film was made. Cary Grant or Gregory Peck would have been more appropriate for the role of Frank Flannagan, the womanizing jet setter who falls madly in love with the daughter of a detective who has been investigating him. Nevertheless even with a miscast Gary Cooper the film works ....thanks to the marvelous performances of Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier, who play the young innocent musician daughter and her snooping, pooping private detective father. The title song Fascination with original music by F.D. Marchetti and Franz Waxman serve as a romantic thread that runs tightly through out the entire cinematic heart throbbing experience. Billy Wilder's more noted films such as The Apartment and Some Like It Hot may have garnered more recognition than this film over the years, but in my opinion none of them have the charm that this film has to offer. In fact if one is willing to What if?, and trade off Gary Cooper for Gary Grant for the role of Frank Flannagan, I suspect that that this film would have been right up there with the best romantic comedy of all time, It Happened One Night.

Audrey Hepburn is lovely in this movie, but it is painful to see her opposite Gary Cooper, who was nearly 30 years older than she and looks in bad shape for his age.When Hepburn began her career, the Hollywood studios had a lot of male stars in their forties and fifties and sixties who had been popular before World War II but had not developed young male stars. So Hepburn was paired with these much older men--Humphrey Bogart in the so-so Sabrina, Fred Astaire in the charming Funny Face. This movie is distasteful and unpleasant, not just because Cooper's character is so much older but because he is an immature, vulgar boor. He shows up at the opera with another woman and, when his date goes to the ladies' room, sees Hepburn in the lobby and makes a date with her, and tells her that he is at Tristan and Isolde by mistake--he thought he was getting tickets to the Folies Bergere! (If he meant this, he is an idiot; if he meant it as a joke, he has a puerile sense of humour.) When his date returns, he winks at Hepburn behind the woman's back.At another point in the movie, he is caressing Hepburn in his hotel suite when the phone rings and it is twins with whom he has been sexually involved in the past. In front of Hepburn, he makes a date with them, causing her to leave the room in distress.One could go on and on, but I think this is enough to establish the point. Treating any woman like this is disgusting. Treating Audrey Hepburn like this--the most exquisite, delicate woman ever to have become a film star--is unbelievable. It is like watching someone kick a puppy. The rave review for this film in the NY Times when it first appeared is an illustration of the male chauvinism of the time, and the comments here from people who think it is a delightful romantic film show that this condescension to women and contempt for their feelings is still with us.Wilder had some talent for romantic comedy, but his heart was really in the sordid and nasty, as in such masterpieces as Ace in the Hole or Sunset Boulevard. The ending of this film might have been intended as a homage to the ending of Lubitsch's film Cluny Brown, but is in fact a clumsy imitation of it. Both films end with the same device for bringing the hero and heroine together at the very last moment, but in Cluny Brown (with Jennifer Jones and Charles Boyer) the device was extravagantly romantic, and you felt thrilled that the two of them were together. In this film, the scene feels completely phony and you think, oh, dear, poor Audrey is letting herself in for a lot more mistreatment and humiliation.

Yes, it was clearly a role intended for Gary Grant (that would have to wait for Charade), but Cooper brings his own plain homespun American style to the role, which plays awfully well against Hepburn's dreamy child-woman European sophisticate-in-training. And Love in the Afternoon has simply one of the most romantic train station scenes ever filmed. When, at the last possible moment, Cooper scoops Hepburn up off the platform and Wilder shoots that close up of their kiss in the train's cabin, with Coop's big hand tenderly embracing Hepburn's stunning teary-eyed face -- well, folks, that's romantic film-making par excellence.

When the Daughter arrives at the Ritz, the angry Husband is staking the hotel room where the Wife is, with visible gun in hand. Fortunately, the Daughter is able to sneak in the hotel room next door and walks on the ledge outside of the hotel to the room where the lovers are and warns them about the Husband outside. When the Husband finally enters the lovers' room, he finds the Lover (Cooper) in the arms of the Daughter, who, incidentally, is wearing a chic givency black dress (the Daughter was performing at a concert just before going to the Ritz). Got that?From there, the sleazy Lover starts a romantic affair with the Daughter, who knows well that the man is not to be trusted. How's that for a romance?The story could have worked if the tone had been sorta goofy fun but it wasn't, the credibility of the story is stretched to the max that I just couldn't get into it. The set up I just explained takes a big chunk of the movie and by the time we finally see the Lover, I didn't care for anything. The set-up was the most convoluted set-up I've ever seen in a movie, with not a single laugh in it. But the set-up is filled with so many improbabilities that once the story finally got going, I didn't buy.For example1 - The Husband staking the room at the Ritz with gun in hand. What hotel would leave a man staking a room for minutes on end without rousing any suspicion? What kind of security was there at the Ritz?2 - The woman with the dog leaving the key to her hotel room. Amazing coincidence. 3 - The Daughter who happens to wear the same kind of dress as the cheating Wife. Couldn't they have Audrey and the Wife swap dress before the Husband entered the room? It would have made more sense than having the Daughter walk the ledge in that dress. Just ludicrous. 4 - Even though set in Paris, almost everyone is English the couple is British, the Lover is American and the Daughter who also sounds British, why set the story in Paris? Only Chevalier was authentic to the setting. Couldn't the Lover had been at least French and not American? As much as I like Cooper, hiring him for the Lover was wrong. They should have gotten someone who was not only younger but also French, like Louis Jourdan? 5 - The age disparity between Cooper and Hepburn was ridiculous.

It isn't what you are used to; it isn't what you expect. You educate your palette, and, eventually, you learn to appreciate not just good wine or good cheese, but the very best.Love in the Afternoon is one of the very best films ever made. As comments here reveal, though, uneducated viewers may not appreciate it.It is problematic, primarily, in that Gary Cooper, obviously in his late fifties here, is cast opposite a dewy Audrey Hepburn. The eyeballs of the average viewer are offended, and they want to turn away.Too, the movie, like a great lover, takes its time to achieve its delicious effects. Viewers trained on the rapid-fire vapidity of TV sitcoms can't sit through this movie.Connoisseurs, though, will watch Love in the Afternoon again and again, and find new aspects of it to love every time.First, yes, Gary Cooper *is* old here. His eyes are baggy, his hair is receding, and Wilder does his best to camouflage this by shooting Cooper in shadow, or even in reflection. In one scene he is talking to Hepburn, and we see her, but see him only in his reflection in the surface behind Hepburn.I wonder if this was at all humiliating to Cooper, who was, in his prime, one of the most beautiful -- not just handsome, but truly *beautiful,* with his long eyelashes and lush lips -- men on earth. Too, Cooper did always tend to be more of a reactor than an actor, best cast against live wires like Barbara Stanwyk in Meet John Doe and Jean Arthur in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.  It is hard to believe that he would be able to sweep women off their feet.Cary Grant would have been more believable.But, do Cooper's flaws weaken the film, or, rather, strengthen it?Cary Grant could have been simply too brutal in this part. He was still astounding looking, and he did have an irresistable allure.Had Grant, not Cooper, mouthed Frank Flanagan's callous line, I believe we should all act as if we are between planes. No connections. No complications, Had Grant, not Cooper, callously dismissed the woman who attempted suicide over him, Grant might have sounded like Mack the Knife.Coop, on the other hand, as an aging, inept Lothario, says these lines with a real poignancy. That Time's Winged Chariot can no longer be kept at bay in his life, that Cooper so clearly shows what such a life does to a man's face, and maybe his soul, makes Cooper poignant as well as powerful here. Unlike Grant, Cooper's face did show the wear and tear of his highly glamorous life. No Dorian Gray he. Audrey Hepburn / Ariane's love for obviously aging Cooper/Flanagan becomes not just her powerless surrender to his machine-perfect seduction, complete with his own Gypsy orchestra, but also her *empowered* rescue of him.Hepburn's empowered Ariane shows Cooper's Flanagan real love before it is too late for him ever to experience it. Cary Grant would not have been able to carry off this aspect of the movie as is, and Hepburn would not have achieved the stature opposite Grant that she does achieve opposite Cooper.Now, as for the movie's pace.Wilder is a craftsmen and real movie lovers will drool over every frame of every scene. Wilder delivers sight gags, throwaway lines, fully developed secondary characters. I've seen this movie perhaps a dozen times and every time I see it I see something new, it is that rich, that packed with evidence of Wilder's craftsmanship, and his determination to produce a worthy tribute to his own master, Ernest Lubitsch. Wilder is wildly successful. Tiny bits reward me for returning to this movie. Maurice Chevalier's hand gestures. The black and white cinematography of Paris. The lovers who kiss through street sweepers.The Gypsies, as they are listed in the title credits. The moment when one Gypsy stands out from his orchestra and steps forward, sensing a heightening of romance, and begins to play from his very soul.  Watch his face. It says so much. How many times has he stepped forward like that during one of Flanagan's seductions? And yet he, no less than Flanagan's latest lover, is fully in thrall to the True Romance of the moment. And, and ... Audrey Hepburn. She is a goddess here, no more, no less. Gamine like, and radiating the wisdom of the ages. I don't think Hepburn shines any brighter, or hotter, in any other movie, and, again, it is exactly Cooper's obviously ravagement by time that makes Hepburn so strong here.This movie is funny. It is romantic. It is a salute by one master filmmaker to another. It is a rich display of craftsmanship. It is one of the very best.I'm grateful to Wilder for Love in the Afternoon.

He's a private detective whose client (John McGiver) discovers his wife is having an affair with an American playboy (Gary Cooper).

This provides the funniest sequence in the film, McGiver's seemingly drunk hubby sneering like Edward G. Robinson has he creeps through the halls of Cooper's hotel. But this is where the amusement ends. The film seems to drag for the next hour and a half as Hepburn pretends that Cooper is only one in a long line of daddy types. She is never convincing in that area, which she isn't supposed to be, and Cooper's befuddled amusement only indicates that he is actually bored.This update of Ernest Lubitsch's 1930's sex comedies provides roles for two stars of some of those films, Cooper and Chevalier. This is basically an update of the character that Cooper played in the film version of Noel Coward's Design For Living while Chevalier (Love Me Tonight, One Hour With You) takes away the rascally romantic scoundrel and plays a much more serious part. He would return to the old type of roles in his next film with Gigi. Some people may be put off by Olga Valéry as the hotel guest who keeps spanking her barking dog.

It is almost normal for a woman her age and a man his age to fall for one another.  Yes, Cooper plays an American.  Again, he portrays the European's idea of an American man.  When the water gets thick... he runs (the Englishman doesn't; Chevalier doesn't.)Yes Cooper is a womanizer.  But he changes.  That is the magic of the film.  That movie-magic where the man changes due to the woman in love with him.  (Dear Readers, This does not happen in real life!)And Chevalier's non-reaction to Audrey's fall for Cooper?Look again... he almost expects it to happen.  In his ultimate Francoisie, he accepts that what happens has, and that is amour.  What to do?  Enjoy life, and hope for the best. Try to protect his daughter, but he knows he cannot control her forever.  That is why he did not go ballistic when he discovers she had been repeatedly going through his papers. He believes in c'est la vie.  I just wonder on a scale of 1-10 how much he thinks Cooper was going to take Audrey after all.  Chevalier's character knows people (it's his job.)

Coming in that string of successful films of the late 1940s - 1961, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is probably less well known to modern audiences than SABRINA or STALAG 17. Yet SABRINA has a similar casting error. There Audrey Hepburn played the love interest between William Holden and Humphrey Bogart, ending up with older brother Bogart. Yet somehow that is more acceptable than here where she is love interest to Gary Cooper, who was only a few years older than Bogart.I think the reason is that Wilder's casting in SABRINA was more astute in one way - he cast Walter Hampden in what proved to be Hampden's best movie part - the elder Mr. Larrabee - father to Linus (Humphrey Bogart) and David (William Holden). Hampden looked old enough to be the father of both sons. But in LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, Maurice Chevalier was (in appearance) about the same age as Gary Cooper. Chevalier played the father of Hepburn. It does not make Cooper's matching with Audrey Hepburn sit as well.A younger man was needed (one can suggest Tyrone Power, whom would subsequently pop up in Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION). But Cooper did have one thing that makes his age problem seem less important than it should be. His public persona was that Cooper represented small town (usually western) America. He had won two Oscars for playing a Tennessee mountain boy who became a national hero in World War I (SERGEANT YORK) and an abandoned lawman in a 19th Century western town (HIGH NOON). He did play occasional sophisticates (DESIGN FOR LIVING; BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH HONEYMOON) but those were atypical films. In real life Cooper was a socialite - he hobnobbed with upper class types. This is similar to that elegant roué Frank Flannagan. One can see Cooper fitting that part of the role quite well.So despite the apparent May - September romance, Cooper and Hepburn act as similar sophisticates and their chemistry is not bad. What would have been the result with another actor like Power or Cary Grant or Robert Taylor is hard to say - Grant had the sophistication, and Taylor and Power had developed high acting ability - but Cooper was the actual article.LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is about a young woman, the daughter of a detective (Chevalier) who gets her excitement from reading the files of her father's client's cases. Frequently he is investigating the antics of the career of Frank Flannagan, an American millionaire who is so scandalously famous that the 1950s' scandal sheet magazine CONFIDENTIAL has an entire issue naming him Man of the Year. One client (John McGiver) upon hearing his wife is having an affair with Flannagan decides to shoot him. Hepburn manages to get to the hotel where Flannagan is staying first, and warns him. McGiver does charge in, but does not find his wife there.Flannagan is grateful, but finds that while Ariane is willing to see him again she won't tell him who she is. She shows up at the hotel quietly, after attending her music rehearsals at the Paris Conservatory, and manages to keep Flannagan totally in the dark. Then he leaves the city for a year. They meet a year later, and he does remember her - so they resume their relations. But Ariane is totally in love with him, and she wants to test him. She gives him a history of her sexual life, fully as garish and full of incidents as his. And it drives Flannagan crazy - crazy enough to contact Claude Chevasse (Chevalier) to locate this fascinating girl.The film has many lovely touches in it, from Chevalier's opening about how Parisians are always kissing to McGiver's whining to Cooper's band of musical gypsies who always end by playing Fascination before he has his sexual encounters. If SABRINA aimed at bringing Hepburn and Bogart to Paris in the end, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a perfect follow-up with the characters in Paris itself. It is a perfect love valentine to the spirit of romance, leading to a moving and sweet ending that is narrated in part by Chevalier.Despite that casting problem LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is a beautifully made romantic comedy.

It was a very funny scene to see them dutifully playing their instruments while a steam bath is ongoing for Frank! I like Maurice Chevalier in this film as it gives him more space for character development and not just a bland light type with little depth as in most of his other roles. He's the detective father of young Ariane who plays the cello, and he avoids talking to her about his work which is supposed to be secretive anyways and in this case it involves spying on a wayward wife - so what else is new in Paris? As the story unfolds, Ariane meets and falls for Frank, then endeavours to get some serious attention and commitment from carefree Frank who probably doesn't know the meaning of commitment, but she tries by using a rather indirect ploy and eventually finds he can get jealous of her fabricated other loves in her life while he's away - a ruse she uses to good effect.I suppose you might say Gary Cooper was rather too old for this role as he lacks a certain spontaneity for such light comedy but I'm happy with his presence nonetheless. Don't laugh, but I can just picture Bob Hope playing this role to the hilt, of being a lady's man, such as he's done in so many movies of the past. But that's falling into broad comedy, which this film is not.It's a nicely put together comedy of errors and mistaken identities, and I plan to see it again as one showing can't do it justice.

The pretentious sweetness is often nauseating. Chevalier is too old to be a young girl's father; he (over)employs his famous bedroom smile, but what was sexy 25 years earlier opposite Jeanette McDonald, is now downright creepy, especially since the girl is supposed to be his own daughter. Cooper is too old too and knows it, appearing very uncomfortable and letting some rather embarrassing moments slip in (I've never actually seen him act badly before).

But this is not a reason to find fault with the relationship. It's more that it is difficult to understand how an intelligent young woman, albeit one who is somewhat naive and romantic, could be infatuated by, continue to be beguiled by, and eventually fall in love with the unpleasant lecher played by Cooper. Despite the charm that Gary Cooper has shown in many of his films, here he seems...well, tired and not really acting as though he at all believes in the rancid character he's playing, and he's right.The premise of the film is sour and cynical and the farce doesn't work. The ending injects a jarring sentimental note that only confirms the earlier implausibility of the relationship that the script would have you believe the two leads have. Doesn't work.Audrey Hepburn is her usual magical self, but even she can't make me believe in her character. She is certainly worth watching, however, for the moments when she is, indeed, someone who might appeal to the Cooper character as more than a one-night stand. Maurice Chevalier is surprisingly appealing here and doesn't lay on the French accent and mannerisms that he continued to polish over the years. But, again, he's done in by the script. In his very last scene in the film, he does a total flip-flop in point of view, again demonstrating the screen writers' (Wilder and Diamond) manipulation to ensure a romantically satisfying and totally unbelievable ending. So...nice musical score, lovely black and white cinematography, a charming Hepburn, an appealing Chevalier...but a Wilder misfire, big-time.

Whatever charm Gary Cooper had as a leading man was spent by the time he made this picture. In fact, he was suffering with undiagnosed cancer and it shows. He seems exhausted, pale and flabby. That Audrey Hepburn makes her enchantment with him at all believable is a tribute to her determination as an actress. In an interview, she said that it was Chevalier who wouldn't stop ogling her and that he might have been better cast as her suitor than her father. The whole thing is very squeamish and gives you the idea of how invincible men believed themselves to be and how subjugated women were to them.

It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in Love in the Afternoon was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter.But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie Funny Face, Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable.The problem with casting Cooper in Love in the Afternoon is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in High Noon. To have him play an aging, indifferent roué was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute.Love in the Afternoon is a beautiful love story &#x96; often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny.

But if you watch this movie carefully and pay attention to where Arianne's character is coming from, it isn't odd at all. Michel, the young man her father would like her to marry, IS young. But he is also immature and fussy. Arianne's father, on the other hand, is of course an older man . . . but has an ebullient spirit. Arianne sees that same ebullience in Frank Flannigan, although it is obviously going in a dangerous direction since by romancing other men's lives Flannigan is putting his own life in danger.Arianne is also drawn to Flannigan's exotic American ruggedness--like Abraham Lincoln, he is tall, rough-hewn, and even a bit shy. (i.e., He employs the gypsy band to help him romance women since he's often at a loss for words.) That he is at this stage in his life too old to behaving like a young roue also does not escape her notice.The more I watch this film, the more I realize that Arianne would HAVE to fall in love with an older man, like her father, but whom she finds sexually attractive. That Flannigan has proved himself to be an international playboy, albeit very long in the tooth, brings out the rescuer in Arianne . . . and, as she continues to see him, she not only falls in love with him; she learns to care for him deeply.

La Ronde is probably our one exposure to these stories of turn-of-century Vienna, but Wilder drew upon the cynical mood at times....has any film that won an Oscar been more cynical than The Apartment? 'Love in the Afternoon' is a total reversal of tone, perhaps because we see the story from point of view of Ariane, the young woman first setting out to find love. What a beautiful film, not only for its 'glorious' black and white photography, its wonderful music and its luminous portrayal of Hepburn, but also because it tames the playboy, the bounder and cad. Yes, Grant could have played the part but in some ways, I doubt he had the vulnerability of Cooper in that wonderful scene where Coop listens to the Dictaphone as Ariane recites her list of lovers. Grant would have been Grant. He would have mugged, sputtered 'a BULLFIGHTER', and been angry. Cooper is a man growing old and realizing he needs something in his life. He is wooden at times, and he does look old, but how vulnerable he seems. And Cooper is better than Grant when alone and in thought.Watch the way Wilder uses the gypsy musicians and the servants of the hotel as a Greek chorus to comment on the progress of love. The great cradle robber did the same in 'Mighty Aphrodite' but without the subtlety of Wilder.Chevalier and Hepburn make a lovely father/daughter.

In the film, Audrey Hepburn is a young woman who lives with her private- detective father and is fascinated by his sordid cases, finding the affairs and suicides wildly romantic. She becomes involved with a particularly notorious playboy, Gary Cooper.People object to Cooper/Hepburn's 30-year age difference, but I think the problem is more Cooper than the age difference. Director Wilder originally offered the part to Cary Grant, who was only 3 years younger than Cooper and who played opposite Hepburn quite successfully a few years later in Charade. I think people would have been far less bothered with Grant in the role, both because he was a better actor than Cooper, who had limited range, and because Cooper seems somewhat weak and ill; apparently he had health problems. Even then, I didn't find him as awful as some did; he still had a certain folksy charm, even when playing a cad.The story is not, I think, entirely unrealistic. Hepburn's character was full of a foolish romanticism and Cooper's character fascinated her before they even met. If you can accept that a woman would be intrigued by an inveterate player (and ultimately there are women who are attracted to Casanovas), then Hepburn's fascination and dissembling make perfect sense, at least when aided by Hepburn's beautifully tuned performance. Young beautiful women do sometimes fall in love with powerful, much older men, even if it seems nuts that they do.Throughout the movie, I was worried that I would be aggravated by the ending I expected, but while I got pretty much that ending, I thought it actually worked well. Somehow Wilder waded into the absurdity so slowly and smoothly, and Hepburn and Chevalier as her father were so dead on, that I could believe the whole, ridiculous thing. This is also a beautifully directed movie. While it's a very slight comedy, there is a lovely formal structuralism to it. It is a movie that is clearly by a talented director, yet not a movie that is trying to show off those talents. The scene with the liquor tables is beautiful but also practical and unshowy. Everything is like that; nothing is extraneous.There is a lot to object to in this movie, particularly the rather indulgent view the film takes toward Cooper's unsavory character and the utter silliness of the whole thing. Yet Hepburn's radiance, Wilder's brilliance, and an amusing script make the movie far more enjoyable than it has any right to be.

He told his daughter, Ariane (played by Audrey Hepburn) that Flannagan was a cad, despicable character &#x96; that he was no good. Flannagan, played by Gary Cooper, is an aged American millionaire playboy. He has no qualms or regrets about his many affairs with women &#x96; married or not. Love them and leave them. That's his motto. Is that the type of man anyone would want a daughter, sister or friend to go for? I think not. Of course, we viewers know that Ariane knew about Flannagan's character (played by Gary Cooper), because she sneaked into her father's files. Yet she falls for this guy anyway. Is that romance or love? It may be romantic daydreaming or fantasizing, but love or real romance it isn't. We parents, grandparents and others who have experienced such things ourselves have known it by another term &#x96; infatuation. Ariane's father cautions his daughter, but she pursues Flannagan anyway. The demure Hepburn's character feigns a nubile persona, but we audience members can't disregard her puerile innocence, if the Flannagan character can't see through her. So, the first big problem with this film is that it is not a love story, or even a romance. It is a slice of life, of course, with some comedy. I am not averse to a story of young and old love. Some other films have handled this very well. Battle Circus was a 1953 film that had a young Army nurse fall for an older Army doctor during the Korean War. Humphrey Bogart (late 40s to early 50s) and June Alyson (late 20s) were very believable in their roles. On the other hand, some other films also have treated age differences quite well &#x96; as infatuation. The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer was such a film in 1947. It starred Cary Grant as a late-30s or early-40s playboy artist and professor, with Shirley Temple as the teen sister of Myrna Loy. Most reviewers have noted the huge age difference between the two leads in this film. Many found it a problem that takes away from the films' believability. And thus, its appeal. Audrey Hepburn was 28 playing an 18-year-old; Gary Cooper was 56 playing a 65-year-old &#x96; at least he looked it, for that time. And the script never tries to specify what his age is &#x96; just that he's an older playboy millionaire. Try as they do, with the old news clips of a wild Flannagan (played by Cooper), the movie makers couldn't convince this viewer &#x96; or most viewers &#x96; that Flannagan was in his 40s. As hip as the script tried to paint him, Flannagan definitely was not so. And that is the problem. A 35 to 45- year-old would have been an older man for a teenage girl in the 1950s. Another reviewer commented that Gary Cooper's was a grandfather character. I agree. Audrey Hepburn and her performance are the main reasons this film earns even 5 stars from me. Maurice Chevalier did very well with his role. Cooper was wooden. The idea of the film was OK and had possibilities. But it needed a younger character and actor as the playboy who could find true love and mend his ways. As it is, this script is terrible. That and the big age differences, and the casting of Gary Cooper as Flannagan made this film a dud.

A Rom-Com-Dram about a middle aged playboy who falls for a young innocent woman in Paris. Sure, the film takes place in what is known as the most romantic city in the world, but it was a truly romantic story. Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn give great performances as two completely opposite people who end up sharing a little more than just one kiss.Wilder does a great job of setting the tone of the film within the first few minutes with Maurice Chevalier's voice-over with the beautiful Paris landscape shown. He tells us about all of the different kinds of love and how it can be beautiful in even the most unpredictable circumstances. The film then takes a little while before our leads meet, but we get introduced to Monsieur X, who is pretty much the comedic relief of the film. The film is almost 60 years old, but I found myself laughing quite a bit. Whether it was the Monsieur's strange responses and interactions with the cast, or the ongoing gag of Mr. Flanagan's 'gypsies', the film is quite hilarious.But that doesn't take away from the romantic drama and tension that formulates between Hepburn & Cooper. At first I wasn't sure I believed that she would fall for someone that unlikable, but over the course of a few hours it was pretty obvious the feeling became mutual. I highly recommend this film for giving us a different take on romance, and for just how beautiful of a film it is.

Now I'm older I know relationships between older men and girls decades younger work out just fine, as each is drawn to the other so much more than to persons their own age.There were a lot of movies in the late 1950's with older men involved with young girls simply because so many of Hollywood's top stars had aged and young ones had failed to take their place.Hepburn looks really good, with her ultra-slim figure and cute face; but a young one with a stronger personality would be better.Love in the Afternoon is simply NOT one of Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

I have to vote for number 2.Writing, directing, cinematography, music and acting are all wonderful. The problem is simply how old Gary Cooper looks and how young Audrey Hepburn looks. He looks 60 and she looks 20. A woman having a sexual urge for a father figure is only a bit perverse, but a woman falling in love with a grandfather figure is more pathetic than romantic.One could understand the casting mistake. Cooper was 56 and Hepburn was 27 when the film was made. It was typical for handsome leading males in their 40s to play with females in their 20's. A 29 year age difference, as Cooper and Hepburn had, was not atypical. Gary Grant had about a 26 year age difference when he worked with Hepburn, six years later in Charade and with Leslie Caron when he worked with her the following year in Father Goose. Yet Grant aged well and had such a touch for light comedy that he seemed in his 40s when he was 60.Cooper is likable in comedies like Mr Deeds and Meet John Doe, but it is in more dramatic stuff like A Farewell to Arms and High Noon that he is strongest. He has a few funny moments here, but for the most part he is way too serious for the movie's fluffy-light tone. The dog playing Lulu is much better.So the real joy and reason to watch the movie is Hepburn. She is almost as beautiful and delightful here as she is in Breakfast at Tiffanie's and My Fair Lady.

Hepburn, with her actual age half of Coop's, both looked and acted like somebody who might be a college freshman.As a playboy, I'm not sure Cooper would have bee best for this part if he were the Gary Cooper of 1938. And seeing it today, with the pristine movie-making standards and practices of the 1950's, it is as corny as watching an old Stooges flick (without the classic camp appeal the Stooges have enjoyed for many years now).In terms of its times, apparently the aging lothario's aim is to lure fair young damsels to his upscale afternoon digs with the hopes of going so far as (perhaps) to be able eventually to plant a closed-mouth kiss or two on them.And Chevalier's hokey metaphorical speech to Cooper, imploring him - who has his pick among the big fish - to throw the little fish, his daughter, back, is positively ludicrous.This film as maybe a 4* originally, slightly better today for its nostalgia.

The Ritz Hotel, overlooking Place Vendome, was the place where Flannagan, the American millionaire, loved to entertain his female guests in style, Gypsy band and all. The story of the romance between two people so unlikely to fall in love is the basis of this comedy of 1957 directed by Billy Wilder a man who brought so much joy to movie audiences with his light touch and intelligence.Ariane, the daughter of a Parisian P.I., Claude Chavasse, loved to spy on her father's cases. She had a way of opening the places he so carefully tried to lock away from everyone. As the story begins, we watch Claude taking pictures, perched in the obelisk in the center of Place Vandome, looking directly into suite 14 of the famous Ritz Hotel. A jealous husband had asked the investigator to follow his wife, who is the woman Claude photographs inside the room making love to the American millionaire. Ariane, a cello student, eavesdrops the conversation her father is having with the husband. The cuckolded man has a loaded gun ready to kill her wife's lover.Ariane decides to warn the would be victim, and goes to the hotel to warn Flannagan and his paramour about what is about to happen. Little does Ariane know to what extent she will get involved with the man that is an incurable womanizer. Knowing what she knows, Ariene will be wise to stay away from Flannagan, but she can't help falling heads over heels with the worldly man that steals her heart.Love in the Afternoon is a romantic comedy based on a novel by Claude Anet. Mr. Wilder and his usual collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, turned it into a comedy that keeps delighting audiences even after fifty years when it was made. The pairing of Gary Cooper, who at fifty six looked way too old for Audrey Hepburn, paid off for the creators in many ways. The film shows a relaxed and playful Cooper doing comedy. Mr. Cooper excels with his take on Frank Flannagan. Audrey Hepburn is also enjoyable with her fresh approach to Ariane. Maurice Chevalier plays Ariane's father, the P.I. man that, in spite of what he knew about the playboy, is not at all unhappy his own daughter gets involved with the man he spied on.A romantic comedy highly recommended because of the work of Billy Wilder and that of its two stars, Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.

I guess when he gets it right, he gets it right, because the direction here is fantastic. This is one of the most romantic romances, and one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while, told with such a sense of style and wit that I enjoyed it more than I believed possible. Audrey Hepburn stars as a young student of the cello. Her father (Maurice Chevalier) is a private detective, and she loves to follow his sordid cases. One particular character appears in many of his cases as a cuckold, Gary Cooper. When one of Chevalier's clients plans to shoot Cooper, Hepurn overhears and sets out to warn him. Afterwards, they begin a romance. She's very inexperienced, and obviously a little afraid that he'll so thoroughly outclass and manipulate her that she decides to play some head games with him, telling him that she has had many lovers. By driving him to insane jealousy, she thinks she can see if he can possibly be in love for real. The biggest fault of the film, one that everyone agrees on no matter at what degree they love the movie, is that Gary Cooper is horrendously miscast. This has got to be one of the worst cases of casting in history. He's a thousand years older than Hepburn. Well, a lot of Hepburn's co-stars were far too old for her, and it harms any number of her films. Weren't there any actors in their 20s, 30s, or, heck, even 40s who were good enough to match Audrey? Why did directors and producers of her films think she would rather sleep with someone 30 years her senior? Has it something to do with her as a person? You know, this might have been the perfect opportunity to put Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn together again for a reunion. Fortunately, Cooper's presence (or poor performance) doesn't hurt the film anywhere near as much as you would suppose, or as some have suggested. I guess Cooper is such a blank actor that you can more or less ignore him. The movie is, after all, about Audrey; Audrey is everything to the film. And she is perfect. She plays it so subtly and wonderfully; it's really one of her greatest performances. The humor is very good. I love the picnic scene, the way that chicken leg is used as a prop. And those gypsies are great. I might have been annoyed at them in a lesser movie, but they are always used very well. The scene where Cooper is becoming obsessed with a recording that Audrey has made, which lists all of her love affairs, is a highlight, with Cooper and the gypsies rolling a cart full of alcoholic drinks on it back and forth in his hotel room.

In find, in the final scene, we find Wilder, Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn at the their classic best (and could Hepburn be any more lovable than we find her here?). The gypsy musician scene, the PI scene and the final train station scene are some of the funniest and most moving scenes you will ever see. And the ending will bring a tear to your eye. Here you'll find a classic romantic comedy brilliance at a level only a great director and writer like Wilder and great actors like Cooper and Hepburn could pull off. Overall, this is an entertaining film and an amusing way to spend an evening. It's a light romantic comedy featuring the creative input of many movie heavyweights (including a writing assist from Iz Diamond - with whom Wilder would later write the great comedy Some Like It Hot and a very charming Maurice Chevalier). A 27-year old Hepburn is very endearing and inspired in a this movie. This is one of her finest performances ever and she absolutely puts this film over the top. Great as Cooper was (and I'm a Gary Cooper fan) - Hepburn could have used a different male romantic lead. Cooper himself had misgivings of playing this part because he felt he was too old. It's not that he's old - it's that the evidence (to those who are aware of it) of his painful fatal illness (he died only four years later) diminished his presence here (he appears ill and lacking in a certain characteristic energy) and it made him less than perfect for this film. Still, you will see notable flashes of Cooper's charm and brilliance here. Chevalier - though although miscast (he was arguably too old to play Hepburn's father) - makes the most of his part and is highly charming. In fact, like Hepburn, he is at his best here as an actor and comic straight man. And in many ways his strong performance keeps this film afloat. In fact, his contribution to the final scene - though small in measured time - is priceless. You'll know what I mean when you see it. He puts the humor in this most touching scene. And he puts the period on this film - endorsing and making nice the rocky romance that was developing, as only Chevalier could do. With Chevalier's final contributions, we feel super good. It doesn't get any better than this.True - Wilder's comic genius is not at its height especially at the start of this film - but as it goes along, you'll discover so many little classically funny and amusing vignettes - scenes created by a master, scenes you'll remember forever - that you'll be glad you stuck with this film to the very end.Enjoy!

For the rest of the movie, she adopts a sophisticated, blasé persona to beat him at his own game.This summary, though, does not do justice to the script, which is an object lesson in how to set up jokes and keep them running.

(Flannagan hires a funny quartet of gypsy musicians whenever he's brought a girl up to his suite.)

The witty script requires a light touch, but Cooper tends to bellow his lines. And if he's intended as a satire of a gauche American millionaire among European sophisticates, the movie doesn't go far enough in that direction to justify his performance.Considering that Love in the Afternoon has very few characters, it's a little too long&#151;some of the scenes involving Ariane's pursuit of Flannagan could have been trimmed. But for the most part, the superb screenplay, and Hepburn's delightful personality, keep everything bubbling along.

I concur with that assessment. I kept wondering why Audrey Hepburn's character would be attracted to an old man. But more so, why is she attracted to a man who makes his life nothing but a series of conquests? I have seen almost all of Billy Wilder's films and enjoyed them (some immensely), but this one just never felt right with me. The attraction seemed too awkward, the film ran a bit too long... I just could not see it. And for the father to support such a thing was even more astounding.If I have to say one nice thing about the movie, it is how it brings out the classic double standard of men and women with dating. The playboy travels from country to country, glorified in the newspaper for being a man of loose morals. But when he confronts a woman who has seemingly done the same, he panics.

I would guess Ms. Hepburn was also trying to keep from retching. It gives me the creeps even to think of it. Miscasting? Worse than that. Cary Grant couldn't have brought it off, either. Any man ten years older than her would soil Audrey Heburn's wonderful sweetness and innocence, like a dishrag tossed into a soufflé. Casting certainly was a problem, but rather than replace Grant, they should have replaced Hepburn, selecting a less radiant actress, someone who looks naive perhaps but for whom there might be some plausibility in the idea of her being romantically attracted to a much older man. She might have a little desperation about her, for example, or an air of loneliness, something to explain her allowing the advances of a man so horrifically unsuitable for her. Shudder!

Much of its charm is due to the excellent acting of its leads--Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier. Much of the charm was due to the lovely script. And the whole thing was tied together nicely by exceptional direction and music. They just don't make them like this anymore.Gary Cooper plays an aging playboy and from what I have read about his personal life, this wasn't any sort of a stretch. Oddly, Maurice Chavalier plays a French private detective who investigates unfaithful spouses--a serious departure from his role in GIGI! And Audrey Hepburn, who is certainly luminous and the star of this film, plays Chavalier's young daughter. Audrey is fascinated by her father's business and ultimately comes to meet playboy Cooper as a result of this odd obsession. However, she knows he cannot love her or care about her--as he is afraid of commitment and loves the carefree life. But, at the same time, given her sheltered life, he is most fascinating, so Audrey creates a false persona and convinces Cooper that she's been with lots and lots of men--and is sort of a younger female equivalent of him! Eventually, however, he is smitten and their romance becomes more serious--causing complications for both--he IS a playboy and she IS a naive young lady who certainly deserves better. How this is all wrapped up is where the movie really, really excels--and the ending is one that is sure to bring a tear to almost anyone's eye. A marvelous romance that is greatly underrated and practically forgotten. You've got to see this movie!PS--Although the people from PETA would definitely not think it was funny, the scenes where the owner of the Yorkie keeps smacking it are hilarious. You've gotta see it to believe it!PPS--John McGiver is terrific in a small supporting role--he's so gosh darn cute and contributed a lot of color to this film.

I watched this a few nights after watching One, Two, Three - which I hated - and I was enchanted by it. Sure, an obviously ageing and, I believe ill Gary Cooper is not the obvious love match - the age gap makes the match a little creepy - and yet Cooper adds pathos as the playboy who, if he didn't lose it to Audrey, would surely be on the brink of losing it anyway. It makes for an entirely different, and much more interesting, movie than if the obvious choice of Cary Grant had been cast. Cooper, after all, had been the biggest movie star (and the most handsome) in the world in his youth, but was looking haggard and old beyond his years by the time he appeared in this. Hepburn, of course, is simply bewitching and enchanting, as she was in all but the biggest turkeys (even she fails to light up the tedious Paris When it Sizzles). The parallels with Sabrina Fair are obvious, and so is the charm of this unlikely but lovely tale.

The biggest problem is the romance that the film is centered around. Gary Cooper is not only too old, but also lacks the charisma required for a playboy character, and there are few sparks that arise between Hepburn and himself. It is hardly credible what happens in the film, but there are so many effective gags to be had along the way that it is not a poorly written film. The funniest segments are those that involve the elderly dog owner played by Olga Valéry and bumbling John McGiver as a naïve cuckold. The best of the cast is no doubt Hepburn though, who is beautiful and perfect for her role. Both the music choices on set and overplayed music are wonderful too. It is not quite as perfect as Wilder's best comedies tend to be, with a slow moving second half and an annoying supporting character played by Van Doude, in addition to the romance problem, but Wilder still manages to make a charming film overall. The fact that it is also laugh-out-loud funny at times is no disadvantage.

The two are, of course, chalk and cheese; whilst Wilder epitomises wit, sophistication, urbanity, style, class to name only a handful of qualities Rohmer epitomises slow-drying paint. Like Rodgers and Hart and Astaire and Rogers Audrey Hepburn and Paris is a match made in heaven and having sent her there for a couple of reels in Sabrina three years earlier Wilder now has her domiciled there and living life to the wide-eyed full or, to put it another way, we're talking chaste, which is what she is both by fellow music student Michel and ageing lech Gary Cooper. In one sense Wilder has come full circle here for back in 1938 when he was - in terms of Hollywood at least - just a writer he wrote a script for Ernst Lubitsch called Bluebeard's Eighth Wife in which Gary Cooper played a much-married millionaire until Claudette Colbert fixed his wagon. Here he plays much the same role without the marriage part until ... yeah, you guessed it, Audrey Hepburn fixes his wagon. Where Audrey Hepburn is concerned I would happily purchase a wagon if she'd promise to fix it even though I'd be in back of a line stretching from here of Mindanao. The great thing about Wilder is that he doesn't just do brittle dialogue he also does sight gags - there was a doozy in Bluebeard - and here he has a lot of fun with a drinks trolley and four gypsy musos. He's also a great craftsman and constructs screenplays as solid as Dutch barns and this is no exception. For good measure Maurice Chevalier is on hand as Hepburn's father and I suppose she considered herself lucky he wasn't playing the Cooper role - one could argue that having cast her opposite Bogie in Sabrina and now Cooper Wilder was probably more than a little in love with her himself and living, as they say, vicariously.
