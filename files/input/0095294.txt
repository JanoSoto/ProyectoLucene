He brings us to a world where monsters have politics, the 5 senses rule, and we sometimes question whether our pre-notions of pain are as accurate as we think. The Hellraiser series is a lush, nightmarish, subliminal journey into human desire, masochism, mythos and madness. Pinhead is not so much the generic, evil antagtonist as he is a source of comfort and logic sometimes. Clive Barker has often toyed with our preconceptions that all monsters must be blindly destructive brutes, as opposed to the endearingly rational and decidedly intelligent Cenobites. Perhaps the fact that I have Cenobites tattooed makes me biased;) But it's still a unique piece with gorgeous imagery (to some.) Angels to some, demons to others... If you haven't seen Hellraiser 1 and 2 (the rest are not so great IMHO)...you must!

The plot sustains the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish,though the first half hour of Hellbound Hellraiser II is a little bit slow and descriptive (but never boring); a great portion of the action and the terror is concentrated in the last minutes. The last thirty ones are a realistic and gutsy tour de force through fear,violence and suffering.This is definitively a masterpiece, but not for the squeamish.Hellbound Hellraiser II is rated R for extreme violence and sex scenes,it runs 99 minutes(uncut version released by Anchor Bay).It stars Clare Higgins as Julia, Ashley Laurence as Kirsty, Imogen Boorman as Tiffany,William Hope as Kyle McRae and Kenneth Cranham as Dr. Channard.If you like this movie, you might also enjoy Phenomena and Suspiria.

OK, the acting is largly dire -  but is this not a horror movie tradition? The film excels in its MENTAL imagery, not physical Tiffany's disturbing   visions of babies with their mouth's sewn shut as Leviathan plays with her fears; Channards violent, acid flashback-style memories... they are all insightful and well-thought out as they deal with that which cannot be tamed easily - the human psyche. Director Tony Randall has a lot to live up to following  Clive Barker's '87 epic, but he takes the reigns of the story with good grace and presents a slick and progressive tale - although I do agree with the general consensus that the Cenobites should NOT have been humanised.  All in all though a great film, fantastic visuals - the fall of Leviathan at the climax has to be one of the most gripping and explosive deaths of a movie monster in horror film history - and one which should have ended the tale.

But with Clive Barker releasing a majority of creative control (he still receives a story by credit) to screenwriter friend Pete Atkins and first time director Tony Randel, the end result is a film that faithfully echoes Barker's earlier work yet also undermines it.The film's biggest problem is the script which relies too much on coincidence. For example, new character Dr. Channard has a deep and previously existing interest in the Lament Configuration. And Kirsty's neighbor in the mental ward just happens to be a mute girl who is really good at solving puzzles. Things like this exist solely to move the plot from point A to B and so on, something the original HELLRAISER lacked in its confined dysfunctional family storyline. To Atkin's credit, the script does effectively introduce the back story of Pinhead and features some appropriately bleak dialogue (including perhaps the series best line Your suffering will be legendary, even in hell.).In their attempt to deliver something bigger and better than the original, the filmmakers further damage themselves when it comes to Kirsty's adversaries. The sequel has two great foes for Kirsty to battle &#150; Julia and Pinhead &#150; but the script makes them secondary and shifts the focus to the ridiculous Dr. Channard. While in human form he is a fearsome villain but once he becomes a Cenobite, all that goes out the window in favor of a guy who delivers one liners (The Doctor&#133;is&#133;in!). At this point in the series, even Pinhead hadn't sunk that low. On top of all that, Atkins actually has the Cenobite Channard dispatch the lead Cenobites in a battle that is so trivializing that it makes you wonder why anyone feared these guys in the first place.Tony Randel handles the film well visually with his two best sequences taking place in hell. One is when mute Tiffany experiences her own surreal vision of hell that includes everything from deranged clowns to a clever giallo tribute. The other is when Kirsty confronts her Uncle Frank in a fiery tomb housing floating slabs that carry moaning, bloody bodies. These visions of hell are certainly unique to the film world but ultimately the film doesn't have the budget to properly convey this. Instead of a sweeping landscape, we get characters traveling what seems to be the same tunnel over and over and a few MC Escher style matte paintings. Most disappointing is the unveiling of Leviathan as an amorphous black blur emitting from a large version of the box.Outside of those uneven effects, the rest of the film's effects work is really well done. Bob Keen and his crew return from the original film and deliver an abundant amount of blood, making sure that the standard of delivering cinematic images beyond belief continues. The bloody resurrection of Julia and the transformation of Dr. Channard are the film's FX highlights. Obviously the unrated version is the way to go. In addition to these striking images, HELLBOUND contains the world's first male/skinless female kiss.And for a film with such taboo images, it features some consistently great acting. Lead Ashley Laurence (was she really in her teens when this was filmed) is actually better than she was in the first film. New faces Kenneth Cranham and William Hope are both good as the bad doctor and good doctor respectively. Doug Bradley, graduating from Lead Cenobite to a full fledged Pinhead, maintains his wicked demeanor as a hell's no. 1 agent while projecting the right amount of emotion when reminded of his human form. However, if HELLRAISER II truly belongs to anyone, it is Claire Higgins as the evil stepmother Julia Cotton. With a cold manner dipped in extra bitchy-ness, Higgins is almost too good for the proceedings.New World's efforts for the low budget follow up paid off with the film earning just under ($12 million) what the original grossed ($14.5 million). Sadly, the next time Pinhead and his brethren appeared on screen, they were firmly in the claws of Miramx's Dimension line. This move resulted in a succession of sequels that, while passable, moved the series further away from Clive Barker's groundbreaking original.

Clive Barkers imagery of hell is profane, violent, and an oddly erotic movie from the off. The sequel continues the fantastic story, and builds on the characters we saw, whilst adding some new ones to the mix. As well as re-introducing the dead ones! As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since. For 1988, Hellraiser 2 is nothing short of breathtaking, and has not dated one bit. The storyline is intelligent and despite the incredible sights of hell and its inhabitants, Hellbound justifies the fantasy with thoughtful dialogue and logic and a powerful story. It also benefits that the cast in this film are mostly great actors who do a great job of suspending the viewers disbelief.Barker gives credibility to the monster in the movie. Every beast in this film has a human side and you may even feel warmed to them when they are faced with dilemmas and dramas which question even their beliefs. There is a powerful scene in which Pinhead and his minions learn of their own past from Kirsty, the heroin of the story who is pursued by the cenobites for opening the puzzle box. Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the bad guys in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the good guys, and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.The violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.I recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets.9/10 "},{"Title":"Gore drenched sequel, well worth watching.","Date":"27 October 2004","Score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" The first and only decent sequel to Clive Barkers impressive original Hellraiser. HellboundHellraiser 2 starts almost immediately after the event of the original. After a brief recap of Hellraiser up to this point featuring footage form the original, we see another unsuspecting victim, Captain Elliot Spencer (Doug Bradley without his Pinhead special make up effects applied) solve the mystery of the Chinese puzzle box and is impaled with hooks that tear his skin, razors cut lines in his head and an unseen thing inserts long pins into his scalp and thus creating Pinhead (Doug Bradley with the make up), the lead Cenobite from the Hellraiser films. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence again) is seen in a hospital room, the police have discovered rotting maggot infested corpses in Kirstys dads house, like the original in its uncut version this film is very gory and explicit. A detective named Ronson (Angus MacInnes) questions Kirsty, she doesn't make much sense to him, speaking of demons and that her dad is trapped in hell and still suffering. The detective doesn't believe it and hands her over to Dr Channard (Kenneth Cranham). Channard uses the information he gets from Kirsty to re-animate Julia (the returning Clare Higgins). He also uses a patient under his care named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) to solve the puzzle of the box and reopen the door to hell, Pinhead and his Cenobite friends from the original, the Butterball Cenobite (Simon Bamford), the Chatterer Cenobite (Nicholas Vince) and the female Cenobite (Barbie Wilde, who I've met in real life by the way!) also make an appearance and join the fun. Kirsty discovers what Channard is doing and follows him into hell to try and save her dad. Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman another returning cast member from the original) also turns up and soon after loses his heart and skin at the hands of a vengeful Julia. Channard gets turned into a Cenobite and all hell starts to break lose. This time directed by Tony Randel, Hellbound is another impressive film, it recaptures the dark feel and hellish atmosphere of the original. Once again the special make up effects are explicit and well done, people slicing themselves up with straight razors in a very nasty scene, more skinless people and corpses, slit throats, hand amputations, brain surgery and all sorts of other bodily mutilation are presented for our viewing pleasure in the uncut version, which is the one I'm reviewing here. The script co-written by Barker keeps thing moving nicely, even though someone should tell them police officers don't carry guns in the UK, towards the start of the movie a police man while searching the house from the original gets scared by a corpse that falls out of a wardrobe and proceeds to shoot it several times, as I said the police in the UK don't carry guns, I know I've lived here all my life! A very minor complaint. This time the film is mostly set in Hell and we get lots of perverse imagery to convince us. I especially like the juggler who's using his own eyeballs to juggle with. After this the Hellraiser franchise went down hill, becoming too Americanized, part 3 for instance was set in an American city and featured Pinhead and his Cenobites killing lots of teenagers, just like countless other soulless unoriginal slasher films. HellboundHellraiser 2 in my opinion is the only worthy sequel to the original, its dark and has the same perverse atmosphere, it features even more blood gore and mutilation and doesn't feature stupid teenagers been hacked up. A very entertaining horror film for those with the stomach. I liked this just as much as the original, high praise. The version I watched was the recent British special edition DVD from Anchor Bay UK, which is the uncut version, the only way to watch it as far as I'm concerned. Recommended.

Director Tony Randel's sequel keeps up the terrifying atmosphere and genuinely infernal creepiness of its predecessor and is even considerably gorier than the (also very gruesome) original. This second entry to the Hellraiser franchise epitomizes pure Horror as its predecessor and takes the viewer on a terrifying journey into the pits of a Hell from the mind of Clive Barker.The film starts off pretty much where the first part ended. After the horrifying events that took place in part one, survivor Kristy Cotton (Ashley Laurence) awakes in a mental hospital. One might think that psychiatrists are not eager to believe stories about Cenobites, demons from a bizarre, sadomasochistic Hell. The head of the institution, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), however, is obsessed with occultism and has his own plans with his new cognitions about cenobites and resurrection from Hell...***Warning! BIG SPOILERS Ahead!*** Kristy's evil stepmother Julia (Clare Higgins) returns from Hell, and she is not the only one. So do the Cenobites. The cenobites, especially the iconic Lead Cenobite (commonly referred to as 'Pinhead', played by Doug Bradley) are some of the most terrifying creatures the World of Horror has ever brought forth. My only slight complaint about Hellbound is the manner of how the cenobites are humanized towards the end. It seems to be a common assumption among makers of Horror-sequels, that they somehow need to explain how monsters became monsters - which is not always a good idea, in my opinion. Ever since I first saw the first two Hellraiser parts many years ago, I have held the view that the Cenobites were most terrifying in the first part, when they were still utterly mysterious and their origin was not yet explained. This minor fault is not yet extreme in this second part, however, and it does not waste its status as a fascinating sequel. The visions of Hell are extremely creepy and terrifying and character actor Kenneth Channard brings in a new type of purely evil villain. The sequel is, once again, filmed excellently, the settings are sublime and the gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets. Overall, Hellbound is an extraordinary sequel that must not be missed by Horror fans. After this, the series spiraled downwards.

She is now locked up in a mental ward run by an occult-obsessed doctor (how appropriate) and her evil stepmother, Julia (Clare Higgins) refuses to stay dead.This film is incredibly polarizing, I fear, because it has such strong qualities of both good and bad. The bad include special effects that really date the movie (though are still superior to much of today's work) and the introduction of a certain level of silliness that pervades the later films. The doctor as a cenobite is a bit strange in form, and opens the door for the even more bizarre creatures in part three.There are some plot and continuity issues, such as wondering where Kirsty's boyfriend from part one went. And while the film seems to try to explain loose ends from the first film, it creates a whole lot more... the maze (presumably hell) is not adequately explained, nor is the role of the giant puzzle box. While some of this is addressed in later films, it seems that what we learn later tends to contradict what we see here.But let us say some good things about this one. First and foremost, the Julia without skin looks incredible. It is hard to say they topped Frank without skin (from the original) but I think they did. The way she comes crawling up out of the bed... her blood-soaked flesh. Beautiful. Right to Die owes a huge debt to the work in this film, the same way that this film owes a debt to Bride of Frankenstein with its use of thunder and bandages...We also have to give the gore creators some credit, because the insane man with the knife was pretty intense... actually, all the asylum inmates are well-played. For all the flaws this film may have, they more than made up for it with a couple of memorable scenes. While my favorite in the series is Bloodline (I believe I am in the minority on this), I think part two may have been the last great addition. Sequels were not necessary, and obviously everything after part four just gives the franchise a bad name.Anchor Bay has released a twentieth anniversary edition, and I would strongly recommend it. Older features, such as an audio commentary from 2001, are available, as well as a few new featurettes. The Soul Patrol features new interviews with Barbie Wilde, Simon Bamford and Nicholas Vince. Outside the Box features a new interview with director Tony Randel and The Doctor is In features a new interview with Kenneth Cranham. As someone who has met Ashley Laurence, Doug Bradley, Clive Barker and each of the cenobites, I have a strong personal interest in this film. I can say that the Anchor Bay edition is easily the best to date and any Hellraiser fan would be making a mistake in getting an older, inferior edition.

I'm not going to lie, this is my favorite of the series and the entire thing is just wonderfully done. But more on that later. Hellraiser 2 is what happens when you take the creative material away from Clive Barker's not-so-adequate directing and screenplay writing skills. Peter Atkins(screenplay) and Tony Randel(director) take over here, with Clive Barker in an executive producer role and the result is a much better viewing experience than the original Hellraiser(which was, in it's own right, a well-done but very flawed movie).The Good For one, I think Claire Higgins is still melodramatic. But she does a much better job of controlling herself here. Ashley Laurence turns in another good performance here. Kenneth Cranham was fantastic as the Good doctor and soon-to-be Cenobite Channard. And Doug Bradley shines as always, and he always gets the best lines(We have an eternity to know your flesh). The best part about this were the effects. Here we get to see glimpses of hell and it's not pretty. The budget was higher here and you can tell. It HAD to be. There was an addition cenobite, and just the fact they had to design hell to be fantastical meant they had to throw some more money in the pot. Pinhead's origin, while gory is fantastic.The Bad The entire Evil Queen rant from Julia made me cringe. Also, there were some logic gaps. How can someone die in Hell if they're technically already dead? I don't care so much about turning the cenobites good as that actually sets up Hellraiser III quite well. How does Julia get her own skin back when she is resurrected when Frank had to steal his brother's in the original? And how the hell does she have makeup and nail polish on her new skin? Plot inconsistencies are the worst part here, at least the original Hellraiser had that going for it in the fact it ran smoothly. And while the dialog in general is better, there are some cringe-worthy lines(You got a ticket to Hell?)The Ugly Gore is not cut out just for the fantasy elements of it all. Skinless people once again run amok, a guy cuts himself over and over with a razor, there are some nasty maggot/infected wound shots, brain surgery, slit throats, impaling, skin ripping and the rather graphic origin of Pinhead himself. Another favorite for gore hounds.Final Verdict Hellbound is a great film in it's own right. It's a fantasy horror film that plays like a travel guide for hell, which I guess puts that ticket line in context. I recommend it, and it's especially better to watch it directly after Hellraiser.Rating **** of ***** "},{"Title":"If you like the original....","Date":"23 May 2005","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Hours after her family was torn apart by the Cenobites, Kirsty is in an institution, receives what appears to be a message for help from her dead father, who is apparently in hell.

I must admit that I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie initially, but I'm glad I did; I wasn't disappointed by this superior second installment.This second film in the Hellraiser series ups the ante in its blood-drenched delights and special effects, in addition to actually being quite scary. Most will make remarks about the extreme level of violence and gore in this film, but Randel is good in making sure it fits in with the relentlessly grim tone of the film and doesn't make it mindless schlock.The film takes place right after the events of Hellraiser young Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) was the sole survivor of that film (pre-credit flashbacks re-tell Hellraiser's story), and as Hellbound opens, Kirsty has been locked up inside a mental hospital and no one believes her claims about Juila (Clare Higgins), Frank (Sean Chapman), the Cenobites, and the puzzle box that opens up a gateway to a dimension of pain, suffering, and pleasure.An occult-obsessed doctor, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), believes her story and in his eternal desire for pleasure, he resurrects Julia and the two soon become lovers. However, Channard's naive young assistant Kyle (William Hope, of Aliens) helps break Julia and a mute young girl named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) out of the mental hospital. And in order to stop Channard, the newly resurrected Julia and the Cenobites, it's going to literally require a trip to the depths of Hell and back.Hellbound Hellraiser II doesn't play around in the gore department. Not even five minutes go by and we're treated to flesh being ripped apart by chains, hooks, and spikes. In these opening moments, we also learn of the horrific origins of Cenobite leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Like Hellraiser, the Cenobites are not your typical movie monsters. They are not your typical movie monsters because they are NOT the movie's main villains, and are only an element of the story (even though they figure much more prominently into this film's plot, and have greater depth, significance, and meaning in the story this time around). Like Hellraiser, Julia and Frank were the main villains in the film; here in Hellbound, Julia also returns as one primary antagonist, soon usurped by Dr. Channard.Even more amazingly, and unexpectedly, noteworthy of interest is the fact that here, the Cenobites become slight objects of sympathy, instead of horror - no longer the horrific creatures we've been led to believe that they actually are. Like Jeff Goldblum's character in The Fly (1986), the Cenobites are tragic beings because we come to see the men (and woman) they once were, although the effect works opposite because the emotional investments of pity and sympathy come AFTER they've torn someone's soul apart limb from limb.Author Clive Barker wrote the novel The Hellbound Heart from which these films are based. The man has a deeply rooted passion for blood, more blood, grisly horror, torture, razor-sharp objects, and just plain gruesome detail and excess. While I'm not sure exactly about his skills in writing dialogue, Randel does a good job of directing Peter Atkins's script while at the same time continuing Barker's first film, not repeating it, and he doesn't disappoint in terms of direction and horrific special effects (some of which was actually cut from the film so that it could be released with an R rating; an unrated version with all the violence and gore restored was recently released on DVD by Anchor Bay). The Atkins screenplay is confusing sometimes and tends to drag but once it gets going along, there's no turning back because your eyes are glued to the screen in absolute horror.Ashley Laurence remains the strong, courageous, and determined young heroine she created in Hellraiser as Kirsty Cotton. Certainly not your typical teenager ready to be torn apart limb from limb by some goon in a mask, she remains a steadfast and determined young woman who remains brave in the face of unspeakable evil. More remarkably, there's never a moment in this film when she just drops everything and strips for the males in the audience, even though she is involved in a nude-less shower sequence fairly early in the picture. Why hasn't she gotten more work as a result of her performance in this film, I ask?Hellbound Hellraiser II is a mostly superior second installment in a grisly franchise that quickly wore itself out with every subsequent sequel after this one.I'm glad I got the unrated DVD, with more skinless bodies, more ripped-apart flesh, and more suffering, sweet suffering.9/10 "},{"Title":"Your suffering will be legendary...Even in Hell!","Date":"21 January 2008","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Hellbound Hellraiser 2 is one of few sequels that actually matches, and in some instances surpasses, the original in terms of blood, guts and sheer terror. Bringing back nearly all of the actors from the original except for Andrew Robinson who played Larry in the original (his absence caused a great deal of chaos during filming which is obvious when you watch some of the final sequences that were originally supposed to include him) and Grace Kirby who played the female cenobite in the original (she is replaced here by the equally talented Barbie Wilde). The film picks right up where the original left of as it seems that no one believes the wild tale that Kirsty has to tell about her experiences so she is locked up in an asylum that is run by the diabolical Dr. Channard. The doctor's obsession with the occult and Hell leads him to conspire to bring Julia back to life. With the aid of a delusional patient from the hospital who tries to cut off bugs and maggots that aren't actually on his skin thus bleeding on the mattress where Julia died and bringing her back to life. In an interesting twist from the original plotine, Julia comes back in exactly the same condition as Frank was during the original and convinces the doctor to procure victims for her in order to help make her complete again. In exchange, Julia agrees to be the doctor's tour guide in Hell. The doctor's young apprentice befriends Kirsty and soon discovers the sinister plot between the doctor and Julia. Meanwhile, it seems that the doctor is also holding a mute young girl with a penchant for puzzles hostage and when she solves the puzzle box that opens the gates to Hell the cenobites are once again unleashed. With Hell now wide open Julia and the doctor enter as do Kirsty, the young mute and the doctor's apprentice. Kirsty is searching for her father and the others are just trying to escape. Meanwhile, Julia betrays the doctor and delivers him to her god Leviathan (in the form of an entity rather than a demon) and the doctor becomes an extremely powerful cenobite in his own right. In a strange plot twist Kirsty soon discovers that it's actually her Uncle Frank, and not her father, who has tricked her into coming to Hell in another attempt to entrap her. Meanwhile, the doctor goes on a bizarre rampage killing all of the cenobites after Kirsty reveals to them their true human nature. The end result is a strange and bizarre ending that has to be seen to be believed. Even though Clive Barker did not actually direct this film he was the Executive Producer and his influence is obvious. He had apparently intended, however, for the character of Julia to emerge as the lead villain of the series but the character of Pinhead became so unbelievably popular that it would be Pinhead, and the actor who played him Doug Bradley, who would emerge as the only actor ever to appear in all 8 films in the Hellraiser series. my advice to fans, however, is that if you only watch one of the sequels in the series, make it this one!

This is the nastiest, goriest, meanest entry in the Hellraiser series. Depravity abounds.  This one was my favorite.  I love seeing movies try to imagine what Hell is really like.  Having a belief in the afterlife would definitely make the flick scarier.  If you don't believe in Hell at all, I can see how most of the movie would look a little silly.  The Hell effects are not that great.  They worked well on me though.One enduring mystery of the Hellraiser series is why these morons keep solving the puzzle box.  They keep saying they want to know, they have to know...  Hasn't all their research of the box told them of the tremendous suffering they're going to have to go through?  I guess I just don't understand the whole S&M thing. Being a demon from Hell can't be that great. Besides, if there is a Hell, why go there early?  All good/bad things to those who wait.

As all great films, with a subliminal message that doesn't need a sequel to follow it up, or explain more, Hellraiser was a film that encompassed the imagination with it's sheer and unsurpassed creativity and told a story with horrific, but beautiful tones. It was only inevitable that a sequel would come up sooner or later, to change the feel of the first film, and derail the novel ending. And as Hollywood driven as Hellbound Hellraiser II is, it's a film that is full of surprises, and yet, keeps it traditional enough to match wits with the first film. Full of lavish production values, zenith class make-up and special effects, and gorgeous set design, and cinematography, this sequel did what only few sequels in film history have done Take what the first film created and keep the original essence, while taking it to a new level. Thus, it's not a mere sequel, but a continuing. Hellraiser II gives you what the first film teased Hell. We as the audience go to hell and back several times, while continuing a saga with the few surviving (in any way possible!) characters from the first film in the process. Kirsty, our heroin from the first film, has been put in a mental hospital, still convinced that the hellish crusade from the first film is not yet over, and direly believes her father to be in hell, awaiting her rescue, while Julia, our villainess from the first film, is back from the dead, and bringing a new depth of hell to earth, prominently fueled by a hellish God, Leviathan. The first of the films many surprises is the integrity from the first film is still intact. And that makes it a great sequel.

This first sequel starts promisingly enough though, beginning on the same night as the original ended.  It features the return of Ashley Laurence's heroine Kirsty and the resurrection of wicked stepmom (no, really) Julia (Clare Higgins).  However about two thirds into the movie any attempt at story progression, character development or coherency goes out the window and instead the film throws up albeit interesting imagery and ideas seemingly at random.  That's not to say that Hellbound  Hellraiser 2 is a totally bad movie, it just seems like such a wasted opportunity.  If the next sequel would have followed on more directly (instead of going stateside and bringing in different characters) maybe the ideas about Hell and Leviathan could have been explored and developed more fully.  However without this safety blanket, much of Hellbound seems confused and half baked. Kenneth Cranham lends weight to the role of sinister Dr Channard but as soon as he's made into a cenobite the film goes into high camp and I wonder what happened to the sombre tone of the original.  Clare Higgins seems t be enjoying playing her return as Julia like a Hollywood bitch on drugs and it's interesting to find out something about the origin of the cenobites albeit briefly(and at least Pinhead's human origin is something that does get explored further in Hellraiser III).  If you like the first film, it's probably worth checking this one out and you may want t view it more than once to catch everything in it but just don't expect another Hellraiser like the original.

Obviously, horror movies are not meant to portray reality, but there was not a single solitary piece of the real world presented here. Not for even one second of film time did anything resembling real life show up in the movie, and this took a lot away from the film's potential. Think about how much more effective the film would have been had Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence, in her second ridiculous performance in this series alone) been kept in a psychiatric hospital that even remotely resembled even the most dismal hospital in the real world. I would have been much more interested had she been placed in an atmosphere of normality, beyond which she knows the hellish creatures that are the Cenobites lurk. I mean, a hospital that doesn't seem to have electricity, that has a violent ward that looks more like a medieval torture chamber, and that allows patients to roam the halls doesn't do justice to the film's personality. What this type of thing does is give the entire film a creepy mood, and takes away from the effectiveness of the parts of the film that are really meant to be scary. There just wasn't much creativity in the movie's presentation. Kirsty, a PATIENT in the hospital, wanders down the darkened hall one evening, and she comes upon the room of Tiffany who, as Kirsty's doctor explains to her after finding her (rather than taking her back to her own room), is a complete mystery because she never speaks. She just sits around and solves puzzles (like little wooden boxes!! Kirsty didn't seem bothered by that little detail&#133;). Also, did anybody ever figure out why the hell she touched the blood from her wall (`&#133;I am in Hell help me&#133;') to her LIPS?! Maybe she really does belong in the psych ward.Hellraiser II goes more in depth into some of the things that were presented in part I. For example, the film starts off with a quick scene showing Pinhead's creation, and the film also takes the audience into the world of the Cenobites. It gives an idea of where they come from and how they are made. It is this element of the film that saves it from absolute failure. The script was awful (`You have got to destroy that mattress! You have GOT to destroy that mattress!!' Or how about this, my favorite, `Kyle, when I think, I hurt.' That's brilliant, Kirsty), the atmosphere was entirely overdone, and the directing was unimaginative and routine. Kirsty and Kyle, her &#145;doctor,' momentarily develop a hint of a ridiculous romance, and the film was packed with careless mistakes (like the fact that, after Julia eats enough women to get her skin back, Dr. Channard cuts her bandages off and she has MAKEUP on. I guess it must have come with the skin&#133;). Then there were trivial things like when Ashley and Tiffany (whose real name we never learn), barely escape one of those Hell tunnels into a room and there are two beams of light showing on the wall, having come through the window. What's this, two suns? At any rate, the movie itself was clumsily put together, but luckily it went into detail about the things that made the equally poor original so successful. The Cenobites, ironically enough, are given a more human side, and even the thoroughly evil Pinhead shows a bit of compassion at the end of the film (a lot of good it does him&#133;). The best element of Hellraiser II, like part I, was the convincing makeup done on the skinless people. There were some intricate details there, and the desired gross-out reaction is pretty successfully attained. Some scenes were actually painful to watch (remember that poor nutcase who tried to get the maggots off himself with the straight razor?), which I think is a mark of at least limited success for this type of horror film. If you are a horror fan, the entire Hellraiser series is obviously mandatory viewing, but I think that other people, before you immediately dismiss the Hellraiser films as complete wastes of time, should realize that they are not meant to be mainstream films. These are made for people who are into this kind of splatter film, and as a splatter film it succeeds on many levels. It creates fascinating characters (the Cenobites, not the numbingly boring humans), tells an unlikely but interesting story about their interaction with the living world, and never fails to throw in buckets and buckets of blood and gore. I'm a pretty devoted horror fan myself, but even though I regard Pinhead as the best villain ever created in film, Hellraiser II (as well as the rest of them) was so flawed that I cannot hail this as a great or even a really good film. It's good horror and it's fun to watch, but it probably won't go down in history as a classic horror movie.

I had high hopes for Hellraiser II.That being said, Hellbound Hellraiser II is one of the biggest letdowns in movie history. Whereas in the original we had characters with believable motives (Julie was motivated by her lust for Frank, Frank was motivated by his obsession with pleasure and experiences etc...) in Hellraiser II we have bland caricatures. The bad guys are ridiculously evil, the good guys are pure and virtuous and nobody ever doubts anything. The original Hellraiser worked because we only saw glimpses of hell which allowed our imaginations to fill in the rest. There's nothing for the imagination to do here because the director felt like he should lay it all out for us. Tentacles, maggots, blades and blood galore. What's truly offensive is that the producers and director of the movie felt like they didn't need any of the basic elements used in movies and thought that the sheer amount of blood was enough to make a good movie. They were wrong. The further the movie goes, the worse it gets. By the time Kirsty and Tiffany are trampsing through hell, screaming each others' names, the movie itself has gone to hell. Seriously, we get all the clichés here. It's actually kind of admirable that they could fit it all in.Hellraiser II is a boring, confusing slideshow of gory images with nothing to link them together, nothing to push the story along and nothing to emotionally connect the viewer to the movie.

Using the bloodied mattress stolen from the bloodbath at Kirsty's home, Channard inadvertently allows the re-birth of the demented Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins).Hellbound is a collection of decent ideas clumped together without much thought for coherency. The first Hellraiser had a sketchy mythology and left many things unexplained, but it compensated for this by conjuring a gripping and nightmarish tone throughout. Instead, Hellbound moves along at a frantic pace from one set-piece to another, without offering any kind of insight into just how a bloody mattress could work as a gateway through which Julia could escape the confines of hell, or why a child prodigy is required to open a box solves easily by Kirsty the first time around. With little character development or time to reflect on the events that occur, the film is a bit of a mess.Visually, it's quite stunning. We get to see more of the Cenobite world as Kirsty enters into hell and bumps into her old foe Uncle Frank (Sean Chapman), and although the sets occasionally appear a bit on the dodgy side, and with special effects and make-up encouraging more laughter than genuine terror, it manages to deliver some memorable imagery and wince-inducing gore when it is called for. Ultimately though, I found Hellbound to be a bit of a headache, and even the extended appearances of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his minions could not distract my attention enough to make me forgive the many narrative flaws. Perhaps it's because I love the first film so much, or maybe it's down to Clive Barker stepping out of the director's chair and being replaced by Tony Randel.

The biggest effort here is the increased blood and gore featured, as this one ups the violence over the first one so much more. Bypassing the traditional hook pulling apart a body, we do get a particularly gruesome scene where Pinhead is shown how he gets his name-sake that fits in the rest of the film as it features an on-screen transformation for a Cenobite, the appearance of skinless people, several mutilated dead bodies scattered throughout the film and particularly graphic kills that splatter all over the place. There is tons more blood throughout, including a retread of the skinless person idea from part one that works quite a bit better due to the extended time spent doing this. Also, the increased time overall with the Cenobites was greatly appreciated. With them being almost relegated to cameos in that one, here they become so relevant to the plot that it's a great joy to watch them all get plenty of screen time. As well, there's some nice ideas as the descent into Hell is handled well, the Cenobites are integrated into the story pretty believably, and the whole scheme of events plays out excitingly since this never becomes boring. The visuals are a big reason for that as it's a great-looking film with all the special effects and scenery which makes it a great film to get lost in. The film does have some moments where the plot doesn't know where it's going, jumping around between several different themes and motives quite often different one moment to the next. This is all the result of a haphazard final half that makes for a convoluted storyline, though there's still enough context to really make some sense of this one at times even if it requires a couple times to figure it out. Granted it's a little confusing, but this is still every bit as good as the original, and then a little more in certain areas.Rated UR/R Extreme Graphic Violence, some Language, Brief Nudity, and a shadowy, blurry sex scene.

And this is a pretty freakish and creepy movie that delves into the dimensional world of Pinhead. I personally found this one to be more entertaining in a way, but not as scary or as creepy as the first one. It is however more freakish. This sequel actually does a really good job of connecting with the first Hellraiser movie and takes place just about right afterwards. I guess one of the reason why this one is most fan favorite is because of how it balances out the environments. Which takes place place in a asylum and some sort of dimensional hell. One of the factors that made this movie not as scary is how it shows the human side of Pinhead and his origin even if it's very slightly shown. The mystery behind Pinhead and his crew is what made him scary, like he is some sort of intelligent ancient being. This one seems to show Pinhead to be on the weaker side. Sure, sometimes villains should have some weaknesses. But the human side just takes away from a villain such as him. I don't know, but I just thought Pinhead would have been more effective horror icon if he was some sort of intelligent ancient being that has a certain code or rule that he abides by and thus can be reasoned with. This one does have more nightmarish elements though and seemed like a subliminal journey into the dark side of humanity and hell. This sequel really does indulges more into the creepy designs by Clive Barker. This is a entertaining flick that delves more into the Hellraiser universe and indulges more on Clive Barker's design and visuals.

Fans of the original can expect more of the same, yet while this film is a worthy follow-up, it is still vastly inferior.Something that made the original so unique (even different from all of its sequels) was its use of the Cenobites instead of using them to advance the plot, they use them to emphasize it. While the sequel does this in some regards, the plot of this film could basically be summed up as Kirsty and some other characters fight monsters. The first 40 minutes of the film, before the gates to Hell are opened, are the film's strength keeping the spirit of the original and still feeling strangely frightening. I, for one, preferred Claire Higgins's performance as the evil step-mother Julia in this film to her performance in the original. But once the puzzle is solved and Hell is opened, the film loses much of its strength.Dr. Channard begins the film as a wonderfully creepy villain, but the second he becomes a monster similar to that of the Cenobites, he loses all of his power, and even defeats the Cenobites so easily that any fear you may have held at the beginning of the film is instantly lost. The last ten minutes of the film is a mess as director Randel tries and fails to create any tension or suspense, and the Leviathan being incredibly disappointing. Part of the reason I love the original is because it is so character- driven in a genre filled with characters who just let things happen to them, rather than being the force behind everything in the film (the Cenobites, as I said before, are more of an epilogue/conclusion in the original, rather than the entire plot). While many people argue that the film cannot be enjoyed because almost every character is, in some way, shape, or form, extremely unlikable and complicated, yet this is, in my opinion, what adds to the film's strength. All of the characters are human, which adds a level to the film, as it is much easier to place yourself in the characters's shoes. The sequel, however, lacks that character complexity, with all of the new characters being clichéd, one- dimensional shadows of people, and even some of the recurring characters lose some of their complexity.Still, for all of the films downfalls, it also contains a lot of strengths. The scene in which Tiffany finds her own personal Hell is probably the creepiest in the entire film, and Frank's Hell is rather intriguing and disturbing. The beginning half of the movie truly delivers, and is up to the standard that the original had, and before Dr. Channard ruins them, the Cenobites are quite threatening, perhaps even more so than in the original. Pinhead delivers some truly great lines (Your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell!, But please, feel free, explore. We have eternity to know your flesh., It is not hands that summon us. It is desire.). The film delivers some backstory on Pinhead, which is interesting and creepy, adding to the quality of the film. All in all, the film is rather unique, even among the others in the series, and it will be difficult to find a film that is quite like this one. So, despite all of its mistakes and failures, this film still holds a special place in my heart.

The story had significant depth, its characters felt real, thanks to great acting, the effects for its time were astounding and its music was hauntingly beautiful. So it is no surprise that when a sequel would be made to this favored horror film, fans would expect a product containing the same or better in magnitude. I am one of those fans, but unfortunately, that promise wasn't upheld to the highest degree. It is not to say that the movie is awful, but it had so much going for it and yet it failed to be anywhere close to its predecessor.What really misses the mark and is also the key component to making a good movie, is a story. The story, which was written by Barker and adapted to the film by Peter Atkins lacks a strong sense of story telling. The screenplay will attempt to bring up various subplots but never accesses them fully. For example, this installment provides viewers with the possibility of understanding the older characters better, and, being introduced to new characters. However both are never explained in a clear way or even resolved. It's actually hard to say what the plot was about and who the main villain was either.After seeing the murder of her whole family, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) finds herself in a hospital with everyone against her. She tries to explain herself but nobody believes her. Little does she realize that she will prove herself right when the Doctor in charge of the hospital turns out to be as wicked as her evil stepmother Julia and Uncle Frank by unleashing the Cenobites from the lament configuration once again. To do this, the doctor will have a mute girl (Imogen Boorman) open the box because she has a knack for solving puzzles.However, this doesn't tell me anything. It is never completely explained to why Doctor Channard (Kenneth Cranham) wants to open the portal to hell. In the movie, viewers will learn he's been studying the lament configuration for years but it's never said what he was searching for. It is also never fully explained to why this girl is mute and what happened to her family. The mother of the girl is shown a few times but never bothers to show the end result of her. What gives? At least Atkins wrote a more decent back-story to the Cenobite characters (thanks to Barker's input). But the rest is never finished. It's frustrating.On the other hand, I do give credit to the casting department for bringing back majority of the cast. It's great to see Ashley Laurence again as well as Clare Higgins, Sean Chapman and of course Doug Bradley. I also enjoyed the set design to the labyrinth of hell. I for one would get lost very easily in such a place. The imagery was creepy and disturbing as always too. I still get goosebumps from a crying child; very unsettling. Adding to that was Christopher Young's film score (who also did the previous film) which made it more effective. Although I found Young's score from the previous film more compelling, I was happy to see that he stuck with his original theme and even built on a few other tunes. Lastly, the make-up department and special effects crew also did a great job. From the Cenobite transformations, gore, creature effects to the skinless characters is still an amazing feat for 1988. I'm just baffled to how incoherent the screenplay puts all these great things together into an almost unenjoyable mess.Peter Atkins' screenplay digs into some really interesting ideas and character arcs but never comes close to finishing a single one. It is even more frustrating because this sequel contains the majority of the previous cast, the same composer and the same gruesome imagery.

I felt the storyline was paper thin and completely divorced itself of the depth of The Hellbound Heart story on which the first film was based.An interview with Clive Barker about how excited he was with the release of this put me over the top in my decision to see it; well, that was a huge source of disappointment!

Only hardcore genre fans will be able to walk away with any feeling of satisfaction, in my opinion, from seeing a little over an hour and a half of nonsense plot line that adds NOTHING to the original story, scenes of people being ripped apart and repeated plot twists from the first film.

So a few years ago I rented Hellraiser, from the clips that I saw it seemed more than promising and it sure was a great horror movie. Clive Barker has the wildest imagination and goes deep into the nightmares that we have and puts them on screen. I give him a lot of credit for putting displeasing images on the big screen, as unsettling as the images are they made for a great horror movie and created a terrifying icon in Pinhead. I don't know why I waited so long to see the sequels, maybe I didn't have the opportunity but I did find them cheap at the store the other day and without hesitation bought them. So I watched Hellbound Hellraiser 2 and while it's definitely not strong in the plot like the first film was, the visuals are done with such love and imagination we get a horror movie that doesn't hold back on making you squirm.Kirsty wakes in the psychiatric hospital, where she is questioned about the events leading up to the destruction of her home, which involved her stepmother, Julia, and a bloody mattress. Kirsty tells the police that her uncle, Frank, opened a puzzle box to an alternate dimension populated by monsters named Cenobites who torture human quarry for sadomasochistic purposes. The story amazes the detectives, who are incredulous and take the bloody mattress as evidence. Kirsty is turned over to Dr. Channard and his assistant, Kyle, who instantly becomes smitten with Kirsty. That night, Kirsty befriends another patient, Tiffany, a semi-catatonic young girl with an incredible skill for solving puzzles. Later, in her room, Kirsty finds a message written in blood stating I AM IN HELL. HELP ME. Believing it was sent by her father, Kirsty tells her story to Kyle, who encourages her to tell Channard about the Cenobites. Now with Kyle and Tiffany's help, Kirsty wants to get her father back from the sadistic Cenobites and must confront them once again.My main complaint about the film is that the plot isn't too well constructed. This was definitely meant more to upset the stomach than challenge the mind. That's the thing I admire about the first film, it was very gory but had a very strong plot and something that hadn't been done before. Why Kirsty is so quick to go back to the Cenobites was crazy to me, she thinks her father is in Hell, but believes it so fast. I would have questioned if I was her if it was due to my trauma or if this really was happening? Also SPOILER when Tiffany thinks that Julia is helping her in the end, but she pulls the skin off and it reveals that it was Kirsty and she had gotten in Julia's skin in order to trick the bad guy, how did she get in that skin so quickly and so well? Movie magic as usual. Also that Kirsty shows Pinhead an old picture of what he used to look like as a human and we have an Oprah moment where he's touched, I don't like Pinhead to be touched, I want him to be bad! But Dr. Channard makes for a great villain, he's so evil that he destroys the other Cenobites within a snap! His make up was terrific as well and very haunting. The visuals were great and the story was still very spooky. I would recommend it over all, it's a film that doesn't hold up for the story but as a continuation from the first film, it's worth the look.7/10 "},{"Title":"Repulsive but part-brilliant Eighties horror","Date":"19 March 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Yes, it still seems repulsive and disgusting and 'not nice', but full of great flashes of style.

The effects (especially those back shots of the psychiatric clinic) look rather cheap by today's standards, but this only adds to the attraction and style of the whole extraordinary ensemble, rather like those obviously fake Walt Disney castles and fields in Laurence Olivier's 'Henry the Fifth.' Shocking images flicker by at an exponential rate, and I felt rather like someone at a tawdry Soho peepshow - disgusted and shamed and appalled, but unable to stop looking.But not recommended... 1) for a cosy Saturday night watch with Grandma and the kids. 2) for psychiatric in-patients. 3) for easily offended Christians (this applies even more to the first film in the series). 4) those who've just eaten a big dinner.More seriously, is this kind of fare proof of the death-wish of Western culture? I'm not saying that merely watching it can turn perfectly sane people into sadomasochistic murderers, but doesn't its popularity go to prove (as if we really needed it) that we're all rather 'sick'? My cable provider is running the whole series of 'Hell', and announces them as 'The films that defined a generation.' Isn't that 'definition' rather worrying? Both for the generation concerned, and the ones to follow? I know many 21st century teenagers will just laugh their heads off at this film - which rather proves my point.P.S. Kenneth Cranham acts with incredible conviction (always rare to attain in horror films since the passing of the great Lugosi-Karloff and Cushing-Lee-Price days). Cranham looks the part of a slightly crazed doctor, and looks in genuine pain when he's floating in mid-air, like Kenneth Macmillan in David Lynch's 'Dune', with what looks like a giant condom growing from the top of his head.

Hellbound is written by Peter Atkins who wrote also Hellraiser 3 and 4 and many other horror movies. Hellraiser 2 is pretty noteworthy horror experience, but it relies too much on splatter (plenty) and the stylishness suffers a little. The film starts immediately where the first film ended and our heroine Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is in mental hospital, because no one believes her story of cenobites and Hell. Soon Pinhead and pals come to terrorize that hospital, too, and then the gore filled mayhem is ready to start. The plot is nothing special and it seems to be there only to deliver the many scenes of blood and splatter. The atmosphere is pretty creepy and the visions of Hell are gorgeous, but still this is not as scary and brilliant as Clive Barker's Hellraiser, the original. But Hellbound is still pretty enjoyable film for horror fans and I think I begin to like this little more now as I'm writing about it. Fact is that the film relies too much on long scenes of mutilation and splatter, and that's pretty stupid at times. The overall look of the film is very dark and also surreal, so this is interesting to watch and enjoy the imagery of the nightmare. If Barker had directed this one, I think there would've been less gore and more terror and atmosphere. I think this first sequel is pretty equal with Hellraiser 3 Hell on Earth and these films work fine if one likes to watch all kind of horror films, sequels included. Hellraiser is a masterpiece of horror cinema, and these sequels try to come close to it. Hellbound is watchable sequel and works as a splattery horror film, and I'm very glad they concentrated a little on those stylish and atmospheric scenes, too. These cinematically more noteworthy scenes are the ones that make this film watchable for demanding horror fans, too. If you can't handle splatter effects, don't try to watch this as this is the goriest in the series.

Unfortunately the weak point is the lore itself.The first part left wanting for more of the dark myths connected with Pinhead and his comrades. Hellbound adequately noted the need, but failed on delivery, as the world of the Celobites and the logic that rules it seems chaotic and at best patchy... basically whatever is needed for the storyline happens, so actions of both characters as well as demons are devoid of any serious thought on the side of the scriptwriter. Basically it lacks the thing that made i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street click so nicely - a rulebook for evil.In the end a mildly satisfying experience that leaves you wanting for some more substance that would help characterize the evil much better.

The film gives us two hells to visit. The psycho ward hell with its screams and patients and the real hell with its maze, spooky imagery.To me this movie had a Nightmare On Elm Street feel to it, Kirsty reminds me of Nancy and Tiffany reminded me a bit of Kristan, although still great which never stops like running through endless hallways and the Channard Cenobite, floating around, hooked to a phallic symbol, spitting out medical related lines. Good fun! I loved the mental ward massacre and the hellish visions (Tiffany's hell is not pleasant). The film moves fast, looks great, has lots of gore, lots of kool effects (loved the Cenobite making machine) and a wonderful score. But what is all the noise about again? Why are these people even in hell? They should've stayed home and played with themselves instead of demonic puzzle boxes.Ashley Laurence (Kristy) is again fab giving an even better performance than in the first one, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) looked the part and gave an believable performance, Claire Higgins is back as the wicked stepmother Julia and is again on top form, William Hope (Channard) is very convincing as the twisted Doc, Doug Bradley gets to stretch and he works both as Pin Head and the officer he once was.All in all much better than the first, better storyline better effects and twisted imaginary.

The movie is a direct sequel to the original and is telling the story of a nightmarish voyage in hell. The plot resembles the third movie in the rival A Nightmare on Elm Street series because the action is set in a hospital and the main characters travel trough a disgusting netherworld. Although the cenobites are not as funny as Freddy Krueger, the movie vision of hell is very original, especially the evil Leviathan and the gruesome Channard. Sadly, the plot makes little sense and it is quite chaotic; also the film is needlessly gory and deserves an X-rating. SPOILER ALERT The final of the film is also VERY stupid because it ruins the whole idea of cenobites getting back to humanity in their death - the scene in which Channard killed Pinhead and his band was surprisingly strong and almost touching, exceptionally when the Chattering cenobite was revealed as a teenage boy. All is ruined by the stupid closing scene, though, and - which is worse - more sequels are promised. In conclusion, I must say that the movie has its qualities, strong ideas and great, almost The Shining-quality vision, but it is way too gory, very chaotic and with too many cheesy moments. In the hands of a better director, it might have been a classic. It is, however, a mediocre, although bizarre horror film.

But I say that if that is all those critics see in these films, they are viewing them from behind their closed minds, rather than enlightened ones.There is dark substance, dire meaning and a hideous back-story behind these acts. They are not the senseless acts perpetrated in film after film of this time period in this genre. These films are constructed around a very solid premise.

I have seen it once before, and that time I couldn't take it seriously. It's just so far-fetched and bizarre and poorly made that I couldn't help but laugh. Due to that being so long ago, and the fact that I had seen the first and understood the idea much better, I decided to give it another chance. A few minutes into the film, I think OK, repetition of the story of the first for new viewers. Good. Few minutes more, I think OK, the story is starting, and looking a little bit interesting. Then, I started to notice more and more flaws, glaringly obvious ones, even. I start to laugh, and I keep laughing. Not because it's funny, per se, but because it's so poorly done and the plot is ridiculous. About 45 minutes into the film, I realize one of the main reasons the film doesn't inspire even a little fear; the scariest thing about it, as I noted to my friend who was watching it with me, is the very fact that the best actor in the film is the teenage girl(Tiffany). The plot barely makes sense, and seems like it was mainly thought up to bring back all of the popular characters from the first film; the Cenobites, Julia, Frank and Kirsty. Half of the film has a cheap repeating of the plot of the first; a resurrected person who needs to kill people for their skin. Then it becomes pushed aside while the characters all run around a huge maze being chased by poor effects and laughable gore. The acting is atrocious. I don't think any of the main characters had more than one facial expression each. The characters are poorly written and the ones that return from the first are pale shadows of their characters in the far better first film. The dialog is ludicrous. The new Cenobite that is introduced has one-liners that would Arnold himself cringe. The effects are really bad, though a few have improved since the first. The thing that really ruins this film, though, is the direction. Hellraiser was based on Clive Barker's book, and having him directing it... he put his vision onto the big screen, and it was good. Here, his vision doesn't really shine through(well, it might through some of the imagery, but certainly not the direction and 'terror factor') and he apparently didn't even get to write this movie(apart from the story... which I suspect was much better before it was turned into a script). A laughable attempt at a horror film and a worthy sequel to Hellraiser.

I consider myself to be a person who is very generous with compliments especially when it comes to movies, and i especially like my horror movies with extra gore,and i loved the original Hellraiser. But this sequel is just terrible in every aspect.First of all, The direction of the film is horrible, with scenes and sequences that were just messily and illogically slabbed together, and illogical actions by the characters(even for a horror movie)is commonplace. The plot is as plain and simple as a blank piece of paper, which is only prolonged by the seemingly never ending wanderings of two poorly built characters with irrational motivation in the corridors of hell. It seems like the story is simply made up along the way as the movie progresses, With rules suddenly changing...a reflection of weak foundation.The special Effects were a significant step down from the original, even though they were more attempts at it in this sequel. The Effect with Dr. channard looked especially cheap even for the 80's. This movie totally destroys what i feel made the first Hellraiser successful, Which is the mystique and the Darkness of the Cenobites and the Box, by over-exposure of hell and by over-revealing the secrets of the cenobites(such as how one becomes a cenobite). This takes away the mysterious, menacing factor to them, and makes them almost vulnerable. What were once strong, menacing characters are now just confused children with amnesia.And then some scenes are just corny and lame, such as Kirsty wearing Julia's Skin, which is a weak attempt at a twist; and the lame attempt at a cool ending with the pointless rotating post scene. Whether you're a fan of The HellRaiser series or not, I can't seriously believe that a person could say that he/she think this movie is even close to being decent. Quite possibly the worst sequel of all time. This movie alone could decimate the entire Hellraiser franchise.

That is the main plot about this film and is definitely a worth of watch for any horror fan. This movie really brings you into the hell that pinhead and frank talk about in the first one its so good and we learn who the Cenobites were, and it was cool seeing Kirsty explaining to the Cenobites that they were human once. The acting in this movie is decent and everyone does an awesome job.What I love about this movie Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) face off with Julia and Uncle Frank (Sean Chapman), I love how Kirsty set's up Frank on fire when he tried to attack her, she responded back by burning down the house, as well as Frank's flesh. I am happy that she helped Tiffany Kirsty later tricks Doctor Channard by donning the deceased Julia's skin, giving Tiffany the opportunity to finish the Lament Configuration puzzle, killing Doctor Channard and allowing them to return home and close the gate between the two worlds. That was really awesome, I am happy that Tiffany killed Julia while tearing her skin down. The characters and the horrors are decent, the movie is very creepy more than the first one. I still love the first one much more than this one, but I still love this one, It is fantasy between heaven and earth. I love that Kirsty explains to the Cenobites that they were once human a long time ago. Clive Barker's first movie never explained the origins of the Cenobites in this movie he does. I love that Kirsty and Tiffany does have a happy ending in the film and that they are free.

In so doing, Hellraiser, which the writer also directed, became one of the seminal horror films of the 1980s and introduced the iconic Cenobites, leather and metal clad demons from Hell. These explorers in the further realms of experience come to earth only when they're called, when someone opens the mythical puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration. The Cenobites, led by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, Nightbreed), drag these willing souls into the depths to show them the limits of the flesh, pain and pleasure as one, from which there is no escape. One year after Hellraiser hit the screen, director Tony Randel (Fist of the North Star) took the reigns to helm the sequel, beginning right where the original left off.Hellbound Hellraiser II also expands the franchise's central theme from carnal lust to general obsession, depicting Channard not as a lowly pervert but as a sociopath who'll stop at nothing to satisfy his intellectual curiosity. Take, for example, his passive reaction to Julia's femme fatale routine. The man clearly shows more interest in the woman's knowledge of hell than in her feminine wiles, which provides some justification for the extreme and often gratuitous violence in the movie.The term cenobite is not an invention of Clive Barker's. Cenobites, traditionally, are people who live by the precepts of religious monastic orders, and this gives the best signal to where Pinhead and his cohorts come from. Sure, they reside in Hell, but I've never seen them as evil. Pinhead is a demon of principle and a man of his word; giving people the extreme experiences they crave. As he tells the female Cenobite after Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a mentally ill, puzzle obsessed girl, opens the box It is not hands that call us, it is desire. He knows that Dr. Channard forced her to solve the puzzle and he is uninterested in her. Channard wants to see Hell and Pinhead wants to fulfill Channard's desires. He's violent, but he's an agent; it's man that's the real evil.This sets the Hellraiser series apart from other horror movies.This Sequel ranks up there with the likes of The Godfather Part II (1974), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and The Dark Knight (2008) "},{"Title":"The strongest of all the sequels and the closest in spirit of the original.","Date":"30 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" There is a really good story in here and some really striking imagery.Tony Randel's positively dark attitude is one of the most prominent and uneasy characteristics of this sequel; the director claimed the film is so dark and bleak in tone as it reflected his state of mind at the time, and his outlook on the world.

In terms of its representation of the practice of psychiatric medicine, the film has also got a strong anti-authoritarian stance, and it's certainly a very nicely photographed film. Through the character of Channard, and his reign over the mental hospital, Hellbound Hellraiser II seems to offer an anti-psychiatry perspective to rival that of R D Laing. (This seems compounded in Barker's Nightbreed, 1990, the film that Barker loosened his grip on the reins of the Hellraiser sequel in order to direct.) The film's depiction of the mental hospital as a place of repression &#x96; where Kirsty is confined owing to the perception that her version of events cannot possibly be true and therefore must be suppressed &#x96; depicts psychiatry as having progressed little, if at all, since the Victorian era. This sense of psychiatry being stunted is partly communicated through the film's mise-en-scène and the depiction of Channard's psychiatric institution as existing within an old Nineteenth Century building. It's a depiction of a mental hospital that differs little from that of Mark Robson's Bedlam (1946).Channard is introduced performing invasive brain surgery on one of the patients at the hospital. He lords over the room, delivering a monologue as he drills into the patient's skull &#x96; an action which is mirrored later in the film when Leviathan, choosing to make a Cenobite of Channard, opts to have a device drill into Channard's skull and carry his body, thus allowing the Channard Cenobite to float above the ground. During the moment of brain surgery, Channard declares that 'The mind is a labyrinth, ladies and gentlemen; a puzzle. While the paths of the brain are plainly visible &#x85; its destinations are unknown, its secrets still secret. And, if we are honest, it is the lure of the labyrinth that draws us to our chosen field, to unlock these secrets'. Channard's monologue ends by drawing fairly explicit comparisons between his rhetoric and that of the Nazis Channard concludes by asserting that he and his colleagues must go further than their predecessors in the hope of finding 'ultimately, the final solution'. Channard's suggestion that the 'mind is a labyrinth' also implies that the journey into Leviathan's labyrinth later in the picture is, for the characters, also a journey into themselves.

Having escaped from a fate worse than death, the damsel from the first film finds herself in a booby hatch where she has some explaining to do, both to the shrink and the legal authorities. If you think that's bad, her murdered father is in Hell, and signals to her that he needs her help. And if those two aren't bad enough, the psychiatrist assigned to her is, well, let's just say he has been dabbling in the black arts, and it isn't long before he brings the femme fatale from the previous film back to life, but as before, to make the full transition requires others to die.After this it all gets rather confusing, but if you like special effects and don't mind a bit of gore you might find it of some interest. And at the end, well, what comes after the second film but third in the franchise, so the end is an open invitation to just that. "},{"Title":"Flesh for the inferno","Date":"22 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" In my view this is to Hellraiser what Aliens was to Alien. I think it's a sequel that's more than a classic in its own right and in scale at least, it outdoes the first film. It's also the sequel that is closest in tone and spirit to the original, which is something that seems to be unfairly disregarded about it. It has a very high amount of gore, with all the violence being shown directly rather than implied, which I reckon helps things immensely. It's very visually disturbing and graphic, with several great mad scenes and moments in it. The horrendous pit-like maintenence level of the asylum is a hell of man's own making, I find the rising pulse sound when Kirsty sees the apparition of what she believes is her dead father to be hair-raising, the scene of Julia's resurrection plays out like a little event that you don't really want to witness and is particularly full-on, the screams of the poor hallucinating mental patient bore right into you, and it's gotta be one of the most gruesome scenes in all horror cinema! There really is nothing more horrifying than watching human flesh be mutilated and damaged... I absolutely love the labyrinthine vision of hell, with its 'god' hovering over it in the form of an immense version of the puzzle, it's wondrously Gothic and foreboding. I like the idea of hell being a place that forces you to relive your darkest secrets and traumas, and scenes like the nightmare circus and when Kirsty sees the picture of her mother as well as the dark dimension beginning to spill over into the real world are strange and unsettling and it conveys the ominous feeling that good and evil, all of the characters are approaching the bottom of a descent into madness... Awesome chilling ending too, with the infernal pillar of souls and the face of the beast revealed. The locusts are a nice touch. Everyone in this does really well, Ashley Lawrence was great again as her beautiful feisty self, she and Imogen Boorman had good gal chemistry together and made for two great heroines. Boorman was fine, she was vital to the plot and all of that and had a lovely angelic quality of innocence to her that worked a lot more in her favour when she kept her gob shut.. The woman that played skinless Julia managed to give an eerily elegant and even alluring performance through her grotesquely amazing makeup effects. I never clicked on that it wasn't actually Claire Higgins, who was terrifically villainous in her role. Such a bitch, she was so good at making you despise her! Her trick of sucking the life out of unsuspecting victims with her fingernails was so vile. Great payoff for the character when she gets even with Frank by ripping out his still beating heart and holding it up to the fire! And what a legend of a character Hellraiser himself is, his every word is so commanding and magnetic, I'm totally compelled not to talk over any of his scenes! And even though they only contact with each other twice, I think it's enough that you get the feel of something between him and Kirsty, like a begrudging admiration of her spirit from him, as well as perhaps a desire for his soul to be set free? I love how the music swells so dramatically as he enters! Kenneth Cranham is excellent and quietly drives the events of the movie forward. When he's still just a man his coldblooded slaughter of human lives in his diabolical pursuit to know what lies beyond is horrific enough, but when he's transformed into an utterly insane cenobite who revels in his own viciousness and is constantly held aloft by a phallic thing and wields bizarre stigmata snakes that bloom into shifting instruments of murder, I just find the character to be terror incarnate and hideously creepy, I think he's one of the most genuinely nightmarish horror movie creations ever. I love all of his fun tacky medical-related punchlines! I think giving the guy a twisted sense of humour made him more scary. And he could only slaughter the cenobites like that because they were weak and expendable because of their newly awakened humanity. Disturbing, unsettling, scary and at times disgusting, this great horror film is always my pleasure, and I think this patient is finished!

My nightmare (in movie terms) run along the lines of 'Night of the Living Dead' because at least that movie gave me an entry-point from which to enter my mind. I can imagine being chased by the living dead. I have a hard time imagining myself dreaming about what happens in this movie.The movie opens about an hour after the first 'Hellraiser' movie with Kirsty in the hospital having seen torture and dismay at the hands of her parents. We find that she isn't out of hell yet and that hell is in fact all around us and Kirsty and her friend Tiffiny are soon darting around the dusty corridors of the damned running into one bloody effects shot after another. This is one of those movies where the special effects credits are equal to the population of a small Third World country but only one person is credited with a screenplay.I got so tired of hearing the named Kirsty and Tiffiny by the end of this movie that I actually had to stop and clear them from my mind. I could swear that about six pages of the script was populated by nothing but the two girls screaming each other's names 'Kirsty!!' and 'Tiffiny!!' I mentioned the movie's construction &#x96; it has none. I don't ask much from a movie but I at least ask for an entryway so that I can get involved in the story. We are led to believe that KIRSTY! And TIFFINY! Have no hope of ever getting out of the corridors of hell and they never seem to be working on a plan, all they do is turn corners to the next bloody, tortured corpse. But nothing is so torturous as a special effects movie that isn't so special.

The creators themselves broke apart the first one and made something almost completely new. HR 2 though only credits Barker as producer and co-writer, and Tony Randel was in the director's chair so he's not totally responsible for this newish scene. But it still is strange that he let the mythos he created to veer off in a new direction and for different things to be emphasized. Hellbound only starts a few hours after the first film and they started filming it a few weeks after they filmed the first one, it's still so different as the story allows despite the fact that it follows so closely on the heels of the first one. Of course that doesn't mean that the film is bad, in fact in a lot of ways it's really good. It's just that that original genius is lost and it sways to a whole different dimension. Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain. But Channard has been searching for the doorway to Hell for years, and Kirsty must follow him to save her father and witness the power struggles among the newly damned. Peter Atkins with his first film and Barker didn't spend time on the script. A little bloodshed, a little chase and there you go the film is done. It's a typical sequel in the sense that it just needs to be more more brutal in this case. But hey you can't complain when there is so much that can turn your stomach, blood is spilling, meat is tearing right? And when an insane guy goes ahead and tries to cut the bugs and creepy crawlies from his skin with a razor even the most tried and tested horror geeks have a second of feeling they would rather hide their eyes. But you won't and that's the beauty of it. And it must be said that a few of the effects really look good. Unfortunately along with the gory stuff there isn't time for the horror elements used in the first one, that means that the characters are less defined than the effects. Even if we get to see Julia deskined she still isn't as scary as in the first part with just a hammer. Tiffany is kind of a pointless character, Frank's short scene is that too. So only the quiet at first then scary as hell Dr. Channard carries the film. Kenneth Cranham is awesome. The demons of the first film that were scary when they just stood in one spot and stared at the camera get an origin story in this film. That's kind of a mistake with a character whose whole creepiness lies in the mystery surrounding them. And we meet a new Cenobite that wrecks the old ones in a minute. I thought they were scary, immoral, untouchable, unbeatable demons? What gives? The idea of them being defeated would have been laughable in the first film and even if they try to give all this a logical expanaition it doesn't change the result. Hell's depiction though is great for a while, but running around in the same darkened hallway and tunnel gets massively boring and repetitive in the end. Less would have been more. But the whole asylum's basement halls being a kind of hell is a great idea All in all Hellraiser's sequel has traces of the first part but looses what was so unique about it. But if you don't use the first as a jumping off point then this is a great film that horror fans will like. 7/10 https//www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog "},{"Title":"Your suffering will be legendary ... even in Hell","Date":"28 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Sheesh, what a twisted ride.

But if you fancy spending 99 minutes trapped inside a nightmare, then buckle up and prepare yourself for a succession of the most gruesome, disorientating and downright disturbing images you'll have seen for a long while.Make no mistake, this film is very, very frightening. Not in a kind of killer in the woods way, but in the sort of psychedelic manner that happens in ... well ... your worst nightmares. I'll say it again this film has the logic of a nightmare. Things happen for no reason, it never seems to end, you're constantly unsure whether the two leading girls are back safely in the real world, and the entire proceedings are underscored with images of outrageous brutality. That's a hell (harhar) of a gamble to take with a movie, but it pays off magnificently. Just switch off reason and allow yourself to be sucked into this film's world, and trust me you will feel very, very nervous when you switch the lights back on.

The film score is a greater representation of the hellish world and for once, it makes sense. The only thing I believe this film is lacking is more history and story in relation to Hell as shown in this film. More story based on Leviathan itself would also be a key improvement.

Soon the bad doctor has managed to resurrect Kirsty's evil stepmom Julia (Clare Higgins) and the whole bunch of them end up in Hell where Kirsty desperately tries to find her late father. This series continues to be a good bet for horror fans with its accent on graphic mayhem, its assault of incredibly surreal horrors, of both the mental and the physical variety, and its articulate, intelligent villain Pinhead. Each character has their own Hell, of course, and we get a taste of each. Veteran New World employee Tony Randel makes his official directing debut (after doing some uncredited work on Def-Con 4) and makes watching Hellbound Hellraiser II an effective sensory experience, if not particularly strong in the narrative department. (Then again, this was partly due to the script requiring hasty rewrites after actor Andrew Robinson declined to reprise the role of Larry Cotton.) Still, it's good fun much of the time, and it gives us just a little background into the character of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and gives him and his fellow Cenobites some more opposition than usual as Dr. Channard undergoes something of a rebirth. It also gives us a rather delicious antagonist as Julia is in full evil bitch mode (the sexy Higgins looks like she's having a great time) and Kirsty is once again an appealing young protagonist. Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith reprise their roles as Uncle Frank and his skinless version (respectively), Angus MacInnes plays the part of the suspicious homicide detective Ronson, and Aliens fans will be amused to see actor William Hope, who was the ineffective Lt. Gorman in that film, playing the helpful doctor Kyle here. Adding some punch are the entertaining visual and makeup effects, while the production designer, Michael Buchanan, and cinematographer, Robin Vidgeon, give this production a striking look. It's not in the same league as its predecessor, understandably, but is still very acceptable entertainment that does have some fine moments, and a nice twist near the end, on the way to its setting-up-the-next-sequel conclusion.

Pinhead's not only trying to take some of slasher shares, but pretty much just copied the superior (1987's) A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors. Let's compare, shall we?Both take place in an insane asylum. Both have a blank stare blonde. Both have a doctor who doesn't believe up front, but starts to both side and help the main star. Both have a heroine that strangely looks like Heather Langenkamp. Both also have a character named Kirsty (yeah, I realize she was named that originally, but it's still too close.) Both involve a labyrinth of one's darkest fears. Both have a wise-cracking villain, including a new baddie who has clay-mation snakes, with blades, no less, coming out of his hands. Both have bad lightening affects. Heck, both have mute inmates with powers integral to the plot.Wow, I didn't know it was that many. Probably more, but suffice to say, Pinhead's first sequel, the only one in the long-running series that's a really a direct continuation, Hellbound Hellraiser II isn't as bad as I've portrayed it, but it's not up to #1's standards. They didn't even improve on the computer-generated flashes of light that causes more laughter than fear.Taking place seconds, then hours after the first one, Kirsty (Laurence) is magically in the aforementioned asylum being questioned for the deaths, including her father, in her late uncle's home. Quickly, the good doctor, Channard (Cranham) intervenes as he's a Brain Doc who knows how crazies work. It's obviously, up front, he's got ulterior motives for Kirsty, her next room over neighbor, the puzzle-solving mute, Tiffany (Boorman) and the objects in Kirsty's outlandish story of the Attack of the Cenobites.For plot's sake and the audience who may have not seen the original, Kirsty suddenly knows more than her character could possibly about the magical doorway opening box that calls upon the Cenobites and their motives&#x85;and what all happened at the house she just escaped when her family was wiped out in the first movie. Oh, and conveniently, not only is her love interest out of the picture, but she doesn't give him a second thought.So, let's see, she gets a message from her father, who's now in hell and it's not too difficult to tell that may not, in fact, be from her real father. Nevertheless, the first chance she gets, she dives headfirst into the labyrinth of Hades to rescue him. I thought most of those there just want a glass of iced water?Meanwhile, Doc Chan acquires the blood-soaked mattress where the Original's Diva Julia (Higgins) laid to rest. He knows (again, thanks convenient plot) enough to take nobodies or criminally insane patients of his, to that mattress, and allow them to kill themselves &#x96; in a really grotesque manner &#x96; to bring back Julia. Her transformation from the red mattress that's only fit for a Motel 6, into real flesh and blood kind of fast forward's the process that seemed to take a lot longer in #1.After the obvious parallel with The Bride of Frankenstein, or is that Bride of Re-Animator?, he willingly enters Hell's Maze to, I guess, learn more than his education allowed.There's a lot more, and I've only skimmed the surface. Suffice to say, all parties involved have fun in Pinhead's domain, each with their own agenda and a lot of plot holes surface &#x96; such as why there's no rules to Hell, then there are, then real is fake and real is real, etc, etc. (Not to give it away, but the ending's death to the new Cenobite and the spinning post had me shocked. A WTF shock, that is.)Pinhead finally shows up half way through, and he's been missed here, since I really did think I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street 3B. His lines were excellent Time to play, Your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell and How can it send us back, child? We're already here are just a few of some of my all time favorite lines. The good-doc also has some good lines (The Doctor is In,) but unfortunately, they overlapped the score a bit too loud and it was troublesome to actually hear him at the most opportune times.It certainly up'd the ante in blood &#x96; even for today's standards, this is pretty gruesome, and they kept up with the complex plot with multiple characters and story lines. The actors were delicious, namely Bradley, Higgins and Cranham. Even Booran tried &#x96; she did have a good line herself Shit!It's a good compliment to the first movie, though inferior. So, it's recommended, even with its multiple flaws and outrageously hilarious special effects &#x96; even for 1988.

The true fans may have seen a really uncut uncut version that makes sense of the various horrible flashbacks of our hero(ine)s in the labyrinth, or of the labyrinth itself - the 139-DVD-version (PAL) does not.The first 40 minutes are very well worth watching. Starting off right where Hellraiser left off (and with some borrowed scenes) Kirsty, orphaned and traumatized survivor, is examined in a mental hospital while cops inspect the decaying corpses at her home. Dr. Chenard, her psychiatrist, is introduced on screen performing a lobotomy while holding a philosophic monologue, evoking creepy notions of the darkest side of psychiatry and instantly suggesting something is terribly wrong with him. Though apparently friendly and dedicated, albeit with a noticeable lack of affect, we suspect the guy slicing so coolly through living brain matter is capable of anything, and of course we're right. Chenard is a man of strange obsessions, a collector of macabre relics and explorer of occult-psychic phenomena. Intrigued by Kirsty's terrified ravings of demons and resurrection from hell through blood, he acquires the mattress her stepmother Julia died on, ready to test the theory with a little help from the incurable lunatics in his hospital's basement dungeon. So the inevitable blood feast starts, and Chenard gets what he is looking for - although in the end, of course, evil is defeated by the script.The Chenard character is very well drawn and acted by Kenneth Cranham, and his job description of course ideally chosen. Although he is ultimately just another human seduced by his desires, he is more complex than the sexy couple Frank & Julia or the arrow-straight Kirsty, or even the iconic Pinhead. When he is transformed into a cenobite, he becomes the mere extension of his operating tools - deprived of all his explorer's curiosity only the carnal pleasures of slashing into flesh remain.Chenard and the asylum are truly terrifying, psycho-horror assets of the movie. Right until after Julia is resurrected in a creepy-gory scene and Chenard displays his fleshly desires for her skinless mummified body, it's a real good hair-raiser. Then, the promising plot unravels into the obvious - and the inexplicable rest. Kirsty and Tiffany, a mute young girl obsessed with puzzles, run through an endless maze, run into the original cenobites (who let them go after pointless threats and teeth-clacking), meet them again, argue - Pinhead and his crew must really be starved for conversation - and in the end even sort of bond with them. The cenobites just needed a little reminder of their human origins. The cutest moment comes when they're annihilated and Pinhead is unmasked - greetings from Darth Vader. Dough Bradley is handsome (if no Adonis), but - oh, these skirts!, the nipple-clips! It's generally a bad idea to show Pinhead whole body (masked or unmasked) without a lot of smoke or chains. And when his eyes meet Kirsty's ... we KNOW HE HAS STILL GOOD (body parts) in him!!The cenobites are about as threatening as Grandma's false teeth. But there's the psychological horror we were hooked on from the start... er - ehm... we know (now) that Kirsty is not particularly blessed with forbidden desires. But Tiffany! She was in Chenard's claws for at least 6 weeks (months?), and has clearly experienced a severe trauma that made her mute. But - alas, we need to see the really uncut uncut version to find out what that was! We can only assume that Chenard physically messed with her brain and maybe did something to her mother. As for Chenard himself, I must have missed why he envisions the copulating couple in the hot bath. As for all the horrific visions - made flesh! - that hell must have sucked up during the ages, we can only imagine them. We came by at lunch break. Hell is infernally boring!Did I mention the special effects? I wonder why some say they're better than in the original. The body make-up and atmosphere are believable enough, as they were in film one - it's all the animated stuff that nowadays looks crappy (the same applies to Hellraiser 3). The old VHS tapes leave much more to imagination - keep them! The only reason to buy the DVD is to enjoy more of the great score by Christopher Young - the Hellraiser theme is simply a classic.So - who messed it up? We just missed a great horror flick.

The story as such is good enough but it all seems a bit lacking, this can be due to the directing of Tony Randel who may have had a bit trouble getting his head around the 'bizaare' mind of Barker's universe, all in all he does a good enough job of it. What is great about this edition to the franchise apart from the fact that we learn more about Pinhead is the fact that we get to see how a Cenobite is made.The acting is all around okay but also seem a bit lacking or should we say confused Clare Higgins does a better job here than she did in the first as Julia Cotton; the newly returned seductress. Ashley Laurence again does a good job portraying Kristy Cotton; now placed in a mental institution. Sean Chapman and Oliver Smith reprises their role as Frank Cotton/Skinless Frank with Smith also portraying Browning; another patient at the Mental institution, this they does in an equally good way as in the first. We of cause also have Doug Bradley in his cult role as Pinhead/Capt. Elliot Spencer; This time with the added background role of Pinheads former human self, This he does with high grades yet again (in fact there could be no other Pinhead). In smaller roles we have William Hope as Kyle MacRae; a doctor at the mental institution whom falls for Kristy, and Imorgen Boorman as Tiffany; a patient at the institution who solve various puzzles and never speaks. Both does a okay job of their respective characters. A small note will go to Kenneth Crantham who plays Dr. Channard with a smidge over the top affection for the Lament configuration.This is well worth the look if you haven't seen it, the look and feel of the hell dimension gives you an idea of how Hell can be even though it's not what we have come to expect from popular beliefs. If you're a Hellraiser fan then by all means see this, it is in fact a good addition to the story, perhaps more so than any of the others (well we have one more including Kristy, I think it's number 6, which also continues the story of the Cottons, but I haven't seen it at the time of writing this.).All in all I give this 6, which may not seem like that high a grade but is still a grade above where I question if this is a movie that should have a place in my collection or not.

So I recently picked up a reissued DVD of it and sat down for a look, to see if it was as visceral and interesting as I remembered. I agree with Clive Barker's summary of this work (in a bonus featurette included with the DVD) Hellraiser II is an an uneven movie, but that it still has some very strong story and design elements, and some very effective acting and directing. It's not perfect, and it's not quite as well put together as the original, but there is plenty to like about it (if gruesome horror is your cuppa tea). Here's what I think is the strength of the franchise (or it was until the later filmmakers ran it into the ground and turned it into a kind of Twilight Zone with meat-hooks) along with some striking character designs and some cool SFX, the Hellraiser story managed to maintain a unique emotional feel and theme. It re-imagined the sufferings of damnation and torment in a vivid, memorable way that replaced Hellfire with Impalement and Cutting. It started out as a tale of a severely dysfunctional family, became the tale of a dysfunctional family's entanglement with Hell (re-imagined in a very compelling way), and then turned into the story of the principle denizen of that Hell and his attempts to invade our world to inflict his visions on us...but all of these versions of the story have been powered by the visceral dread of and fascination with, the spectacle of impalement and cutting...and the emotional consequences of it. The most interesting part of H II to me was the actual glimpse of the 'underverse'/dimension/version of Hell that spawned Pinhead and the Cenobites and the further exploration of their natures and origins. Even after 15 years, this envisioning of hell as an endless Labyrinth still has the power to fascinate...even if the 'modern eye', grown sophisticated from hours of multi-million dollar CGI, can now easily see matte paintings and process shots. It is still interesting and evocative enough that it helps the viewer overlook some of the more overblown and badly told portions of the movie, and once more 'get into' the mood Barker was trying to convey in the original. At the same time, what is revealed to the viewer doesn't really hang together, and tends to offend his desire for a consistent, coherent chain of cause-and-effect. It leaves a LOT of questions unanswered, or answered unsatisfactorily (although it is entirely possible that some of these answers were lost due to editing decisions). For instance Why doesn't Pinhead 'know' about Julia and Channard's entrance into Hell and Chennard's subsequent transformation? How does Channard get the power to so easily defeat the Cenobites? Why are some people turned into Cenobites (like the soldier who becomes Pinhead) and others are simply condemned to suffer (like Kristy's father and his brother Frank). Why does Julia's allegiance to Leviathan differ from Pinhead's (who seems to be the premier soldier of Hell?). Why isn't she working with him to accomplish Leviathan's aims? For that matter, why is Kristy in a sanitarium after the events of the first film, when her boyfriend is sent home with no ill effects after going through the same experiences? Etc. All these answers can be found by people willing to further investigate the back-story (such as www. cenobite.com), but they are not especially evident within the movie itself, and that feeling of incompleteness and information-glossed-over, weakens the film experience quite a bit. (By comparison, Star Wars IV, A New Hope has an enormous back-story, but you don't need to know it to understand the events of the film or the logic of the movie's plot). I feel there is really no need to get into the worth of the acting here - everyone here is at least perfectly adequate to the material, some of the actors are great, and everyone is as good as they need to be for a gruesome damage-fest like this. No one is here to win an Oscar - everyone is here for the paycheck. But they are all pros (even the oft maligned Ashley Laurence), and they get the job done. Everyone here is a pleasure to watch, in costume or out of it. So is it a 'classic' of modern horror? Hmmm. I'd say, no. But it IS a piece that holds up well, and still has a certain power and fascination to it even more than an decade after the fact. That's more than they will be able to say about Final Destination 2 (which I actually liked), or Jeepers Creepers 2, or the Jason or Freddy Kreuger series.

With brass and choir blasting away it sends chills up the spine.Like a sequel should, this film is more lush and explores bigger territories. We're talking exploring the territories of Hell where we get to actually see the Leviathan.The cinematography and sets are just beautiful. And can you take gore? Because this has some very intense and hard to watch scenes of pure bloody mayhem. Get'em off meeeeee! I guarantee that scene alone we'll have you squirming.The Hellraiser series will forever remain the most interesting and provocative of all horror films because of their terrific back stories and intriguing characters. As grotesque and disturbing as this film is, you can no doubt admit that at times it is a very beautiful film to look at.The first film wallowed in the pleasures of pain and suffering in a house, this one takes you into the nether regions of Hell. There are no boundaries. There are no limits. This film goes all out.If you liked the first film you will definitely enjoy this.And remember... They Have Eternity To Know Your Flesh! "},{"Title":"Sweet Suffering","Date":"16 April 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" This sequel to the groundbreaking Hellraiser is every bit as innovative and gory (if not gorier) than the first. Picking up right where the first film ended, Hellbound finds Kirsty Cotton in a mental institution, being questioned by police who have just found the bloody ruin in her fathers house. Not believing her story of demons and puzzle boxes from Hell, Kirsty is left in the Channard Institute, dismissed as a shell shocked lunatic. Unfortunately for Kirsty, not only is she completely sane but Doctor Channard, head of the Institution, believes her story. It seems the good doctor has been searching for the Lament Configuration for a very long time. The blood is soon flowing as Channard releases Julia from hell (through a very bloody doorway in a stained mattress) and supplies her with an inexhaustible amount of nubile young women to feed upon. Meanwhile, Kirsty takes an interest in a mute girl, Tiffany, who has a convenient knack for solving puzzles. She also gets a surprise visitor in the middle of the night; a skinless horror who scrawls a plea for help in blood upon the wall (a message that fans of Trent Reznor will have no problem recognizing). Kirsty, convinced her dead father is trapped in Hell, strikes out to save his soul. But Channard and Julia have beaten her to the puzzle box, and force young and innocent Tiffany to open it for them. Pinhead, making a most majestic entrance amid lightening and smoke, is wonderful to watch as he regally roams the corridors of Hell like the King of Pain himself. A GREAT and stunning prologue also tells us the tale of Pinheads' beginning, and the end sees him come full circle as he uses his instruments of torture to save the lives and souls of Kirsty and Tiffany.This is a nice, bloody, nasty sequel with interesting new characters and some neat surprises. It manages to answer most of the questions posed in the first film and does it with as much blood, guts and torn skin as possible. The great setting of the mental institution sets just the right mood, as the screams of the violently insane echo up and down the corridors of the hospital, which are not so very different from the halls of Hell. Careful attention is paid here to light, shadow, music and movement, and it all pays off, giving us what is probably the strongest entry in the Hellraiser series. Definitely worth seeing, even if only once.

At the time, I had only seen Hellraiser, Hell on Earth, Bloodline, and Inferno (which now, I wish I had not seen). I heard many things about it. Some said it was either as good as or better than the first. Some said that the film was full of enough gore to put the original to shame. And when I rented it, I was first appalled, then I was shocked, and finally, I was in awe.Taking over the director's reins from Clive Barker, Tony Randal, along with newcomer horror writer Peter Atkins (who would go on to do Hellraiser III and IV, as well as the first Wishmaster, not to mention cameoing as the Barbie Cenobite in III) create a film that manages to be a bit darker than the first, with a just as good cast.Starting right where the first ended, Kirsty is now in a mental hospital, run by Dr. Channard. He has frightening fascinations involving the puzzle box and the world of darkness within. So, he resurrects Julia, uses a mute patient to solve the box, and once again, Hell is brought to Earth. But this time, the viewer actually gets to see how Cenobites are created and explains more of the Hell that the Cenobites serve.I won't lie. When I first saw this, there were images in that film that stayed in my mind for a long time. Only finding the unrated version, I wasn't prepared for such sights as Skinless Julia, Hell's Labyrinth, and, especially, the Channard Cenobite. When I first saw him on-screen, I knew that he would be the one that would put Pinhead's seething darkness into shame.SPOILERSI was a little bit surprised, though, that the Channard Cenobite actually had the nerve within to kill the original Cenobites (sans Pinhead). I could already figure out that Female and Butterball would turn back into their normal human selves, but when the Chatterer changed back into a little kid, I was completely off guard. I was so shocked to see that the puzzle box would actually transform a little kid into a Cenobite.And the Channard Cenobite's death was a fitting death to such a creepy character. He was a monster as both human and a Cenobite. And it was also a pretty ironic way that he dies by the hand of Leviathan, who actually seemed to have chosen him as his new Dark Pope. Well, a fitting end to a frightening monster.END SPOILERSThe acting in this one has improved. Returning from the original are Clare Higgens (Julia), Ashley Lawrence (Kirsty), Sean Chapman (Frank), and Doug Bradley (Pinhead), who take their roles to a new level. New bloods Kenneth Cranham (Channard) and Imogen Boorman (Tiffany) help bring more life into the film, but what really makes it the best, besides Bob Keen's excellent skinless/Cenobite makeup, is Christopher Young's beautifully haunting score which gives the film its own emotion.So, the next time you go to your video store, don't get a Freddy, Jason, or Leatherface movie. Go to the H section and look for Hellbound Hellraiser II, one of the 1980's best horror sequels.A+ "},{"Title":"Hellraiser 2","Date":"31 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This movie is more simple to understand than the first, and in alot of ways much better.

Pinhead and his gang of demons ('Cenobites') make a very welcome return after the semi-classic Hellraiser. Fans of the original will already be au-fait with the bucket-loads of bodily fluids and fairly difficult subject matters which dominate this film. The afore-mentioned self-harm scene is one of the most disturbing ninety seconds on tape. Although frankly if Clive Barker's vision of 'Hell' is indeed true, I shall become a devoted Christian just to avoid the boredom of empty tunnel upon empty tunnel. The transition between this film and the last is difficult. It's not one you could 'get' immediately without watching Hellrasier 1. But the insights from Kirsty Cotton, the unfortunate lass who lost the lion's share of her family in HR1, are enough to shed some light. The cast, none of whom we can call 'household names', do a good enough job of making their respective parts believable. The two older campaigners, Kennteh Cranham (Dr Chinard) and Clare Higgins (Julia) put on the strongest performances, and rookie Imogen Boorman (Tiffany) gives a convincing display. Doug Bradley, who plays Pinhead, the repulsive character who symbolises Hellraiser, has a slightly bigger role but still not one on which the show centres. Which is certainly not a bad thing, the last thing we need is another Freddy Kruger. But the budget for this picture was small, and it shows. Apart from the wonderful costuming applied to the cenobites and in particular to Dr Chinard in his Cenobite phase, the graphics don't do the film justice. But surely that's the norm for horror sequels, and where many fall by the wayside, Hellbound is as strong as and certainly more frightening than the original despite not being blessed with a Titanic-esque budget. The music to accompany the film is quite astounding. The main tune itself is pretty a simple, sobering, even depressing affair. But it works on several levels - the orchestral version which sees out the closing credits, and the choral piece which accompanies Tiffany's final showdown with the Leviathan (easily the worst part of the film) are both touching. So it's a good film if you're looking for the typical blood 'n' guts horror - there's enough of the red stuff to sink the HMS Ocean - although it is advisable to watch Hellraier 1 first, as the plot thickens more easily with the full insight. Those who already have seen HR1 may be disappointed at the 'lack' of Pinhead, but this is still one of the better Horror sequels in terms of emulating the quality of it's original - a feat not achieved by the likes of Nightmare On Elm Street, the Omen and the Evil Dead.

Even though the creativity of Barker's original is gone, Hellbound makes up for the loss by expanding the Hellraiser world. Now Hell no longer comes to us, now, friends, we venture into hell, itself.Largely the same cast as the first film, introducing new characters as needed; the main cast give varying performances, but most are on the better side of any horror film I've seen. The lesser the character, the lesser the performance but hey, this is horror, and for horror it's not bad. Laurence, Bradley, Boorman, Cranham, and Higgins do very well. My biggest gripes are some of the character reactions--which were the fault of the script writers, not the actors themselves necessarily. But guess what? Most of the reactions in Hellraiser was either silly or stupid.The trademark gore returns, perhaps a little toned down from the first; I never cared for excessive gore in horror films, but Hellraiser 1 and 2 does not make the blood its plot much like it never makes the cenobytes the plot. The plots in these two films revolve around dark characters bound for hell, their sins, deceptions, power struggles, and the puzzle box. The cenobytes, the puzzle box, it's all just the result of the plot. So the people who whine because the new Hellraisers don't show much of pinhead; well, actually sit down and watch the originals, he's not here very often either.Christopher Young returns in full force with a haunting and heavy handed main theme, but it evolves to something beautiful when accompanying likable characters. Very surprising and inspiring; I can't hardly name any orchestral horror scores from the 80s worth listening to.This sequel does something unique in horror history--it actually manages to pull off an explanation of its predecessor successfully. Most horror sequels falter not because they don't have a plot; rather because they have too much. Ex. Most sequels will dig into the mythology of the first to develop the new installment, until they dig so deep that you're getting to the source of the killings being because Joe's brother's mother's distant cousin's grandfather had a enchanted item given to him by a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy who knew some man from Cleveland, well now he's back and p***ed.How 'bout a specific example? Halloween 6 built an entire plot line for a 90 (or so) minute movie based on a handful of snippets of dialogue from Halloween 1 & 2. There was a reason why it was just snippets in Halloween 1 & 2, if they could've made a plot of it they would have. Back to this sequel, Hellraiser 2 brings up minimum detail from Hellraiser 1, gives just enough to push start Hellraiser 2's and goes no further. It combines enough of Hellraiser 1, while walking into new territory.Also, Hellraiser 2 has my favorite two word line in horror movie history. I would quote it but it's been used everywhere, the significance is when and who says it in this film.In the end, sequels are about combining old with new; different fans demand different mixtures, but for this fan . . . Hellraiser 2 is the only sequel in this franchise that's gotten the formula right.

Her doctor, as irony would have, is a mad doctor & hell bent on learning & unraveling all the mysteries of the puzzle box.While he deceives others into thinking he's a caring person, underneath he has a very malevolent nature just like Frank Cotton from the first film. Actually, he's more evil than Frank. Case in point, he keeps his un-treatable patients in the cellar of the institute & uses one of them in his twisted plan. As the film moves along, you learn very horrible things about the doctor, not only in the present but in his past as well.There are several plots going on in this film. For starters, Kirsty trying to get to hell to rescue her father (boy, this girl needs a serious bible study lesson! She's really convinced she can do it!), the return of Julia, and Dr. Channard trying to take over hell are just a few plots we see. One very interesting thing about this film is what I call the Battle of the Cenobites! Watch if you dare!While I like this film, I found some flaws in it. There a few special effects that look as if someone needed to go back to school. The battle of the Cenobites needed some more bite to it & it was too short.

I was also glad that many of the original actors & their characters were brought back for the sequel.

Apparently, no-one believes her story about demons from hell. However, it appears her psychiatrist, Dr. Channard, appears to take interest in her. It turns out that he is obsessed with the puzzle box and after resurrecting Julia, he provides her with fresh bodies. When she is whole, Dr. Channard gives the puzzle box to a mysterious young girl called Tiffany who has a strange obsession with solving puzzles. She solves the puzzle box and Pinhead and co appear.However, they don't want Tiffany. Instead they want Dr. Channard. Tiffany meets Kirsty and the two girls go to look for Kirsty's father. After a run-in with Julia and Frank, they decide to leave Hell. Meanwhile, Julia has actually tricked Channard and he is put into a cenobite creation machine. He emerges as a powerful being who wishes to not only rule Hell but also the world. Kirsty and Tiffany have to find a way to stop him even if it means going back to Hell. The cast are pretty good and the plot is also interesting. We also find out more about the Cenobites and the fact that they were all once human. This later developed in later sequels especially in the case of Pinhead. Channard makes a pretty good cenobite and gets some good lines. Visually, the journey through Hell is kind of  cool. If you love gore, you will love this film. There is a nasty scene where one of the mental patients uses a razor to get maggots off his arm. There is also people with no skin, hooks digging into flesh, cheese wire wrapped round faces, injections of needles, throat slashings and more gory delights.Overall, this is a very enjoyable film with some nice ideas and excellent make up effects. However, if you are squeamish or don't like the sight of blood, then this a film you should avoid. If it doesn't scare you, it will make you launch your lunch.

The follow-up is far less successful but still manages to be enjoyably silly and just occasionally - especially during the first third of the film - highly effective. There is throughout a strong element of high camp which prevents the viewer taking proceedings at all seriously and goes some way to helping one overlook the truly dreadful script which is nevertheless delivered with great gusto by Clare Higgins and Kenneth Cranham. The former's character Julia, returns from the dead as a skinless seductress and  her resurrection and subsequent 'rehabilitation' are creepily impressive. Once 'human' again she is transformed into a backlit, begowned Hollywood goddess her appearance providing an amusing contrast to her subsequent behaviour. Higgins was obviously encouraged to go way over the top and doesn't disappoint. But there's far too little of Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites and the two heroines spend far too much time charging around in a labyrinth that is one of the most boring representations of Hell you are ever likely to see.

The storyline places Kirsty into a psychiatric hospital, commanded by the equally brilliant and evil dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham, excellent. His part is unique, and Cranham makes his character a Humphrey Bogart type. Everything in Channard resembles Bogart). Channard manages to bring Julia, the evil stepmother, back, through the mattress,and not only he brings Julia back, but he also unleashes the cenobites. Counting with the help of a mute girl named Tiffany and Kyle,a medical assistant who learns too much too late and who ends up suffering a lot inside julia's arms (William Hope makes his even small interpretation one of the best things in the film), Kirsty decides to put an end in the cenobites. What is so good about Randel's direction and Peter Atkin's script is that both are not afraid to shot this sick, but interesting, story in a realistic and cruel way.

Unfortuneately, this also makes it a tad guilty of biting off more than it can chew.The coolest thing about this movie is that it takes place, for the most part, in Hell.  The new 'fantasy' element seen in the Labarynth segments is very well done.  There are, of course, the obligatory gory scenes.  The music is very cool (I bought the soundtrack!), and the acting is solid all around.The story here is that the head of a mental institute, Dr. Channard, has an obsessive interest with the mythos of the puzzle box.  He has collected and documented a houseful of research regarding hell and cenobites.  The movie gives (brief) insight into how Pinhead and his pupils became the way the are, although not information specific to each cenobite.Anyway, the doctor is using the mental patients as sort of specimens (or pawns really) in his research.  We also see the return of Frank and Julia, and are introduced to Tiffany, a little girl at the Channard Institute who does not speak, but is skilled at solving puzzles.The movie is important to me because it gives further insight into a mythology that I really enjoy.  The only thing is, for some of the ideas that are touched on to be fully developed, the movie would have to be hours long!

Perhaps the most fantastic aspect to the story is how the dimension of the Cenobites, Hell, is further explored as well as the customs of those who reside within it. This is a place built upon unspeakable, primal transgressive desires mixed with degenerative violence but at the same time, it possesses a strongly human element in the form of Pinhead and his Cenobite brothers and sisters. At one point, every inhabitant of this place of pain and ecstasy was a human being, not mere creations of will and Kirsty comes to realise that these so-called demons aren't necessarily evil despite their appearances. On that note, allow me to say I love the designs of Pinhead's brethren, my favourite possibly being the Chatterer.There really is nothing out there like the Cenobites they are utterly precious creations. This brings me to the further explanation of Pinhead himself and his relationship with Kirsty in this film and how I feel it is truly one of the best male/female relationships in the horror genre.There is no sexual tension to be found between the two and that is absolutely, unquestionably refreshing to me. So many interpersonal relations between a female hero and a male villain tends to automatically favour some type of erotic tension- not here. I mean sure, there is fan fiction out there that tries to imply there was of course, but the chemistry between Bradley and Laurence hinges more on an understand of each other than attraction. If Pinhead is intrigued by something of Kirsty's it is her intellect. You see, Kirsty has come to understand that Pinhead is a businessman and follows a code of conduct when it comes to hunting down errant souls of which he makes claim to.when she finds the fortitude and strength to make a deal with him, he is impressed and agrees to the mutual contract. At this moment, Pinhead realises that he isn't striking a bond with a frightened girl, but a tactical and logical mind which he thoroughly respects. I don't think I've seen a heroine take such a cerebral approach such as this and Laurence's strength and skill as an actress shines through as Kirsty begins adapts and starts to master an art that so many are unable to comprehend. Now, the question you may be asking yourself is, is it as good as the original?

With her is a new friend she made in the mental ward, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a mute with convenient puzzle-solving skills. Hot on her trail is her arch-nemesis and step mother, Julia (Claire Higgins), who has seduced Kristy's doctor and turned him onto the wild side of life (read Hellraising good times).While the film lacks the vision and focus of the original, it's certainly a worthy successor with more than a few creepy elements at play. First and foremost, the visions of Hell are unique and unlike anything seen in film before it. Also, there's plenty of bloodshed and elaborate special effects and make-up work to go around, making this one almost as visually unsettling and disgusting as its predecessor. Director Tony Randel doesn't work the same sort of magic behind the camera as Barker (it doesn't help that the script is a bit bloated) but is more than up to the task of delivering an intense and visually striking follow-up. It's also worth noting that the film lets us in on a bit on the origins of the lead cenobite from the first film, Pinhead, as portrayed by Doug Bradley, in one of the film's most imaginative and intense sequences.While it's certainly not a patch on the original, for what it's worth, Hellbound Hellraiser II is miles above and beyond the myriad of sequels that would follow in its wake. Fans of the first will appreciate the fact that it attempts to take things one step further, and although it stumbles along the way, in the end, it's a gruesome and grueling experience that more than lives up to its name.

Kirsty tries to do so but this time she has to do battle with her evil stepmother (Clare Higgons) who labels herself as the wicked queen.

Clare Higgins works in the role but she lacks the edge she had in the first and her motivation seems rather random this time. Indeed that is the feeling through out. It is pure randomness that often times leaves the viewer unsure of what is going on at times.

From what I understand, the production was a stressful affair for all concerned. I suspect New World, on its last legs, was desperate for a hit.Yet, if you just sit back and let it entertain you on its own terms, it actually has a certain weird appeal. It makes little sense by human standards of logic, but it's great to watch when you're drunk or stoned. (Preferably both) If nothing, it works on a visceral level. The most graphic portion of the film concerns an act of self-mutilation, and a subsequent resurrection of a character from the original...minus her skin. It still has the capacity to disturb. In keeping with giving credit where it's due, the performances are more than adequate given the circumstances. Kenneth Cranham is effective as an amoral psychologist, and his eventual transformation is a masterpiece of makeup technology. Doug Bradley seems more comfortable playing Pinhead, and Ashley Laurence likewise has a better grip on her role than she originally did.Speaking of Pinhead, he receives more screen time than he did in part one, and his back story puts the Cenobites in a whole new light. One cannot discount the originality of Clive Barker's vision of Hell, although the time and budgetary constraints do hamper the effect to a degree.

It does not surpass the original, and it is lacking on some of the key qualities but regardless Hellraiser 2 raised the bar for this series. They knew what they were doing. More blood, more guts, more story, more of the original characters and they ran with it. Honestly the sequel starts out on shaky ground because it doesn't feel like it has the same strength of story but once the ball gets rolling it really does complement the original film. Best of all in the final moments of the film which takes place essentially inside 'hell' or inside the puzzle box, once again the special effects are absolutely outstanding. Not only that but instead of just having Pinhead return and the rest of the cennobites you have a new 'big bad' guy in the form of the head institution doctor whose obsession with the occult takes him into Pinhead's world and turns him into a beast of unspeakable terror. The blood and gore is probably twice that which was in the first film and that in itself is an impressive feat.Ashley Laurence returns as Kirsty Cotton, now institutionalized because of the events of the first film. While this isn't entirely a unique idea it is a solid staple into leading into a great horror film. Institutions always make great backdrops for horror flicks. Also returning in a superb manner is Clare Higgins who plays Kirsty's stepmother who has now been re-born much like her lover Frank was in the first film. Only now she wants vengeance on Kirsty. Higgins easily tops her original performance by becoming this monster, this twisted woman and creature and proves she is more than just a B-Movie actress which she sort of came off like in the first film. Higgins and Laurence have the perfect chemistry. Doug Bradley returns to his iconic role as Pinhead (again he is not called this in the film at all) and the best part of Hellraiser 2 is that we actually learn something about the man that 'Pinhead' was before he became the monster. This is of course explored in great depth later in the many, many sequels but it is delicately touched on in this film. Bradley is brilliant once again and manages to keep a lot of the mystery of his character which is a feat as well. Kenneth Cranham joins the cast as the head of the institution I mentioned earlier. He has a thirst for the occult and will stop at nothing to uncover the secret of the puzzle box. His doctor character is very campy but fits well in his scenes with Higgins but he truly flourishes as the latest cennobite that is blood thirsty and absolutely evil to the core. Imogen Boorman also joins the cast as a mute girl who is profoundly good at puzzles. The doctor is of course using her to try and solve the puzzle box. The problem with her character is that she starts out seeming almost autistic like there is something socially or mentally wrong with her but by the end of the film she seems to be fine other than she hadn't spoken since the death of her mother. Still she isn't in the film enough to make a huge impact.Tony Randel takes the helm from Clive Barker and I think that Barker must have had a significant hand in the film because it still has that distinct Barker quality and no offence to Mr. Randel but he doesn't exactly have an amazing career record especially at this time. The story falls short of what the original film was but that is bound to happen. Fortunately the characters and the incredible special effects and creatures win out again. The last half hour to 45 minutes of this film are terrifying, brilliantly filmed and breathtaking. A worthy follow up to the original film. And while as I said I don't believe it is as good as the original its too good to score it less than a solid 9/10.

He had always had a special interest in the box. Dr. Channard was the best actor in the film by far. The special effects, looking back now were primitive and laughable.

Luckily for fans of Pinhead and Co., Hellraiser creator Clive Barker, after the sequel was given the go-ahead, decided to expand on the ideas and characters of the first movie to ensure that Hellbound was more than just a case of 'more of the same.' Barker's plot outline and ideas were passed to writer Peter Atkins and Tony Randel was signed up to direct the sequel.Visually, Hellbound retains a similar look to the original movie with flashes of bright lighting and some strikingly macabre images - the sight of a skinless Julia, wrapped in pure white bandages is especially memorable. It's worth mentioning at this point that Hellbound is one of the most relentlessly gory films that this reviewer has ever seen, with hardly a minute passing without some kind of gore effect being splashed across the screen. The previously mentioned scene with the hospital inmate hacking away at himself with a razor will send even hardened gore hounds stomachs a-churning and splatter-fans will be delighted with the grue on display here.

I really enjoyed JULIA slipping into the role of the skinless seductor, previously held by her former lover Frank in the original. Several of the same cast & crew also return. The special effects by BOB KEEN is some of the best special effects work to ever grace a horror film! I really loved the character of Channard, he's so deliciously charismatic & evil, in fact along with him, Julia & Frank, one could almost consider it a crime, that neither of these villains ever turned up in future instalments. The scene where the mental patient razors himself on a bloody mattress is super gory, that it actually makes up for the lack of blood in the film. The film is imbued with marvellous, twisted & very weird visuals. The cenobites yet again serve only as mere window dressing to the real plot & not counting Pinhead's birth & flashbacks to the first film, only appear at the 53 minute mark. However they are given a little more screen time here, as does their master Levithan. Frank, the main villain in the original, is given a cameo appearance here & one can also see that Kirsty betraying Frank & leading the cenobites to him in the first film, has not dampened his sickening lust for his niece either. To be truthful, he is really only here in order to see him get his by Julia, seeking revenge for killing her in the original, since he serves the plot not at all. The character of Steve, Kirsty's love interest in the first film, is wisely dropped from the sequel, although one can well see a potential romantic interest going on between Dr. Channard's assistant Kyle & Kirsty, that never gets developed, as he is bumped off rather quickly. Director TONY RANDALL takes the directorial reigns from CLIVE BARKER (Who serves as Executive Producer here) & his direction serves the film well.On the downside however, there were things that bothered me, such as the following It is revealed midway that the message Kirsty thought she received from her skinless father believed trapped in hell, is actually from Frank, who was manipulating her in order to help him escape, making Kirsty's trip to hell rather pointless, since she never once runs into her dad & despite shedding some light on the cenobites & hell itself, the viewers visit into the cenobties universe, disappointingly turns out to be nothing more than a series of dark, dusty labyrinth hallways & despite it being around since the beginning of time, there's hardly anyone, if anyone, there. The film also fails to answer the questions of how Julia was able to emerge a bloody skinless corpse & yet Frank was forced to bludgeon several victims in order to obtain their blood, since he was a dry & rotting husk of a corpse. Julia also is able to retain her original human look & yet Frank couldn't? Julia remarks to Channard that she has such sites to show him & seems to have unlimited knowledge of hell itself & yet she has only been there one day? Channard has three puzzle boxes in his home & then later in the film, we see several mental patients playing with a series of them, is there more than one main puzzle box then? What is Channard doing with a picture of Elliot Spencer, Pinhead's human form? How can Channard, Julia & Frank all be killed, when they are already in hell? Kirsty meeting up with Frank in hell, also slows the exciting amount of momentum the film story had going in & who grabbed the mover & pulled him into the bed in the end sequence?. Continuity errors also abound In the original film, Kirsty's house burned to the ground, yet here, it is once again standing as the cops are investigating it. One of Julia & Frank's victims is found in a large wicker basket full of maggots, & yet this same corpse was hidden in the large oak cabinet in the first, while a rotting boned dusty corpse falls out of a large cabinet instead? The last film ended with another soon to be victim set to buy the puzzle box from the Asian seller, but this is never referred to here. I also admit to not caring much about giving the cenobites a back story, specifically having them be human at one time & Kirsty helping them to remember their humanity, I felt this watered the characters down some, wherein the original film, one assumed that they were always centuries old minions. Thankfully the sequels tended to ignore all of this & the story tends to jump around a lot.All in all, HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II despite it's many shortcomings, is one of the best horror films ever made & to be truthful, they really didn't need to do more sequels to this franchise, simply because the film ends with the cenobites dead & Levithan put to sleep no long able to control the minds of those in it's midst. Julia & Frank's along with Kirsty's story, has now been completely solved. Regardless of all this, I highly recommend this movie!

Hellbound Hellraiser II is a brilliant example of that situation in action.A sequel to the 1987 horror sleeper hit Hellraiser, Hellbound exists simply to keep that business flowing. It has no other purpose.For legal reasons, Hellraiser director and screenwriter Clive Barker had to step down from direct creative control over the sequel, and screenwriter Peter Atkins and director Tony Randel stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that is actually more plot less, confusing and gore-filled than its predecessor. To describe Hellbound Hellraiser II is an exercise in futility, but I will endeavor to explain it. Opening almost immediately after the conclusion of Hellraiser, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), one of only two survivors of the first film, awakens in a psychiatric ward run by one Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), a psychiatrist and surgeon who appears to have a side interest in the occult (how convenient). He discovers that an individual died on a mattress confiscated by police in Kirsty's father's house and determines that he must resurrect the individual on the mattress so he can get a better understanding of the afterlife, or another dimension, or something. So, he secures one of his more radical patients, takes him to his lavish home and proceeds to give him a straight razor to open himself up on the mattress, thus beginning the cycle of resurrection for Julia Cotton (Claire Higgins), who was Cenobite bait at the end of Hellraiser.Embued with flesh thanks to Channard's willingness to support her thirsty appetites for human blood and flesh, Julia agrees to show him everything he wants in Hell if he can only open the door. So, he recruits an autistic patient from his hospital, named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who has an amazing knack at solving puzzles, gives her one of the puzzle boxes that open the doors to Hell, and lets her rip. Meanwhile, Kirsty has had a vision of her father wallowing in Hell, and using a friendship with Channard's protégé, Kyle MacRae (William Hope) they brake into Channard's house to prevent Julia from being brought back from the dead, but they are two late, and end up watching as Channard lets Tiffany open the doors to Hell and then follow them in.To describe the rest of the film would be useless, because there isn't much point. The film has the barest thread of a plot, Kirsty's search for her father, but that is just an excuse for us to be witness to some of the goriest stuff ever put to screen. Hellbound Hellraiser II is not an easy film to watch, and if you are even the slightest bit squeamish, just don't even bother. It is a constant stream of skinless bodies, people cutting themselves open, having themselves cut open, hearts ripped out, various torture implements stuck into skin, etc. There really are no characters to care about, everybody is thin as a sheet, and spend most of the film wandering around some dank, dark corridors running into various unsavory events and images. Randel isn't even trying to generate suspense, he is just letting the grotesqueries unfold on screen for all to see. We feel no tension or fear, no dread, just indifference. It also doesn't help that the film is wildly underexplained, as it's predecessor was. How is it that there apparently is somebody around every corner that has some strange interest in this puzzle box, and why has no one ever noticed that those who end up with it disappear never to return? I guess there is some message here about exploring the darker side of humanity, but it's buried underneath the gore. I must admit, when I was younger, I enjoyed this film, perhaps because the imagery was perverse enough to feed my need for rebellious youth, maybe I had a dark streak, who knows. But as time has progressed, I came to realize the Hellbound is nothing but an endless display of gory effects with no substance. I think we could all do better than this film for two hours of entertainment.

The original Hellraiser obviously was affirmative in this respect, because only one year after the original was released, this darker and slightly dumber sequel was released.Set almost straight after the original film, Hellbound Hellraiser II starts with a brief recap of events as Kirsty Cotton from the first movie awakes to find herself in a mental institute. With doctors and police questioning her story, Kirsty appears to be doomed to spend the rest of her life in this institute facing nightmares and visions of her father, Frank, Julia and anyone else who might now be in Hell. This is, however, until Dr Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham) demonstrates a knowledge of the Cenobites by bringing Julia Cotton back from the dead. With Julia and the Dr both travelling into Hell, it ends up being upto Kirsty to once again stop her evil stepmother.Whilst the original film had an element of family to it, with the Cotton family fighting amongst themselves, this sequel spreads it's seed as it includes an entire mental institution. With Dr Channard himself eventually becoming a Cenobite, the institution becomes particularly relevant as this new badguy's favourite phrase appears to be The doctor is in.By spreading the range of people involved, the creators of this film have evolved the world of this series, but at the same time have devalued it. Hellraiser was never the best horror film around, but it was still a dark, formidable tale about the evils of the world. This second one has lost part of that mystic by creating an actual Hell where our characters spend most of their time. One thing which seems interesting is that whether the plot is inferior or not, the direction feels less superior under the leadership of Tony Randel than the original did under Clive Barker. Barker remains present on the set of the film, but in the main credits he is the original writer, rather than writer, script writer and director. It's a good question as to whether Barker's smaller role in the creation of this film has hampered it's effect, and personally the answer is a resounding yes. Whilst this film is far from awful, it's very much average. There are so many better horror films out there and even the original is vastly superior.Therefore to summarise, Hellbound Hellraiser II is a typical, average horror film. With nothing special going for it (except for Doug Bradley's Pinhead) and one or two bad points (the obsession with showing footage from the first film), it's far from perfect. It's not the worst film either however. It has a plot, it has acceptable acting across the board, and it has the odd spot of gore. Ultimately though, these don't make it particularly brilliant. It's worthy of a five out of ten, nothing higher, nothing lower. Totally average.

However, wishing to add a comment about the film here on IMDb for the sake of completeness (I had already reviewed the original and part 3, and intend to watch the further instalments in the future), I decided to refresh my memory whilst also giving it another chance to impress me.And besides, it also seemed like a good excuse for me to get another fix of the lovely Ashley Laurence!Directed by Tony Randel, Hellbound follows on immediately from the events in Hellraiser, with a traumatised Kirsty (Laurence) recovering in a mental institution. In the first of several rather contrived plot developments, the head of the institute, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), turns out to be a student of all things 'Cenobite' and, upon hearing Kirsty ranting about demons and boxes, decides to seize his opportunity to experience Hell first-hand.After acquiring the blood-soaked mattress on which Kirsty's step-mother Julia (Clare Higgins) died, the nasty doctor takes one of his institute's more extreme nutters, who believes that he is covered in maggots, and hands the poor fellow an open cut-throat razor. The seriously disturbed lunatic slashes at the imaginary creepy-crawlies on his flesh, cutting himself to ribbons in the process (definitely not a scene for the squeamish!). The flow of blood revives Julia who, in one of the films most shocking and disturbing sequences, crawls from the mattress to feed.The twisted Dr. Channard then forms a bizarre relationship with the semi-rejuvenated Julia, bringing her more sustenance (and indulging with her in the occasional spot of slap 'n' tickle) until she is fully revived. In return for helping her, Julia (who thankfully no longer sports that horrible hairdo she had in Hellraiser) shows Channard the key to unlocking the doorway to hell Tiffany, another of his patients, who is adept at solving all manner of puzzles (another convenient coincidence, methinks!).Meanwhile, Kirsty has seen a bloody vision of her father pleading to be released from his suffering in Hell, and also seeks a way into the world of the Cenobites...Whilst I am sure all of this twisted sado-masochistic, occult-based nonsense makes perfect sense to creator Clive Barker, who obviously views this world (and beyond) in ways I cannot (or do not) want to imagine, it appears to me that Hellbound's director Randel and screenwriter Peter Atkins were not quite so clear about the author's vision when making this film (and who can blame them?).Hellbound begins well enough, but gradually becomes more and more confusing, until the totally incomprehensible finale which takes place in a labyrinthine version of hell consisting of dodgy matte paintings and cheap visual effects. Although there is undeniably loads of inventive imagery and gruesome gore to ensure that the film is never boring, it is way too messy (and I'm not talking about the blood and guts) and incoherent to be a satisfying experience.Throw in a silly cenobite version of Channard that makes wise-cracks ala Freddy Krueger, and a twist ending in which Kirsty wears Julia's skin to win her battle against evil, and you have a film that, although not quite as bad as I had remembered, is a long way from the quality of the original.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

Unfortunately this film goes so over the top that it's nearly impossible to watch.In this one the audience is taken into hell, with Kirsty, sole survivor of the first film our tour guide. Again this is a terrific idea and they really go all out to make hell a surreal and horrifying place, but it just doesn't work. I mean Kirsty ends up befriending a young kid and wearing some fake human skin so she can save her life at movie's end and then we have a Disney soundtrack in the background and a feel good moment. Who's supposed to be watching this movie? Little kids? I won't complain too much because I'm not a whiner, but there is too much meaningless carnage, too much Pinhead and too little story for me to rate it as anything but a disappointment.

This is a sequel to Hellraiser (a laughable, disgusting production) and the film picks up where its predecessor left off. Ashley Laurence (the girl from the original) is now in a psychiatric ward with a crazed doctor (Kenneth Cranham). The doctor naturally is obsessed with the occult and wants to find the way to hell that was released in the first film. Cranham also tries to resurrect Laurence's stepmother (played by duo actresses, the main one being Clare Higgins), much the way Higgins attempted to resurrect her former lover in the original. Also the dreaded Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is along for the tedious, confusing and tiring ride. Fans of charnel house ugliness should enjoy this waste, but all others should stay away if they know what is good for them. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).

There is a self-mutilation scene, early on, that goes far beyond anything you've ever seen in, say, Day of the Dead or Maniac. If you manage to sit through that, you'll probably be able to sit through the rest of the film, though it's not really worth it. The gore here is mostly gratuitous and the story pretty weak, making little sense and ending without a proper resolution. Many fans of the series were displeased with the introduction of the human side of the Cenobites, but frankly it's the one fresh angle the filmmakers managed to come up with, to give the film whatever reason for existence it has.

I'm referring to, of course, the horrific scene of a mental patient slashing himself repeatedly with a straight razor to rid himself of the hallucination of being covered with bugs. The premise is that the mattress that Julia from the original film died on is possessed with her spirit, and that she needs blood to resurrect herself. Well, she gets plenty via the poor mental patient, who unloads buckets of it onto the mattress, thus bringing Julia screaming and dripping right out of the middle of it. It is a very difficult scene to watch; I have to give the director/producer credit for the sheer horror of it as is extremely effective. Definitely not for the squeamish!

But this had nothing. I think it sucked 1988 too, but maybe not as bad as it does if you see it today. I mean some of the effects used in this flick were a bit Star wars, but that has been done before and George Lucas did it much better in the 70's than Clive Barker would manage. Not even if he got private tutoring from Lucas himself. Really lame. Don't see it. Any other movie will do.

This movie is a must see if you enjoyed the first one ( and I can't imagine you haven't ). Hellbound is a logical continuing of the saga and begins almost immediately where the first one left off. Like its predecessor, it's a tale of pure terror. Like no other movies, the Hellraiser films create this nightmare world you sure don't want to be a part of...I didn't think it would be possible but Hellbound creates and even more morbid and dark atmosphere than Hellraiser. Images of pure horror are showed here and it certainly ain't a pretty sight from time to time. Gruesome make-up effects and clearly showed violence make this motion picture the prototype of pure horror. Add a powerful plot and some terrifying characters to that you got yourself a pure horrorfest and even a damn good movie in general.  Doug Bradley returns as the most charismatic horror icon ever created. Pinhead, the lead cenobite. Also the very beautiful Ashley Laurence is back to take up her role again as Kirsty. Too bad these movies were the only highlights in her career. I would have wanted to see a lot more of her. Hellbound takes place in hell for a large part, and it's shown as an endless labyrinth filled with deadly traps, unpleasant surprises and nightmarish visions. Actually, just like you fear it to be...SPOILERS...the story begins a few hours after the first film finished. Kirsty still is in shock and she's brought to a mental institution. Over there, Dr. Channard is in charge and he happens to be totally obsessed by the mysterious box. He manages to bring Julia (who died in part one ) back to life but in return for that he asks Julia to show him what Hell is really like. In the meantime, Kirsty still is convinced that she can bring back her father and, along with a mute girl called Tiffany, she faces the Cenobites again. Pinhead and his fellow Cenobites don't want to show any mercy no more but Kirsty has a plan to survive...END SPOILERS !!!In my point of view, Hellbound is the perfect horror. I admit there are some flaws to it ( and even a few mistakes ) but it's the ideal movie if you want to be scared, intrigued and fascinated by the more macabre aspects of cinema. I know Robert Ebert doesn't like it very much but what the HELL does he know about it ?!?Favorite rewind-scene  So many to choose from, but I'll certainly go for an early scene in the movie. Through a pan, the attic of Dr.Channard is shown. This attic contains all the victims Julia needed to become her old self again.

Unfortunately for her Julia (Clare Higgins) is back as well and after getting her skin back she sets out for Hell where we're going to have a battle. I know this film has a large group of fans but I'm certainly not one of them. I will admit that it's always a good idea to start a sequel soon after the events in the first film but to me everything that needed to be told was done so in the original and this film just comes off as something made in order to make more money. Again, I'm sure fans would say everything that happens here is logical and carries on the original story but I just don't see it that way. This sequel really doesn't start to nearly the forty-minute mark and that's because we get several recaps of the first film and we have to get all the characters from that film back in action. Once we get to Hell nothing really picks up as we get all sorts of bad special effects with fake looking zaps and lasers. I think the biggest problem with the film is its screenplay as you never really can tell where the movie is headed or what it's trying to do. It just seems like a film that shows us one ugly scene after another hoping that we take something from it but usually we never do. What the film does have going for it are the gore scenes, which there are plenty of and especially if you watch the unrated version. Gorehounds, such as myself, will at least be able to sit through everything for the gore as we get countless scenes of stabbings, cuttings, flesh ripping and various other forms of gore. The highlight of the film has to be the sequence where Julia comes back from the dead but even this here isn't nearly as good as the sequence in the original with Frank. The performances are decent if nothing overly great and the same can be said about the direction. This is far from one of the worst movies ever made as there's some decent stuff here and there but in the end I couldn't help but feel no one knew where this movie was headed and why we were even bothering to get there.

Basically in the early 1920's or 1930's Captain Elliot Spencer (Doug Bradley) was one of the few people to solve the puzzle box, and besides opening up the gates of Hell, for him the consequences were much worse, he was forced into the cube to be chained and have nails hammered in his head, so he was transformed into Cenobite leader Pinhead. It forwards to the present day, where Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) who survived the events of the last film, her father and twisted stepmother killed, and she has woken in a psychiatric hospital. Of course no-one believes her stories about what happened to the people in her house, so she is kept in the institute to try and rest and at some point be studied by strange psychiatrist Dr. Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham), who has been secretly studying the occult dimensions himself for years. One day hiding in his office, Channard's assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope) witnesses the doctor leading an innocent mentally ill patient to the blood covered bed sheet that Kirsty warned could bring her stepmother Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) back to life, and sure enough she is skinless and seeking more flesh to nourish herself. Kyle now believes Kirsty and plans to help her get out of the institute, but she knows the doctor will also plan to somehow bring back the Cenobites, and indeed he does this using innocent young semi-catatonic patient Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) who has a gift and incredible skill for solving puzzles, so she opens the puzzle box. Pinhead and the Cenobites, Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), The Female (Barbie Wilde) and Butterball (Simon Bamford) do not harm Tiffany because they know she was forced into releasing them, and Channard and Julia meanwhile travel through the passageways in the other dimension inside the cube, he is shown all sadomasochistic pleasures that await, before being turned into a Cenobite himself. Kirsty meanwhile also wanders through the maze to find her father, who she believes has been contacting her from beyond the grave from the Hell world, but in fact she discovers it was her uncle Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), and at that moment Julia arrives to kill him in revenge, by ripping his heart out. Kirsty and Tiffany manage to get out of Hell world Leviathon, but they realise the dark realm has begun to crossover with the real world, so they return to close the box from the inside, and transformed Channard wanting to seize control of everything tries to stop both them and the other Cenobites. In the fight the Cenobites are all killed and revert to their true human forms, and Julia returns momentarily to interfere, but the cube is closed, and Julia is revealed to be Kirsty wearing her skin, and they escape back to the hospital before the portal closes, of course in the end while they walk away free a final event occurs with the bloody mattress that will lead to events continuing in the next film. Also starring Oliver Smith as Mr. Browning and Deborah Joel as Skinless Julia. The monsters are just about as interesting as the previous film, especially Pinhead of course who we see the origin of and has all the philosophical dialogue, Laurence isn't quite as convincing as the heroine like she was before, the special effects to create the bloody torture and deaths is still worth watching, but the story is muddled, it is obviously more about the blood and body count, so while fans will be happy enough it is a slightly disappointing horror. Okay! "}]
