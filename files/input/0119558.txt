[{"Title":"Why Lyne's Lolita is Controversial","Date":"13 August 1998","Score":"136 out of 149 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  When the 1997 version of Lolita was widely censored in the US, many asked  why the reaction was so strong to this film.  After all, the novel was  published in the US in 1958, Kubrick's film version appeared in 1962, and  we hear more shocking tales of sexual depravity every day on the daytime  talk shows.  But after seeing Lyne's brilliant version of Lolita, I can  see how he manages to breathe fresh controversy into this familiar story.   Lyne's lascivious lens eroticizes Lolita's every movement and pose.  The  viewer is forced to see her through the eyes of Humbert and to feel his  obsession and desire.  We are co-conspirators in his crime, and at the end  we share his shame.  Rather than shocking us (and having us pull away in  revulsion), Lyne draws us in and makes us face the Humbert in ourselves.   This is an incredibly powerful film.

Although still disconcerting, the subject of pedophilia is far less shocking today than when the book was published almost 50 years ago.  Yet, despite the subject matter, the book was wildly popular because it was a literary work of art, beautifully written with some of the most splendid metaphors and descriptive narrative in American literature.  This was all the more amazing when one considers that English was Nabokov's second language.Director Adrian Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9 Â½ weeks, Indecent Proposal) is no stranger to stories with perverse sexual content.  His presentation of the story does the book justice although certain interpretations may not have been what Nabokov had in mind.  Lynn gives us a presentation that is very sympathetic to Humbert.  Nabokov's Humbert was very complex, partly a victim of his fixation on young girls, partly a sexual predator and partly a hopeless romantic.  Nabokov's Lolita was extremely innocent, just approaching the threshold of sexual curiosity and urges, more playful than consciously provocative.  While Nabokov hints at a mutual seduction, he leans far more heavily towards Humbert as the cause of the events even though Humbert is clearly helpless in the face of his obsession.  Lolita entered into the sexual relationship more as a result of longings burgeoning from her blossoming sexuality than a desire to seduce Humbert in particular, who was not even her first lover. Lynn's presentation transforms Humbert from the seducer into the seduced, whose weakness for young girls is manipulated by a sexually precocious siren tempting him to dash himself on the shoals of pedophilia.  Lynn portrays Lolita as the aggressor, an adolescent temptress who knows she is desired and simultaneously teases and entices him to do her lustful bidding, knowing he is powerless to resist.  Lynn's Humbert is more of a hapless romantic than a fiend, ennobling him as a victim of love rather than the confounded sociopath he really is.  In Lynn's version, Humbert becomes the fly to Lolita's spider.However, after the initial seduction when they take to the road, the film is very true to the book in chronicling the decay of the relationship, Humbert's further plunge into feelings of romantic desperation and Lolita's shrewish exploitation of him as she increasingly uses sex as a weapon.  The book was very effective at portraying the relationship as a symbiosis of two deficient beings, each selfishly taking from the other what was needed.  Lynn does an excellent job of portraying that here.  As the relationship degenerates, Lynn is effectual at portraying the ugly side of both characters.  The bitterness and rancor that results is compelling.  To his credit, he understands that Nabokov's story was more of a character study than a sex story and Lynn avoids the temptation of becoming too lurid, focusing instead on solid character development of two very flawed beings.I must take a moment to give Lynn the highest praise for his period renderings.  This is one of the finest portrayals of 1940's Americana I can remember.  The costumes, hairstyles, cars, furniture, locations and sets create a 40's reality that is like being hurtled back in a time machine.  The music is not just precise for the period, but it is perfectly integrated with the story.  As the two travel, the music changes to reflect the region.  Having Lolita dance and sing to period music on the radio is a nice touch because that is exactly what teenage girls of any era are apt to do.The acting is first rate all around.  When the film was made, Dominique Swain was 17, and although she looked young for her age, she could never pass for 12.  So for the first part of the film before Charlotte's demise, she is simply too mature.  However, for the road trip she is ideal.  Though I don't agree with Lynn's early interpretation of Lolita as the teenage temptress, I can't imagine it being done any better than the performance Swain delivers.  She is playful and provocative in a childlike manner, part pixie and part vamp.  Once they get on the road, Swain hits stride with a performance that is almost a force of nature.  She is powerful and intense, effortlessly moving back and forth between sweet innocence and the emotional torrent typified by the `murder me' scene.  It is an outstanding performance with depth and breadth that is very unusual for an actor so young.Jeremy Irons is wonderful as Humbert, giving him as amiable a personality as one could possibly imagine for a character with such vile intentions.  Irons injects a good deal of wry humor into the part in addition to giving Humbert an almost quixotic romantic quality.  Melanie Griffith is just the wrong actress to play Charlotte.  She looks nothing like the portly and plain character described in Nabokov's book.  Though her acting is fine and she is appropriately obsequious, she is far too attractive to be the repulsive troll Humbert despised.  It takes away from Humbert's desperation because it hardly seems like a great sacrifice to have married Charlotte to be near Lolita.Frank Langella (Dracula) is more obnoxious than mysterious as Quilty, making the audience want to exhort Humbert to pull the trigger as he confronts Quilty with the revolver.  Again, I think this is probably Lynn's doing since his vision is clearly that of a Humbert sympathizer.This is a fine film with great production values, terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book, even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks.

Lyne follows the original plot very closely, with few slight changes. Even the dialogues in many scenes remained exactly the same. Most of the movie is a flashback, but Lyne doesn't make the same mistake as Kubrick and he follows the correct order of events (Quilty's murder, i.e.).The casting is excellent. Jeremy Irons proved to be a much better choice than James Mason was in Kubrick's version. Irons delivers probably one of his best performances as he portrays the tragic character of Humbert Humbert. Iron's voice overs help us get into the mind of Humbert and understand his thoughts and actions. Dominique Swain is excellent as Lolita. She is the perfect nymphet. Young and innocent, but vulgar and crude at the same time. Frank Langella as Clare Quilty is a little bit too mysterious and he probably should've been a bit funnier, as his character was in Nabokov's book.The final reason why this movie is better than its predecessor is its photography. The colors are just amazing. They actually seem to follow the mood of the story - from excitingly colorful to tragically dark.I'm going to keep this user comment rather short. I could compare it to Kubrick's version some more, but it's easier if you just read my comment for Kubrick's Lolita.The highlight of the movie is definitely the last scene in which Humbert surrenders to the police - he stands on the top of a hill, listens to the voice of children playing and expresses his remorse for ruining Lolita's life. In this one scene, Lyne managed to capture the whole point of the book that Kubrick totally missed in his movie.The movie is a perfect 10. Just please go see it without any prejudice.

But the story in the book was incidental, just something on which Nabokov could hang his layered challenges to concepts of narrative. The narrator is crazy, overly colors and outright lies. The story never fully exists in the book at all, and such as it does one can never be sure what is true and what imagined. Humbert is a made up name (as are all names) and clearly the narrator makes up most of the elements of his own character as well (European, Professor, Author... obviously a joke by the narrator on Nabokov).In this film, everything makes sense, exactly the opposite of the reason the book exists. This is a beautiful film, with lovely detailed cinematography, good acting and great score, and all to solidify something that Nabokov created such that it could not be so. I believe that Peter Greenaway could make a good film of Lolita, and that he would have the courage to make it confusing and unerotic and unresolved. Why does Dolores' fate have to change in the film's epilogue? Because it ties up every last loose end. On Christmas Day no less!(The real scandal is not that audiences/censors are shocked by prurient subjects, but that they take one of the greatest literary achievements ever and make it explainable. Is this the only thing we can accept?)But take the film on its own presumption that the book's story is what matters. This Lolita is too old, too pretty and sexy, too controlling. Irons is clearly narrowly channeled here and he is smart enough to know it his frustration with the unimaginative stance of the film translates to a frustrated Humbert. I think Melanie is just right (just because HH calls her a cow means nothing). HH's violence with his previous wife should have been mentioned; her running away with the Russian cabbie is as much a setup for the Lolita fixation as the childhood dalliance, and better justifies the angst of loss. There should have been a few butterflies, and some explanation about the play that it was written to allude to that first night at the hotel.I highly recommend the audio tape version of Lolita. It is read by (guess...) Jeremy Irons! What he brings to the audio tape is the voice and phrasing of a man in a cell continually going over things in his own mind, embellishing and exaggerating and confusing and speculating and sometimes not at all sure about any of it. He brings this same voice to the voiceovers in the film, but it conflicts with the images which purport to represent a narrative stance of real truth.

While  staying pretty faithful to the original source, Stephen Schiff's screenplay  fleshes out the primary characters and their relationship, which plays out  as a taboo but reserved love story. Maintaining the central themes, the  plot is reduced to the essence of the major players and the linear events  of the book. It's almost impossible to adapt a long book into the confines  of a single average-length movie, but Schiff captures most of the important  moments quite well and humanizes the characters who could have come off as  bizarre depictions from Humbert's narrative.Lyne's movie is at once haunting, compelling, and beautifully photographed.  For all the controversy, it is a mature, reflective, and subtle film.  Lolita is a challenging piece of work that sublimely reflects the pathos  of the story and manages to retain bits of the complex humor of Nabokov.  This Lolita abandons the notion of being a complete social satire and  works as an essentially dramatic portrayal of a doomed, inappropriate  romance that is ultimately a sad, tragic tale.The performances are remarkable, especially those of Jeremy Irons and  Dominique Swain. Irons is utterly perfect as the ill-fated wretch, Humbert  Humbert. So understated but evocative with every move and gesture, he is  the definitive Old-World European whose obsession bristles beneath his  timorous demeanor. He evokes an incredible amount of sympathy for the  character. Swain delivers an on-target portrayal of the flowering nymphet  who toys with her burgeoning sexuality but hasn't overcome her fundamental  brattiness. Swain elicits both allure and pity as the wayward character  whose immaturity in mindset and behavior does not excuse her complicity in  her affairs. Despite what some critics may have written, Melanie Griffith  is fine in the small role as Lolita's overbearing mother. She is comically  obtuse, and her veneer hits all the right, grating notes. Frank Langella  rounds out the cast as the mysterious Quilty. He is appropriately shady,  vague, and sinister when he appears from time to time, slowly revealing  himself.This is a real winner on many levels and should be up for several awards  including best picture, director, actor, actress, and adapted screenplay.  Showtime should be congratulated for its smart acquisition. I hope the  movie finds its way to the largest possible audience.

It's actually an improvement.1. Quilty  Of all the things I did not like about the Kubrick version, it was Peter Sellers' quirkily irritating and totally unclear portrayal of this jerk.   The latest version completely downplays the character, other than to show that he is a dark, mysterious, monstrous person who keeps showing up in the shadows.   Also, it finally clarifies that Quilty is the very worst of Humbert... It is Humbert without a soul, conscience or any redeeming quality.  It becomes clear that he is truly a monster, and makes Humbert look almost saintly by comparison.2. Humbert and Lolita  While I enjoyed the chemistry between James Mason and Sue Lyon immensely, the chemistry between Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain is ten times better.  This is due mostly to Swain, who basically portrays a part of herself.   Her teasing and her battles with Irons are priceless and extremely believable.   Also, the Sue Lyon version showed Humbert going after an older teen, not as repugnant as the Dominique Swain version showing Humbert going after an actual underaged teen.  Also, in this version, most of the movie is about Humbert and Lolita, and their adventures, misfortunes and run from the law.3. Humbert himself  For the first time, we see the reason for his obsession, and it isn't entirely pedophilia, as in the case of Quilty. Irons is given many additional scenes to show the conflict between his better nature and his pedophile nature, to show that he understands that what he is doing is not only wrong but will be his downfall.4. The ending  I prefer the way it ended so much more in this later version.  First, Quilty finally, for the first time, comes out of the shadows, and we see him for his repulsive self.  Sellers' portrayal was too offbeat to allow us to despise this guy as he should be despised.  Also, the final fini is so downbeat so as to let you know in no uncertain terms that you have just witnessed a multiple tragedy.Adrian Lyne did an excellent job of directing, and the music of Ennio Morricone was a great help to the also excellent cinematography.

But I like both the Kubrick and the Lyne versions, with reservations.With Kubrick's, the only real problem is that it's not Nabokov. James Mason's performance contains the core of an accurate portrayal of Humbert, and he's often moving. But Sue Lyon was too old for her part and Sellers' Quilty is an altogether different conception from the author's (not that he isn't lots of fun). The film also suffers from having been filmed in the UK. Nabokov had a complex vision of America - vast, tacky, seductive, and grindingly mundane all at the same time - and this just can't be conveyed in a studio and with a few well-chosen locations.That's where Lyne's version excels. His compositions (or his cinematographer's) are indeed beautiful to look at, and (I think) capture suburban and roadside America very much the way Humbert would have experienced them. Irons is fine as Humbert, although the typecasting was initially painful to contemplate, and Swain is a vast improvement over Lyon as young Dolores still a bit too old for the part (an inevitable problem, perhaps, for anyone who wants to film this book), but her intelligent performance makes up for this. Despite his cheesy reputation, Lyne wisely refrains from making his Lolita a teenage bombshell, something the more artistic Kubrick couldn't resist.Again, however, the problem is Quilty. Both directors obviously felt compelled to render in three dimensions a character who is one of Nabokov's phantoms Does he really exist? Who is he and what do we know about him, outside of Humbert's increasingly paranoid imaginings? Can we trust anything at all that's said about him in this book? I expect that Nabokov himself regretted having to bring Quilty out of the shadows at all for the denouement.Sellers carried off the role with style, making you forget for a moment that his routines seem to have wandered in from another film. Lyne turns the final confrontation between Humbert and Quilty (there is no flashback framing device, as in Kubrick) into pure Grand Guignol, and so we have to endure watching poor, paunchy Frank Langella running down a hallway of his ridiculously overstuffed house, his bathrobe falling open to reveal his endowments to our embarrassed gaze before being blown away Dirty Harry-style by the avenging Humbert. A major wrong note to say the least.So Quilty, in the end, defeats both of Nabokov's filmic approximators. But if you love the book, see both movies Kubrick and Lyne each capture different aspects of the master's great story in valuable ways, and the new Lolita is clearly Lyne's best work yet, proving that a great novel can inspire excellent filmmaking, if not guarantee an ideal adaptation.What we really need now, however, is not a third version of Lolita, but finally, a filming of Lolita A Screenplay. Nabokov had fun writing this, and any fan of his should read his script as well. Wouldn't you like to see a move of Lolita in which Humbert, searching through the woods for his Lo, encounters a butterfly collector named Vladimir Nabokov? Of course you would!

The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the film is brilliantly acted. The content of the story may put off many prospective viewers, but the story does not condone Humberts actions, it simply narrates them. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, Humberts (Irons) loss of his young love scars him in a way which compels him to rediscover it, through relationships with young girls. He moves to a town to accept a teaching position and while looking for suitable housing he meets Lolita Haze (Swain), a young girl who immediately catches his eye and his heart. The rest of the film chronicles their tempestuous relationship, one in which Humbert takes advantage of Lolita's natural curiosity and developing mind and body.

I do think, however, that he did pinpoint one of the key components of the novel's genius a capturing of life on the newly paved highways of mid-century America.  As Humbert, Jeremy Irons is as good as his predecessor James Mason.  Frank Langella's interpretation of Quilty entirely diverges from the one given by Peter Sellers (and rightfully so; who wants to compete with Sellers?).

This is high souled genius if you ask me with a fervent faith that art is a divine game. and that pleasure in art consists in following the moves of the game with the artist himself when he communicates his own playful and Godlike bliss. Poet and pervert, Humbert becomes obsessed with twelve year old Lolita and seeks to possess her, first physically and then artistically, out of love. The magic of nymphets. This is a dizzying seduction, a masterpiece in a strange dimension, very rich. Lolita is a major work in fiction, equally intense as wildly funny. A Medusa's head with trick paper snakes chewing gum.

Bombarded by gratuitous sex, reckless violence and distracting special effects, critics often dismiss today's features by simply saying, `They're too Hollywood.' To some extent this is true, but we must not reject all current day films.  In fact, 1997's Lolita is an example of a current day film that is superior to the original motion picture release of Vladmir Nabokov's controversial novel.  One could even argue that the modern version is less Hollywood, since every American distributor refused to show the film. Regardless, 1997 version's supremacy is due in part to the depth at which Jeremy Irons is able to take our darling pedophiliac, Humbert Humbert. Irons' portrayal is magnetic due to his depth of character, which is seen both in his sincerity to real life and his truth to Nabokov's writing.A flashback in the beginning of the 1997 movie portrays a fourteen-year-old Humbert's doomed summer romance to Annabel, which sets up Irons' Humbert as a brokenhearted romantic.  Thus, when he sees Lolita for the first time, lying out in the grass of the &#145;piazza,' innocently letting the water from the sprinkler drench her, the reincarnation of that love is clear. That clarity, however, transcends the simple addition of the flashback.  Unlike James Mason, the 1962 Humbert Humbert, Irons' startling licentious stare at Lolita is that much comprehensive.  In those eyes the viewer sees tenderness with wickedness, occupation without realization, a moment of pure lust.  The amorous connection is developed in that one look-whereas Mason's look at his Lolita is obvious and plain-Lolita is a beautiful girl, the look shows a man seeing something beautiful.  Irons not only sees beauty but he perversely sees a sexual creature, correctly identifying the perplexing issue for the reader and viewer of Lolita&#133; While his love is based on pedophilia, is there something in his love for Lolita that is common to all love?  His intoxication is precisely what makes the story of Lolita so fascinating-Humbert's love for Lolita is as real as anyone's love for another, and the perverse thing is that he truly madly deeply loves a child.  Mason fails to show the depth of love that Irons easily does in the first meeting.From the first meeting on, Irons is true to the version of Humbert Lynne and Schiff prescribe.  Unlike the 1962 version, we see those rare moments of ease with Lolita delighting her with stories as they swing on the porch, the rapt, nearly bashful smile he gives her while she sits in his lap showing him how she can make her chin wiggle. Irons's Humbert is heartbreaking.  He is tortured.  He is helpless.  Despite those scenes when Humbert is buying affections from Lolita with a jar full of coins, despite his heavy authority over her activities, Irons never let's the viewer lose sight of his complete and utter dependence on Lolita.  Although Lynne and Schiff's version seems void of the cunning that is so very much a part of the literary Humbert, the essential question is the same Who was in control of the situation?  Lolita or Humbert?  Who is more to blame for the affair? Through possibility of empathizing with Humbert's love for Lolita, the viewer is left with an unnerving understanding of his pedophilia.  Unlike Mason, Irons makes it almost impossible to completely detach our knowledge of what love is from the perverse love between Humbert and Lolita.Being true to a character, as in being true to a book, means that an actor catches the essence from the book, not necessarily the exact phrasing or the exact chronology of events.  Irons catches Humbert Humbert's tenderness and the true infatuation that is so evident in his confessions, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.

After seeing this remade version, I came away satisfied.  Hearing what countless critics had to say has never changed my view.  Of course, it can never come even close to the novel, but watching Lyne's version unfold in quiet and somber light brought to mind the exact same feelings I was experiencing reading the book.   Certain things did bother me.  Lolita's mother in particular.  Hearing Melanie Griffith deliver lines as if she were reading to a group of school children set my teeth on edge, although she went down in fine style.  And having the sole reason for Humbert's obsession with nymphets wrapped up in one neat reason(Annabel) was also hard to swallow. But Dominique Swain was nearly the perfect picture of the Lolita in my mind. Wistful, vulnerable, and a fierce manipulator all at once, it's hard to believe she'd never had acting experience beforehand.  Perhaps a bit too old in certain lights, she still managed to carry off a difficult role and steal every scene she was in, much like Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls.  Certain expressions were incredibly poignant. (Think of Lo's face when Humbert denied permission to be in the play.  Think of her lipstick smeared smile after being caught going out when Humbert went to the market). The essence of this movie is what formed my opinion that this was a good film.  The pacing, the comparison to Kubrick didn't matter when the mood of the entire film was left.   Maybe the critics are right, and I'm missing something.

At times I suspected some scenes had been inserted to appease a contemporary sensibility but, on checking, I found they were all in the book.I generally prefer this Lolita to Kubrick'e version, but both versions raise an interesting question.It is a presumption of cinema that any novel can be satisfactorily filmed. Lolita casts doubt on this.The problems can be illustrated by a small, but crucial, change that both films make to the book. When Humbert first meets Lolita she is 12. In the movies she is 14 and is played by actresses who were 15 and 16 respectively.Objectively, this change shouldn't matter under age is under age. In practice it does. When you see a 14 or 15 year-old, you can see the woman she is about to become. When you see a 12 year-old you can only see the child. Raising Lolita's age makes Humbert seem less perverse than Nabokov intended and James Mason and Jeremy Irons both make him too sympathetic.All Nabokov needed to write Lolita was a typewriter and some paper. To film it, Kubrick and Lyne needed a young actress. Jodie Foster, Nathalie Portman and Lindsay Lohan all show that it would have been possible to find a 12 year-old actress good enough to carry the movie - but should she be asked to? If it was absolutely necessary to have a 12 year-old in order to make this movie, then most people would say Don't make it then.But this is only part of a wider issue.Nabokov wanted to put readers inside the head of a paedophile without them endorsing his actions empathy doesn't necessarily imply sympathy. His first attempt was The Enchanter (which gave us the word nymphet). It was written in the third person. Nabokov was unhappy with it and it was only published after his death.Lolita was written in the first person and that changed everything.The book is Humbert's own testimony. He wants to present himself as a sensitive aesthete a romantic lost soul surrounded by dull, uncomprehending Philistines. He charts his seedy obsession in elaborate, over-ripe 'poetic' prose, trying to draw the reader into his self-delusion, but we soon come to doubt the truth of what he is telling us. He can't help letting us see through his self-serving narrative to glimpse the murky reality that lurks beneath. Lolita is in real distress and is being profoundly corrupted by this unhealthy relationship.Humbert's nymphet fantasy soon starts to crumble before the reality of a troubled, wilful, increasingly manipulative child. Then he finds himself haunted by the ominous shadow of Clare Quilty, who we come to realise is his dark alter ego (Humbert's doubled name is a fairly obvious clue to Nabokov's intentions). Humbert is the doomed romantic he wants to be seen as Quilty is the evil sexual predator he really is. Inevitably, it is Quilty that wins the battle for Lolita.Eventually, Humbert emerges from his pubescent fixation and has a relationship with an adult woman, so when he finally meets Lolita again he is able to see (and love) her as a real person. But it is too late. At this point, there is nothing left for him to do but finally kill off his evil doppelganger and then die himself.The point of Lolita, therefore, is not just in the the events it depicts, but in the particular way it depicts them. It is not only a story it is a specific literary device. I think this presents an insoluble problem for a film-maker.I doubt if there is a cinematic equivalent to Nabokov's mendacious first person narrative. Cinema only really works in the third person and is a very literal medium 'the camera doesn't lie'. When Hitchcock used a misleading flashback in Stage Fright people were outraged and even film critics, who should have known better, complained about the deception.Kubbrick and Lyne can both show us that the real Lolita is a far cry from Humbert's idealised nymphet but we are always seeing the disturbing reality itself, rather than that reality filtered through the haze of Humbert's prevarications.Kubrick tried to defuse the problem by playing up the humour. The first hour, in which Shelley Winters's Charlotte vamps the stiff, repressed Humbert to his considerable discomfort, mines the humour of embarrassment. Then Kubrick lets Peter Sellers loose to do a series of virtuoso comic turns. They are great, but overload the picture. Kubrick's Humbert is constantly being harried and badgered and in the end is less a sexual predator than a hapless victim. I don't think the movie works and Kubrick seemed to agree. He often talked about remaking it.Adrian Lyne uses the voice-over to give us more of Humbert's oily verbosity and he can be much more frank about the true nature of this deplorable relationship. But, again, we are spectators of events as they actually occur, rather than as Humbert wants us to see them, and the greater frankness only compounds the problems. Although his version is better in many respects than Kubrick's, it is even more uncomfortable to watch.Because of the nature of the medium in which they were working, Kubrick and Lyne both ended up making The Enchanter, not Lolita.I am not suggesting that it was wrong to make these movies. Film-makers should be free to tackle any subject that intrigues them - and it is not a crime to fail. It is just that the problems inherent in some books are so great it is unlikely there will be any solutions to them. Perhaps there are some challenges that film-makers should just decline.I suspect Lolita is one of them.

A self-obsessed flamboyant character, with a taste for doing dirty deeds to reach his goals. Humbert in the book doesn't love Lolita. Not her character anyway. He is a man sexually obsessed with her looks and her age, not her personality, which he complaints time after time in the book. The Humbert character in the book was a lot closer to Clare Quilty then the 1997 movie makes it seem.This film makes Jeremy Irons's Humbert a tragic traumatized drama character full of guilt and despair. A tragic romantic lonesome man with a broken heart and basically a good person besides one little flaw.Then Lolita in the book. Lolita in the books 12, and basically not much different from your average girl in the early days of puberty. Experimenting with the power of sexuality? Yes. Slutty? No. Lolita in the book is just a girl who got into this situation by accident, and tries all that she can for her young age to stay alive.The Lolita in the book is not the sexualized naughty teenager we see in the media. That was the result of various forms of media exploitation.The Lolita in the book didn't have any blond or red braids or pigtails, and didn't wear sailor or any other stereotype outfits.The Lolita in the book was girl with dark brown bobbed hair, and a honey tanned skin, with a polka-dot bikini. However, the 1997 film portrayed Lolita the way she's been portrayed as a stereotype teenage hussy in the sex industry as well as the regular media. With her reddish blond braids and pigtails, stereotypical child-girl outfits and average ordinary sleazy teenage character, the Lolita played by Dominique Swain is NOTHING like the character in the book. Neither by look or by character. Then Clare Quilty in the book was described as a charismatic artist. Ultimately a dangerous wealthy pervert, but he was never described as a dirty old man. Clare Quilty in the book was a Humbert with a bigger house and more money.Clare Quilty in this movie is portrayed as the audience of today expects it. The Marc Dutroux type of sick dirty pig-like maniac.I thought this movie was good at the point when i hadn't read the book, but after i read the book, i thought is was a failure.I dislike it because when it came out, the production team and every newspaper and article claimed that this movie was made absolutely faithful to the book. When i read the book, i found out that is was all but faithful to Vladimir Nabokov's book.Kubrick's film may have been a bit shy and tame, but it was closer to the heart and soul of Nabokov's novel. It didn't hide important key elements of Humbert's twisted personality.Before you watch this movie, read the book. After you've seen this movie, read the book again.

This movie is a closer adaptation of Nabokov's book than the Kubrick version. One flaw of the Kubrick film was that it begins with the end and gives away crucial plot points and takes away suspense. In the Lyne version, the scene at the beginning takes place again near the end but this time, it reveals nothing. Dominique Swain is excellent as the title character. She looks and acts the part of the nymphet that Sue Lyons could have never have pulled off. Some have suggested that Miss Swain was too old to play a 12 year old child, but Dolores Haze is not 12 for the whole book. A good portion of the novel takes place after she is 12. When they are on the road, she is 13. When she is in the all girl's school, she is 14. She is 17 at the end. The movie is not without flaws however. Some scenes of humor with Irons falls flat. I found Melanie Griffith to be very annoying but then again Lolita's mother was suppose to be. Thankfully she's only on screen for a short time.Lolita is shown eating bananas in the movie. Besides the phallic references, the bananas were used because the inspiration for Lolita came when Nabokov read a newspaper article about the first monkey to paint a picture (or so he claims.) The scientist gave him the tools to draw and the first thing he drew was the bars of his cage.I can't say that this version of Lolita is better than the Kubrick version, they each contain what the other misses. Kubrick's version contains the humor that Lyne's version is lacking while Lyne's version contains the sadness that Kubrick missed. Including reading Lolita, I would recommend that the viewer get both films. For Lolita, is both a satire and a sad story rolled into one. The two films in a way compliment each other.

My grandmother gave me a copy of the book when I was eighteen. I had never heard of the masterpiece, but it is Lolita, the novel, which ignited my passion for brilliant prose and Lolita remains my favorite book.Why can't the book be filmed? Let's see. In the Kubrick version from 1962, Lolita is sixteen; in Lyne's (this) version, she is fourteen. In the novel, she is twelve. 1997 and Lolita is still two years older than she was in the novel. The real-life difference between twelve and fourteen is enormous. About the last thing I want to see is a twelve year-old girl and a middle aged man making out on screen. I don't suggest that a fourteen year-old girl and a middle aged man is acceptable. Nor sixteen and middle aged. The point is that this literary masterpiece simply needs to be read to be appreciated; if a faithful rendition of the novel is to be made, it would be kiddie porn. It would also have to be ten or twelve hours long. And really, the sickness of Humbert, his blighted lust and love for small girls, isn't even what the book is about. The book was written with venom, yet venom so rich and esoteric that it only makes us hate Humbert more than we already do, yet a measure of sympathy does emerge, and more so in the two films than the novel. Nabokov wrote the book, knew it was a gamble, knew it would be censored and above all, knew it would be talked about by EVERYBODY. He wrote the book in order to achieve financial independence and to say that he succeeded is a masterpiece of understatement. The anger I refer to is Nabokov's contempt for cruelty (yes, contempt) in any form. Dolores Haze is ruined by a depraved animal; America is roasted slowly over fire on a spit. And never has America been ravaged so exquisitely! Okay, I needed to mention all that. The actual film is wonderfully photographed and Frank Languella, as Quilty, deserved a Best Supporting Oscar. Jeremy Iron's narration is hypnotic and outstanding; Domonique Swain is quite good given the circumstances. Sue Lyon had far more censorship problems in 1962 than did Swain in 1997, and Swain is thoroughly believable. However, the pedophile aspect can never be overcome, neither can the richness of Nabokov's prose be transmitted visually to the screen with consistency--and THIS, even more than the kiddie angle, is the primary reason why a GREAT Lolita will never appear on a silver screen. I can think of two brief exceptions to this, no more. In my favorite scene, where Quilty uses word-play to terrorize Humbert, the zapping of the insect killer, the purple sparks, the tone of Quilty's voice, his expressions (sleep is a rose, the Persians say) are pure Nabokov, and this scene is superb. The other Lolita book-like part of the film, and a close second to the above scene, is Humbert's murder of Quilty. Quilty eats cigarettes, he spouts richly literate nonsense, a piano covered with blood keeps playing--it is also superb, this scene.But the rest of it, and honestly the film is about as good as one could make of the novel, is hit or miss. In the Kubrick version, Shelly Winters, of whom I tend to be no fan, is impeccable. Melanie Griffith, in this one, is flat-out AWFUL! I wanted her dispatched long before she had been. Of course she is supposed to be vapid, but shrieking literally half of her dialogue isn't necessary to achieve this end.Lyne did a good job and I would recommend this film.

I admit James Mason was good in the original and so was Shelley Winters but you just can't do an American road movie in Britain. Kubrick's badly-judged, conservative and unfunny adaptation was frankly rather poor. Adrian Lyne, formerly known for less than scintillating films such as Flashdance and Fatal Attraction, has done an excellent job of bringing Nabakov's difficult and challenging novel to the screen. He has chosen to stick fairly closely to the original plot and he has managed to walk the difficult tightrope of balancing the story of Humbert Humbert's obsession with the satire of American life observed. The production values are astonishingly high and would shame the sterile efforts of the average frock movie hack. I was utterly convinced that this was 1940's America and the sets, the locations, the clothes, the props were all so believable I wanted to walk right into the film and live there. In fact this was probably also the film's most vulnerable point &#x96; at times it looked so good that it could have been an advert.Jeremy Irons recorded an unabridged audiobook version of the original novel and it's well worth seeking out. I'd heard this first and found it almost impossible to imagine anyone else in the part than Irons. He is the right age. He has the right air of naivete and doom and the gravity to deliver the lines required without sounding silly. In many ways it is the same character he played in Damage and indeed this has many resonances with Damage. Dominque Swain is perfectly cast, having the look of a child and the look of a woman at the same time. Her acting is astonishingly good and she ought to go on to greater things if this film doesn't ruin her like the first version ruined Sue Lyon's career. And yes, she is incredibly sexy and yes, Adrian Lyne has gone out of his way to make her appear sexy often using low camera angles and lingering shots of her legs and shoulders and face and whatever else he could get away with to make the point. Why should this be a surprise? This is Humbert's story and if the director can't make us feel the passion that Humbert feels for Lolita then he wouldn't be doing his job. Frank Langella must also get an honourable mention for his role as Quilty, a part badly misjudged by Kubrick when he cast Peter Sellers in the role.A certain amount of hysteria surrounds this film, often stirred up by the popular press. However, rest assured that if you weren't a child molester before you saw Lolita you won't be one after you see it, any more than you will become a Jedi knight after watching Star Wars.

Tragedy in the sense that it dares more than Kubrick's film did (which I believe has nothing to do with the censorship in the 60ties), because director Lyne isn't interested in sexually or provocatively exploiting the relationship between Humbert (a marvelous Jeremy Irons) and Lolita/Dolores (Dominique Swain), he makes it sort of enigmatic, carefully lingering and beautiful. More faithful to the novel, the film successfully achieves the great character nuance of the civilized and sophisticated Humbert Humbert, and the way he falls completely in love with such a obnoxious and difficult child, who's at the same time such an alluring, facetious and sexual creature. Another stronghold for the film in its dignity as an adaption of the novel, is Ennio Morricone's sweepingly romantic and classic score. It may just be a notch better than Kubrick's film, and for me personally, as an adaptation of the novel, it also rings more true.

There is a reason why the novel is as acclaimed as it is, and almost everything that was good in the novel transfers well to screen.Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert gives us a character that is hopelessly, but sympathetically, obsessed.  Many people have a problem with the age difference between Humbert and Lolita, but as is explained in the beginning, Humbert has reasons in his past to be fixated on nymphets.  It's a given that Humbert is not mentally stable, and his behavior is never shown as right, but as the product of his instability.  Dominique Swain is the perfect Lolita...capable of the sensuality of a full-grown woman, but just as capable of a temper tantrum.The filming of this movie is exquisite...I love the quick shots that are designed to make you feel what Humbert is feeling (e.g. their first kiss). Not only that, but there are some scenes that seem capable of defining the word sensual.The thing that I love most about this movie is, of course, the love story. I'm a hopeless romantic, and the love that Humbert has for his Lolita never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  You can feel Humbert's inner anguish at the situation, and at his helplessness to change it.

The two interpretations, while both more or less faithful to the material, differ widely in tone. Where Kubrick's film is witty, cerebral and detached, Lyne's is passionate and emotionally driven.Lyne's version is undoubtedly more erotic in tone than Kubrick's. Obviously, the time in which the two films were made is a factor here. More modern sensibilities allowed a younger Lolita and far more sensuality than would likely have been permitted 35 years earlier. This version has drawn some criticism for making Humbert a bit too sympathetic, for making Lo seem too much a seductress. These criticisms are perhaps valid, but there is an artistic advantage We are seeing this story now through the simultaneously Quixotic and monstrous eyes of Humbert. We aren't given the luxury of watching this one from Kubrick's usual emotional distance nor of seeing Lo portrayed by a woman who is clearly of legal age. As a result, the scenes are both more disturbing and more powerful.In truth, Kubrick's film is probably more in keeping with Nabokov's witty and almost facetious tone. The characterization of Clare Quilty is a perfect example. In Kubrick's film, Quilty is portrayed by the legendary comic actor Peter Sellers, who captures perfectly the witty wordplay of Quilty. Frank Langella's Quilty had a silky-smooth and sinister-sounding deep voice, but somehow his relatively straight-laced performance seemed out of step with the almost vaudevillian lines he uttered.For me, though, this actually is a point in Lyne's favor. For Nabokov's Lolita seemed at times to devolve into literary word-play until the story itself seemed merely a hat rack for Nabokov to hang his verbal wit upon. This film instead focuses on the aspects of the novel that have led it be called the only convincing love story of our century by Vanity Fair.Jeremy Irons gives a magnificent performance as Humbert. Much as he did in Dead Ringers, he gives the impression of someone who combines deviance and vulnerability seamlessly. Dominique Swain was marvelous as Lo/Delores, combining carefree pixie, traumatized victim, and wily seductress into a complex and convincing character. Langella and Melanie Griffith were, I fear, miscast as Quilty and Charlotte Haze respectively.

A voice-over can maybe give us some of it -- that famous first paragraph -- but the problem is that there is such mellifluous gamy prose on every single page. (I think there are only about three sections in which Humbert doesn't undercut his expressions of love and guilt with irony.) How can we transpose HH's offhand rhetorical remarks like, Where is the rapist in therapist? Where is the jest in majesty? And that's not to mention all of the literary allusions or comic references to pop culture.The story itself is so simple that, if Lolita weren't twelve years old, it would be just another love story. And, I was, by the way, surprised when this film was released at the horror some people felt -- oh, my gosh, a movie about pedophilia. I mean -- in this day and age? Movies about thinly disguised pedophilia of course have been around for years -- Sundays and Cybele, Pretty Baby, among others. And the Shirley Temple movies may not have been all that innocent either, she prancing about in those tiny skirts reeking of popcorn and lollipops, wagging her tail, a forty-year-old midget for all we know. And if we think of Lolita as innocent and corrupted, we don't know as much about what's happening with kids that age as we might like to think. This is a story about pedophilia in the way that Faust is a story about Satanism. Jeremy Irons is superb here, as he is in almost everything he's done. One can't help comparing this version to Kubrick's earlier one, and this one isn't as good. Dominique Swain is no Lolita. She's an improvement over Sue Lyons, to be sure, but not actress enough to break a grown man's heart, or to project that peculiar combination of meanness, crudity, and ultimate loneliness that Lolita embodied. Melanie Griffith does what she can with the role of Charlotte Haze but I thought Shelley Winters brought a bit of additional, maybe unintended vulgarity to the part. Griffith is serene and self-confident, which is closer to the Charlotte of the novel, but for unashamed raw hunger nobody can beat Winters.The direction is competent, not much more than that. But this is a hollow movie. It fails to capture the outrageous humor of the novel (I was a pentapod monster....). The score is lugubrious. The photography gloomy where the novel is filled with summer warmth, aspens, butterflies and sunshine. In other words, the movie treats the novel as a masterpiece, deserving serious treatment, which is the kiss of death for Lolita. Like Strick's attempt to film Ulysses, all the humor is lost and what's left is a kind of humdrum story about people talking to one another without having that much to say. But if you are interested in unusual love stories I can recommend seeing this. See Kubrick's piece as well. They're rather different, because Kubrick, maybe realizing he could never capture the wisecracks in the novel, at least brought in Peter Sellers to provide laughs. But here, Quilty, Frank Langella, is little more than an ominous shadowy presence, whereas both in the novel and in Kubrick's film he was a terrible and hilarious tease.

She's the whole package of Lolita cheeky, innocent, flirtatious, and soon to be manipulated and corrupted, by a playwright/pedoarse, (Langella, hauntingly evil) who's a bad turn of fate upon Irons in the finale. Swain is up against some stiff acting competition, like her older lover, Irons, her strict and selfish mother, Griffith, really impressive, and of course Langella as I mentioned before, who cringes like a toad, for his sins, in the finale which I really liked. This time around, Lolita has been done more visually, with more plotting and life poured into it's characters, sorry Stanley, although that vivid sunbaking scene, to whet your whistle, I never got out of my head. It was easy to see, the controversy that burst out from the public, accusing it of promoting pedophilia, where there was one or two scenes with our leads stark, making love, that actually bordered on crossing that line. Adrian Lynne, of course renowned for that 86 hit, Nine And A Half Weeks (god that was a long time ago) has done us proud here, or remade us proud here.

He is attracted to the landlady's nymphet daughter, Lolita.One has to be an artist, mad enough to choose the devil, the nymphet in the group of schoolgirls, he reflects. For some reason, Dominique Swain, while at times sensual, comes off as lanky and silly in some scenes. Perhaps this was the directors intent to further demarcate the age difference, although Jeremy Irons slips into the role in a believable, somewhat humorous sense, scarcely believing his luck that the young seemingly innocent child is more promiscuous than he has ever been.The early scenes with Melanie Griffith as Lolita's frazzled mother are amusing, she gives a good performance as lonely widow wanting Professor Humbert to herself. She sends Lolita to camp, Humbert is beside himself. There is an amusing scene where he visits his physician asking for a prescription to knock out a cow so he will not be disturbed while sleeping in the marital bed. Mrs. Hayes finds the disparaging comments Humbert has made about her in a diary, lashes out at Humbert and dies in a tragic accident.Be careful what you wish for, Nabokov (book author) seems to be telling us. Now, Professor Humbert has Lolita all to himself. He takes her cross country after he breaks the news that her mother has died in hospital. Lolita accedes to his wishes, in bed, and becomes his obnoxious travel companion.Her childish pranks begin to grate on Humbert and things begin to unravel. Admittedly the side story with Quilty (Frank Langella) doesn't work as well as it could have, although Langella always does have an interesting and sinister presence.Overall recommended, as Irons gives another good performance here, the girl could have been cast a bit differently, however. That said, also watch the early Stanley Kubrick film with James Mason, Shelley Winters and Sue Lyon, as Lolita. Also read the book for a better framework from which to view the varied film versions. 8/10.

While the story is both disturbing and distressing, the moral dilemma each of these characters find themselves in becomes one of true fascination. Perhaps reading Nobokov's novel is essential to better understanding where Humbert is coming from with this undeniable love and so I would highly recommend the read (the prose flows) as this is a beautifully tragic human story that should be felt.Truly faithful to its source, I was impressed with the high production value, the cinematography and haunting score composed by Ennio Morricone.

How can you ever beat a Kubrick? Well, this version doesn't exactly beat the better Kubrick version but it simple is a real great movie on its own nevertheless, that really deserves to be seen.This version is of course somewhat different from the 1962 Stanley Kubrik movie and as far as I understood, this version stays actually closer to the actual Vladimir Nabokov novel. What this movie does is trying to explain why Humbert Humbert likes them younger, while I believe in the Kubrick movie he isn't interested in Lolita at all in the beginning and actually tries to fight it but finally falls for her fatal seductions. In this movie they both want each other from basically the moment they see each other.It perhaps also makes this version more sensual, although it's not very hard to be more sensual than a movie that got made back in the early '60's. This version is also more sensual due to both Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. There is nothing wrong with James Mason and Sue Lyon but Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain have a better natural chemistry together. And while Frank Langella ain't no Peter Sellers, he does a good job in his role, even though his role is rather restrained in the movie, which is a sort of a waste of such a fine character and actor such as Frank Langella.It simply is its fine and also controversial story that makes this movie such a great one. I like movie don't portray things as being black and white. A pedophile is not just a pedophile and this movie shows how a seemingly normal man with a respectable profession falls for a 14-year old girl. When you read about a story like this in the paper you tend to see; 'What a creep!' or 'how sick!'. Real life however of course isn't as simple and black and white as you would read about in the papers. It's a multi-layered story with complicated characters, feelings and emotions.Adrian Lyne once more shows that he is a real capable director. He doesn't make an awful lot of movies but when he does it's often something really good. The movie has a good style although the movie made me wonder why they didn't attempted to give the story a more modern update. I mean, there basically is no reason for this movie to be set in the '40's. He lays the emphasis mostly on the two main characters, which does go at the expense of the other characters obviously but it's a choice he made and did not worked out all too bad I must say. Really a movie worth seeing. Give it a change, even if you known that it just simply can't beat the 1962 Kubrick version.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A Great Film That Will Find Its Audience","Date":"9 August 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Perhaps the best film of its year, this Lolita is everything Kubrick's wasn't.

Sad and haunting with a real monster not a Sellers clown (although some will say that Kubricks's Quilty is more faithful to the book, there is no menace in him and yes, Langella's Quilty does have a measure of whimsy (many monsters do).For those of you who are going to use big words like pedophilia, take the time to understand the pathology. Humbert is NOT a pedophile, his love of Lolita never changed (did you see the ending?) heavy with another man's child, I loved this Lolita. When his child-love died, he too died. Emotionally the man remained a boy (did you see the beginning?)but I continued to search for her, I should have joined the priesthood. A pedophile would have had no use for an adult Lolita. His killing of Quilty was a violent rejection of such monsters. The killing didn't need to be included, Humberts final admission in spite of his love for Lolita was justice enough. Victims aren't we all, Eric Draven's words were written for these tragic characters.Had Lolita demanded that Humbert wait until she was of age, he gladly would have. She was the lost child, his love, his life. In a country that cherishes the on screen butchering of children and finds entertainment in watching predators ply their trade (we justify it by their being caught on Dateline), we have consigned this beautiful, sad film to the graveyard of the censures.But...This film will find its way like so many before it. The American film-goer is the one cheated. And yes, the film contains one of Grand Maestro Morricone's greatest scores.

It is an effective film in the sense that Adrian Lyne makes us see the appeal of Lolita, but at the same time makes us understand that we could never be attracted to her. It all bottles down to Humbert's (Irons) past experiences and his subconscious search for a 'child' he loved and lost when he was young, finding this child in Lolita and obsessing about her.Lyne introduces a narrative by Humbert in Lolita, which is a vital device to the story, because seeing things from his perspective, he becomes something of a lovable pedophile. We feel for him. Everyday of his life after meeting this young girl, he is consumed with love for her and this is captured beautifully in the film through long visual shots. Their relationship is certainly an illicit affair - and it definitely feels like it from a viewer's perspective. All the kissing, fondling, cuddling, the looks - it gets rather intense and very uncomfortable at times. Lolita is arguably one of the least likable characters in film history; she is an ill-mannered, manipulative attention-whore who knows the power she has over Humbert and uses it to her advantage for money, attention and just generally to hurt people. I have not read the book, but I understand she was a bit more subtle in it - intelligent, witty. In this film she reeks of Britney-like schoolgirl sucking on lollipops and chewing on jawbreakers. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that this would make her more accessible to late 20th century audiences. It's wildly stupid.While the film has plenty of powerful passages, it is far too long. It really drags on toward the end so as to do the book more justice by adding pseudo-depth to it. Film is a different medium, so I think Lyne should have had a bit more fun with the script - not as much fun as Kubrick did with his version (which was unbearably silly), but lighten up just a bit. I cannot pinpoint any more negative aspects to 'Lolita' (1997), but I know there clearly are some because I was not too crazy about the film when I saw it.7/10 "},{"Title":"Great acting and a great film","Date":"28 August 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Having seen neither this nor the Kubrick version of Lolita, a few weeks ago, I started to wonder, if the films are really as great as they are made out to be; so, after reading as much as I could about both films, I finally bought this film on DVD. After having watched it, I was very impressed, both by the acting and the overall film quality. The theme is based on the well-known novel of the same name, by Russian author, Vladimir Nabokov. I found it very well-presented; unlike what you might expect, you don't loathe or despise Irons' character. You may find some of his actions disturbing, perhaps even disgusting. But you understand him, and you sympathize with him. The plot is great, it evolves at a very good pace, rarely standing still at any point. I don't think there was any point during the film where I was bored. The acting is great; Jeremy Irons gives a stellar performance, as do Melanie Griffith, Frank Langella and Dominique Swain. Of all those, I think it was actually Swain who impressed me the most; maybe it's because this was her first film, and she didn't have any acting experience. Or maybe it's because, well, despite knowing that she was very young when she made this film, I was, just like Irons' character, Humbert, attracted to her. Her performance as Lolita is amazing. The cinematography is very good, at times great. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The characters are well-written and credible. The amount of humor in the film, however little it may be, was good. It helped the viewer ease into the somewhat uncomfortable subject of the film. The climax of the film is great; despite being hinted at, throughout the film, it came as a surprise, and truly sent a chill down my spine. Now, as I mentioned early on in this review, I have not seen Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita; I have not read the book, either. Therefore, I can't really say if this is an accurate depiction of the story or not. But I found it to be a very good piece of cinema, and I suspect most people interested in the subject would too. I recommend this to fans of any of the actors, possibly Nabokov's novel, and/or people who are interested in the subject matter. I will advise anyone who sees it, though, to be prepared; the film is quite explicit, and some will definitely take very much offense from it.

Indeed, this film could never have been made as a studio picture. Maybe it's precisely an under-appreciated director like Lyne who could go his way and make the film as it should have been made in the first place. Going through making-ofs and audio commentaries, one realizes that Lyne was actually doing something he can never do again. He was temporarily insane and had an I MUST make this film passion that transformed the film into something more than just an adaptation.Of course, he couldn't go wrong. At least not with a team like Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain and Ennio Morricone.By no means does the film reach the heights of the book - and that would pretty much be an impossible task anyway - but what the film does so well is capture the essence of Humbert's doomed love. Kubrick's Lolita is wonderfully witty and funny and, fair enough, that was also an important part of Nabokov's book - but that version lacked all the beauty that the most beautiful subject in the world (doomed love) deserves.Sadly, Lyne's masterpiece has now been forgotten - as if it never existed and Kubrick's Lolita is still considered as the definitive version of the book.I will definitely always defend Lyne's version.

Because this one abduction seems the way Humbert Humbert feels about his childhood love taken from him. And also, something which I have never read elsewhere before is that Typhoid in etymology means a.o. things Hazy, a term that frequently in this book alludes to Lolita's last name Haze (or something that rhymes on it).

I'll be on half.com to order all of Nabokov's English-written and English-translation stories - what a writer! (I hope I don't find out that he's a pervert.) But seriously, the story he tells is breathtakingly human, gorgeously written, even humorous.Now, this movie. Or rather, let me start with the 1959 movie, with James Mason, who did a fine job, within the constraints of 1959 movie-making. Pretty much what I expected, and so I was disappointed, altho a well-crafted movie.NOW, this movie. Jeremy Irons blew it out of the water! The only thing he didn't convey - that Mason did - was his utter disgust at touching a woman in her 30s (old, decayed flesh)... but everything else (by Irons) was blindingly perfect. And in fact, I was actually able to believe that perhaps HH did love little Lolita... (Perhaps I had read through my prudish eyes?) I tend to look with jaded eye at obsession and supreme selfishness, which were abundant in HH, of course...Yes, and yet, I do believe that the movie romanticized HH QUITE a bit. For some reason, the director wanted us to like this man. I would have preferred the total HH.

The problem seems to be the text itself is a huge burden, so ornately conceived and masterful in many ways it's hard to see right into it. Kubrick did not outright miss any of the elements, but reduced in a simple way to divine farce. This filmmaker, likely aware of Kubrick's failings, goes the opposite way&#x97;this Lolita is far too sombre and serious, too earnest about sentimental loss.To be fair, it's not all wrong. It's sensuous enough to be Lolita. The actress is spot on, a whirlwind of bratty ego. Its visual fixation with everything around Lolita, touched by her breath and body, the sock in one leg, the skimpy shorts, her movie mags and bubblegum stuck under the dashboard, all that is worthy of a book that is deeply about uncommon fixations and spends pages upon pages enumerating the trinkets of drama. And there is some wonderful Americana in the travelogue portion.But the book's deep peculiar beauty is in the way it's remembered. Not a simple flashback, the more the poor narrator tries to grasp having known Lolita the more she escapes into the desert with another man.The heartbreak, the elegy, the biting humor; these are all entries into it.So why bother at all with this one, which means an uphill struggle with moralists, if you're going to squeeze out another tragic love story?I do believe we've had cinematically more interesting Lolitas outside the text, even in Bertolucci's Last Tango. I do think a visual solution to Lolita is hidden right in this film&#x97;the scene of Dolly reading a comic-book on HH's lap, she begins rocking and for no 'real' reason throws her head back in seemingly rapturous passion. What has happened is that we have seamlessly shifted from reality to what may be happening, may be imagined or embellished in the narrator's eye, all being equally true as you watch which is how Nabokov expands the reader's mind. However as to the overall effect, that is ruined in this film in favor of something reasonable and straightforward. I miss all the humorous reinvention, irony of illusion and layered madness that bring Lolita to life as both tragicomic and the result of mysterious machinery of mind.You can tell that the filmmaker has no notion of the deeper implications by looking at the character of Quilty, always a big key to what this is. He is mostly right here (by contrast to Sellers who was way off), but seems wrong because Humbert is wrong.

Jeremy Irons plays a great role as Humbert, and I am glad that they included the scene in the beginning with Annabel. I am glad they did this because in the 1962 version of the movie they never show scenes with her, and I believe it is a huge reason why Humbert is in love with Lolita. It helps the audience make the connection with his obsession for her, like he is almost subconsciously seeing and reliving moments with Annabel.

A desperate pedophile, Humbert, somehow makes his wildest sexual fantasy actually come true, or at least that is what he longs to believe, but at the tragic cost of the lives he destroys, including his own.Humbert explains why he is attracted to 14 year old Lolita. By his own account, he became fixated on girls the same age as his childhood sweetheart, Annabel, who he lost forever during his own youth. It is still a mystery, however, why a man of Humbert's maturity indulged an adolescent sexual fantasy for as long as he did. A man his age could no more have a love affair with a 14 year old girl than could he resurrect his long lost lover from the dead. Nor could he go back to being a 14 year old boy himself.In a transparent attempt to approach the object of his desire, Humbert marries Lolita's mother, Charlotte, even though he does not truly love her. Charlotte's accidental death gives Humbert what he had been secretly hoping for, complete custody of Lolita. But, how could he be happy knowing that it was his rejection of Charlotte that practically drove her to suicide, especially since his flagrant negligence also hurt Lolita? This shocking realization should have interrupted Humbert's erotic dream and marked the point in the story where a responsible man assumes his natural role as a father. However, when Lolita approached him, inexplicably, he could not control his pedophile nature.Humbert refused to abandon his love fantasy, until the day when Lolita was practically torn away from him, and he finally realized that he couldn't have her. But by that time the damage he had caused her was already irreparable. He destroyed Lolita's happy childhood in much the same way his own had been destroyed by the death of Annabel, and he could never forgive himself for his 'sin'. Murdering Quilty, an even more perverse pedophile than himself, was as close as he could come to suicide. In the end, he died in prison of a broken heart, leaving us to ponder whether there was ever any need for such a tragedy, or is it simply true that none of us can ever find bliss except for a fleeting moment.

The casting, the photography, and the production values are amazing. Having directed Fatal Attraction and 9 Â½ Weeks, Lyne understands the dark side of love and sex. It's interesting that in his Lolita, he keeps that understanding of the obsessive as the keynote, but adds sunlight, beauty, and humor (a more sophisticated humor than Kubrick's). This dynamic works beautifully. Jeremy Irons adds a guilty edginess to the role and is excellent throughout, portraying complicated emotions naturally and credibly. In my opinion this movie is among Irons' top work.There are many scenes that play out as they did in the book, and the small additions where Lyne has diverged from the book enhance the scenes with rich detail and beauty. The scene on the porch of the Haze house, with Humbert, Dolores, and Mrs. Haze, is wonderfully choreographed, and Swain, as Lolita, is believably kid-like yet sensual. Her sensuality is a new toy, something to experiment with. Dolores, becoming a young woman, plays with her emerging sensuality, but has a child's understanding of adult relations. When she's done playing with sensuality, she'll read a comic book, or listen to the radio, and she doesn't want Humbert bothering her again. Lyne brings out that contrast of normal teen to obsessive object Lolita&#x97;the contrast of Dolores Haze herself, and how her obsessive lover sees her.The performance of Melanie Griffiths needs to be noted. She's beautiful, yearning, and a bit socially inept as the small-town landlady attracted to the sophisticated European professor. When she and her daughter get into arguments several times, Griffiths' voice cracks and takes on a shrill tone. These scenes are well-done, and Griffiths handles the switch from charming to infuriated extremely well.The last of the main characters, Clare Quilty, is perfectly acted by Frank Langella. Where Sellers' Quilty was manic and funny, Langella's Quilty is shadowy and sinister, which is as it should be. Near the end, as Langella's Quilty talks to Humbert, we see precisely how Quilty is Humbert's dark (or is that darker?) side and we see that Humbert sees it too. Langella's Quilty is almost always seen smoking a cigarette in the shadows, and his devilish presence adds weight and gravitas to a small but crucial role.As I noted, the production and photography are excellent. The set designs, cars, clothing, and music are all late 1940s, which is the time of the story in the novel. The Kubrick version was set in the time it was made, 1962. I appreciate Lyne getting this right. One of the themes of Nabokov's novel was post-WWII America, with its brand-new recovering economy, and its many highways that spanned the country. A good portion of the book details Humbert's and Lolita's wanderings across America,and Lyne portrays this in his version. He also portrays how immersed in her era Lolita is, using the slang, singing along with the popular music, and gorging on movie magazines and comic books. Lyne and Swain get this aspect of Lolita's character right. The attention paid to detail in Lyne's Lolita is gorgeous and eye-filling. Yet everything feels natural, with never a whiff of self-conscious retro. There are beautifully-lighted scenes, and a sunny surface that contrasts with Humbert's dark obsession. That contrast is the crux of the movie. Kubrick's Lolita brought out the dark comedy of the novel, but Lyne's version of Lolita brings out its lyrical beauty. Both deal with the unhealthy obsessive love Humbert has for Lolita, but in very different ways. I think those who have read the book will appreciate this second version of Lolita for its beauty and for Swain's portrayal of Lolita as an ordinary bratty young teen, and Irons' portrayal of a man with a fierce, yet helpless, obsession.

The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors are all very good and Frank Langella's interpretation of the character is one thing I consider superior to the 1962 version, even if Peter Seller is a great actor, he is far too funny for the role, and while that one works much better as a dark comedy than as a drama, he is sort of miscast. The highlight of this film is actually the music score. Ennio Morriconne's beautiful soundtrack never fails to bring me to tears, it perfectly captures the mood of the film.

The novel was forbidden for a time and terribly criticized. So you could imagine critic's reaction with this adaptation.And that's a big thing to talk about. You know, Jeremy Irons had a lot of problems, because of his hot scenes with Dominique Swain. Of course, as she was under-aged, the adult scenes were filmed with an adult woman, and all the proper means for avoiding all contact with Dominique in some scenes in which she sits over his legs. All this, and some erotic scenes, such as watching her eating a banana, or she on the grass, with her T-Shirt all wet, makes the movie pornographic.As you could imagine, I don't believe that. Those are just details, that doesn't make a common and touching drama an erotic movie.The acting, is great. Jeremy Irons, as Humbert Humbert, is perfect.

The characters are very intriguing people, all of them, Lolita, Humbert and Charlotte. They seem to be weird people in awkward situations, although for all their problems you can still feel for each of them. Humbert the child molester strikes a chord of his sense because of his undying affection of this little girl who plays off his illness. Lolita is the easiest to fall for, but only because she is a young impressionable girl who always has innocence in the viewers' heart, even though at times she seems to rip that notion right out of you. This film tests the boundaries of what is right to most people and what is right in the heads of all the characters.A Constant battle goes on in feeling of pity or total disrespect for Humbert and his twisted mind. Also, what side causes this disastrous relationship to start and why it ended so abruptly? This movie leaves few answers to the questions you ask your self. Who is the real evil of this story, the situation that the two were put into after there is no more mother or is it the man that flirts with a 14 year old and eventually sleeps with or is it the girl who seduces a man, who she sees she can profit from or is this just a sick movie of people you never want to meet and think all should go to hell.Lolita is entertaining to those who like to see those whose characters are a little off and a storyline that shakes you and leaves you asking why. The movie is put together well enough were the story moves fluently and keeps the viewers attention and is well worth the two or more hours, especially if you have never read or seen the other versions.

Brilliant reproduction on the book, which is also one of my favorite. As the book, it paid very close attention to detail. The time period, 40s, was very accurate which added to the charm of the movie. Perhaps the best thing about it was it's great choice of characters. It is true, as some critics have mentioned, that Melanie Griffith is too thin and pretty to physically match Mrs. Haze, but her acting is so wonderful for this part that she perfectly carries across the roll, especially with all her screeching and hollering at Lolita. So, even though she does not look like a fat cow, her manner surely suggests it. As far as criticisms go, it is also true that seventeen-year-old Dominique Swain is too old to play Lolita. Alas this is also made up due to her excellent acting and coquettish manner of a true nymphet. One of the things I found interesting is that in the movie Lolita is a reddish blond even though in actual life the actress has dark brown hair. This is curious because in the book when Lolita is described she has dark brown hair also. Perhaps as a blond Lolita gave more of a sunny light image then she would have otherwise. As far as Humbert himself; Jeremy Irons received no criticism at all. He matched the image of Humbert Humbert even if one were not to consider his great acting. The way his face becomes strained and he mumbles every time Lolita got anywhere close to him is absolutely touching. As a matter of fact, touching is the key word in this movie. Perhaps the major difference between the book and the movie is, in fact, how touching Humbert seems, how innocent, and how vindictive Lolita in the movie, whereas in the book Lolita is the obvious innocent and Humbert is the fiend. In the movie one constantly gets the feeling that Humbert is trying his best to be good but it is Lolita who always thrusts herself on Hum and makes it ever more difficult for him. I watched this movie as DVD so I had a chance to see the parts of the movie that were later cut. These parts make up most of the little scenes that are missing in the movie; for example the seen where Humbert pictures drowning Mrs. Haze, but then can not do it. Once I examined all the scenes almost all of them were of Humbert being more forward. So at first Lolita was created closer to the book, but then most scenes where Humbert is showing his wicked side are cut. One might wander why, but one has to consider the problems this movie had which have not been spoken of. It started out as rated R and, though it is really not bad at all, it was proclaimed as child porn, simply because of the ideas in it, and not allowed to be shown in American theaters for a long while. This is probably why it has not been heard off and then out of nowhere appeared on shelves in the video rentals after it was revised and no longer proclaimed to be child porn. One might also add that in Europe no one had any problems showing it what so ever. Another very nicely made part of the movie was the secretiveness surrounding Quilty. Overall artistically done movie, though not to the point of movies like Titus or The Cell. Defiantly worth watching although the lack of conventional morality may be disturbing for some.

Charming as James Mason played it in '62, Jeremy Irons won me over thoroughly as he seemed so genuine and so dastardly attractive, that I might be moved by him as well if I were 12 years old!  In retrospect, Mason seemed almost too old.  Irons also brings about a deeper sympathy for his Humbert in the same way Tony Perkins did for Norman in Psycho.  He is so adorable and sort of lost, that you've gotta like him!  Sue Lyons also seemed too old, in the '62 version, yet her aloofness and dated teen-aged ways charmed me, as did her recurring theme, which the '97 Lo (Dominique Swain) lacks.The matter of the sinister Clare Quilty (Frank Langella) **POSSIBLE SPOILER!*** is dealt with in a much more harrowing manner in the later film, and adds genuine drama to the story (WHO is this person, WHY don't we see his face clearly, WHY is he always in the background, etc.), and he is a thousand times more ominous than Peter Sellers' goofy characterization of same in '62.  As vulgar and frightening as Quilty is, I understand him and his motivations much better, and merely the fact that he is kept a dramatic secret until the latter part of the film is much more gratifying plot-wise. The back and forth flashback nature of Irons, his confrontation with Quilty, somehow add much more suspense than the almost amusing confrontation in the '62 version and the dreadfully serious latter third.  Somehow the continuity in the '97 version is maintained, perhaps *because* the humor is kept to a minimum in the first half?  An interesting debate.  **End Spoiler!**Also, the many delightful humorous moments in Kubrick's '62 version are done away with almost entirely in this picture.  The very sexually suggestive, Broad-Minded friends of Mrs. Haze, the Farlowes, are reduced to a mere mention; and there are none of the awkward social scenes, such as Mrs. Haze's constant flirting, the difficulty Humbert and Lolita encounter in checking into a Motel the first time, and the tedious scenes with the porter and that ridiculous cot.  If these elements (a scary Quilty, the humor, the cot, Winters as Charlotte and Irons as Humbert) were magically woven into one film, I would dance and dance, as it would then seem to me, perfect.I highly recommend BOTH pictures, however, for all the above mentioned favorable reasons.  The cinematography and period locales in the later film are stunningly photographed and historically accurate down to the period candy packages and road maps in the glove box, and the costumes, cars, the COLOR, and even the incidental radio-music works splendidly.  The shots of the nasty old coin-operated Magic Fingers unit in one of the many Motels along the way brought back fond, if not dreary, childhood vacation memories...A lovely film, but see both!

Critics who are offended by the subject matter say Lolita glorifies paedophilia. Using the same line of argument, one could say that murder is offensive and illegal, so why doesn't the public have a problem with movies featuring serial killers? Did The Silence of the Lambs glorify murder? Ironically, the violent scenes in Lolita are more disturbing than the sexual ones. It's a shame all the hype surrounding the movie isn't concerned with the film itself.Lolita is stunning, emotionally and visually. Adapted from the novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita focuses on Humbert's (Jeremy Irons) relationship with Lolita (Dominique Swain) and the tragedies it creates.Humbert is a scholar who is infatuated with young girls. A reason for his 'condition' is given in the film, but it really doesn't explain the extent of his desire. It seems reasonable that Humbert would be an evil predator in the eyes of the viewer, but what makes the movie so interesting is how he is portrayed as a tragic figure trapped by his desires. Humbert understands his affair with Lolita is wrong, but he is unable to change it-stating the relationship was a paradise, whose sky was the color of Hell-flames. To Humbert, Lolita is not just an outlet for his sexual desires. He falls in love with Lolita herself, not just the idea of her as a sexual object.The viewer's sympathy for Humbert has a lot to do with Lolita herself. In many ways she is more of a predator than he. Lolita initiates the first few sexual encounters and is fully aware of what she is getting in to. Yet, as with Humbert, her innocence in the affair shines through. Director Adrian Lyne contrasts Lolita's sexuality with child-like images. In one scene Lolita is reading a comic book and laughing, when the camera pans down to reveal a naked Humbert underneath her. In another scene she is lying soaking wet beside a sprinkler, and for a moment the viewer forgets her true age, until her smile reveals a retainer.Newcomer Dominique Swain shines in a very difficult role. She can go from woman to child in a instant, which is crucial to the part. Without Swain's ability, Irons' character would be much less sympathetic to the audience.Lolita's beauty can be found in its character's complexities. In many films the characters are one-dimensional and predictable, making even a good script seem dull. The viewer wants to feel sorry for Lolita and to despise Humbert, but the characters and script don't let conventional norms take over.Lolita runs at two hours and 15 minutes, and for the last half-hour, it loses some of its focus. The ending is disappointingly over-dramatic, but it doesn't take away from the first hour-and-a-half. Lolita isn't exactly a fun ride, but it's one you should take.

I had no clue about the nature of `forbidden'ness before watching the movie. I have never read the original work, nor seen the Kubrick's version of the movie. Worse yet, I missed the initial credits and about the first five minutes of the movie as well, which apparently would have given me a good indication of how the movie ends (After being told what I missed, I thought it was a good thing that I missed it). All these resulted in one of my memorable-movie-watching experiences ever.The film is visually appealing, with a very graceful background score, which continues to ring in my ears as I write this sentence. Ever since `The Mission', Ennio Morricone is one of my all-time favorite music directors. The performances by the cast are commendable. (I beg to differ from some earlier opinions that Irons look lost in many places; I think he is exceptional and has almost brought Humbert's mental nature alive in to celluloid). A very decent technical work overall.But the very nature of the subject matter, and a script that supports it well, lies in the core of `Lolita'. Mild Spoilers What makes Lolita controversial? Is it the incest or the pedophilic nature of the love or both. If it is both, which one outweighs the other? I mean, is it possible to have the same strength of reluctance with one of these elements missing?And finally how much is Lolita or Humbert responsible for what had happened? I think the movie answers these questions as it flows along, if you could watch it with an open mind to the different characters in front of you. I personally would have thought the story is incomprehensible, if I were to have watched the same movie a few years ago (attributing to my `immaturity').

However, this is a main part of the plot that leads to the psychology of the relationship becoming ever closer.This is especially the case in respect to Lolitas feelings for Humbert when she is told that her Mother is dead and looks to Humbert as an obvious but more so father figure.Overall a very good movie.

But somehow the film ends up very different. One could not expect any adaptation (though I admit to not having seen Kubrick's '60s version) to contain all the layers of the novel. So Adrian Lyne goes for just one - the tragedy.True, the Humbert here loses all of the craftiness of his literary counterpart. He is still deceitful, but seems caught up in events, almost betraying himself with every lie. Although the events of the movie are almost identical in every way to Nabokov's novel, the movie's tone becomes completely different.Now that I have (very *very* briefly) said that, I must point out that I do not consider this a flaw in any way. True, the movie is based on the novel. But if it were exactly the same, what would be the point in any adaptation at all? You'd be as well reading the book.So, quickly now (I hate long comments on IMDB), I will attempt to encapsulate my favorite things about this movieLyne's attention to detail. Not just small things from the novel (Quilty's aliases in hotel books, for example, or Mrs Opposite) but just little things. Lo spinning in her chair at the soda place. Numerous authentic 40s items, lovingly recreated (despite  the novel's Humbert's derisive attitude to much of American consumerism). Just a myriad of small details that could alone sustain this movie for dozens of viewings.The acting. Irons (as has been much discussed) is so perfectly tragic (again, unlike Nabokov's Humbert - but so what?) and sympathetic, even in his depravity. Swain is superb (though a little poor as 17 year old, pregnant Dolly), a real find.The directing. Especially the way Lyne transforms Nabokov's shadowy Quilty to the screen. Brilliant!The music. So beautiful (especially the opening tune, with its occasional discordant note).The comedy. Small things. Sedatives for a cow. Charlotte's adoration of the French tongue. Is she keeping you up? Some wonderful lines!As a side note, I had not read Nabokov's novel when I saw this first. I loved it to death. Now, having read Nabokov's novel (perhaps the best thing I have ever read incidentally) I am even more impressed with Lyne's (and, of course, screenwriter Schiff's) movie. Not just it's faithful recreations, but its departures. Surely the ability to recreate the letter of the source novel so accurately, and yet defy the tone so dramatically, must be a talent worthy of some praise?

Iron's Humbert was an immensely tragic figure-a man damned by the fates of his past, toyed with by the chances of his present and led inexorably to his future demise by forces his scholarship had ill-prepared him for.Adrian Lyne's photographic direction was superb; his camera angles and choice of shot distances was perfectly matched to the unfolding tragedy. So many directors seem to be overawed by the story they're telling, particularly with famous-books-to-film, that they lose sight of the nature of cinema-that is, cinema as a separate art form, meaning the images must be crafted as a movie rather than a filmed stage play.  Lyne succeeded  where so many others have failed before him; he has used another art form, crafted it and created something new-something brilliant in its own right.Above all else, see this film and marvel at its beauty, be moved by the tragedy of its characters and ruminate about the vagaries of our humanity.

Lyne's Lolita works wonders with Nabokov's novel, but it does not pretend to be an exact representation of its literary counterpart (and arguably this should be preferred, as so many book to movie translations are doomed to failure and inferiority). Rather, the film dwells in emotion that might be considerably less prominent in the novel. We see the tale of one Dolores Haze and her tortured pursuer in a decidedly softer light. Yet the result is still Lolita. The emotional whirlwind that we are treated to is Humbert-as-hero- we come to view Humbert as he might think of himself by the novel's end. Humbert is the tortured lover, Lolita's desperate protector, and a father(?) who has been cheated of his redemption. Whether or not audiences see Humbert as such is up to them. Most of our hatred for H.H. is derived from our societal views of pedophilia. Those of us who are somehow able to overcome these obstacles may come to feel for this monster. At the heart of Humbert's relationship with Lolita is a desperate struggle to preserve a crumbling love (or maybe even to build one that was never there...). This struggle is beautifully/painfully rendered by its actors. One never knows whether things are going well for H.H. and Lolita, and we watch Lolita slowly slip from Humbert's grasp with as much pain as he does. Even H.H.'s last noble effort against Quilty is disastrous, and his last chance at redemption is unsuccessful. We need to see Quilty die almost as much as Humbert needs to kill him. There is no finality to the tale short of death. Humbert is ultimately unfullfilled (as he is with the death of his Annabel), his life becomes tragedy.And this is what we ultimately bring from this film- a lasting feeling of frustration and emptinness (not entirely unlike what Humbert feels). This is, in a sense, Humbert's paradise- a paradise with skies the color of hell-flames, but a paradise nontheless. In short, Lyne's Lolita is a not to-the-word exact translation of the book, but a faithfully created and beautifully crafted film.

(Of course, with the exception of 'Lawrence of Arabia' and its source, 'The Seven Pillars of Wisdom', I can't think of one movie based on a novel that can.) I won't dwell on its more obvious flaws, but will mention them in passing Jeremy Irons is too old for his role; Dominique Swain is a convincing 14-year-old but not a pregnant 17-year-old; the character of Clare Quilty, a figure of black humor both in the book and in Kubrick's version, is rendered by this script as a sinister, charmless pimp.  The role which has taken the most heat on this site, and which I believe is the most impressive, is the role of Lolita's mother, acted by Melanie Griffith.  I've read several comments that state that this character was intended to be fat and unattractive.  What these viewers may have forgotten (or perhaps they have never read the book) is that every character in the story is seen through the eyes of one person  Humbert Humbert.  Therefore Lolita is described as being an enticing, irresistible nymphet, although most people who actually came into contact with her would find her to be a rather unattractive, slatternly little brat; and her mother Charlotte is described as being a 'fat cow', when the fact probably was, was that she was a normal, healthy woman who had those secondary sexual characteristics (hips, thighs, breasts) that Humbert wasn't too crazy about and which he recoiled away from as 'fat'.  Nabokov deliberately romanticized Humbert's predilection for girl-children by portraying him as a man haunted by a lost childhood love (rather like Charlie Chaplin); if he hadn't done this, the reader (and viewer) could have interpreted this aversion to grown women as more of a latent homosexuality than to pedophilia.  That digression aside  the movie is gorgeously photographed and beautifully scored, and the ending is as likely to bring tears as the ending of the novel.  Superior in many ways to the Kubrick version--I preferred Peter Sellers' Quilty in that film, but hated the way he kept intruding so obviously throughout the movie--and inferior in others.

If we were to look at the date given in the book's mock preface and count back the years, we would (I suppose) find that the story begins in 1947 - so Lyne dutifully begins the story in 1947.  (Kubrick's setting, more indeterminate and more modern, was also more successful.)  But why, if he was so obsessed with dates, did he compress events into just three years?  If it was to allow the older Lolita to be played by Dominique Swain, then it was surely a mistake she looks impossibly youthful even for a seventeen-year-old, and there's no particular reason to use the same actress in any case.  Lyne was careful to include as many scenes from the book as possible.  But why bother doing so, when he often removes the sting from them?  The scene where Humbert gets the `knockout' sleeping pills from his doctor is retained, but we never see its culmination.  The crucial big fight between Humbert and Lolita in Beardsley remains; but Lyne muffs (as Kubrick doesn't) the disturbing way in which it suddenly ends.  I'm not convinced that Lyne always knew WHY he was including a particular scene or detail.  `It's in the book' isn't a reason in itself.Kubrick deserves credit, too, for telling the story without resorting to (a) memory-style flashbacks, and (b) verbal narration.  Indeed if there's one single damaging flaw it's Humbert's frequent voice-overs.  Very often he says no more than what is obvious to anyone attending to the story or images or dialogue - and what's the point of distracting us from the movie in order to tell us what we'd have been able to work out if we hadn't been distracted?  On the rare occasions when the narration actually gives us information it's either information we don't need, or information we could have been given some other way.  It's simply a weak device.  Yes, Nabokov's first person narrative is superb; but that was a book and this is a film.All the same it's a good film.  We ought not sneer at the fact that it looks good - very good, in fact, and I urge you not to judge its appearance from what you may have seen on television - since it looks good in the right way we see the tourist attractions of America as a motorist would see them, but beautifully shot, as if imbued with poetry by Humbert's overactive, lovelorn mind.  It's important that the affair between Lolita and Humbert not physically repel us, and it doesn't.  (No mean achievement considering that Dominique Swain is only fourteen.)  This is really no more `the movie of the book' than Kubrick's version was, but enough of the book survives to make it well worth watching.  -I'm putting it uncharitably.  Let me say rather that Nabokov's posthumous gaze keeps Adrian Lyne honest.  The director of `Fatal Attraction' somehow manages to avoid cheap sensationalism.  Not nearly as sharp as the Kubrick version, it's by no means foolish, and has its own languid charm. "},{"Title":"A masterful poetic journey into filmmaking.

This doesn't mean the movie is perfect, far from. But it's as good as book adaptations come. The cast is nearly perfect. Especially Jeremy Irons, who is appropriately tragic and funny, and newcomer Dominique Swain (most people will remember her as the teenage daughter in Face off) as Lolita. The movie is very much like Nabokovs novel a combination of a love story, a tragedy and a lot of Irony and sarcasm. There  is one fatal flaw in this film though, which stops it from getting a 10 mark from me. The ending. The overly theatrical death scene of Quilty. While (like the rest of the movie) following closely to Nabokovs very words (the playing piano...) it should have either been a lot more (sarcasm) or a lot less theatrical. Still that's not enough to spoil a truly great film.Now as you may have seen I'm Belgian. Remember, Belgium is the country that started all this paedophilia witch hunts.

I have been unable to get this film out of my head since I saw it.  I was fortunate enough to see it in the theatres; I know it was on Showtime, but this is a film to be seen on the big screen.  Because there are less limits on sexuality in films now than in 1962, Lyne is able to show more than Kubrick was ever allowed to imply.  I was shocked to see that scenes of sexual intercourse (although they were merely simulations) between Humbert Humbert and the 14 year old Lolita were allowed to be seen, although it helps the viewer picture what is at hand, and Jeremy Irons uses the scenes to show us Humbert and Lolita's inner turmoil.  Mr. Irons is simply brilliant, as is Dominique Swain as Lolita.  This was her first film, and if she continues to give performances this strong, she will be very successful.  This film is special because Mr. Lyne had such a passion for it, and because of this, he understands the characters and has prepared well.  There is a human element present in this film that even the book lacked at times.  The film focuses more on the road trip across America than Kubrick's version did, but this is for the better.

He says that he regrets everything except the murder of Quilty, and was saddened, Not by the absense of Lo by my side, but her absence from the sounds of children playing in the fields. It is at this point we see that Humbert's obsession was really over the girl he loved from his youth, and from that, he has destroyed another girl's life, and deeply regrets it.

Unfortunately, the tone of the second half changes so drastically, it almost seems like a different movie.  It becomes overly dramatic and the style turns almost haphazard.  The film's biggest flaw however is that, unlike the book, Lolita does not seem to have any real love for Humbert Humbert at all, and it is this element (perhaps too dangerous to American puritan sensibilities) that would have made her character so much more complex and interesting.  Whoever greenlit Lolita to the tune of $60 million was insane, and such a budget is really unnecessary for a story like this.  It does look like its cost though.  Cinematographer Howard Atherton lights every shot stunningly, too stunningly.  Humbert and Lolita's trip across America should look seedy and squalid.  Instead it is postcard gothic.

Yet for all its splendor and true-to-lifeness, Lolita the movie lacks the breadth of its source.Nabokov's prose is rich; he transfixes you, plays associate word games with you, passing the hours and pages while, in fact, very little has actually happened in the book--he has no patience, ironically, for speed readers.  It is as hard to translate to film as it is perhaps to step onto a moving train.So perhaps I shouldn't be so hard on Lyne for not living up to Nabokov; the limitations of the medium are beyond his control, after all.  But through all of his tricks and his feints, Nabokov wants above all to impress upon us the depth of despair and madness in the soul of the duplicitous and reduplicated Humbert Humbert, and the marvelously limber humor with which he beats those demons back.Lolita, for all of its supposedly rampant sexuality, is to me primarily notable for its humor its rollicking puns and the gentle pleasure Humbert takes in playing detective with his audience.  Somehow, that has gotten lost in Lyne's movie; Jeremy Irons in the lead role is oppressively somber and fidgety.Gone, too, is Humbert's sense of having been molded by circumstance his childhood dalliance with his cousin is reduced to a mere reminiscence, something inserted carelessly because it happened to appear in the book.  One gets the feeling that the broad spectrum of experiences and emotions and resonances represented in the book has gotten squashed or clipped on its way to the silver screen.  That simply didn't have to happen.These issues aside, the movie stands very well on its own. Dominique Swain plays Lolita with an insouciant flair, and Melanie Griffith possibly gives her best performance (which I admit isn't that difficult).  At the very least, it may induce those who haven't read Nabokov's book to do just that, and it does provide an interesting study for those who have.

This is the film Lolita in every possible way.Being a 40-something single mother, I should relate to the mother Charlotte Haze as she struggles with her teenage child and emerges from her loneliness as she falls for Humbert. And yet, it's Humbert I sympathize with.Being a woman who has been burned by selfish men in the past, men who have led me on for whatever purpose suited them, I should feel rage on Charlotte's behalf and feel furious that Humbert so blatantly uses her, writing such nasty things about her. And yet, it's Humbert I sympathize with and share his irritation with Charlottes behavior.Being a protective mother of my children, I too would be horrified and utterly disgusted if some old creep was lusting after my kids. And yet, the way in which the erotic tension is built up between Lolita and Humbert is very fulfilling and delicious to watch. One practically yearns to see them interact in a sexual way.So basically Adrian Lyne managed to take me to a place far, far away from my normal values and attitudes - leaving me confused and disturbed by how I could feel such things watching this film. But in this case, it says less about me and more about what an utterly brilliant director and storyteller he is.

For what it's worth, I don't consider anything in the film to be particularly explicit or salacious and therefore couldn't understand what all the fuss was about in the first place. Does the film portray a sympathetic paedophile? Arguably, but it must be borne in mind that the film, like the novel, is narrated by and viewed entirely through the eyes of Humbert, thus leaving itself far more open to the charge than if, for example, events were seen from the viewpoint of Lolita. I also remember reading some rubbish in sections of the British press at the time of the film's release about its glamourisation of paedophilia through its choice of a handsome leading man like Jeremy Irons. The filmmakers were only following Nabokov's lead here as he has Humbert mention at various points in the novel (somewhat immodestly) that he is a very good-looking man. In any case, it's just nonsense to suppose that all paedophiles are hideously ugly people. The only lesson I think can be drawn from all this is that any film made nowadays which tries to deal with the issue of paedophilia is really playing with fire, whether it's explicit or not. The film sticks fairly closely to Nabokov's novel with much of Jeremy Irons' narration culled directly from its pages, a nice touch, as Nabokov's prose is so beautiful and poetic. The performances of Irons and Swain are superb and Melanie Griffith, a much-maligned actress over the years, is ideal as the bitchy, annoying Charlotte Haze. Frank Langella is also great as the creepy, depraved Quilty. The film is beautifully photographed and the recreation of late 40s/early 50s America is spot on. Ennio Morricone's score is simply breathtaking, one of the best I have heard. How he was denied an Oscar nomination is beyond me. I can only assume that the controversy-hating Academy could not bring itself even to give the film a nomination in one of the more minor categories. The film, like the book, contains some very funny moments but is ultimately a tragic and moving experience.

I'd heard about the original story but instead of it being this dirty old man lusting after Lo, Jeremy Iron's portrayal makes you feel for Humbert because he isn't just some old perv, but a very kind, loving man who has feelings for a girl who represents that love he lost as a teen. You actually hurt with him as Lolita toys with him, bribes him and leaves him. Dominique Swain was perfect in the role. Beautiful, seductive but also childish and playful.The cinematography is great along with the musical score. You get a real sense of the 40's era. This version is way better than the Kubirck original, which I saw afterwards. Mason seemed like a dirty old man and though Lyons was okay.

I have to agree with Alan Stone of the Boston Review (linked on this page under `external reviews') that here director Adrian Lyne has managed to convert Nabokov's comic literary novel on the dangerous subject of paedophilia and the even more dangerous subject of American cultural criticism into a tragic romance, giving us a more literal rendering of the story than Kubrick's and which does even less justice to the book.Once again, the sex scenes are toned down to placate the censors, both official and non-official, who are attracted like flies to material like this. Dominique Swain, Lolita, at 14 is more the nymphet than Sue Lyon was but Jeremy Irons looks younger than James Mason did as Humbert. He is more a case of arrested development than a world-weary middle-aged intellectual nursing a secret passion for under-aged girls, and we are asked to believe this has come about because of the loss (to typhus) of his first love when he was 14. No one can do an Englishman in emotional torment like Irons, and he is superb here (even though he is meant to be French), but the origins of his suffering remain implausible. The other two important roles in Kubrick's film' (rather blown up from the book), Lolita's mother Mrs Charlotte Haze and Quilty the pederast, are considerably reduced here, so that the film is about little else than the fragile and deteriorating relationship between Humbert and Lolita. This is just as well as regards Charlotte, who is execrably played by Melanie Griffith (it is a relief to see her run over), but Frank Langdella does give us an alternative Quilty worth attention.While agoraphobic Stanley did his filming in and around Elstree in England, Lyne went on a location orgy. There doesn't seem to be a US state with a film commission he didn't visit, with France thrown in for good measure, and it's easy to see where the $60 million US went. This is one aspect which is truer to the book, since Nabokov sends Humbert and Lolita on a not so grand tour of the US &#150; highways, gas stations, dreary motel rooms and rampant kitsch Americana. One scene we are in the forest somewhere (Appalachians?) the next it's Texas &#150; but then geography is not Professor Humbert's subject. Nor Adrian Lynes' &#150; one place we do not get to is New Hampshire, the Nabokovian location of the Haze household.Because Lyne has set the film according to the novel, he has to evoke a lost era, the US of the immediate post war years, and here he succeeds brilliantly &#150; the music, the dÃ©cor, the drugstores, the dresses, the hairstyles and even the character's attitudes all fit beautifully. Here at least the huge budget was well spent.We get rather less of Nabokov's wry commentary on US education and culture, though there is one delightful scene at `Beardsley College', when Humbert, professor of French poetry, is told by the administrators about the importance of dating in the curriculum. Nabokov set `Beardsley' in Ohio (he once taught at Wellesley College, Boston) but Lyne, for inexplicable reasons, has located it right next to the St Charles Streetcar track in uptown Norlins (sorry, that's New Orleans for the uninitiated). Well never mind, we get the point. Poor old Humbert dies in prison again and this time we are advised of Lolita's fate (Stanley held out on that one). Quilty gets what he deserved, or at least Humbert gets to vanquish his dark side. Oh, why do such good books make such crook films?

Yes, 'Flashdance,' 'Indecent Proposal,' and 'Fatal Attraction' left me writhing in my seat at times, but '9 1/2 Weeks' (Mickey Rourke is just awesome) redeemed them.  Of course, 'Jacob's Ladder' is one of the most visually horrific films to appear in the past fifty years, but it was truly this searing version of Nabakov's masterpiece that put Lyne over the top for me.Jeremy Irons is one of those rare actors who, like Brando or Dafoe, enter each moment with complete commitment and sincerity (Freddie Prinze, Jr. following close behind...).  I admire Irons' work so much, from the chilling 'Dead Ringers' to the unforgettably painful 'Damage.'  Much like Michael Douglas, Irons places himself in roles that demand humiliation, suffering, and total loss of dignity at times.  Unlike Douglas, however, Irons effortlessly works through these moments with a gaunt and quixotic expression that eternally haunts.No, we're not discussing Melanie Griffith.  Her voice is painful to listen to--and it reminds me of the one thing I dislike about 'Chasing Amy' Joey Lauren Adams' voice.  Urgh.  Griffith and Holly Hunter should do the world a collective favor and work strictly on silent films...Dominique Swain is as a rare a find as Sue Lyon was for Kubrick's version.  It's actually quite sad that Swain has yet to produce a respectable performance since because her naturalistic approach and obvious improvisational talent shines throughout the film.Overall, of course, it is Lyne's unrelenting attention to detail that wins over in 'Lolita.'  Every moment is filled with carefully observed details the enigmatic touch of a foot or hand, the quick cut away to a glance or grin, the curious distractions that intensify certain emotions (flickering lights, barking dogs, a strand of saliva dangling from Lolita's retainer).I can only begin to imagine how keenly his eye captures the world.  Lyne himself admitted to drawing from his own marital spats for 'Indecent Proposal;' specifically the moment with the yellow rubber gloves and the suds of the sink.  In 'Jacob's Ladder,' he created the violently contorting heads from a painting his once saw of a man in agony.  In fact, we could almost taste the foods Rourke was playfully feeding to Basinger in '9 1/2 Weeks.'But back to 'Lolita.'  I was innumerably glad that Lyne approached Humbert not as some intellectual pervert to be laughed at with each successive bumble.  In fact, the inclusion of the expository action (Humbert in his youth madly in love with a nymphet that dies three months into their affair) paints an entirely different portrait than the doomed cyclical beginnings of Kubrick's version (Humbert entering Quilty's barren mansion with a loaded gun).  Lyne places the focus directly on Humbert and his obsession with the nymphet rather than the RAMIFICATIONS of such an obsession.  This is a crucial--if not highly controversial--directorial choice (Lyne recalls the fear surrounding the production during the unfolding of the Jon Benet melodrama).I have seen the film twice now and explored the DVD's ample supply of extras.  This certainly isn't the easily disposable kind of entertainment that Hollywood prides itself on; 'Lolita' loomed over me both ways of a four-hour bus ride.  I wish to place it among my favorite films dealing with love 'Chasing Amy,' 'Leaving Las Vegas,' 'The Piano.'  In time I think I will be able to further sort my feelings about this film, but for now it is sufficient to say that I have been scarred.Tolka's advice Some films succeed in hurting; just be prepared.

Two films have been based on this novel. Both Jeremy Irons and James Mason are acceptable Humberts, though while reading the book, I pictured either Rex Harrison or Noel Coward. Shelley Winters was perfectly obnoxious as Charlotte, while Melanie Griffith was terribly miscast. Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film is a dark farce while Lyne's adaptation is truer to the source. Kubrick's film deals with Mason's obsession for young Sue Lyon who, after the infatuation wears off, is a younger version of obnoxious Winters. Here lies the darkest humor of the piece. It is the same idea used by Blake Edwards in his 10, where Dudley Moore discovers that his beautiful dream girl, Bo Derek, is really a common dud. Kubrick also features a fair share of slapstick, which is surprisingly not handled by Peter Sellers. The famous cot scene is straight out of Laurel and Hardy. Winter's seduction of Mason is also hysterical. Lyne's film takes itself seriously and the only humor is really provided by Dominique Swain as Lolita. As for the characters of Clare Quilty, Frank Langella's character is pure evil, while Peter Sellers plays an insane impressionist. They are as different as night and day.Now for my comparison of the Lolitas. It is hard to believe that Sue Lyon was actually younger than Dominique Swain was when she appeared as Lolita. Lyon's Lolita is a beautiful, young adult. There is nothing childish about her. The taboo of a grown man falling in love with her is completely undermined. She is an adult who turns him into an irrational child. Her worst qualities are the personality traits she inherited from her mother. Seventeen year old Dominique is much more of a child. In Lyne's film, Lolita is supposed to be 14; it is never mentioned in the Kubrick film. Dominique does not act like a high school student. Her Lolita is a middle school child. Though physically, Dominique Swain is about as close to perfection as any girl could ever be, her Lolita is clunky, all arms and legs fidgeting all over the place. And it is she, beautiful Dominique, who provides the little humor this film has. Her playing with her retainer and her constant off pitch singing with the radio are quite funny. Her Lolita is ironic; she is physically immature for her age, but she is sexually very aware. Dominique is less convincing as Mrs. Richard Schiller. She looks like a pretty young girl dressing up as a frumpy old woman for Halloween. Her physical movement has matured, but her voice is still child-like.Kubrick's film is a masterpiece of International comic cinema. It is linked with Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick's other comic masterpiece, since both contain the best performances ever given by Peter Sellers. Lyne's film is beautiful to look at, but it will probably be forgotten because it does not go far enough. However, it is a fine adaptation of the novel. It is too bad the Dominique Swain has not had another role to propel her into stardom. She is magnificently beautiful and has a wonderful comedic sense.

Although the original (Kubrick's) Lolita was in black and white, and seems dated, it was much more effective in drawing me into the world of Lolita than the latter version. Kubrick's version seemed much more natural and convincing.  Most of the scenes did not seem forced.  Whereas in the modern version, you can actually tell that the actors are acting.  I found Melanie Griffith's portrayal of Lolita's mother very unconvincing.  In the original movie, I felt the lady who played Lolita's mother was a very good actor.  Her range in feeling were very broad.  All Melanie Griffith seemed to be able to express was stupidity and lovesickness.  I didn't even know stupidity was part of the original character's persona.  Everyone else turned in a decent performance. However, the movie seemed to take itself to seriously at times.  (As though trying to convince the viewer that great taboos were being broken) One most interesting difference between the two movies is how different the main characters are.  In the original, you had a professor who, falling under lolita's charms, acts quite silly and immature.  Despite his immature love for lolita, he still seemed like a good person, and therefore it was hard not understand his situation, even like him.  In the modern remake, the main character was much more serious, stoic.  He appeared to be, at times, like a sexual predator. One could not feel for him, nor even imagine being in his shoes.  He did not have enough humanity for us to sympathize with.I'll admit the modern remake is more extreme (in terms of sexual expression and intensity) but I found the original movie to have much more substance and originality.  In the modern remake, lolita and the professor both seemed as though they had absolutely no qualms about having a guiltless sexual relationship.  There is almost no story at all here.  We have two people who have great affinity for each other despite the difference in age.  So what? I found it much more interesting in the older version when the characters did not act as though they were in a soft porn movie.  Kubrick did a great job in creating tension by using this taboo.

However, this film still falls short of actually presenting what the novel is all about. It isn't a tearjerker about the innocent Humbert Humbert being unfairly taken advantage of by the bold, yet still childlike Lolita, it is in fact the exact opposite.After watching this film, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Humbert and his endless longing for Lolita. After all, Lyne makes it seem that Lolita used him, then took off with another man who could give her the satisfaction that she needed. Nabokov never intended for this to happen in the novel, so why is Lyne so unfaithful himself to the actual story?The strong point of this film is the large performance of Jeremy Irons as Humbert, a man who truly loves Lolita very much and never could fight off any feelings for her. One can see the pain build up within Irons as the film progresses until the final scenes in which he finishes off Quilty (a very unnecessary scene). My favourite scene of the film happens to be near the end when Humbert is being followed by the police, drives into a farmer's field and proceeds to get out of his car and just stand there. This scene alone speaks more than the majority of the film itself.Melanie Griffith seems miscast as Charlotte Haze (who in Nabokov's novel is fat and unattractive), I don't know of many men who would want to subdue her with sleeping pills every night in order to pass on their husbandly duties. Dominique Swain puzzles me in the role of Lolita. She captures the whole nymphette quality, but should have been a little more subdued at times. She seems slightly more childish in her performance than Nabokov intended.I would give a slight recommendation to the over 16 crowd who have an appreciation for the more artsy-type films like Lolita. However, it may seem quite subdued when compared to all of the hype.6/10 stars.

While it is not necessary for a film to accurately reflect a novel's content (being a different medium), there is usually an effort made to represent the heart, mood, or overall theme of the adapted work. Nabokov's Humbert is an unreliable narrator, a self-aggrandizing, pathetically pompous man. The dark humour of the novel is evoked by the reader's awareness that Humbert is a joke. The reader has access to Humbert's private thoughts and must infer what's really happening. The reader's inferences and judgments make the novel a grim pleasure to read. The novel is tragically comic, not merely tragic. In contrast, Lyne's Humbert, as portrayed by Jeremy Irons is put forth as a melancholy romantic who may be lying to himself, but is ultimately a more sympathetic character. Lyne's adaptation has characterized itself as more faithful to Nabokov's work, but it is only so in word alone. This failure to fully realize the character of Humbert as the ponce that he is turns the 1997 adaptation into a tragic romance, eliminating the truth conveyed regarding human folly and deception put forth in the original work.

The Haze woman must be UNattractive. Shelly Winters in Kubrick's Lolita (1962) was perfect for the part because she was a woman who had once been attractive, but had become fat and had lost her looks. Charlotte must be unattractive as a contrast to Lo (and not just in Humbert's mind); furthermore the references to her as a fat cow and Humbert's disinclination to make love to her, do not play well if she's attractive. Melanie Griffith is actually better looking than the young star, Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita. Swain is pretty enough, however, and although not the great beauty that Sue Lyon (who played Lolita in the original) was, she is actually sexier, and she is an excellent actress. She does the coquettish muggings better than Sue Lyon did and she is allowed more latitude. Humbert never even kissed Lolita in Kubrick's version! The direction is patently stupid in parts as though Lyne wasn't paying attention to his film. He has Humbert stare at Lolita in the famous scene when he first spots her on the lawn much, much too long so that Charlotte Haze could not help but notice his noticing. And in the scene on the front porch, with the three of them together on the couch, Charlotte would have to be blind not to see the sex play between the two right there in front of her eyes.This is a cynical, loveless Lolita. The scene at the Enchanted Huntress is not enchanted. Instead Lo teaches Hum some sex numbers. By the time they are in the car driving away from the Enchanted Huntress, the romance is over.Once on the road, Humbert finds out that he has to be a father as well as a lover. She thus begins to despise him. But she has nowhere else to turn. The rooms of the motels are not romanticized. Lyne makes them sorted and cheap. He shows a sign advertising Children under 14 free at one of Humbert's choice stopping places, slyly reminding the cognoscente that Nabokov's nymphet should be younger than Shakespeare's Juliet, who was thirteen. (Given the puritanical nature of the American political psyche, neither Lyne nor Kubrick was able to make a true to the book film.) Irons is now looking older with the stress of taking care of Lo and dealing with his forbidden love.Lyne wants to emphasize the idea that Lolita has been robbed of part of her childhood. She becomes a prostitute, effectively speaking, as she negotiates with Humbert about quarters and dollars for her favors. Kubrick glossed over this while Lyne highlights it. When Humbert tries to grab her saved-up money for fear she will use it to escape him, she shouts indignantly, I EARNED that money! We feel no affection or identification for Humbert as played by Irons because he seems so consumed by his sexual need that he is aware of nothing else. James Mason as Kubrick's Humbert at least aroused our pity. In the novel and in the Kubrick film it was clear that Humbert loved her. In this version it appears that he only wants to use her to get off. And in fact can only get off with her, and so in one sense he is her prisoner.One of the strong points of Lyne's film is the photography of Swain. The camera brings both her adolescent body and face alive. She is natural and confident. It's hard not to feel a strong affection for her. Again I would like to see more evidence that Humbert loves her. In some scenes we see that she, in her on-again off- again way, loves him, as though she cannot not help but love him because there is no one else. It is kind of like we love our parents because they are our parents--and hate them since they control us.The Kubrick film and the novel had Humbert as the focus. The Lyne film, despite the Humbert voice-over, is really seen from Lo's point of view. And Lyne did not, I suspect, like all the comedy in the Kubrick version.The really terrible thing about Nabokov's tale that both directors got right is the unrelenting possessiveness of Humbert, the unrelenting control he exercised over Lolita. That was his undoing of course, and really shows the perverted nature of his love for her. If he had really loved her, he would have stepped aside and let her live a normal life. That's what fathers do. That he loved her as a woman is not in itself a tragedy. It was the jealousy and control. Lolita makes this clear when as the pregnant, married and glasses-wearing Dolly, looking common and matronly in a cheap house with a dirt yard and a working-class husband, she sees Humbert for the last time.Lyne wanted us to focus on something sad and corrupted. This is a Lolita for the Nineties. She is exploitative; he is a sick man she is exploiting. This interpretation will be more agreeable to some since it reenforces the idea that teen sexuality is wrong. As usual, we see that nobody cares about the girl. The feminists know she has the sexual power, and they are jealous. They want to put her off limits so that they have a better currency themselves. This is the political position of the sexual wars, and Lyne has fallen into it. I think we need a French Lolita, as done by somebody like Louis Malle. I don't expect this for another hundred years, however. This film ought to kill the theme for quite a while.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

The basic premise underlying the adaptation of Nabokov's work (among the best modern literary works in English) is flawed; much of the novel's power stems from Humbert's thoughts and how things look from his twisted yet insightful perspective.  Nearly all of this is left out of this telling which, to be fair, is difficult to avoid with a work like Lolita.  But it's removal does much to rob the story of it's vividness (and it certainly destroys any sense of Humbert as a coherent, if flawed, character)The actors do absolutely nothing to help this situation.  The best is the usually-solid Jeremy Irons who simply looks lost throughout much of the movie.  Melanie Griffith's Charlotte is a grotesque cartoon with almost no form and less inspiration.  And then there's the much-heralded Dominique Swain, chosen to represent the nymphet Lo.  Watching this film, it was clear that she either had no notion of what nymphet means or was simply incapable of playing a moderately sophisticated role that requires some sense of sexuality.  There was a lack of any chemistry between she and Mr. Irons in all the places where such chemistry was warranted.There were some interesting visuals in the film, particularly the nightmarish sequence near the end.  That said, they don't do nearly enough to save a very weak movie.  This film fails on nearly every level.

In that regard it succeeds admirably, there's nothing remotely titillating here, indeed the only real nudity is Frank Langella's rather startling full frontal scene as he flees a gun-toting Humbert in the finale. From start to finish despite the beauty of the photography and Humbert's elegiac narration it's plain to all that this is a tragedy, Humbert's final words are those of regret that through his selfishness he has denied Lolita her childhood (and through the ultimate revelation it seems the joy of motherhood too).Plenty of good here, Irons is great as Humbert (to think this is the guy I watched as a child on kids variety show 'Playaway'!), handsome enough for the role but not some blatant Casanova, you can understand why he appeals to women without casting him as an incorrigible womanizer or pervert. He achieves the near impossible task of creating audience sympathy for a man who attempts to drug rape an adolescent virgin (or so he thinks). Melanie Griffith does well with the frankly thankless task of playing Lolita's mother and Swain is fine as the title character, a shame she never seemed to be able to capitalize upon the brief fame it brought her. Langella almost steals the entire show as the odious Quilty (the dark reflection of Humbert himself, murdering him as an act of self-loathing?).If there's one flaw it's that ultimately it falls short of confronting the monstrosity of Humbert's actions. Dominique Swain's Lolita is always clearly a teenage girl on the verge of womanhood, she's very obviously 14. In the book Lolita is only 12, the film chickens out from casting a girl who looks the correct age as it would just be too uncomfortable for the audience and legally difficult to cast an actress who'd look the right age but have to take part in (both literally and figuratively) 'adult' scenes. Casting her as older puts everything in an altogether different light (Humbert and Lolita's relationship would actually be legal in parts of Europe and the US at the time) and lessens the impact of the taboo being broken, with every year older she becomes the subject matter is conversely less shocking. In the end the film doesn't have the courage of its' convictions. Still I think that ultimately it is the best adaptation we shall ever have of this most controversial of literary classics.

How is that possible? A pathetic old man loves little girls, and when he finally has the opportunity he exploits an orphan thoroughly and completely. What makes the story great is that it expresses raw emotion, pure passion, real love.Background The author of the original story, Vladimir Nabokov, was a literary genius whose portrayal of the pedophile Humbert Humbert is so powerful and realistic that readers suspect the Russian-born author must have been a pedophile himself. However, as Boyd's definitive 2-volume biography shows, there is no evidence that Nabokov was anything but a mature, happily married heterosexual.Set in France and the U.S.A., the story begins by describing the early life of the main character, Humbert, who fell in love with a girl, Annabelle, when they were 13. She died suddenly, and he remained fixated on girls aged 9-14 for the rest of his life. Most of the novel (and both film versions) focuses on Humbert in the 1940s when he is in his 40s, and has a relationship with another girl, Lolita, beginning when she is 12.Although Humbert is portrayed as a human being rather than an inhuman monster, the author doesn't romanticize Humbert's imbalanced mind or his crimes against the young girl. This is an educational story of how a man should NOT treat young girls. Humbert's relationship with Lolita soon turns tragic, and he eventually looses her to another pedophile in the story, Quilty, portrayed as a creative artist who is Humbert's rival for Lolita'a affection. Unlike the opportunist Quilty, Humbert didn't consider the young girl a score, she was his redemption. All the main characters in the story die eventually.Despite being a respected professor and acclaimed writer, Nabokov was unable to find a conventional publisher for Lolita and had to settle for a pornography publisher in France. There were attempts to censor the book in France and Britain, until it was finally published in the U.S. Various versions of the book have since sold over 40 million copies, and there have been two film versions &#x96; one in 1962 and the other in 1997, as well as many books and dissertations about the author, and even a biography of his remarkable wife, Vera. Lolita isn't Nabokov's best novel (I prefer Ada), but it is by far his most popular. I highly recommend listening to actor Jeremy Irons' inspired reading of the book on audio CD.The First Film Stanley Kubrick did a great job of making this controversial story acceptable to the American public. Nabokov wrote the screenplay, but Kubrick didn't follow it very closely. The theme music and Peter Sellers (as Quilty) give the film a comic tone, as is common in treating sexual themes in Europe. It's in black and white, which contributes to the sense of history.The Second Film Adrian Lyne's version offers a more accurate presentation of the story (historically). The most beautiful part of the film is the meeting between Humbert as a boy and his child-love Annabelle. There is more physical contact in the second film, but still no nudity or actual sex. In some ways there is more hysteria over sex between different age groups today than in the past, so maybe Lyne felt inhibited? The theme music is certainly more somber than in the first film.Both films feature beautiful photography and are well worth seeing, now more than ever due to the current mass hysteria over sex between different age groups (14-year-olds on sex offender registries for engaging in sex play with 9-year-olds!) Some people today are horrified by the subject of this story, apparently without being aware that the tragic ending is entirely consistent with political correctness. A defect in both films is that Lolita is not played by a 12-year-old actress, the same problem that exists when you see a performance of Romeo and Juliet featuring middle-aged opera singers. There is a need for a third film version for that reason alone. A 12-year-old actress can easily be made up to look like a 16-year-old for the end of the story. If you're willing to finance a third film version, I'll write the screenplay myself!- Frank Adamo, author of the documentary Girl Becomes Woman.

Losing her mother and her father and being taken advantage of by two very older men.

The appearance and delivery of the two older central characters are also superb, with Irons and Griffith both presenting the darkly pitiable natures of Humbert and Charlotte Haze.Lyne's film also succeeds in highlighting the range of scenery as Humbert and Lolita travel across the American landscape; whilst Ennio Morricone's score appropriately depicts the tragic sentiment of the novel. Moreover, Lyne also succeeds in balancing the tragic elements with the black humour of Nabokov's prose and his fascination with US pop culture.Of course, no film can ever stand as a substitute for a novel as profoundly brilliant as Nabokov's Lolita. It might at least encourage people to turn to the stunningly beautiful prose of the original. One final point to an earlier comment made; the details of Lolita's fate are by no means a creation of Lyne's but are actually tacitly alluded in the fictional Foreward to the novel.

Let's not confuse love and lust.This is the story of a pathetic middle-aged man who cannot disentangle himself from his attraction to a nymphette.  It is told almost entirely from his perspective which is tragic and totally humourless, a role which Jeremey Irons does to perfection.  He does not find Melanie Griffiths attractive (who appears fat to him but not to anyone else -- remember how spunky she was in Cherry 2000?).  His only interest in her is to gain access to the object of his desire.  He is acutely aware how inappropriate it is, but he's powerless to resist.  Thus the momentum is set for most of the entire film.With few notable exceptions, movies do not do justice to books, just as videos don't do justice to movies.  I would venture to say it would be impossible to find a 12-year old who had the maturity to act Lolita.  Not particularly attractive (nor unattractive) Dominique Swain at 15, makes a very believable 14 year-old (but not a 17 year old) and puts in a splendid performance in the title role.  Perhaps it was possible because she hadn't had previous acting experience.  It made me think of the incredible non-professional child actors in many Iranian films -- though none of those would be given such an intense role as this one.The sign of good incidental music is that the audience doesn't notice it, only the mood it conveys.  It was conspicuous by its absence at times but I rarely noticed it.  I had been to a concert of superb Beethoven Chamber music a few hours earlier in the day I saw this film.  Since I am of the view that Ludwig wrote half of the world's exquisitely beautiful music, the fact that I didn't notice the incidental music is high praise of it indeed.I find appealing incidental images such as the flowers in the hospital rubbish bin and the old lady on the porch waving to all the traffic, but some were made a little too obvious.  A longer shot would have made these images less obvious and to my mind more satisfying.  The rest of the cinema audience had left and didn't see the final few frames after the credits.  That sequence might have Bible fanatics upset, but I liked it.  Come to think of it, so might they....The proliferation of 1940s consumerism paraphenalia and the vacuuous pop music did not convey any sense to me of satire, but did do a fairly accurate job of setting the social atmosphere.  With no sense of the satiric or comedic, the shooting scene just looked silly.  How come this guy's still walking even though he's been shot three times?  Since the story is told from HH's perspective, I took that to indicate he did not have a good grip on what was objectively observable.Excellent photography almost as good as Nicolas Roeg's (e.g. Walkabout or Don't Look Now) combined with great acting and music makes a film that anyone who has ever felt manipulated by another could relate to, even if they confuse love and lust.

I will not talk any further about this movie... one should really see it to at least have an inkling of what I feel about this fantastic piece of art. This one has got to be among my all-time top 10.

The Kubrick version comes closer to the real thing, but is still lacking.  Read the book, if you haven't already.

First, it is unrealistic to expect that a movie will stick to the original book in a one hundred percent faithful manner. There are obvious time constrictions that rule out a lot of the intangible thought processes involved in savoring a book that are seldom depicted in crude reality on a screen. This is not to say that there are not superb adaptations from masterpieces made by BBC television that are almost quite as good as reading the book. But that is a rare quality in one-time movies. In order to truly adapt a book it is much better to go through the mini-series formula.Second, I find the new version lingers too much on the nitty-gritty and less on the background and the development of the characters and the relationships. I find this is totally unnecessary to understand the plot and the consequences.Third, the final scene excessively long and detailed (when Humbert kills Quilty). The Kubrik adaptation still holds my highest regards for being subtle, yet revealing, and gives the scenes that The good if brief twice as good feeling.Fourth, I liked better the character portrayal of Shelley Winters, James Mason and Peter Sellers than (with all due respect) the one of Melanie Griffith, Jeremy Irons and Frank Langella. This is not to say that these fine actors and actresses have made an award-winning job at some other movie or movies or could do it in the future.Summarily, I keep my Excellent (9/10) vote on the 1962 version, and give this one an 8. I think this is a just vote, but keep in mind that always beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Even when I am a relatively young viewer, I find the excessive realism of the post-1970 cinema sometimes a bit distressing, and increasingly encounter the 1930-1970 movies to have a much more adequate perspective and treatment of the subjects than the new movies have.

When he killed Quilty, he finally in a lucid moment realized what a monster he was, and in the final imaginary scene overlooking the village, he felt remorse.The evocation of the seedy motels and desolate landscape of 1940s America reminded me of many such scenes from my childhood.

One thing he has been known for is casting excellent actors in parts wonderfully suited for them, and Lolita is no exception. The infamous Humbert Humbert is played here by Jeremy Irons, in an emotionally gripping performance, a sensitive man who realizes his unhealthy obsession with Lolita but is unable to stop it. The nymphet temptress herself is portrayed by Dominique Swain, whose acting ability is far beyond her years; she knows who Lolita is and what she wants, and she carefully and elegantly allows herself to evolve from an obnoxious brat into a cynical woman.Vladimir Nabokov's novel was a tragedy, a romance, a drama, a social commentary, and, at times, even a satire and a detective story. Lyne's Lolita is primarily a romance, with scenes that even border on campy occasionally. He is truer to the letter and plot of Nabokov's immortal novel than the spirit. He is careful to mold and execute the scenes exactly as Nabokov has written them, staying true to detail rather than feeling. Nevertheless, he has managed to produce an admirable adaptation of a classic work of literature.

Casting Dominique as the younger Lolita reminded me of the director Tamra Davis' talk after the St. Louis Film Festival's showing of Skipped Parts (about a fourteen year old boy and girl's deliberate first sexual experience). Ironically, for that film, one of the reasons thirteen year old Mischa Barton was chosen for the part was because Ms Davis was having a hard time finding a fourteen year old who had the innocent look she was looking for. Personally, I'd have preferred a younger film Lolita. In Leon (The Professional) Natalie Portman's Mathilda, in spite of her sexually forward behavior, projected a natural twelve year old innocence that would attract a Leon. Would he have committed as much for her had she been, say, fifteen? The story would have been different, to say the least. But in the long run it's of no matter, Dominique Swain portrayed Lolita beautifully.To me this was Lolita's story. Humbert, Quilty, and Charlotte were the supporting characters.<SPOILER AHEAD> As I saw it, the difference between Humbert and Quilty lay in Humbert's self-justification and Quilty's not. Quilty was evil; evil doesn't justify or explain itself - except, perhaps, through irony. Humbert actually made himself believe he was Lolita's benefactor, a typical trait among us human types - even to the end, where he adopts an almost fatherly aspect. We, with an uncomfortable sense of guilt, actually feel sympathy for him when Quilty steals Lolita. We are Humbert (We has met the enemy, and it is us). Humbert's sloppy assassination of Quilty actually made a victim out of evil (we do that too). The driving force behind Humbert's feeling for Lolita wasn't love - or lust; it was good old-fashioned human greed. He wanted her as his own.<SPOILER AHEAD> But Lolita is the real victim in this story; although we, like Humbert, view her as a pubescent siren (blame the victim). You can't always avoid being made a victim (See Eye of God 1997). It's how you cope with it that defines your character. Isaac accepted his father's orders dutifully. Jephthah's daughter accepted her fate, but bargained for a three month youthful fling first (it's doubtful that the judge would have been so permissive ordinarily). Lo never did fully accept Humbert's dominance except as a means of survival.<SPOILER AHEAD> The story is told from Humbert's perspective, and tells of his thoughts, plots, and trials, and is quite graphic in the assassination scene. But the story's title is not Humbert or Humbert Humbert or I Loved a Teenage Wench or I Killed Quilty. Nabokov chose Lolita as the character on whom he wished to bestow such importance. Because she was important. Innocence is one of the few worthwhile assets we humans have. We mistakenly equate innocence with sexual behavior - especially with young girls. I prefer looking at innocence, at least in part, as trusting, as the naivete we humans view with scorn, something we see children needing to grow out of. Also typifying innocence is the absence of greed. When given her freedom, Lolita chose the option of a becoming a normal wife and mother. Not only was she innocent in her naivete, she was innocent in her heart.What a great and resilient character Nabokov created.

I knew the basic gist of the plot but from the second I pushed play, I was in a whirlwind of amazement. Humbert Humbert was more interesting to me than any other character I had known before. I must admit I was somewhat puzzled at the opening in which Humbert is slowly careening back and forth on (the what is portrayed at that time)empty road holding the blood encrusted bobby pin.This scene is what kept me interested, knowing it would end in tragedy.

After seeing the movie, I was driven to read the book. I finished it this morning, taking two days to finish. As I read, I began to find small contrasts and similarities in the 1998 film. Lolita eating pie instead of drinking milk before she runs off screaming. Quilty showing up while Dolores swims, tapping her on the bottom as she plays tennis, the abscense of John and Jean...these are all things (with the acception of the pointless pie comment I just made), that would thicken yet ruin the solitude of Lyne's Humbert.Throughout the '98 version Quilty's prescence is felt sometimes literally, but most of all like a black omnipresent cloud that is supposed to represent Humbert's conscience.The instance that upset me the most after reading the book in comparison w/ the movie is Rita. In the movie, it does not tell you that during the three years Humbert searched for his kidnapped nymphet he moved in with a girl who claimed they went to college together and became involved with her. But left her once he got the letter from Dolly Schiller.Also, during the novel he speaks French almost as frequently as he speaks of his young love!

Whereas, Jeremy Irons and the breakthrough performance of Swain, add to the pros. The film ends up landing somewhere in the middle and becomes a watchable failure.Lolita and Humbert are tough to translate. How much control and nymphomania should Lolita flex? How sympathetic should Humbert's obsession be? How much of the story should be tragedy and how much black comedy? While Kubricks version leaned tword Humbert being laughably pathetic and meek (more a black comedy), Lyne plays up the more tragic side of Humberts obsession with liberal amounts of comedy sprinkled throughout. In the end, it just falls flat. It fails to find any emotional ground, most likely, because the subject matter and tone just doesnt translate from novel to film.Jeremy Irons is fine in yet another quirky sexual drama. He and James Spader have cornered the market on these roles, the same kinds that Donald Sutherland gobbled up back in the 70's. Swain is great, vibrant and alive, completely carefree, but a little lacking twords the end when Lolita has lost her youth. Though far from perfect, they both do well with the difficult, beguiling characters.Lyne, with his soft focus lens always at ready, makes it look like all his other films (except Jacob's Ladder) Misty, some would say, romantic. It doesnt help that the man who helped create the look of soft core porn films with 9 and 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal, and Flashdance, photographs Lolita in the exact same way as his previous trite films.

Both in Despair (filmed in 1978 by R.W. Fassbinder) and in Lolita (filmed in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick and in 1997 by Adrian Lyne), the protagonist is suffering from an impossible love. In Despair, Hermann Hermann breaks apart living together with his stupid, scatter-brained wife Lydia, starts to see himself, looks for a real Doppelganger (who has no resemblance with him), kills this Doppelganger and starts his Trip into the Light (so Fassbinder's sub-title to his film).In Lolita, a college professor who bears strong resemblance with Edgar Allan Poe (cf. Annabel Lee vs. Annabel Leigh) looses as a boy his 14 years old girl friend (Poe married a 13 years of girl) by death. Since then, he is without inner rest and looks to find her in another body. Who is Humbert? And who is Humbert? A split personality as Hermann Hermann? Too late in the film version of Adrian Lyne we learn about his antagonist, Clare Quilty. Who is he? How was is possible that he could liberate Lolita during the night from the hospital, after the physician told Humbert that he will keep her until the morning and Humbert was waiting directly before the hospital during the whole night, sleepless, in his car, his eyes directed to the only entrance and exit? Is Quilty Humbert's Alter Ego? Totally dissimilar to him as is Felix Weber to Hermann Hermann? At the beginning and at the end of the movie, we see Humbert sparkled with blood from his execution of Quilty. Of course, this could be Quiltys blood. Or --- did he try to kill himself - but did not succeed - while Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray actually did succeed? But there is another motive, as I see it, which gives the whole novel a quite strange last perspective which has been constantly overseen. After Humbert's Doppelganger Quilty has liberated Lolita, she lives in a relation to a young man from whom she is pregnant. Humbert needs years to find her, crossing all around Amerika. She confesses him that her love to Quilt was the most intense in her life, and when he asks about her love to him, she looks like she has already answered his question. Neither one of them survive their love. She dies in child-bed the same year, he dies five week earlier in prison from a heart disease.

While Jeremy Irons is a fine actor, even he was unable to make me care for the fate of Humbert Humbert.  An audience likes to be able to identify with the protagonist, but Humbert Humbert is a complete idiot.  It is hard to identify with one so stupid.In the end, I felt that the overall film had no point other than to create controversy, and it left me feeling that I had just wasted more than two hours of my life in watching it.

Quilty fingers the loop of a dog leash. These are the things in Adrian Lyne's version of Lolita that pass for subtle sexual metaphors. They are metaphors, but of a different sort; they represent the shallow and humorless tone that pervades and undermines this film.Say what you will about Kubrick's 1962 version of Lolita, but the characters had depth, the performances were excellent, and the film's darker moments were counterpointed with humor, which is much truer to the tone of the novel.Not so in this version. Jeremy Irons' one-note performance has him gaping and moping from beginning to end. There is no sense of manipulation on his part, or of an intellect at work; just a awestruck shamble from scene to scene. Melanie Griffith gives a similarly untextured performance.What the film lacks in acting or subtlety, it attempts to make up in flash, as you'd expect from the director of yes, Flashdance. And while a strobing bug light might add to the disorientation and paranoia of a scene, I again direct you to the Kubrick version to see how the exact same dialogue can be more effective with good performances and directing.Again, I think it is the pervasively somber tone that ultimately undoes this film. The one bright spot is Dominique Swain as Lolita, who captures the effervescence and half-innocent sexuality of a nymphet quite effectively.

The language of the book, and the emotion highs and lows the author takes us through are unmatched. The fact it was his first book in English makes it even more amazing. Transferring any book to film generally loses something in the translation, and this one is no different. The 1962 Kubrick version both benefitted and suffered from Peter Sellers as Quilty. He was a great actor and his performance was the best thing about that movie, but his character was way off base compared to the novel. James Mason was good but seemed a bit old. Shelley Winters was good. Sue Lyon was OK, but a bit too mature, I think. This version also was heavily sanitized (though it had a few minor points of symbolizm - the peach and banana, etc), and in fact the characters never kiss. Also missing from the early movie is most of the 27,000 miles of traveling the couple went through - so much so that HH frequently confused the motel names. I did like the movie as its own thing, but it bears slight resemblance to the book. Now to the 1997 movie... Jeremy Irons seemed perfect as HH, and Dominique Swain was darn good as Lo.However, Melanie Griffith was just irritating and shrill as Charlotte, and bore no resemblance to what HH summarily described as ...that sorry and dull thing a handsome woman.SPOILERS AHEAD TO THE ENDAlthough I appreciated the scenes of HH and Anabelle (missing in the early movie) because it gives much insight to HH's obsession, I felt that there should have been some mention of Valeria, his wife before meeting Lolita, and Rita, his adult lover after Lolita abandons him. I thought it needed more voice-overs from the book. Particularly during the first night at the Enchanted Hunters - the culmination of fate and HH's plans - it could have been used to get a deeper feeling of his internal mental struggle - I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness, and then later ...and less than 6 inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous Lolita! Also, his depression after Lolita abandons him did not feel as strong as in the book, and some more voice-over could have helped there. I would have loved to see HH tape that good-bye note to Rita's navel when he leaves her to track down Lo after getting Lo's letter. Although Rita is somewhat of a rebound for him she does give him needed companionship, and the fact that he drops her immediately with not much regret only reinforces that fact he is hopelessly in love with Lolita. The biggest problem I have with either movie is the ending. The last page or two is possibly the most emotionally moving in the book. HH explains his reason for writing the book - ...I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. He expects Lolita to have a long and happy life and gives her some sound words of advice, then we are informed that if we are reading the book then Lolita is dead. It culminates with this...And do not pitu C.Q. One had to choose between him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita. This could and should have been included in a simple prison cell scene at the end. His subsequent death could easily be shown, too. Why resort to the cheap and easy text on the screen? I give the 1997 movie 9 stars. If you want the real deal - read the book, which gets 100 stars.

Not only that but Jeremy Irons has an acting ability that makes me wonder why we're not watching him all day instead of movie floppers like Hugh Jackman- oh, or Matthew McConaughey, who is in the worst flick chicks ever made that it is so disgusting it's not even funny.Its sadness and helplessness is disturbing. The whole movie is suicidal, but it draws you to it because it's so gripping and beautiful in all its darkest parts.To one viewer its incoherent outcry of the need to love and be loved in return is disturbing, when another viewer will find its pedophiliac plot and sexual themes to be the real disturbing piece. You cannot argue that Jeremy Irons plays a pedophiliac man, but that this movie might also stereotype a pedophile is apparent. But to have such a powerful stereotype it's only crucial that there be some truth to it, but let us not mistake or become unable to separate Humbert's depraved love for Lolita from his sick obsession to do anything to have her with only sexual intentions-- which make his character repelling and, of course, disturbing.Most people will either love or hate this movie, but some have found a place in between. I can appreciate its vision of love and desperation- but unfortunately it's for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to draw us from the point that Lolita is a twelve year old girl, which makes the painful scene at the end with Lolita and Humbert completely necessary. Once it seems to lose its track it reminds us again of what's real and what's unacceptable- this shows also with what happened with Lolita's mother. If we did not have that then I'm afraid there would be no closure to justify the lines this movie has crossed over.It's good, and it's bad, and gratefully it acknowledges this.7/10.

In this film we see what we didn't in the first version. For example, the new Lolita looks farther more innocent, and she is farther more perverted. Her opening scene just tells us everything. She isn't aware of her beauty, but once we get inside her character we discover a horrible person, one that pleases herself in some indecent way, that practically sells herself to get thing, fun and money.As for Humbert, we get to another face of this person. In the original we appreciate a man in love with a beautiful creature that is not aware of it. This Humbert is very aware of that, and when he sees Lolita for the first time, he falls in love with her but also, as you may see in his perverted look, that he wants her sexually, and that he hides that with that academic mask of his, burring it so deep that at the end of the film, that just explodes.Of course, if you compare it to the original film you may not like, or like it too much. One must analyze a film for what it is, not for what it should have been. Dominic's performance is just fantastic, and it really gets into the idea of a Lolita -A beautiful creature, that attracts everyone with her sensuality and is not aware of it-, Humbert is a perverted man that unfortunately as also fallen in love, and Charlotte.Melanie Griffith as always been a good actress. Is her character that is not so well created to the idea from the book (which tell that only Navokov knew his characters enough to turn them into real persons) so I'll have to say that the original Charlotte is much better.

And Charlotte didn't even notice the 10-second stare? C'mon!At times, Humbert's discomfort over his own feelings toward her and over being discovered in the situation seemed less than fully credible.Still, as an angry, jealous lover and a grieving confused lover, he was superb. His voice-overs as the narrator really made the film for me. They framed the entire tragedy perfectly. Of the result of his relationship with Annabel, he said Something in my heart remained frozen. And then at the end of the film, he said he regrets not hearing her voice among the chorus of children's voices on the playground. Just a couple of unanswered questions 1. What did Charlotte write in the letters that Humbert burned? 2. Was it Quilty following them all along, or just paranoia?

You can't help but pity Melanie Griffiths' character as the young girls mother.  ***SPOILER***   She and her daughter have this strange competetive relationship and her  character's tragic ending is quite downplayed (as though the mother was just a one-sided, unnecessary obstacle in the story). And of course Jeremy Irons' character is simply using her to get into her daughter's pants. Sorry to be so blunt, but even with all the artsy additives, that's a child molester. Parents, stepfathers, uncles are expected to give respect to the rules and be the strong ones. Whether a 14 yr old girl is suffering from a hormone/romantic overload, it is the adult's place to draw the line.I can't help being bothered by the whole situation - especially with the girl falling for the other gentleman who has an even more severe pathological condition than Jeremy Irons.***SPOILER***   The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I knew he was going to die and I wanted to see him get his just desserts.Perhaps the movie could have been more tolerable with less time spent in bed - less visual sexual situations and images which do not leave your mind after the movie's over. Those long, drawn-out love scenes' you'd expect from a highly-charged romantic flick were unnecessary and purely included for the enjoyment of the voyeuristic audience. You end up feeling like you're just as guilty of the sick obsession he had with this way-too-young girl, and I'm sure anyone with a conscience (and a daughter) would have the same problems.

Unfortunately, Frank Langella's role as Humbert Humbert's walking paranoia is played too far over the top, and the whole last act crumbles and falls apart. I did not think Dominique Swain was much of a presence as the new Lo (she's too lanky to be squirrelly and teasing, she just looks like she's showing off), but Jeremy Irons is very fine as Humbert (though he is perhaps too conventionally good-looking for the role). Melanie Griffith, on the other hand, is totally out of her league as Lo's nagging mother. Lyne's film is full of hypnotic images, but as a film per se it doesn't hold up.

Impossible?  Probably.  But cinema owes no respect to literature, so let's meet Lyne on his own terms.Plot rather dull.  The Humbert/Quilty confrontation is necessarily muffled. Actually, I can't keep this up.  This LOLITA doesn't exist in its own right it suffocates in the shadows of its predecessors.  The whole point of the novel (NOT AGAIN.  GROAN...) was a mocking of ideas of 'plot' and character.  Humbert is a madman (he confesses to many stays at 'sanatoriums' (sic?)), supposedly dying in prison, who manages, in a first draft, to create a work of polished beauty and perfect artistry.  Yeah right.  He is constantly playing games with the reader, with Nabokov playing further games on him and us.  Whole passages, of seemingly vital plot importance, are undermined by parody, pastiche, allusion, word-games.  The vital final clash is played as hysterical farce, as is much of the book.How on earth do you capture this on film?  Kubrick ignored much of the (untranslatable) book to created a masterly black comedy, which forswore Humbert's mendacious viewpoint in favour of Nabokov's more detached eye (funny how the hyperintelligent Vlad failed to notice this).  It is, however, primarily a Kubrickian work, with the source material serving as a blueprint for many of the director's favourite themes, especially the idea of a moral monster as point of audience identification in his struggle with a repressive society.Lyne, rather facilely, thinks that because Kubrick did not stick to the letter of the book, that he somehow betrayed it.  His film is therefore superficially authentic - we are back in 'real' America, not Kubrick's English invention (which actually transliterated very well the book's themes of appearance, pastiche, deception and reproduction).  But throwing in a few 40s signifiers does not a sense of time and locale make, and Lyne completely fails to grasp Nabokov's use and subversion and understanding of popular culture, as one of the two forces shaping Lo.The major impression one gets from the book is the sweltering heat, the 'haze' (also Lo's surname), and this too is faithfully reproduced.  But this only serves to make realistic a novel which is always rupturing into the fantastic.  Lyne makes the fatal error of taking Humbert at his word.  The glorious mixture of wild, disturbing farce and poignant melancholy of the book, is seriously unbalanced by almost completely obliterating the former, and drowning the film in the latter.  Yes, we sympathise with Humbert, but he's a fiend - he has sex with pubescent girls; he enjoys his mastery and their pain; he tries to murder Charlotte, and only fails because he is too timid; he drugs Lo so that he can sleep with her unawares; the money he so generously offers her at the end was hers anyway, through her mother.  I mention these examples because they are suppressed in the film, as it tries to make of Humbert a tragic figure.  This is helped by the fact that Dominique Swain, wonderful nymphet that she is (although the ideal Lolita is surely Shirley Temple), is far too old, tall and beautiful for Lo in an age where Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery are a viable box-office item, there doesn't seem to be anything all that distasteful about the relationship.And so the film is actually profoundly scared of the book, not daring to make us sympathise with an absolute monster.  The casting of Jeremy Irons conspires in this.  He is superb, his best since DEAD RINGERS, but he is not Humbert, he has no madness, no poetry; more like Charles Ryder twenty years on.  James Mason specialised in suave lunatics, and his perceived 'coldness' is a perfect interpretation of Nabokov's Humbert, as opposed to Humbert's self-image.  This LOLITA is as safe as can be - there is hardly any sex at all (I mean, we wouldn't want to offend anyone, would we?); the style is glossy and fatuous, TV-movie blandness, abandoning Nabokov's figurative language, and offering none of its own.  The detailed descriptions of landscape in the novel have an untranslatable moral import Lyne gives us a few blurry shots of trees.  The film is such a mockery of Nabokov that when we do get unimaginatively large chunks from the novel, they actually, unbelievably, sound daft.  The Quilty climax, one of the funniest scenes in literature, and perfect in the Kubrick (with Sellers how could it not be?) is reduced to FATAL ATTRACTION-style psychodrama (Nabokov, even beyond the grave, was spot on about modern cinema).  Once again, Lo's anguish, in the hands of a 'sensitive' male (Lyne), is reduced to hysteria. Very sporadically, there are moments of cheeky Nabokovian farce (especially when Humbert checks that Charlotte is asleep, and the interviews with Lo's principal), but the Nabokov tone is never caught, the sense of cartoon, non-sequitur, and sheer charming Humbert bull, is rejected as not being highbrow enough.  By trying to be so serious, the film ends up looking silly.

Nobody could dispute it. But beyond this positive point there are some characteristics of the movie that make it just middling as an artistic creation.Lyne's direction uncovers his unsuccessful effort to let on the film his personal stamp. What he finally succeeds is the fact that we do not understand if we watch a film noir (surrealistic plans similar to those in The Third Man), a psychological drama directed by David Cronenberg (the chill we watch on the screen is supported by the without-feeling way of acting) or a boring James Ivory film! The performances - except of Dominique Swain's - are really tragical. Jeremy Irons is so bad as he could never be. Sometimes he makes you believe that he is not acting but just reading indifferently the script.At this point I should emphasize Steven Schiff's impotence in rendering some of the great moments of Nabokov's novel. For example find in the book the point at which Dr. Humbert Humbert sees Lolita for the first time and try to compare it to the correlative scene. In this way you will find out what I am talking about. Schiff is also unable to analyze Humbert's character. Someone who has just read a few pages of the book will easily understand that Humbert is a complexed personality, a man sinking in his unrealized lusts -which outrun every moral limit- and trying to save himself by creating an imaginary world for him and his Lolita. However Schiff does not seem to have understood it .Closing this comment I have to say that Dominique Swain's performance is remarkable as she manages to combine in a perfect way the innocence of a 13 years old girl with her developing eroticism, without having to be seductive.

It's strange that Adrian Lyne, the director of Fatal Attraction and 9 and a half weeks, films that are hardly subtle, was given the job of directing Lolita.But Lolita the film and Lolita the book are apparently about two different topics, and here I'm going to draw  from The Australian's Evan Williams for enlightenment because I haven't read Vladimir Nabokov's novel.According to Williams Lolita the novel was an amused and pitiless exploration of the springs of American popular culture. The hopelessness of Humbert's sexual  passion stood, in a sense, for the hopelessness of any engagement between  Nabokov's ideal world - that of European culture and refinement - and the world of Dolores Haze (the young Lolita). Lolita was a complex satire on American consumerism.In other words the novel wasn't a salacious skin flick about incest. Neither is this film really. It's stuck somewhere in the middle, between an ironic black comedy and a failed love affair, and that's a difficult world for a film to inhabit.So Adrian Lyne's version of Lolita (Stanley Kubrick made another in 1962) seems confused, perhaps especially so if you haven't read the book.The plot tells of an academic called Humbert (Jeremy Irons) who in at least his forties falls hopelessly in love with a fourteen year old girl who he calls Lolita.He marries her mother (Melanie Griffith) who is soon dispatched from the film leaving Humbert and his daughter to each other as they travel around America in a cute wooden panelled car in 1947. There is a climax but it's puzzlingly surreal and out of step with most of the rest of the movie. Somehow Lolita doesn't quite make sense.Lolita however is beautifully filmed. It's full of outstandingly presented interiors and exteriors shot through the soft filters we'd expect for a wistful romantic drama.It is also superbly cast. Melanie Griffith as the mother was perfect as Lolita's sloppy and inattentive mother. Any child of hers would have tended to have been spoilt and disrespectful.Jeremy Irons was right in his element. His Humbert is frightfully worried. He should be. He's hopelessly in love with his daughter.Young Dominique Swain plays Lolita with avid gum popping enthusiasm. And I'd imagine that Nobokov might well have portrayed her that way in his novel. She would have fitted beautifully into a black comedy.But because Lolita isn't ironic and because it concentrates almost entirely on Humbert's predicament, even leaving the young girl's motivations out of the picture, it only becomes a strange tale of thwarted love.And then you would have to argue that we really needed to have more than the limited glimpses of what the girl might be thinking. After all there are very good reasons for the taboo on adults allowing themselves to become sexually involved with children!But if, as Evan Williams and many aspects of the film suggests, Lolita is meant to be wild satire on consumerism ( I was strongly reminded of The Coen Brother's Barton Fink at one stage) then it could have been a triumph.And if it was only about falling in love with the wrong person then at least we should have been introduced to the child's pain as well as Humbert's. And then it's middle reel mightn't have dragged as it did.But still Lolita does offer plenty for discussion.

In case you are unfamiliar with the novel, here's a bit of background. Published in the 50s, Lolita is the pornographic tale of an 12 year old girl who engages in a lurid sexual relationship with her nympholeptic step-father. No, you didn't read that wrong I said TWELVE YEARS OLD!! Nabokov had a lot of trouble bringing the book to press - the only people who would touch it were some sex novel publishers - and Lyne had a lot of the same difficulty. Distributors were afraid that audiences would be offended, and so Lyne had to bring out the film on TV. With good reason! I can only say that it saddens me that Showtime ever gave this sorry excuse for a movie a chance...and also that they gave America's perverts a chance to watch it! You MUST keep your children away from this monstrosity at all costs cover their ears if you happen to chance across one of their classmates' progressive parents, shield their eyes whenever in the vicinity of a movie theatre, and if they should speak of this despicable film...well I at least wouldn't hesitate to give them the discipline that the movie's heroine so obviously needs. It is essential that you be alert for the possibility of corruption - a movie this scandalous will draw the seculars like butterflies to a flame. I hesitate to discuss the actual movie at all, out of a fear that even hearing about it might provoke your curiosity and lead you into temptation and also because reading about the movie is or should be a sin in itself. Even typing this out for you sends a shiver down my spine. In the end, though, I think that there is a greater good to be served by the certainty that I will deter readers who might otherwise have subjected themselves to the movie from that future error. Jeremy Irons plays the villainous Humbert Humbert, who comes to America in order to lecture at a reprehensibly elite college. He meets the disgusting Charlotte Haze, with whom he becomes a boarder and eventually a husband. This Haze woman, played by Melanie Griffith, is a portrait of vapid and loathsome sensuality. Her unveiled come-ons (before their marriage!) are absolutely sickening. In fact, this side of Griffith's portrayal is perhaps the movie's sole redeeming moral lesson the utter undesirability of this woman and the sexual so-called pleasures she has to offer should help us in our fervent quest to keep our children pure. This repugnant sensuality is clearly the element shared by the little and big Hazes. Dominique Swain, in the title role, magnifies her mother's charms to a monstrous degree. We see, for example, her reading the funny pages, hair lank with sweat and exertion, toes curling, tendons straining, rocking, breathing deeply, bare leg, breathing more deeply, moaning&#x85;before Lyne cruelly cuts away. Or later, we see the temptress prostitute herself for a raise in her allowance. Wherever did she learn to rub her hands so teasingly along her step-father's leg? The viewer, shuddering spasmodically, struggles to think. And Irons, with that bare, well-muscled chest, is hardly innocent in these exchanges either. Incidentally, I have not seen the film.
