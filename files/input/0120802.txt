I was mildly intrigued by descriptions of the story I had read and with the trailer, so I thought to take a chance. I took someone very close to me, an actual violin prodigy. Coincidently, her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans, so we could relate to parts of the plot first-hand. We arrived to a very thin theater in one of those mega-complex theaters, and while everyone was queuing up next-door to see the latest blockbuster from Hollywood I settled into an amazingly comfortable seat with an excellent view and prepared for whatever might come.I was shocked. This film turned out to be clearly one of the best movie going experiences I have had in ages. We see this as the story unfolds and is creatively told through the reading of the violin makers wife's fortune with a deck of Tarot cards. It is the story of a part of the life of a violin; of the humans who would dare to possess her beauty. A masterpiece of a craftsman's art, it is desired by many for it's acoustic perfection. But, as Tolstoy said, how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. Or more interestingly, from Saint Augustine Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked. There seems to be a curse on this instrument as it brings ill to those who manage to possess it. This makes the ending especially eerie.An original, imaginative and thought provoking story that engaged one's mind as American films almost never do. I will not describe more of the plot, it's far too good to ruin. The memory of this film will be one long treasured.Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.

While this guy is also a member of the Academy and has steered me to some pretty good picks in the past, I walked into the theater fearing the usual letdown that invariably follows going into a film with overly high expectations (i.e. The English Patient, The Truman Show, etc.) This film not only managed to exceed my expectations, it restored my faith in the magic and mystery of cinema altogether.We start with a rather simple but cleverly structured story about a very unique red violin that emblematically (and quite literally for that matter) takes on the heart and fate of a 16th century Italian woman as it passes across several centuries and continents on its way to the auction block in present day Montreal.  The unfolding vignettes reveal more and more about the nature of this instrument and, when strung together in the bigger picture, play out like finely orchestrated movements of a great sonata; each movement plucking out its own stirring and poignant variation on theme.  I was so swept up in the majesty and spectacle of this film that it didn't even occur to me until much later that the violin is nothing less than a personification of beauty itself (okay, okay, maybe I'm starting to overly deconstruct things here in retrospect, but the parallels are too perfect to remain unexplored). It's fascinating to watch both the transformative and destructive power of this beauty as it's placed into the hands of a sensitive young boy, a self absorbed musical protege, and a remorseful ring leader of a totalitarian regime.  Much praise goes to director Francois Girard in how he refrained from overplaying the social and moral commentary, repeating this theme at mostly an emotional level rather than an intellectual one -- much in the same way that beauty itself, to some degree anyway, defies analytical discussion and belongs in the realm of pure and simple experience.  You obviously can't dissect it, as co-writer Don McKellarÂ¹s onscreen character thought to do, and so it remains as it was in it's original form timeless, magical, elusive.  The stuff that pompous nobility and rich collectors the world over will offer a king's ransom for and still never manage to posses in the end.Performances were good to great all around.  It's hard to go wrong with Samuel L. Jackson in a leading role and I appreciated the fact that the actors actually appeared to be playing the violin on camera, as opposed to watching the typical hokey cutaways and cheat shots often associated with onscreen musical performances; nauseating contrivances that always tear down the wall of suspended disbelief with a resounding crash. The costuming, set design and cinematography were absolutely stunning (Oscar nominations soon to follow I'm sure) without taking center stage from the story. I especially loved the amazing period recreations of China and Austria.  I felt like I was fully transported in both space and time to these places and walking among people who really belonged there.Overall I would rate this one as a true film classic on the level of masterpiece. Perhaps this is in part due to my love for music and the undeniable fact that, being the sentimental guy that I am, I'm always a sucker for haunting open-ended films like this where you leave the theater in a half daze, pondering all the implications, mesmerized by the lingering imagery. I'm still speculating about the future of Mr. Moritz and what will ultimately happen when beauty is placed into the hands of our modern world.

Recommended by a good friend I went to see this piece and frankly, I came out of the theater speechless! I was overwhelmed, enriched as well as happy that I finally, in years, got to see something that's well worth while.From the story, costumes, cinematography, acting and finally its greatest actor -the superb music- all absolutely flawless! S.L.Jackson acts at his best, his performance is unforgettable and I am sure one of his own most favourite; I can tell. I was estatic to see J.Corigliano win the Oscar for the best score, and saddened at the fact that the whole movie wasn't nominated for even more Oscars - are they blind in that Academy or what?! Now that's a shame but you know what I don't care what the Academy has to say, important is my subjective feeling and this movie made my day, and days to come.I couldn't wait to get hold of both, the video and the sound track, and I never seem to get tired watching or hearing that beauty all over again. And believe it or not, that ingenious soundtrack can be so erotic at times that if I may give a little advice to all these men out there seeking to entice and seduce their partners - hey, this might be the way to go - worked for me (and her!)!!!Anyways, I'd like to recommend this movie to everybody with an open heart and mind, I guarantee satisfaction and enrichment in every possible way. And lastly let me bestow my gratitude and thanks to the very director F.Girard for enlightening my spirit, my heart and my soul with his vision of a truly quality story that I can never forget.

The adventure begins with Anna, a young woman whose only child brings about her untimely death.  A gift of a violin to be given to the babe becomes host to Anna's spirit.  The Red Violin narrowly escapes the grips of greed, ignorance, and vengeful lust as she is passed from hand to hand of those who would have her.  She wanders about the globe until at last she is exonerated by the one man who knows the truth that she holds within her wooden belly.In spite of the death and despair, the film is truly positive.  It teaches us to appreciate people from all walks of life.  From the violin maker of the 16th century who made the Red Violin for the bittersweet arrival of his baby son, we travel through time with the violin to the Chinese Communist Party who spelled out certain death to any instrument that may threaten the ideals of the collective.  In our travels, we learn the dark and sordid side to each person, but we also learn that to create a shadow there must be light.  That light, or hope, that the people shed is what gives the violin her vitality and will to survive.A truly magnificent film, The Red Violin inspired me to recollect my own past I shared with my aged upright piano; the certain spiritual vibrations I felt while playing a ragtime melody.  Suddenly, memories came rushing back to me tenfold.  I recalled the times as a young girl I would listen as my father played his rendition of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag.  Wiping a tear from my eye, I remembered how long ago that truly was; how my piano shaped and molded me, as I shaped and molded it.  I am left wondering where my beloved piano is now.  Who is influencing his instrumental life?  In the end, what stories will he have to tell, and will they be of meTake the journey of the Red Violin.  Visit other lands and other times. Feel the strings of life against your fingers; the bow of spirit in your palm.  Rest your chin against the weathered wood of wisdom.  Listen closely and hear the music that is the gentle rhythm of time and change.  See the film to learn about music; to learn about history; to learn the boundless raptures of the spirit.  Perhaps, as I, you will learn just a little more about yourself.

Co-screenwriters Francois Girard (who directed) and Don McKellar (who acts in the film) structure the movie around a wealth of richly detailed locales, including Vienna, China, and Oxford, and provide a unique modern-day Montreal framework which intertwines with the often tragic history of the instrument to provide the narrative with a rather unique element of mystery.  The late-19th century English section shows the film at its most baroque, but each of the finely tuned tales reaches for some truth about music, life, love, and passion -- and that is commendable.

The segments follow a violin for 3 centuries obviously shooting for a wide range of settings, thus a wide range of stories and characters. But they are all much different. The Red Violin will be rewarding for those who pay attention, and a pain for those who don't, because the transaction of the violin from person to person isn't smooth, whoever is not willing to pay attention should steer clear. I definitely recommend it to all big movie buffs, because those willing to see it, should. I really enjoyed Don Mcellars work before, and this is no different. Some segments, like 'Vienna' are very enjoyable and sad (in a good way, like bambi's mom getting shot) well some like 'Oxford' are dark and depressing.

Ambitious is a good start.  This film was very well crafted and at about one hundred forty minutes was too short for me.  The story follows a red violin, an inanimate object, although at times it seemed alive to me, thru three centuries and the influences good and ill that it has on its possessors.  It does ever seem to be owned.  Each of its possessors lives a life of passion and turmoil.  The violin's birth is during turmoil and during its life it buried, shot, and almost burned.  The writing which includes this parallel between the violin and its possessor , five somewhat independent segments that mell and converge in the final scenes, and a story told by tarot cards make for an extremely unique experience.  Add to that the musical score, scenery, the varied languages and cultures and you have a great offering.  The performances were all strong, but I thought Jason Flemyng as Lord Frederick Pope stood out.  To say his character was eccentric and maybe a little over the top is justifiable but I'm sure that was intended.  English nobility has always been known for its idiosyncrasies.  The ending has incongruous feel with     the remainder of the film but is satisfactory and I can not suggest a better one.  Great entertainment!  Three and a half stars!!!

Â«The Red ViolinÂ» whole story is based on a piece of wood and strings, which carries a whole story of humanity and social issues. We travel through 400 years of history and music, to end up in what you might think is the end of the story of the Â«red violinÂ» but in fact, takes you to the next chapter.If you are a classical and historical music fan, you will love this movie. The Oscar to composer John Corigliano was not an option. FranÃ§ois Girard clearly has something for music, as he did another wonderful movie about pianist Glenn Gould, Â«Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn GouldÂ», a movie that really drives us through the life of a great piano interpreter. Quite different from Â«The Red ViolinÂ», but quite good too. I can't wait to see his next movie, if he ever plans to do one, but the challenge to surpass Â«The Red ViolinÂ» is quite big.

First there is the small violin shop where it is made, and the tragedy around this particular model, the maker's last. It's supposed to come from the same era as the Strad and other timeless fiddles. It's a great place to begin a story filled with mysteries (and the mystery of a great violin, it's shape, wood, and varnish, is given high tech reinforcement in the end with an electronic awe). So the violin is born.And it moves from a Austrian orphanage (with an unbelievable prodigy) to generations of gypsies (some interesting filming with the violin suspended in space as one after another player takes it up) to a crackpot British prodigy (who acts more like a rock star and an indulgent one, if that's not redundant). Finally it winds its way (not so improbably, because life is weird) to China, which of course echoes the modern rise of the Asian virtuosi coming from that part of the world.So the tale is the history of a violin, a possessed one. The spirit of the instrument seems to inhabit the movie. This is reinforced by an Italian fortune-teller (a kindly witch) who has an early Tarot deck. The Tarot was not used for divination that early--it was introduced a card game in Northern Italy in the late 1400s--but that's okay, because it works into the plot really well. Five cards are chosen by the pregnant wife of the master violin maker. Each is turned over for another twenty minute chapter in the movie. In a key moment, the wife asks the fortune teller, what if I don't like what it says, what if it's evil? And the fortune teller says, I'll pretend not to notice. Promptly the moon is the first card, the most ominous card in the deck (I've studied tarot a bit, which is why, weirdly enough, I watched the movie). But the fortune teller doesn't say that doom is facing the pregnant wife. Instead she lies, and the movie takes one turn after another.You might think this is brilliant stuff, and it has the trappings of that. It could have been, with some slight twist of intentions, artfully transcendent. But it's a hair long at times, and by the last (modern) scenes, a bit cold and unfulfilling. I don't know the solution to what might have worked, but I know it left me interested and curious by the end, not quite bowled over, which is clearly (on the sleeve) the intention.Still, an engaging, musically rich tapestry of great scenes, great music, and a brimming story. Recommended, with slight reservations. "}{"Title":"Not perfect, but mighty close!

It takes only a few seconds to know that this gem did NOT emanate from the money grubbers in Hokeywood California as one more way to titillate teenagers with sex, violence, and computer generated special effects with a subliminal message that sells products. Nope! This film was made by film makers who understand the power of a story well told, and REAL cinema.Cutting back and forth repeatedly between the present and various disparate periods and places from the past, THE RED VIOLIN forces the viewer to pay attention and most of all...

Jackson as a learned expert in ancient instruments was not convincing for me personally. And, the NON-ending which is more of a comment on human habits of acquisition than human nobility, was just not what I considered a definitive ending. (Maybe that was the point!

With all of it fitting nicely into 2 hours of great cinema, drawn from a most exceptional story. Perhaps I should say stories - as there are many, and of course the stories are about people.I don't think a great cast necessarily means famous names, lengthy reputations, or even a lot of acting experience - but one that simply works well. Meaning actors (or acting ability) that fit the characters, with a flow of believability or at least the right feel. Some of the best movies I've ever seen have had several cast members that were never heard of before or after being seen in the one film I saw them in. Here everyone fits. From the child prodigy in Vienna to the instrument expert in Montreal (Samuel Jackson) - this film is well cast. Shot on location in at least 4 different countries, this is storytelling at it's best. One of my favorite films, it is one of the truest examples of what good movie making is all about. It also happens to have an inanimate object (a violin) as one of the stars of the show. Like so many of the rare occasions in your life when something happening seems like a dream come true, it would sound like a fairy tale if you told it. It's that way here.

Whew.  Let's not be hasty, selfish or unreasonable. Sure this movie had it's flaws.  The Locale's may have seemed just a teensy bit artificial(the most common critique), but downing the movie because Sam Jackson stole the violin, and on top of that attributing it to his color is downright UNCALLED FOR!And further more, to say that the times we live in are the reason for us over looking the fact the violin was whisked away immorally is a clear fall back on cliche for a lack of intelligence.  Because that's what this person is challenging.  The morality of what Jackson did in the closing moments of the movie.  If we were to really analyze the morality from each owner to the next, we would find that morality was not really the wave of fortune the violin was riding on(it was stolen from a grave for crying out loud, not to mention almost burned for simply being... a violin).  If not liking it because of it's closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then I don't know what is.This movie, as shockingly revealed as it was, was not about the life of this inanimate object.  Surely the violin did not have a life.  It was merely the carrier for the essence of the character of Anna Bussotti, Nicolo's wife. Because he used her to complete the instrument, it was endowed with her essence.  That is where you are to find your morality in the tale.  That life, our life, our essence, our being, is lived not only in our bodies, in these pathetic heaps of flesh and bone, but in everything around us.  The morality is that Nicolo's love for his wife, made her immortal in the violin, and her song, was a gift passed down to each of the ones touched by the violin's life.Therefore it is quite inconsequential, the morality of the people(and their actions) and events surrounding the violin, to say that it is the times we live in, or the race of the man stealing the violin, because the story encompasses a much higher enlightenment.  Easily seen, too, if you don't analyze the mistemperments and shortcomings of the people surrounding the voilin to a point where they consume your vision, blocking the true lesson or moral, or whatever you want to call it.  The lesson, or better put  the essence of life.Tres bien by Girard.  An easy 10/10.

The storyline is very moving and touches upon a host of emotions. A majority of the movie has foreign language, but you can activate the subtitles. I watched it first without the subtitles and was so taken by the movie, I watched it a second time with the titles and realized I had missed very little. The actions and facial expressions of the people do an excellent job of revealing their emotions. Trying to read the titles became distracting. I didn't need them so I turned them off. There were several instances where the hauntingly beautiful music gave me goosebumps. I certainly hope it touches you as deeply as it did me. As the movie progressed, I began to suspect the fortune teller was speaking not of the life of the expectant woman sitting before her, but of the violin. That point is not made clear until the final minutes of the movie. To tell you more would ruin the ending. When you learn how the violin acquired its captivating shade of red you will most likely be stunned at first, but then touched by the thought behind it and the bittersweetness of the moment.

That so-called in-crowd believes that every movie that hasn't been made by a big studio is great art and that all other movies are bad. Never tell them that sometimes the opposite can be true, because they can't and won't believe you. Well, I'm not one of them and I watch all movies with a critical eye. And yes, I try to see as many of those alternative movies as well. But that's just because I'm a movie buff who is interested in all kinds of movies, not because I'm convinced that this kind of movies is automatically a lot better than the rest. In this movie we don't follow some people, but a violin on its journey through time and the world. The movie starts in present day Montreal, where the red violin, a famous Nicolo Bussotti violin, is being auctioned off. But instead of staying with the auction all the time, we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monastery/orphanage, a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame, but also bad luck and despair, often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller. It actually tried to be original and it succeeded very well. Another thing that I also really liked was the fact that not every detail of the movie was clear until the end (for instance why the fortune teller's predictions come true, but not for the woman, but for the violin instead.). It sometimes seems that the creators of movies don't even bother about adding some mystery in their movies anymore and I really miss that. That's probably why I liked it so much in this one.Once in a while you come across a movie that you might call a gem. Well, The Red Violin is one of those truly magnificent gems. It's beautiful in every possible way. The music is excellent (although you better love violin music, because that's all you'll here), the acting is very nice and the story really is very beautiful.

The Red Violin is supposed to (in the story) be unique in all the world.

Anyone who is a fan of great film and not just the mainstream, mega blockbuster, more cgi than story will love this movie. The fact that the movie is based on the violin rather than the people (which isn't a new idea) is what makes this film great because it shows that objects in our lives have stories all their own. I also loved this movie because I'm a huge Samuel L. Jackson fan and this is one of his best roles to date (other than Pulp Fiction of course) because I didn't know if I was supposed to like him or not until the very end. I also liked the twist involved with the origin of the violin's color because it was totally unexpected. Bottom line this movie was great and one of the best of the year.P.S. - If you liked this try Twenty Bucks with Steve Buscemi, Christopher Lloyd, Brenden Fraser, and Elizabeth Shue. It uses the same idea of an object passing from person to person but in a span of a couple of days not centuries.

The creation of the violin in Renaissance Italy mirrors the rise of Classical music and, with it, of modern Western culture.  It moves from time to time, from place to place, always falling into the hands of those who are, in some way, greedy.

The music was incredible and considering I gave up learning the violin after Grade 1, I've found new respect and love for the music they produce.  Just felt swept away by the music from the child prodigy, the gypsies and the English virtuoso.The story was reminiscent of The Yellow Rolls Royce with the main protagonist now being a violin.  I thought it was obvious why and how the violin is red but the revealing scene still drew gasps from the audience. So is the violin cursed consequently or just an innocent instrument of fate.Wonderful way of introducing each chapter via the Tarot Cards and ending each through a prospective bidder at the auction.  Initially, I was discontented with Samuel Jackson's character and his eventual prized acquisition but I realised that this is not the end but in fact, another beginning.

Most of the film is beautiful and interesting, but it disintegrates when the American actors and English lines take center stage.  The spoken text is awkward and stilted.  As a result, Samuel L. Jackson is wooden and doesn't seem to have any reason for stealing the violin.  He looks neither in love, nor obsessed with an object he supposedly pursued his whole career.  At times he has sudden outburst as if the actor suddenly remembered he was supposed to be at the end of his wits.  At other times you can almost hear him saying I can't believe I'm even saying these lines, somebody please rescue me from this film.  I could have easily believed Jackson in this role, but the dialogue and his mistrust for it makes it impossible.  Rent the video, and stop the film before he and his even more wooden co-star start saying things like (paraphrasing for effect) You don't have children?  No, but I know what you mean.  I just want to take this violin apart.  Or It's like it's this thing . . .  Also, equally unbelievable is when the violin maker rushes in to see the body of his dead wife, sending everyone, including the nurse holding the dead baby, out of the room.

I apologize if I may offend anyone, I just feel that I need to give this movie a fair trial.This movie is unique in the fact that it really don't have a main character. Well, it does, but it involves an inanimate object; the red violin. And when you know, if a movie is character based, there will have to be 'attachments (added values/importance)' to this main character, similar to many other movies like The Godfathers 2 etc.but in this case, it is a violin. This movie is also unique in the fact that it has two 'central point' that tells the story; the auction and the tarot cards. In most cases there is only one or at all; like the bus stop in Forrest Gump.I agree in a certain degree that this movie is about antique collecting. But I will go as far as it is present in the movie but it is not by any means to be the sole purpose of the movie. (Like requiem for a dream is about only drug uses or pulp fiction is only about killing people) I agree, in the light of music's meaning, putting too much emphasis on a musical instrument is wrong. But in the light of a main character in a story, it is an inevitable step. But I would also suggest in my humble opinion, putting music on the emphasis on the musical instrument OR the musician is just as bad. To say music is the musician is like worshipping Mozart of his status and values and not his music. Music IS NOT the musician. One hand can't make a sound. No matter how good you are, you can't play the Hungarian Rhapsody on a out of tune piano. Music lives in the relationship between the two parties and it should not exist even in the realms of space nor time. It is the interpretation/understanding that is triggered within a subjective perceiver. Hence, it can never be truly spoken of nor discussed. So if this is the case, movies that promote musicians like `Mr. Holland's Opus' or `Amadeus' will all fall within this error. But of course, there are certain limitations to a movie and all movies have to base on a character whether if it is Forrest Gump or The Red Violin.This movie talks alittle about auctions of a number of antiques. But is it just about collecting them? What about the monks? Do you think they want the violin because they want to collect violins for their monetary values? If so, why get the same one that happens to be related to them? There must be more than just antique collecting.Is this just an object of history and not history itself. But wouldn't we not say that history is composed of objects/events (that is related to objects in the space-time)? It is the summation of these important events/objects that give history its meaning. The sum that makes up the whole; one can't talk about the whole without its sum. It is like trying to picture someone you love in the past. It is hard to picture that person out of context. You need to picture that person in context of something you have done/ shared the same event together.Did Sammuel steal the violin because he wants to rebel against capitalistic values? Do you think he did all that inorder to spike the society? (If you want this issue addressed, red violin may not be the best movie to go, try Fight Club).  Did you think that when the 17th Century violin maker used blood to paint an instrument from his beloved wife, he was thinking consciously, `ahh, this will be later of great value to both antique lovers and musicians and I will be rich, rich I say, RICH! Or do you think that he was just feeling pain and anger and love and hatred and emotions and things which logic and rationality that can't explain LIKE what music does to people. Don't analyze music; you can't. Once you start to analyze music, it no longer music but notes on a page.So what is this movie about? It is about a musical instrument, its history, and the relationship of it with the musicians throughout the course of its life. It survives longer than men, and so it may seem alittle ridiculous. But having in mind that this movie is not an account of facts but of storytelling. It also symbolses that comparing to love/music/beauty, men is minute.It does not matter how virtuous the little girl is that the father hands down the violin to, it does not matter. Nor do I think that the pleasure one finds in music or the meaning/emotions one find in music is not equal to what grade of piano you have hanging on your wall. To be able to understand the true meaning of opera does not entail you to be a fat lady. If one thinks about music parallel to skills or notation on a page, music is no more than an illusion.Is it just about music, no. But it is related to music as it is suggested in the relationship it has with all of its owners. The love and the meaning triggered by this violin is beyond words.  The symbol played by this inanimate object is a great one. It resemble freedom, love, greed, ownership, beauty and music; all entities in men. It is a pure neutral entity that will transform to whatever to the musician's subjective desired.I hope whoever is reading this will see both sides of the coin.

It's not giving much away to say that the red violin is imperilled more than once; and I was sitting in my seat, mentally screaming to the director Kill off some of the characters if you want, maim and injure them, but for God's sake, don't hurt the violin!  I don't think I could stand to watch even an ordinary violin damaged.  As for a surpassingly beautiful and sonorous violin, centuries old and perhaps with centuries yet to live ... well, it's no stretch at all to say that such an instrument would be more important than most of us, certainly more important than I.  So why shouldn't it be a central character?  Fictional characters simply have to (a) have things happen to them, and (b) make us care what happens to them.  They needn't do anything else.This is an amazing film.  The violin comes to life, so to speak, in five different eras (and countries), and every one of them is perfectly realised - it's a joy just to watch the temporal scenery.  (Perhaps the third of the five eras, early Edwardian England, is a little harder to swallow than the rest, with its aristocratic violinist who extemporises great music while having sex.  Really!  As if the resulting compositions would have the slightest value.)  It's interesting that the evocation of time and place is NOT accomplished by musical means.  Almost all the music we hear was composed by John Corigliano, and he makes his music as hard to pin down to any one age as he can.  This was an excellent idea.  It gives the violin a character, and makes it seem more powerful than any of the forces temporarily besetting it.  It also suits the story in a way I'm not at liberty to reveal.Although it's easy to be absorbed in The Red Violin, be warned that the human interest in each of the five eras is subservient to the violin interest.  If you are one of those people who can't easily care about a musical instrument much of the film will be lost on you.

The story shows how the violin gets passed from one owner to another.  The violin is, at first, constructed by a violin craftsman and then is given to a monastary, some gypsies, a wealthy British violinist, an owner in China and finally at a present day Montreal auction.  What I found amazing about this film is how each of stories come together seemlessly by the end of the movie.  That is typical of most Canadian movies and I think that formula is great.  I also liked how the Talot card reader's predictions match the events of the film.  It gives the story a sense of spirtuality.

Well, from my perspective anyway.The Red Violin takes you through 3 main stories, with two more narratives that are used to tie them together.  The fortune teller tells the story of the Violin from the past, viewing the future through prediction.  At the same time the appraisers of today derive the past through scientific discovery.  The three central stories are very different from each other, and the switching between can seem abrupt.  But it's meant to.  The shock of Chinese story keeps the audience from getting complacent.Although others might have found the characters in each story not fleshed out enough, it is my opinion that they are supporting characters only. They are not the story, the Violin is.If you want to see Stevan Segal in a movie, don't see this one.  There is no great action.  There is no giant climax.  But the scenery and music is masterful.  The mood is haunting.  And the story is compelling.This movie is a good one to rent on a quiet evening when you can curl up and have no distractions.

Through these characters, we explore the universal human propensities for fear, passion, jealousy, love, greed, oppression and survival in even the most dire of circumstances. Like many anthology films, The Red Violin loses some of its emotional force through the fact that the characters, by their very nature, cannot be fully developed and therefore tend a bit toward type.  However, each segment is so lovingly created in terms of setting, costume and cinematography, that the viewer is drawn into the many worlds the film creates. The most impressive part of the film is the brilliant overlapping time structure that is remarkably complex and creates a tremendous amount of excitement and tension in the last half hour of the film when all the elements from the various narrative skeins are pulled together to reveal the whole picture.  In fact, the last half hour, in which the violin is restored and the man in charge (played by Samuel L. Jackson) must confront a moral dilemma, lifts the film to a plane far higher than one expects it to go. The surprise ending is also very brave for trusting the audience to accept a morally ambiguous resolution. All in all, this is a mighty impressive achievement.

Canada has generated scores of famous actors - Michael J. Fox, Jim Carrey, Donald Sutherland, William Shatner, John Candy, and Neve Campbell to name but a few, but Hollywood's empire of film production has drawn them all down south, while, ironically, so many US films are shot in Canada (especially Vancouver).In the past, Canada made the odd good, low budget film (Who Has Seen the Wind, The Grey Fox) but in the past decade, its government has been setting more funds aside for the development of its entertainment and culture industry. The result has been the creation of about one very good film per year (Decline of the American Empire, Jesus of Montreal, Black Robe, Exotica, and The Sweet Hereafter to name a few).Just as Canadian film-makers borrowed England's Helena Bonham Carter in making Margaret's Museum, the latest Canadian creation - The Red Violin - features a well known US actor - Samuel L. Jackson. Perhaps we have done this as a drawing card to attract attention to great films that, because they are Canadian made, run the danger of passing unnoticed outside of the country.I glowed after watching this heart-galvanizing spectacle of beauty out of slight feelings of humble patriotism, seeing that my country really is capable of landing a winner in the movie making game. Everything is likable about The Red Violin - great acting, dialogue, production, cinematography, music (score), compelling characters, and interesting stories woven together into a work of art. And, just think, this was pulled off without Hollywood's gargantuan enterprise of talent, experience, and funding. WAY TO GO, EH!

What the mother does not know (and the fortune teller can't see in her cards) is that the fortune being told is actually that of a violin. How the mother's fortune got mixed up with that of a violin is revealed only at the end of the film.Samuel L. Jackson, always one for lingering facial shots that allow his remarkable ability to display subtile emotion to be fully utilized, turns in a fine performance that holds the film together, and also gives the film an extra kick as his character participates in a bit of premeditated subterfuge (how premeditated is also not apparent until the end) that gives another nice twist to the film and really helps to advance the character of the plot through the ending and beyond; the violin's story is obviously far from complete (here is where Hollywood will often screw up - they will take a film and staple the ending down so that the story has no life, but is rather obviously yet another project of an uninspired writer). Here we see that the contemporary portion of the plot is not an end but only another stage. Not profound perhaps, but compared to usual Hollywood garbage it seems profound.Throughout the film is fine music, in many styles, depicting the various persons who own the violin (kudos to Joshua Bell, the superb violinist who does all the playing where the red violin is concerned). How the violin affects them, and to a lesser degree, how they affect it, is the work of the great variety between episodes. And they are not all shaped by the same cookie cutter either. Each person is fascinating in their own right, and this would make a fine movie even without the violin (but how else to tie the episodes together so nicely?) And yet, each episode is represented in the contemporary scenes, as it is slowly revealed that the bulk of the bidders in the exclusive Montreal auction house are somehow related to the various historical characters, and wish to recapture the magic that they know once influenced their lives and fortunes.One more point; in most films where actors pretend to play instruments, it is painfully apparent that they are doing no such thing. My hat is off to the film makers for managing to portray various figures playing complicated music on the violin, in such a way that it is almost always totally convincing, and perfectly matches the sound track. Were the actors selected from expert violin players? Were special effects used? I don't know how, but it worked.This movie is a costume drama, a suspense film, a history lesson, has a great soundtrack, and no filmgoer should find themselves left out.

Francois Girard has directed and written (with Don McKellar) a beautiful drama detailing the life of a red violin from its manufacture in the late 17th century through its sale at an auction in the present.Samuel L. Jackson portrays Charles Morritz, an antique violin authenticator. This auction is the framing device for the rest of the film. The tale flashes back to the tale of Nicolo Bussotti, a fictional violin maker. He is planning to give it to his unborn child. His pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) goes to an old woman fortune teller who proceeds to relate some of the future of the Bussotis and other owners of the instrument.The violin continues on through the years coming into the possession of an orphan (Christoph Koncz). It then is owned by a virtuoso soloist (Jason Flemyng) who gets his inspiration by playing it during love-making with the lovely Greta Scacchi. The instrument passes across the ocean to China where Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) is caught in the middle of the cultural revolution. Finally, as a valuable antique, it is brought up for auction in the film's final sequence.This cursory summary cannot do justice to the lush beauty of this film. Joshua Bell plays the violin on the soundtrack to a fine score by John Corigliano (CD on Sony Classical). At an early screening Bell explain that the children in the orphanage are actually violinists. Bell's hands are also shown in other scenes as the instrument is played. The movie cost only $9 million but the production has an epic feel to it. McKellar explained that this is accomplished by lavishing the expense on one elaborate scene in each vignette. It definitely works.Girard has fashioned a wonderful story that probably should have been saved for the fall season. It has award winner written all over it. Especially in the areas of costumes, scenic design and music. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.

Not exactly what is expected from a movie named The Red Violin (Le Violon Rouge).Writer/director Francois Girard's dark tale takes us on a journey following Nicolo Bussotti's masterpiece known only as the Red Violin, named for its unique red varnish. The Italian violin maker's wife, Anna, is soon going to be giving birth. The mother, wanting to know the future of her baby calls upon a servant to tell its future with the help of her Tarot cards. When the mother and baby die, Bussotti is left with nothing but his unfinished work. The most perfect violin in the entire world.The violin makes its way around Europe into the hands of an orphanage where the children all learn to play the violin. One boy in particular, Kaspar Weiss, is considered a child prodigy. He is taken in by Georges Poussin who hopes to make him into the next Mozart. The journey of the violin does not end here. The violin travels across Europe once more and eventually ends up in China. What was meant to be a gift has become In present-day Montreal, the violin that was once going to be the prize possession of Bussotti's baby is now up for auction. Several violin connoisseurs and enthusiasts are present to witness the unveiling of the magnificent stringed instrument, including Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson). A person from the violin's past is represented by family or organizations to claim it.It is rare to find a film with the main character being an inanimate object that travels so much. All of the characters are linked by this one instrument through one way or another. The violin's itself is steeped in mystery right until the very end of the film. Everywhere it goes there is one thing it carries with it the ability to enchant, dazzle, and endanger those who come into contact with it.The film excels in all areas. The cinematography is extremely tasteful and compliments the Academy Award winning score with its flowing movements and well thought out shots. One scene in particular the violin changes hands several times yet it remains in the same part of the frame with each person. It almost appears that the world is revolving around the violin.The one part of the film that stands out has to be the story. The chopped up storytelling much like that of 21 Grams and Pulp Fiction (although not as chopped up and graphic) is incredibly hard to do. It can't be too hard to follow or too easy to figure out. Girard perfectly executes what it should be. The story is easy to follow but keeps you guessing the whole way through. Unlike some directors, Girard uses the languages of the countries that the violin travels through. Some would have had English all the way through. This story seems too real to be fiction.The Red Violin is an absolute joy to watch. It isn't one genre. There is mystery, crime, romance, drama, and scandal. The senses will be delighted with colors and sounds from all time periods and places. This is truly a great movie going experience.

The tarot cards not only make a nice sub story within the frame (as if the frame itself were not engaging enough), but provide helpful insight to the pending chapter when one knows the cards.

We know from very early that this violin is the premiere lot at an auction of very valuable musical instruments, yet repeatedly wonder how it can possibly survive it's long journey.

Anna is having her cards read by a tarot card reader in between each scene involving the new whereabouts of the violin.It circulates between a child prodigy in Vienna, a music lover in communist China where the violin is an illegal western instrument, a great concerto player who uses the music to seduce women and finally, to Montreal, where the auction is taking place.In between each scene, you learn a little bit more about the violin and it's origin and the fate of the Bussotti family, including why it is red. Also, with each story, you see why certain people participating in the auction are interested in said violin.Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) does not even really appear, other than a few quick flashes, until the very end. It is then when we understand what Morritz is doing there and the ultimate fate of the violin, at least for the time being.This was a good movie although a bit overrated in my opinion, it was still worth a watch. You have to be in the mood for this type of movie, as it is filled with sub-titles and is, ultimately, a foreign movie. Although I like foreign movies, there are times when I am just not in the mood.

Though we go through several centuries and multiple countries, Jsckson's story really ties it all together -- like the moment in 2001 where the bone becomes the satellite, Jackson is the modern day counterpart to the violin's entire history.

It was built in 1681 and Nicolo's last. The movie follows the violin from the story of its construction to the present. Nicolo's wife Anna Rudolfi is pregnant and her servant Cesca reads the tarot cards. When Anna dies in childbirth with her child, Nicolo mixes her blood with the vanish to paint on the violin giving it the unusual red color. The tarot cards foretells the future of the violin and not Anna.This is a difficult thing to make each section as compelling as possible. In the end, that is not achieved. Each section doesn't have enough time to tell its drama compellingly. Also the movie already shows that the violin doesn't get buried or burned. The music is beautiful as long as you love violin music. This is a beautiful sounding movie but the plot doesn't have much tension. There are some poetic moments but it meanders a bit.

I was afraid it would be slow, tedious and somewhat boring, but it was engaging from the beginning and kept your interest as you followed along the saga of the red violin, which was the main character of the story. From it's creation, passing through a variety of hands of ownership, the red violin has a rich history and significant stories. It has multi-layers of interests historical, artistic, relational, political. It includes beautiful music and an intriguing twist to the story and the significance to the instrument. Watching the movie is like the feeling many of us have had going into an antique shop, purchasing an item and wondering the life it had before it reached our hands. This story answers that mystery for the red violin and weaves the tales of it's existence into this interesting piece of film. It is a quality and memorable movie, well worth your viewing time. "},{"Title":"blood and music","Date":"21 June 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":" This ambitious project realized 15 years ago and directed by Francois Girard uses a not completely new pretext for its story line retracing 300 years of history of a superb violin manufactured at the end of the 17th century, a violin born in tragedy and seeming to carry unusual passion and power which marks the destinies of all its successive owners. When watching this film we cross centuries, countries, continents following the destiny of an unusual instrument which seems to be hiding the special gifts making wonderful sounds, but also a curse for the fate of its owners. An object that ignites art and passion.The story telling predicts by a few years the novels of Dan Brown and the like, and we deal in parallel with the chronological told story of the violin and with the intrigues behind the scenes of the public auction in which it is sold at the end of the 20th century. As the story develops we understand that the participants in the bid are also related to the history of the instrument, descendants of its previous owners, connected also through a destiny predicted in cards of tarot, which is also revealed gradually as the story progresses.15 years after the film was made its music and some of its independent story segments survive better than the whole. Violinist Joshua Bell was the musical consultant and probably played much of the score, which makes for some very interesting but out of the beaten track music. I liked it, but do not expect to hear any famous scores, you will need to listen carefully to understand the passion and appreciate the quality. The short stories in the history are all well written but also a little bit conventional, characters are drawn with attention, and love for music. The connection between the episodes is not so well made, the five cards can be a transition trick that works well on TV, but the jumps in time and the changes of hands of the owners are too sketchy for a big screen movie. The final episode (of the public auction) introduces an element of suspense which I found again to be a little too conventional and not really in tune with the rest of the story. A little bit like a musical composition with many beautiful passages but lacking strength in composition and a 'finale' to remember.

The stories feature a 17th century tarot card reading, an orphanage run by monks high in the Austrian alps, an opium-stocked Edwardian lord whose fiddling makes Greta Schacchi swoon and her prose definitely purple, and one of those high-end auctions where folks call in on the phone and the auctioneer keeps saying Fair warning in a plummy English accent.

I recommend this beautiful film to anyone that likes a truly wonderful story. This is one of the least known movies that the great Samuel L. Jackson has done, and although his part is minor, he binds all the individual stories into one. Who knew a movie about only one constant (the violin) could be so touching/heart wrenching all in the same movie. I don't recommend this to everyone, but to those willing to think about the different cultures and how we all can be united by something as beautiful as music. Now I am not a huge fan of the violin sound particularly, (Yo Yo Ma notwithstanding, he's brilliant!) but I think anyone that has a basic understanding of musical instruments will realize and listen to the beautiful sounds that come out of this truly original piece of string family. Now if you like a lot of what is considered music these days, (Britney Spears for example) don't bother with this film because it will go right over your head. I would say when they get to some of the Oscar Winning original score, (It won in 2000) close your eyes to really listen to music. Now I'm a huge movie buff, and I am the last person to close my eyes during a movie, but when you watch this a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time, give it a try.

No, he was not a theatre or other arts major, but a football -player cum chemistry major on his way to medical school. Throughout our relationship he has given me unique gifts, and this was no exception. Not a little part of that gift was sharing it with him.This movie is the best that I have ever experienced. At various times other movies may have taught me, thrilled me, scared me, made me cry or intrigued me, but none has ever immersed me in their artistry as this one did. And still does. Not a little part of my son's gift was sharing it with him. The plot is simple. A violin of unique character passes through multiple talented hands as forecast by a tarot reader. But the plot is merely the stretcher for the canvas which is the story. And the story is painted with the visuals, acting, music, etc. The violin and the movie are metaphors for life. We are all unique and on a journey and we are all connected. This little gem is beautiful and momentous. To its critics the making of work of art is not unilateral.

I was most happy to learn that it did receive the Oscar for the Best Musical Score the year it was nominated. With the help of Joshua Bell, John Corigliano, casts a spell with his music! Interestingly the violin that Joshua Bell plays is steeped in as much intrigue and history as the Red Violin. The Gibson Stradivarius that Bell plays now was made in the early Eighteenth century(1731 if I'm not mistaken). It reached the hands of Polish violinist Bronislaw Huberman from whom it was stolen by a John Altman who played it in bars for fifty years, never repairing it although it needed due care and attention. While on his deathbed, Altman is said to have confessed his crime resulting in the Stradivarius being duely restored to its original glory. And then Joshua Bell eventually became its owner, feeling an instant connection with it the day he played his very first notes on it...! Every violin does have a story of its own...

I was strolling the lanes of Blockbuster today and I fortunately picked up The Red Violin. I have nearly watched this film about 5-6 times before, but each time I always find another movie just getting ready to go and I put this one back as its always my backup. I didn't really know that much about it, but I was curious, so today I finally used my 3rd rental spot on it. Boy am I lucky I chose this.The Red Violin is a story about this violin that was created in 1683 by this relatively famous violin maker. It passes through many hands and is owned by various people of four different languages, five countries, and 300 years. It is practically mythical around the world. But, out of chance, it ends up in an auction house in Montreal where it is what everyone came for. It is the main event. I'll leave out all the various stories, but they are magnificently done and all quite interesting. This magnificent script alternates between the year 1683, the year that the certain owner has the violin (I believe they show ~4 different owners), and the current year (the present) and does it incredibly smoothly. It constantly keeps you on an edge by giving you bit by bit of the auction, until the end when they finish it up. I found this to be a great way of presenting this. Made you really want to see what happens because they kept repeating this.Besides the alternating between time periods, I enjoyed the great characters of various cultures and many different music periods that I encountered as I watched. All these very different people came upon this violin and you can see that while they were so different, they all hailed it as a masterpiece. As a treasure. They all knew that it was special. They all masterfully linked with this violin. Along with this, every character that was introduced was very interesting. You only were with each one for a relatively small amount of time, but that was no matter. You quickly cared for them and their relationship with the violin. You always wanted it to flourish, while still being disappointed time after time.I'm going to try to leave out any specifics of each of the stories, but they are all incredibly interesting. I put a fair amount of backing behind The Red Violin and I definitely recommend it. Four stars, 10/10, A+ etc.err well I forgot to mention the beautiful score that accompanied this. What was so amazing is how each different piece that was played went along with the character that the movie was focusing on at that time. Each person had their own little piece. Its of course some magnificent violin that accompanies the film. I unfortunately heard about this part and didn't spot it myself. I was looking for it the whole film and I am glad I did. It added another dimension to it.  "},{"Title":"An amazing multicultural film","Date":"1 September 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":"  Francois Girard's 1998 film, 'Le Violon Rouge' (The Red Violin) is the tale of a violin that is up for auction with a Sotheby's-like company. As the bidding proceeds, we see the birth of the violin, created in 17th century Italy by Nicolo Bussotti for his son, and it's three century journey to where it is now housed, in France. Between the 17th and 20th centuries, the violin is used for a century in an Austrian monastery, buried for years in a grave, travels Europe with gypsies, becomes the prized violin of an English virtuoso, and finally, the personification of intolerance and loss during the Cultural Revolution in 1950's China before landing on the auction block in France. The film becomes compelling when, after a segment of the violin's history is revealed, we return to present day and see someone associated with that portion of history present at the auction, and bidding on the cherished item. The red violin ties all of the stories together, and it is Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), a consultant for the auction house who discovers it's secret. There is so much to appreciate about 'The Red Violin'. There are scenes that look like they were blocked in order to look like paintings of the Renaissance and Flemish era. I expected to see Pieter Brueghel off to the side at times, painting a perfect scene. All of the stories with one exception are intriguing, emotional and somewhat enlightening, particularly the scene set in China. The only segment I wasn't crazy about, though it was definitely necessary to the advancement of the story, was about the English virtuoso Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) and his lover Victoria Byrd (Greta Scacchi). It just didn't do a lot for me, though it certainly wasn't horrible by any means. The score, with solos by Joshua Bell is absolutely beautiful. The most impressive thing to me, however, is probably something that isn't a big deal or noticeable to most. While the story, cinematography and acting were quite good, I was most impressed by the fact that writers Girard and Don McKellar (who also acts in the film) did not dumb down the presentation, but rather allowed each story to be told in their native languages. Considering what we have learned from the last century of films, that we are to expect that it is natural that everyone, regardless of country or origin speaks flawless English, even in their own native countries, it is like a breath of fresh air to see something a bit more 'real'. If you have seen this film and enjoyed it, I would also recommend seeking out Julien Duvivier's 1942 film 'Tales of Manhattan'. It may be hard to find because it's kind of a buried classic, but it is the same kind of concept, only in this case it follows around a tuxedo jacket. It has always been one of my favorite classic films, and was actually the first thing I thought of in terms of comparison after seeing 'The Red Violin' for the first time. The story concept of 'The Red Violin' is compelling and intelligent and the presentation is beautiful &#150; I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story with his or her aesthetic.--Shelly  "}{"Title":"An old-fashioned spectacular","Date":"8 May 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":"  I see no point in recounting the plot here; many other reviewers have already done so.

The instrument survives centuries of use and abuse and changes the lives of every one it touches. Five years in the making, The Red Violin offers a great score, involving stories, a terrific ensemble cast, beautiful costumes, and outstanding cinematography. Directed by Quebec director Francois Girard (Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould), the film was shot in five countries (Italy, Austria, England, China and Canada), spans five centuries, and uses six languages, one unspoken. The unspoken language of course is music, and we are treated to the sound of this beautiful instrument played by Joshua Bell performing an original piece, Chaconne for Violin and Orchestra, by John Corigliano.The film dramatizes five stories about the different owners of the instrument through a period of 400 years. Each seemingly unconnected tale is woven into a tapestry, a theme and variation, that is epic in scope and a sumptuous feast for the eyes and ears. The central symbol is the last violin made by the fictional Niccolo Bussotti finished with a red varnish partially consisting of the blood of his dead wife. The story is framed by Cesca (Anita Laurenzi) a Tarot card reader foretelling the future and a modern auction in Montreal in which Samuel L. Jackson plays Charles Morritz, an appraiser of antique instruments who is determined to keep the violin out of the hands of crass global investors. The film goes back and forth between Cremona and Montreal and each segment is linked by the Tarot readings.Rescued from an Austrian orphanage by arts benefactor Georges Poussin (Jean-Luc Bideau), the violin is first used by Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz), a gifted child prodigy with a heart condition. It is then redeemed from a graveyard by a group of gypsies, travels to England where it becomes a tool of erotica in an over-the-top Victorian melodrama featuring violin virtuoso Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) and his lover Victoria (Greta Scacchi). After the instrument is sold at a pawnshop in Shanghai, China, it becomes an object of scorn by Communist cadres during the 1966-67 Cultural Revolution who see it as too European. Coming full circle, the violin ends its journey in the hands of Morritz (Jackson) in Canada who investigates its origins and recognizes its true value. Along the way, the violin is shot at, buried alive, used as a tool for political repression, valued only as a commodity, yet the glorious music remains, a testimony to the enduring power of art. Bravo!

There were many scenes of immense beauty and realism. The Chinese cultural revolution period and characters were refreshingly real and energetic. But there are few contradictions that is not easily overlooked. While the old fortune teller woman reading of the cards were adeptly played, and each card symbolized life's great dilemma, why did she declared to the violin maker's wife who asked that she tells everything, that madame will have a long life where in fact she would shortly died? Another difficulty I have problem accepting is Sam L Jackson's role as expert artifact authenticator. The delicate instrument looked like a child's toy in his huge hands, and he did not show particular careful handling such a revered instrument would bring. While Jackson has had many fine character performances even including action pics with Mel Gibson,I have hard time believing from his demeanor that he was an art expert. Also short on display was the knoweledge that his character called for. Those who sing his praises are probably more driven by a black man in a non-traditional role than actual merit. Finally,the ending was most troubling. **SPOILER** it should have Jackson tempted to take the instruments (big climax), refrains and walks away, follows by call to his wife from the taxi to the airport and tells her she loves her by doing the right thing. That's the ending it deserves. "},{"Title":"Nicely Crafted","Date":"7 October 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":"  Every man wants the Red Violin.  Why?  Well, the reason why is the big mystery revealed in the final scenes of this very clever piece of work. Spanning three continents and several centuries, the film has the look of a lavish production but somehow was made on a small ten million dollar budget.I liked it a lot.  There must be a half dozen stories crammed into this epic, all very well told, some sexy but mostly tragic. The script is merciless on the very engaging characters and it seems to have a slightly wry, almost cruel sense of humor as they are put through their travails. I admired the beautiful, stylish photography and inventive direction that makes the imagery stick with you -- especially one hypnotic montage spanning generations while gypsies play the violin as it somehow appears to be suspended, immobile in the frame.But the real story is the adventure of this violin.  Men fall in love with it, it is buried and resurrected by gypsy grave robbers. It becomes a pawn in the Chinese Cultural Revolution and is nearly incinerated.What really stands out though is the brilliant way multiple timelines are interleaved, overlapped, flashed forward and back rhythmically but without any confusion.  Some say there are three timelines, I counted five.As you watch, you see odd occurrences -- like a woman who discovers her lover cheating.  She finds a gun and shoots -- not him or his companion but the violin.  The big supernatural revelation at the end makes all those puzzling scenes suddenly make sense.  But the end also tends to reduce the whole story to a macabre and naughty little joke that just makes you smile.And the ending, as startling as it is, is the problem.  The movie outdoes the message. When people see a movie that looks this grand, they leave with an empty feeling if they are not treated to profound statements about life and the human condition.  But that is not what the Red Violin is about. True, it has a lot of good drama but it is not a morality play at all. Don't look for heroes (there is a heroine -- but that would be telling).If anything, and even this may be a stretch, it is about lust, the coveting of a finely-crafted thing of beauty.  But that is what the Red Violin is -- an intricately cut jewel of a film. Expect no more than that.

I don't think it's the deep, profound epic some seem to suggest, but I liked the idea of the violin as the McGuffin, and as an axis for the film, it held things together very nicely. I won't provide any spoilers here, but I was a little perplexed as to what to make of the ending except as a very simple little parable about the continuity of civilization; it seemed a little out of character, nevertheless.I write today, however, to praise Samuel L. Jackson. Even though he's got a relatively small role in this film, it really shows what he can do when given some space to stretch out. It reminded me very much of the way Gene Hackman almost always blends in to his role, making you forget he's Gene Hackman, which is the hallmark of good film acting. Sometimes Sam can get a role where you say to yourself, man, I love Samuel Jackson (Shaft, Jackie Brown, etc.), which is fun in itself but often detracts from the film around him. This time around, though, his chops are great AND he becomes the role; it makes me want to see him in more roles like this, and fewer Pulp Fiction riffs.

It is an episodic journey told by foreshadowing, as a violin makes a long trek from the seventeenth century to the modern day.  How a tarot card reading to a pregnant woman in the 1600's ties into the violin's journeys, or why the violin itself is red, is something I think best left to the viewer to find out.  The movie's summation and climax, with an auction for the violin being attended by a host of characters who each represents the episodes of the violin's journey, and each one vying to possess it again, is a wonderful piece of dramatic conclusion, tying together the seemingly disparate threads of the story into a whole.  However, all is not perfect.  I couldn't see why Samuel L. Jackson's character was somehow the one entitled to the violin. (But getting it by switching another violin, as happened several times in the story, was a good touch.)  I assume maybe because he was the only one who knew the violin's entire story and perhaps really knew it, but he acts like such a royal jerk most of the time I kept hoping the violin would take it's bow and run away.  Despite this, Red Violin is one of the most interesting and unique movies I've seen in a long time.

Perhaps it lies not in the music itself, but within all that the music comes with- the history of it.  Its past, all the different hands that have gone into shaping it, the work of the individual that creates that music at that moment.  Music is the most delicate of the arts, for once created, it can never be re-created identically.  And each moment is fleeing, dynamic, related to the moment before and the moment that follows.  This movie follows the path of a violin, as it exchanges hands over centuries, touches lives, brings passion and pain.  The theme of the movie, first hummed by the violin-maker's wife, becomes the voice of the violin, linking the human soul with that of the violin.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that her soul inhabited the violin, as other reviews here have.  However, I think the movie tries to show how everything that has occured in the life of this violin has affected and shaped it, made it into the perfect musical instrument it is.  I was especially impressed by the performance of the little boy in vienna.  He is actually playing the violin- amazing!!! And the soundtrack, of course, is incredible.  Joshua Bell is God.  Above all, this movie is about passion.  Feelings are not just intangible wisps of nothingness that vanish as soon as they are created.  They remain in the vessels that create them, and in the vessels that are affected by them.  In this case, all the passion that surrounded this violin became a part of it.  When one person played it, the music brought back the memories of all those who had played it before.  The story is slower than most movies today, yes.  But why let that dissuade you?  Why go see a movie if you aren't willing to let it take you in, absorb you, and free you from the time contraints of everyday life?  The movie is made to be watched, not as an accompaniment to popcorn.  Let the story be spun around you, and take things in as they come.  Trust in the storyteller to unfold the events fully and satisfactorily.  You have all the time in the world to watch this movie.  Finally, let the music itself envelop you.  Feel the sweep of the phrases and the rich fullness in the violin's voice.  Enjoy the lopsided, fun, gypsy's theme (my personal favorite), the firey passion of pope' theme, the frenzied desperateness that comes with the little boy in vienna.  Take in the despair that was the cultural revolution in China, where anna's theme, full of longing and sadness, comes to its prime.  Anna knows she is going to die, hence her melancholy humming.  The violin became her child, her last creation, and her voice.  See this movie, and let it take you in.

He talked about the way that the music was a way to speak in a universal language, a language that everyone could understand. It moves through space, time and cultures excellently, much better than spoken words. Girard gave us the interesting example of children he knew who watched the film, and how they understood what was happening even though they were too young to even read the subtitles... The subtitles were a way to stay true to the mood of the characters, while letting the melodies and music played by the characters express their individuality. The soul of the young pregnant woman, 'Anna' becomes closely tied to the 'soul' of her husband's masterpiece, the Red Violin.

Joshua Bell, a young 20ish concert violinist noted for his flair with romantic music, plays on the sound track.  The movie doesn't have so much serious music that those who don't usually listen to it will be turned off; the reverse could be more often true -- that some of those with an especial love of the violin and its serious repertoire may feel a little short-changed. I've read a few other user comments and agree with those who remark that the transitions from one story episode to the next are somewhat rough.  And agree that the episode with Kaspar Weiss is the most effective.  The episode with an English violinist and his love, a female author, was almost worthy of a pulp fiction romance novel except it lacked enough credulity of gender roles for those times (or combining sexual and musical activities?).  Oh, and the red varnish of the Red Violin -- terribly sentimental, romantic, and so fantastic as to be completely unrealistic. (Don't they feed these scripts through any technical editors?

We are left more inclined to believe the violin will go on, and that Morritz and his daughter are just another stop in its journey.

"},{"Title":"A passionate movie about making music.","Date":"28 November 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":"  Perhaps the most interesting thing about The Red Violin is the fact that it transcends cultures.  This a film about the life of a violin that travels over 300 years from renaissance Italy, to revolutionary France, through eastern Europe, onto Communist China and into modern day Montreal.  Along the way this violin is the property of several people who have nothing in common, except for their love of this exceptional instrument. The film opens with Samuel Jackson as Charles Morritz, arriving at an auction house in Montreal where this violin is about to be sold.  We are soon whisked back in time to the workshop of master violin maker, Nicolo Bussotti (played by Carlo Cecchi).  His young wife is pregnant and seeks the advice of the kitchen help/soothe seer.  Using tarot cards the seer predicts an untimely end to the life of this woman, but somehow also sees a long and turbulent life for her.  We wonder what this scullery maid is talking about, however it quickly becomes evident that she has tapped into the life of the violin.  This violin is still under construction.  Nicolo feels that it is his most perfect work to date, and will present it to their child when he/she is born.  Unfortunately the seer was right about the wife dying, so when all is said and done, a broken Nicolo closes up the work shop and puts the newly created, and quite perfect, violin up for sale.  The violin ends up in the hands of several people over the years, and in nicely styled vignettes we see how much this instrument means to people who really know nothing of its tragic origins.  As the film moves from era to era, we hear beautiful arrangements complete with some gorgeous photography.  Each story is told like a parable of sorts.  Not one of them are long enough to get into complicated detail, however they are complete enough to create an impression.I thought there were only a few minor disappointments, none of which would take away from the film as a whole.  Jackson seems to draw on his character from Pulp Fiction in various scenes as he tells off hotel staff.  That got a little tiring, mainly because it was so out of place with the rest of movie.   Francois Girard directs this film, using styles similar to that of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon.  Like Kurbrick, Girard allows for long periods of silence, using imagery to tell his story.  The story of the little orphan boy in the monastary, with a weak heart, but a passion for music, was hauntingly stunning.  As we see him going as far as sleeping with the violin, we learn the true value of Busotti's creation. Of course the tragic theme of this film is man's inhumanity to man.  Jealousy, betrayal, greed, vanity and bigotry all come into play in this film.  We wonder, in the end, how this violin ever survived all those years.

The auction ties the stories together, sort of, but the viewer is still left with a feeling of discontinuity since the object, beautiful and possessed of a fine tone, is still that, an object. The music is interesting and pleasant but can't replace the lack of a strong storyline. The story of the violin's creation is a bit poignant, but mostly trite. The second story, the sad tale of the child prodigy from the Alpine orphanage, has the most impact, but ultimately is pointless. In the third story, Jason Flemyng does a terrific Chopinesque musical Lothario, reminding us that the 19th had its brattish pop stars, but his sticky end is a bit pointless too. Greta Scacchi does make a nice femme fatale though. The fourth story, set in Mao's China at the time of the Cultural Revolution, is pretty dull. The ending, at the auction, is pretty silly.Back in the 1960s, the director Anthony Asquith, did something similar with a motor car in The Yellow Rolls--Royce (his last movie). There was a fair bit of sexual hanky-panky in and around the Roller but that seemed fitting. The stories were separate but on a similar theme, love, sex, betrayal. This film, on the other hand, says something about creative passion, but I'm not sure quite what - maybe how hard it is to control, to channel productively. It also says, if you want to get money out of five different film funders, give 'em five different plots. Oh well. The crew(s) must have had a good time.

The film traces the history of a rare violin from its birthplace in 1681 Italy.  The instrument is headed for a 1998 auction house to be sold. Enter expert Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson knows rare violins.  He recognizes this piece as one of a kind. Its not a Stradivarius. Its even more refined, a handmade instrument from an old Italian craftsman.  Jackson is not the only one who sees through the plain trappings of the violin.  A young scientist who measures the richness of fiddle acoustics, is also onto the red violin. The young man is actor Keith Gordon the same young skeptic who doubts Rodney Dangerfield's attempts at getting an education in the 1986 film Back to School. The Red violin is so famous there are knock-offs and copies circulating in the rare violin marketplace.As I mentioned, the first four historic scenarios through which the vintage violin travels are costume pieces.  They are also choppy and differ in detail, authenticity and tone from the last auction house episode. On top of that the auction mystery is so richly separate in tone and character from other sequences, it is as if separate filmmakers were working here.One sequence features a Viennese landowner who retrieves the instrument from a band of gypsies who are trespassing on his property.  The aristocrat is a true eccentric.  The music  he plays  on the Red Violin is extraordinary. His love affair with absurd European Duchess Greta Schacchi is so unnecessary, the episode plays like farce.Another episode takes us to China in the early 20th century then moves the daughter whose mother buys the pawned violin for her, to China's cultural revolution of the '60s. All old things are now considered reactionary. Violins are instruments which play decadent western music. The young girl, now grown up, takes flight to save the instrument.  This sequence echoes the ridiculous woodenness of the cultural revolution itself.  Characters are reduced to counterrevolutionary sloganeering. Its difficult to believe even the Maoists of that period could have cared so much about an off-colored violin.Scenes from the the first 17th century period when the instrument is made, explain its strange color.The last sequence is a mystery.  It pays off a story  that has been difficult to follow.  The auction sequences take place in a European Capital, though the actors appear to be Canadians.  Fittingly, the actor who actually auctions this fiddle played the title character in Thirty Two Short Films about Glenn Gould. The 1998 auction sequence saves the whole film from being little more than a comic book. Most of the violin music played throughout the films is exquisite and interesting in its variety and range.Samuel Jackson, Keith Gordon and the many others in the last sequence are superb. The last part redeems the entire film.  The screenwriting is fine here as is the camerawork. The color photography, if I have failed to mention it, seems excessively red.

More than a simple collection of stories told one after the other, The Red Violin is made up of five threads that are sometimes parallel but more often tangled. The movie jumps from thread to thread, sometimes showing us new pieces of the violin's history, sometimes returning to events we have already seen but revealing just a little bit more. It reminds me a bit of Tanith Lee's The Book of the Damned. Both are made up of several different short stories that are largely unrelated save for the connection of a single mystical object and its effects on those who possess it.I enjoyed The Red Violin immensely as a whole, though some of the threads are better than others. I especially like the Frederick Pope thread. It is witty, sexy, and quite fresh. The auction thread could have been better, but it did succeed at filling its place as an integral piece of the overall puzzle. Although each of the threads would stand reasonably well on its own, the strength of The Red Violin lies in the brilliance with which the threads are woven together. The jumps from thread to thread are not at all disorienting. The tapestry they weave is consistent and satisfying. All of the threads come together to tell a wonderful story that was far greater than the sum of its parts.Be forewarned that The Red Violin is a bit slow. That being said, it is an exquisite movie.

I have just bought Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 2000,and am horrified by the fact that he gives it only two stars! I usually agree with him, but in films relating to classical music, he is usually WAY off-base----witness his 2 and 1/2 stars for Amadeus, 2 stars for the 1984 Carmen, and 3 and 1/2 for the film of Verdi's Otello! The Red Violin is the poetic story of a legendary violin, the greatest musical instrument ever made, designed under mysterious circumstances during the Renaissance in Italy. (The circumstances are revealed fully ONLY near the end of the movie, so if you do not wish to know the solution to the mystery, be careful which review you read.) The framing story of the film is the present day auction in Montreal at which the violin is scheduled to be sold. We are gradually taken, in flashbacks, through the story of the violin and all of its owners, in four different countries and five different languages----Italian, German, English, Chinese,and French.(yes, there are subtitles, but this film is so good that who cares?) The storytelling is absolutely mesmerizing--each twenty minute episode is seamlessly interlocked with the auction and linked by beautiful shots of the sea rolling. The acting is excellent, especially in the German episode featuring little Christoph Koncz as a hard-driven child prodigy and Jean-Luc Bideau as his well-meaning but misguided stepfather and tutor.Greta Scacchi and Jason Flemyng, in the nineteenth-century British episode, are like lovers out of a Harlequin novel, but I have a feeling that this episode MUST have been done tongue-in-cheek; it is just too over-the-top compared with the dignity shown in every other episode. Samuel L. Jackson, in the framing segment, demonstrates incredible subtlety as an actor---watch his eyes as he listens for the first time to the red violin as it is played. The costumes, sets,and photography are ravishing--and most significant of all, there is John Corgliano's music--perhaps the finest musical score written for a film in more than twenty-five years, and no,I'm not forgetting John Williams' score for Schindler's List, though THAT one comes the closest, and violinist Joshua Bell does the Red Violin score full justice.Don't even think of passing this one up.

What it lacks in emotional depth, though, it makes up for in its sensuous imagination. The film is alive with masses of people, monumental locations, and the artistry of five very different eras. The fact that the plot leaps freely between characters, continents, and centuries makes its sensual impact that much greater. There is no point in trying to predict what comes next, it seems to say; we're wiser to notice what is here and now. Above all, music is here and now.As compelling as these first four acts were for me, the final act (lasting only 30 minutes but feeling like a day) is so outrageously terrible as to nearly sink the film as a whole. Instead of sensuality and beauty, the film meditates on money, bland hotel rooms, laboratory technology, and an unnecessary (and extremely implausible) double-cross that is intended to tie the film shut. Through this tedious action, the movie instructs us about how meaningful the Red Violin is to some people -- just in case we missed this point. Of course, by now, we have a more intimate understanding of the Red Violin than any of the Act 5 characters possibly could, and so their ovations about its deep significance come off as the worst sort of pretentiousness.At one point, an acoustical engineer (yes, the film calls in tech support to explain how good the instrument really is) says that what he'd really like to do is take the violin apart for closer analysis. As preposterous as that suggestion sounds, this is precisely what the final part of the film tries to do to what came before.My suggestion Skip the fifth act. Go listen to some music instead.

Cinematography grabbed you from the very beginning and throughout all the different eras; remained accurate, moving, exciting. Acting was also consistently excellent- by all performers. It would be difficult to single out any one performer, despite the listing of the credits. The story line was persistent and though flashbacks were used, there was a purpose behind all of them which kept the story line moving forward. It would have been very easy to overdo each and every episode, but there was a control present by the writers, director and actors that never permitted this to happen. Without a doubt, one of the finest movies I have seen. I am not prone to superlatives, not caring for most films I see-- this is an/the exception.

This is clearly a  4 star movie. I think the sign of a great movie is that you forget you are in a theater watching it - you are drawn into it far enough to feel like you are watching real events unfold.  Another sign of a great movie is that you are really elated about the successes some characters have or depressed about tragic things that happen to the characters.  This movie succeeds on both fronts.  And who would have thought that a violin could be a character so successfully?  The score is fabulous - I want to own a copy of John Corigliano's music.  The Paganini-like virtuoso in the middle of the film and the Paganini-like music were remarkable. The well enunciated Italian, German, French, and Mandarin (the last-mentioned I can only say presumably well enunciated) also added to my enjoyment of the movie.  I want to rent the video of Immortal Beloved again to compare the two films more closely.

I mean, a real movie, a production of Cinematic Art, not some box-office addict.One thing I love the most about this film is that it did not rely too heavily on music, as most of the movies about music did.  This one is simply the storytelling, a story about the divine instrument and the passion, time, love, hate, and people.  It's always amazed me the most not the Art itself, but the stories behind. I must confess, after finishing the movie, I walked out of the theatre with the great sense of regret of my giving up playing piano all those years ago. I hate the music then, because I couldn't understand why I should routinely spend one hour a day to play the piano and listened to the teacher scream at me.  Later I heard about some professional piano players practice 7,8,9 hours a day and found it unbelievable.  I understand now. It's that perfection and passion we should be looking for.

It is really at least four or five separate stories (taking place in widely different locales) about things that happen to the Red Violin, any one of each, with just a little amplification, would have made a very satisfactory film by itself.Of course, despite the score's composer and one of the principal actors being American, the film is basically Canadian, and thus probably will not be seen much anywhere else.  I am sure that, had it been made in the U.S., with the final scene taking place not in Montreal, but in Ell Ayyy or Noo Yawk, it would be critically acclaimed as one of the season's best.

Like his last film, 32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD, this explores the power of music (and though the subject here is classical music, it applies to all music), in a non-conventional, yet compelling way.  The red violin is not the overwrought symbol it might have become in lesser hands, but the expression of how moved we are by music in so many ways.  The way it's tied up to fate, passion, and, ultimately, life, is also well done without being pretentious.  It's appropriate that the violin is used, for it's one of the most basic of instruments.  The way Girard weaves in and out of flashbacks is also well done.  Finally, the performances are all good, particularly Jackson as the collector.

I saw it this afternoon at a press screening of the Toronto International Film Festival. The story follows the history of a violin, the red violin as it is known in musical circles, from it's creation in Italy in the 1600's to the present day where it is being auctioned off in a collection of instruments in Montreal. The film is tied together in flash-forwards of the wife of the violin maker, who is having her fortune told with tarot cards. Except that it is not her fortune that is being told, but that of the violin. We follow the violin through numerous and varied owners and across three continents. There are also flash-backs from the present-day auction.As a musician myself, I identify easily with the emotional attachment that musicians, especially string players, have for their instruments, and the importance of music in their lives. I recommend this film to anyone who can see beauty in life, anyone who understands the passion of the Arts, anyone who can feel emotion, because this film will touch you, deep inside your soul.

Allow me to correct them. One thing this movie definitely is not about, and that's music. Rather, this movie is about promoting the business of antique collecting. As such, it carries the mentality of collectors, a breed of human that sits around thinking about how much more fun life could be if an old object were to jump in monetary value. There doesn't exist a train of thought more thoroughly removed from purely musical thoughts. This is why a film like this, supposedly about the virtues of musicianship, is little more than a jumble of pretentious, lying crud.Let's take violins, for example. My uncle was a violinist/violist and he held high esteem for a finely crafted instrument. But he also owned enough honest musicianship to know that placing too much value on a fine instrument is a mistake. The greatest example of fine musicianship, as my musical elders would say, is when the musician can take a shabby instrument and make it sing. This is the sentiment of true musicianship that I'm talking about. The Red Violin makes no attempt to share this concept to its audience. Instead, it wants to sell the opposite concept, that musicians are shallow until their instruments, if they are finely made, save them from themselves and others. What a load of nonsense... we musicians say! But antique collectors, well they fully embrace such a concept, of course. Next stop college music courses taught by antique collectors.Antique collectors value the objects of history more than history itself. This is demonstrated in this shallow film, which craps on four periods of history while upholding the present as better than the past. But the fact is, the present state of humanity is sickeningly capitalistic compared to the past. So the story's protagonist finds a way to pilfer an auction house of the filthy rich in order to give a young girl a priceless violin. Is this the best anyone can do to set the vicious world of capitalism right? It doesn't set the vicious world of capitalism right. Such an act in the real world of auctions for the filthy rich would cause these capitalists to be that much more annoyed at thieves, thus that much more viciously competitive. Lesson burglary as rebellion against capitalism is a failed endeavor no matter how one attempts or perceives it.I give now a recounting of my experience watching this film, in the form of a plot summaryA virtuous, 17th century violin maker uses his dead wife's blood to coat one of his better instruments, making it special to both musicians AND antique collectors. God forbid they should make a movie about how musicians, but not antique collectors, favor a certain instrument, then learn through their pure musicianship that it's not the instrument that counts, but the musician who plays it. Then a sickly 18th century child is given scholarship but dies before he can use it. Wasn't  the old world dreadful? But the violin survives this encounter, metaphorically informing us that violins are stronger things than humans with natural music talent. Gag me&#133;.But wait! Now we must endure a soap opera styled interpretation of musical life during the 19th century, when apparently talented musicians are so decadent that their musicianship suffers. It's a typical misrepresentation of the Romantic music culture, and entirely expected from the creative minds of 20th century capitalist bigots who think that their own century saves all. What they forget to include is the bona-fide fact that 19th century music is leagues more virtuous than any music ever created during the 20th century. Again the violin survives the musician, and now the nausea is causing the vomit to flow from my mouth. But they're not yet through with me.First I must endure more capitalistic rhetoric when, during the 20th century in China's cultural revolution, all non-nationalistic (decadent) music is forbidden. Now the virtuous musician must sacrifice their instrument or face violent persecution. It makes for a good bit of espionage, and I'd be the first to denounce such totalitarian atrocities. Only I'm aware by now that this story is meant to serve a purpose. That is, to show us that free capitalism is better than anti-art, totalitarian socialism. Hmm. Agreed, like the lesser of two evils.Again the violin survives the musician. Hey, this is some violin. It's indestructible! Finally, we reach the present age of technology, when real music has finally been completely obliterated by way of over analysis. A guy manages to burglarize an auction for the filthy rich, then plays Robin Hood and hands over the priceless violin to a musically aspiring young girl. Is there anything in the story explaining to us just how musically virtuous this girl is? Of course not, that's not necessary. Besides, such a digression would spoil the moments of deep sentimentality that all the would-be antique collectors in the audience are feeling towards this incredible violin. It's about the violin, you see, not musicians. If suddenly these fools in the audience were subjected to real music performance on the screen, their sensibilities would surely be twisted out of their comfortably shallow little places.The part of the story that I sorely missed, was what happens after the ending A few years later the girl who'd been given the priceless violin decides to quit learning the instrument and listen to some Brittany Spears with her friends instead. Since otherwise she would certainly be considered a nerd freak by her schoolmates. One must have realistic priorities these days, hmm? Hence, this film is not about music. For currently music is at a very low rung on the average citizen's list of priorities. And this movie is, after all, for the people. Finally, I pass out from exhaustion. Thank god this horrible episode of my life is over.

I find it amazing that we can know every owner for example of a specific pearl going back several centuries, but most folks know about their own families usually just two generations back. So I thought this movie would be one I would enjoy. I also expected to hear some beautiful violin music. Wrong on both counts. The violin's history seemed too manufactured for the film's sake, not a real logical progression from one owner to another. Some of the major changes of ownership were left to the viewer's imagination and at least in my own case, I was unable to make the leap. The change did not make sense. How did the violin get to be owned by gypsies? How did it get to China? It would have made an interesting story, but where the manufactured history is stretched way beyond anything credible, the change of ownership is simply not explained. While I liked the overall concept of following the life of an object, the music, which I expected to be a major part of this film, was beyond disappointing. I don't play the violin but I can certainly appreciate beautiful music. There was very little music per se in this music. The only time anything that could be called music was played was some Chinese children's performance and it was made by accordions. The only sounds we heard coming from this supposedly incredibly valuable violin was the endless screeching, and this in spite of the fact that its journey took us through times when some of the most heavenly music on earth had been composed. Not one piece from Mozart, or resembling Mozart's style, had been offered. Just screeching. No music of any of the music's great composers was played at any time. More screeching. The sounds this violin made could have been compared to a cat scratching on a metal roof. That bad. Wonder how many CDs with the soundtrack they managed to sell. That would tell them just how wonderful the soundtrack was. The soundtrack was thoroughly modern, something that may be considered all the rage today. The music was probably difficult to play, but there is no sugarcoating it - the music is nothing but screeching. No melody, no rhythm, no emotion. No sweet sounds that leave a person in awe of beauty of sound. So no music, just noise. The ending climax likewise is not really any surprise like it is supposed to be, and most certainly not a shocking surprise, because I thought the secret was already implied in the beginning and so it didn't seem like any kind of surprise, at least not to me. If you can stand the noise that passes for a soundtrack, this is not a bad film. It's different. It's not very entertaining, but just the fact that it doesn't follow the standard mold makes it interesting. Best film ever made (as some of the reviews here indicate)? Most definitely not. I am writing this in 2013 (saw the film for the first time yesterday) and the film is all but forgotten today, 15 years after it was made.

I hate it when people toss about that term like it has no meaning because this movie is most definitely not that. A masterpiece implies a movie that not only has narrative finesse but narrative cohesion. The Red Violin is not even entertaining, so it definitely doesn't have the first. At first, I thought The Red Violin was a cool foreign film. But as the movie progressed, it became clear that it wasn't even that. The movie is all about one single solitary violin and what happens to it over the centuries. Sure there are groups of characters that pop up and tell their stories around the violin, but there is no single main character or even groups of main characters. The players don't stick around long enough, and in the end, it's all about the stupid violin. I don't know about the rest of you, but it's hard to care about a violin. The movie jumps about between the centuries so much like they're some kind of cool plot device, that I was uncertain what was going on. As such, it most definitely lacks narrative cohesion. As such, it most definitely is NOT a masterpiece.I don't know what most people saw in this movie.

So, why wasn't i able to feel any connection with any of the characters? The movie tries to say too much as it explores too many stories, only to tell us the violin is cursed, but it failed to deliver, because for the viewer to feel that, there would have to be a connection between us and the characters. On the contrary, i couldn't care less about any of them, except maybe the orphan virtuoso.I also felt that the passion that I (as a viewer) was supposed to feel for the violin, just wasn't there. There should be more emotional items to connect the viewer to it, like for instance, better music. What happened to sweet and dramatic and revealing melodies? They aren't there at all, and it's such a shame. I remember when i saw Copying Beethoven i cried all the way through his concerto, because i felt attached to him, Diane Kruger's character, and all the music, all the instruments, it was all wonderful in that scene. This movie doesn't have high moments like that.I rate it with 5 out of ten, because, although i was expecting more of this movie, i was entertained, and i also loved the motif that made the violin red. I liked the fact that we followed the violin in different moments of History, i liked that it wasn't centered only in one place and one story, i just think that it should be more centered in the characters and on how the violin grew on them.Overall it's an ok movie.

It brings out the best in him musically but personally it destroys his family. So much so his girlfriend shoots the violin grazing the neck. He is smoking Opium and is in the arms of another. He commits suicide and leaves his entire estate to his girlfriend. The violin, however he leaves to his Chinese servant. The violin then moves on Shanghi, China. During this time period the violin must be in hiding because anything to do with Western culture is banned and destroyed. Its final stop an auction house in 1997, where Charles Morritz finally proved it was the original Red Violin. He switched it with one of the really good fakes and took it home to his daughter. Violin3The characters throughout the movie have a special relationship with this violin and it helps many to overcome fears and gives them confidence in themselves. The setting of the movie takes place on five different places and each place is as real as it gets. The rich red color of the violin is amazing. When you craft something for the one you love, of course it is going to be perfect. In its life span it had made many people happy and sad. The journey of life is not all about the things we collect, but the few that we do are special and we want to hold on to them.

I spend a lot of time on IMDb reading movie reviews to decide about what to order. This movie would rank in my top 5 favorites and the only one so far that I have taken time out to review like this. The story is so unique, incredibly well drawn, directed and acted and you have absolutely no way of guessing at what will happen next (this is one of my top criteria for great movies - that of being non-formulaic and unpredictable). The story begins at an auction house where a masterpiece antique violin is being auctioned off. The viewer is then taken back through the life story of the violin and the lives that it touched over 200 years. I have seen this movie several times and I never fail to marvel at my re-enjoyment of watching it. Great story, great acting, great music, unpredictable and unique. It doesn't get any better!!

I love Don McKellar, he is a big influence on my own writing and his sensibilities fairly close to mine, especially with our shared fascination with multiple intersecting stories, but with Le violin rouge, the sheer scale of the film, spanning three centuries and five countries as we follow the titular red violin, a real thing of beauty, on its journey. Three of these stories are very good, particularly the violin's own 'origin story', the other two quite dull and occasionally painful (Oxford and Shanghai). The screenplay is still excellent despite the flaws, and plays out like an intriguing, particularly romantic Twilight Zone episode for music lovers, leaving almost everything up for interpretation. Perhaps those flaws would have gone down easier had the cinematography not been a pretty dull TV-level affair in general and Francois Girard's direction so flat much of the time, but unfortunately those aspects also hurt the film overall, though neither are incompetent. A generally strong cast with an unusual role for Samuel L. Jackson help keep the film involving.It's a real charmer, a great idea and with many great scenes, a frame story that more than just does its job, and a truly epic, yet grounded, scope. I wish I could love this film like I used to, but some of it just doesn't hold up like it used to. I do want to read the screenplay at some point because I'm nearly entirely sure that this reads better than it plays out on screen. Despite my expressing disappointment in the film here, I do need to clarify that I still recommend this film, and quite strongly. If nothing else, it is very unique. Thankfully, there's more than that to recommend it. How about this for instance one of cinema's great scores by John Corigliano, with the violin solos played by Joshua Bell?

The cinematography, particularly in the period episodes, is exquisite, and the score is nice. However, the segmented structure makes it difficult to become involved with the story and the characters. The dialog in the Oxford segment is laughably bad. The Chinese segment belongs in another movie. The Montreal segment, which the story centers around, is repetitious and uninteresting. Other than the violin, there is nothing compelling holding the segments of the film together, and it tends to drag due to its excessive length.

In that film, the yellow Rolls passes through the hands of four owners, and with each owner comes a story of the life of the owner and his friends during his association with the automobile. It was not as good a film as The Red Violin, by any means, but the parallel is curious.The Red Violin is, indeed, a wonderful film, by any criterion one might apply to a film. My remarks, however, speak to what has been said here about the film -- and to what has not been said.I viewed the film on DVD just a day or two ago. When I sat back to think about it, I realized, above all, that this is a very slyly droll film. The romance and fine sentiments that everyone speaks of are all well and good, but they hardly speak to the artistic heart of this film -- which is humor, irony, satire, and -- well -- fun.Didn't anyone notice the extraordinary lack of sentimentality in this film? The lack of romance? Oh, romance is present -- in the form of a sort of parody of romance, especially in the segment depicting Pope's possession of the instrument. Then there was the wonderful -- and perfectly comic -- performance of Jean-Luc Bideau, culminating with the death of his young prodigy, a death which, if you noticed, was less tragic than it was gently comical and ironic. No one seemed terribly sad when the poor tyke toppled over -- they seemed chiefly bemused.The life of the instrument is then continued by dint of an act of grave-robbery, as it passes into the hands of rogues and gypsies, on its way toward even more extraordinary, and more lunatic, ownership.All the while, we are watching Moritz (Samuel L. Jackson), vetting the instrument for Duval's, chasing down the intimate secret of its varnish, and generally playing the perfectionist, business-like expert. Ah, however -- we discover that what his heart truly is set on is simple larceny (and, incidentally) putting one over on a pompous would-be owner of the violin -- a bumptious bidder who is correct in his charge that Moritz had warned him off the instrument for self-serving reasons. The irony sizzles when the butt of Moritz's trickery buys the fake red violin. Moritz then escapes with the real article to give to his own child -- another irony, because, as much as he knows about the violin, he does not realize that he may be passing on to his offspring, along with the instrument, a virulent curse. A lovely film, an ironic film, a very tongue-in-cheek film, and a very funny film, this is (albeit with some drama and pathos); but it is neither sentimental nor romantic. Quite the contrary. From the beginning -- and others have noted this -- Bussotti is a singularly unsentimental man. We see this in his treatment of Anna and in his treatment of his apprentices. He was clearly distraught at his wife's death; but it immediately became for him another problem to overcome before getting on with his work. I loved this film for its beauty, its wit (a quality that today's movie viewing public should be better schooled in), for its technical acumen (cinematography, sets, and so on), for its clever structure, and for its masterful quality of spoof and satire, blended with a curious innocence in everyone who possesses the instrument, from the unfortunate orphan to the conniving Moritz.

As a historical back story, the Red Violin (fictional)is considered by collectors to be the greatest instrument produced by a certain 17th Century Italian violin maker--a perfect acoustic machine as described by a violin restoration expert.  It is because of the instrument's perfection that it was coveted by many who encountered it, and survived centuries of owners and pawn shops.  Most of it's owners had no knowledge of the violin's origin or unique qualities, and the movie audience itself discovers the violin's most unique characteristic only at the end of the film.  Shot on location in a number of cities around the world, and combined with a marvelous soundtrack (in glorious DTS sound on the DVD), it's a joy to watch the sights and sounds along the violin's journeys.  This violin is sort of the Forrest Gump of musical instruments, finding it's way by accident through many historical events.  Don't expect a huge surprise twist ending.  The ending is only mildly surprising, and really not the point of the film.  The purpose of the film is the journey, and the violin, and it's effect on it's musician owners, obsessed with music and rare objects of perfection. Some interesting observations (spoilers!) It's interesting that the fortune teller was probing the woman's future, and yet the tarot cards told the future of the violin.  Presumably this is because the violin is varnished with the woman's own blood.  It carries her essence, so the cards extended her future into that of the violin.  Is this not an interesting technicality of tarot cards?  The woman was already dead when her blood was extracted, yet the cards considered her blood a continuation of her life, and therefore, her future.  For tarot cards, at what point is a dead person's blood no longer considered part of the person?  On first viewing I thought perhaps we are supposed to notice that each person who possesses the violin suffers an untimely death.  This turned out to be an unintentional thread on the part of the director.  Interesting that there was no Mozart played in this movie, even though Mozart was a grand master of violin composition.  Mozart was even mentioned in at least one scene ...even Mozart, God rest his soul, played a child sized violin.  There's no shame in it....  Perhaps they were trying to avoid direct comparison to the movie Amadeus with which this movie has many similarities.

The story starts off as a master craftsman in Italy looses his wife and newborn during an awful birthing.  As a result hey uses the blood of his dead wife as a varnish for the instrument and it transforms all who come across this violin into pure fanatics as it seems the soul of the dead wife inhabits the instrument and makes music like the heavens.  There are 5 stories as the violin is handed down, traveled through countries from France, Germany, China, and then modern day North America.  The climax of the film towards the end of the story involves an auction house that has the violin in which several parties are all trying to get it.This was a great film and even though it dragged at times it truly shows what music can do to ones soul.  Relationships broken, hopes lost, joy found all through music as it transcends history.  Although some parts were a bit lengthy the music score keeps you sitting tight and pleased.  There are also some humorous moments for the film, certainly lead violinists all have a chip on their shoulder.  But one thing is for certain, music is all unifiying, it breaks down walls, politics, hate,  greed, and is all encompasing and all it takes is one little instrument.Rating 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"What could have become a good movie ...","Date":"15 May 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":" ... admittingly the idea is enchanting.

Girard once remarked that he could have going on researching forever, and with all the sophisticated locations and costumes in mind this thorough research might well be a hint for Girard's taking perfectionism too far. Unsurprisingly then that is exactly the film's problem, that it is obsessed with details and effects and misses out on overall coherence and consistency.Location and costumes were already mentioned as an example for sophistication, but this is exactly were Girard's perfectionism goes far too far, as the setting looks remarkable artificial,  even dirt and stains, where they were admitted, look disturbingly sterile.It might be the presence of Mr.Jackson that makes one compare the film with Pulp Fiction, but clearly its episodic character and its obsession with effects, as the surprising twist towards the end, show some resemblance, and there exactly lies the problem, that coherence, powerful and moving overall motives and the development of characters are sacrificed for a handful of twists.Vivid imaginary and a beautiful score, exploring its different eras musically, make this film worthwhile watching.

However, I was really intrigued by the number of production companies, actors, and locations, the latter not being at all simulated but moving from Italy to Vienna, to Oxford, to China, and finally landing in Montreal where apparently the major investors lived. I thought that perhaps Samuel L. Jackson might have been a major investor as he commands considerable sums for his acting service and seemed particularly unsuited for the part. Jackson is the very best ever in roles such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, but just didn't come through this time. All this being said, judging from the enthusiastic response of most who have written in this column, I seem to be a minority of one. And I did enjoy the picture withal.

Throughout each instance, you can't help but wonder what will happen next to this instrument, and how it will seek to live on.I loved how, though I don't believe in myself, the tales related to the old house maiden and her predictions. Its seamlessly put together instances of the predictions, the life of, and the present pace of its journey and Its scope is so grand, yet so well done, with the music to match, that I can't help to also feel mystified and intrigued by it all. Another awesome addition to my movie collection...

It's beyond amazing how they do the movie and look at the numerous historical events (maybe the scene in China won't make your skin crawl, but it's not a pretty sight).This is definitely the sort of film that would make anyone revere musical instruments. And among other things, it shows that Samuel L. Jackson can do more than play bad mother****ers in movies. A most impressive piece of cinema. Also starring Colm Feore, Jason Flemyng, Greta Scacchi and Sandra Oh (of Sideways fame).

In fact, you could even say that it isn't a single movie - rather, it's several shorts combined together, with the single connecting thread being the red violin that we watch change hands over the course of a little over 300 years. Built in Italy in 1681, the stories follow the violin through France, Austria, England, Hong Kong, Communist China and finally to an auction house in Montreal, Canada where it's to be sold. The nature of the movie being what it is, some of the stories are stronger than others. The one that really stood out powerfully for me was the depiction of the Cultural Revolution in China.There's a somewhat effective mystery that also holds things together. In 1681, the violin maker's wife went to a fortune teller before she died in childbirth, and the movie makes clear that somehow her fortune is being fulfilled through the violin's travels. I had an advantage coming in, because I knew the basic story and so the explanation of the violin's connection to the woman came as no surprise, but to give credit to the writers, had I not known the story coming in I don't think there's any way I would have figured out the mystery.It's hard to rate the performances here. Again, the nature of the movie worked against being able to identify anyone as the star of the movie. The biggest name was probably Samuel L. Jackson, but he really didn't have a major part until the last half hour or so. I wasn't really keeping track, but if memory serves, the most screen time probably went to Colm Feore, but his role as the auctioneer didn't really stretch him.Overall, I'd characterize this as a movie that really didn't pull me in, but one with a few parts that I thought were very well done. In all honesty, though, I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it again. 5/10 "},{"Title":"I don't know if I am interested in the fate of a musical instrument","Date":"6 January 2002","Score":"6 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Mystery","Review":"  I was quite distressed, when they repeated the promising auction scene again and again, and, instead of continuing with it, they switched back to all these rather unnecessary episodes from the past, where all the characters were portrayed so roughly &#150; obviously because there wasn't a lot of runtime left for each of the episodes &#150; that the stories become, well, not interesting.As Jim Jarmusch has shown us in `Night on Earth', it is possible to give perfect character descriptions of two or three people within a small story of twenty minutes. The makers of `The Red Violin' could have achieved this as well, but they were not interested in people, they were interested in a musical instrument. I don't know if I am interested in the fate of a violin.   In fact, the score of this movie is really beautiful and unusual. John Corigliano has absolutely deserved his Academy Award. It's for his music that I give this movie 4 points out of 10.

Lavishly produced, it shows us a series of stories about the various individuals who own a special violin over the course of several hundred years. Unfortunately, the stories don't really come together to make a resonant whole; and the finale, centred on Samuel L. Jackson's character, is of little interest there's no underlying reason why we should care about this individual's relationship to the famous fiddle. This is not an awful film; but it lacks the edge of magic needed to make the concept work.

But hey, if we were following logic, the film makers wouldn't have an excuse to blow millions of other peoples' money!Forget figuring out how it found its way to the monastery, I expected the teacher to take it after he learned it had been buried with his Mozart wanna-be (all that hard work he put into the kid for nothing). Instead, in a truly laughable montage, some gypsies rob the grave, fiddle with the violin, then sail to England, where it's given it to a Mick Jagger wanna-be in exchange for being allowed to stay on his lands.Our hero next pops up on a ship with a destitute Chinese seafarer. By now, I didn't bother to wonder how a destitute Chinese seafarer wound up with this priceless object for fear what was left of my brain cells would explode! So do the Western music-hating Maoists toss the violin into a bonfire when they find it at the teacher's house? Heck no, they hold onto it for at least 30 years until they consign it to a Montreal auction house! Makes sense to me, too! That's when Mr. Bad Ass Himself, Samuel L. Jackson, decides it'll make a really neat present for his kid!As if the film makers decided to see just how lame-brained they could get, what does the curator do when she realizes the violin up for bids isn't THE violin? Nothing! Here's hoping she and everyone else (especially Mr. Bad Ass Himself) can land jobs at Wal Mart after the winner realizes he got hosed big time!

I was particularly peeved by how utterly unbelievable the central tenet of the violin's beauty and perfection was. Am I the only person aware that blood doesn't dry red? Am I the only one who knows that burial in damp ground warps wood? In fairness, I should note that (1) I very much dislike the romantic artist-as-other motif and (2) I'm not fond of violins, finding them too often shrill. Maybe if the film had been *The Golden Oboe*...

Main problems 1) Lack of a small group of characters which the audience gets to know and care about. Instead we are given tiny snap-shots of a host of characters who appear, wander about the film for five or ten minutes, then disappear. 2) The one character who we see (in small bits and pieces) throughout the film is the art expert. He turns out to be a crook. We know nothing about his life. We know nothing about his past. He is just a temperamental jerk who lies to his employers and then steals from them. My emotional investment in his character was just about zero. Why should the audience care about him? What did he do that was in any way admirable or even interesting? 3) The director lavishes vast amounts of attention on the painting of the violin and at the end the pay-off for the audience is... revolting. I'm sorry but I did not feel at all uplifted or enlightened to find out why the Red Violin is red.A film just about the violin maker might have been interesting. A film just about the life of the orphan virtuoso might have been interesting. A film about the conflict between the love of classical music and adherence to the idiotic Chinese Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution might be interesting. But a film about all of these AND MORE is not a film that is interesting. It is a mess. In trying to tell lots of stories, it ends up telling none of them.Bottom line I'm sorry I saw this film. I'm sorry I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. This film gets my lowest possible rating. "}]
