Even though my adoration of the late comedian precludes me from giving a impartial rating of this movie, I can at least admit that this isn't one of his best efforts (I still loved this movie, it's just not my favourite Farley flick).  Nevertheless, I'm going to take the easy way out and say Come on, take it for what it is, a Chris Farley movie.Farley plays Haru, an orphan adopted at birth by a clan of ninjas.  He is raised under the pretenses that he is the Great White Ninja. Needless to say, his development is much anticipated by his teachers .  Unfortunately, to the dismay of everyone, he grows up to be overweight and klutzy. While the ninja graduates are out celebrating, Haru finds himself alone at the retreat when a mysterious woman (Nicollette Sheridan) enters looking for help.  Believing Haru to be a ninja, she hires him to spy on her boyfriend, an assignment he accepts with great enthusiasm.  Hot on the boyfriend's trail, Haru witnesses a murder and eventually ends up in Beverly Hills. Surviving on dumb luck and a designated guardian ninja, Haru never gives up on his task.Like I said before, this isn't Farley's greatest contribution to his comedic resume. But make no mistake, this is a funny movie.  Farley's bread and butter is his propensity to bumble and stumble in any given situation - walking into poles, falling down stairs, crushing coffee tables, etc. Since his character is expected to be agile and sleek, the comedy in Beverly Hills Ninja is that much funnier.  The exact same formula worked for Farley's SNL character Barney, the Chippendale's hopeful.Many critics felt that, by this time, Farley was a one-trick-pony whose act had nothing more to offer than jokes involving head and groin injuries. Perhaps his choice in films were poor but to don't deny him the recognition of his talent is unfair. Watch the movie and you'll see Farley display all the qualities of a great comedian intelligence, timing, pathos.  He was a tremendous talent and I will miss him very much.

Beverly Hills Ninja is nevertheless a valiant attempt.  It is filled with classic moments which will not be soon forgotten.  Examples include Haru protecting Sensai's ninja house when he first meets Alison and nearly destroys singlehandedly the entire place and the superb dialogue (such as, You do not have Ninja intuition.  In fact, you do not even have normal intuition.)  Who can forget such classic movie moments?But, probably the most enjoyable aspect of Chris Farley's movies is watching the response of others watching Chris Farley in action.  Chris is one person you really love or you really hate.  One of these extremes always prevails. And, for those of us who truly enjoy his work, nothing brings more joy than seeing the look of disgust and outrage on another person's face as they watch Chris Farley.  Watching people toss and turn in their seats just hoping to get out of the theater as soon as possible really brings happiness to Chris Farley fans everywhere.  It only highlights the high quality of his work (and the lack of a sense of humor on others' part).  Although we can always enjoy his movies in video, nothing will compare to the full theater experience.  Beverly Hills Ninja takes this aspect of his work to a new level.A great movie and one definitely to watch (multiple times).

I never saw this film in the theater; it looked a little silly to me. One day a few months later it came on pay-per-view. Due to a technical glitch the cable company unscrambled the pay-per-view channels all day long. It also happened to be raining and generally miserable out, so my buddies and I decided to watch this movie. We had three pay-per-view channels, and one of the channels showed a single movie all day long. Guess which movie it was.The first time we watched it, we thought it was goofy, even stupid, and didn't really care for it. However like many teens, we mindlessly watched it again . . . and again . . . and again. We watched this film all day. Why? you ask; because it truly gets better every time you watch it.I think the reason is because this is a stupid film, and when you first watch it, you're too smart for it. Eventually though the IQ points seep out of your head, and you're able to fully enjoy this great movie.The bottom line Watch this film at least 5 times, not necessarily back-to-back but it helps. It will grow on you. Even if you don't like Farley, watch this film for Chris Rock. Rock's performance is perfect, despite being too small of a role. Farley's performance is perfect as the bumbling but good-hearted Great White Ninja. Even the chicken's performance is perfect. If you find the concept of a fat, white ninja involved in an Asian gang war mildly provocative, check your brain at the door and enjoy. "},{"Title":"Silly, but funny.

He offers another gem of a performance in this one. He was found on a stormy night be Sensei and was named Haru, the prophisized Great White Ninja. The beginning of the film shows him training to be a ninja, with such funny stunts as him trying to lift a burning cauldron with his open forearms, spilling it all over the others. On the day of truth, he is not selected to graduate and become a ninja. The plot of the story is simply this - He is proposed by Allison Page to help her in a steal mission against a counterfeiter. Not all goes to plan when he witnesses a killing. He uses the matchbook that Allison gave him to determine that he must go to Beverly Hills in her aid. Little things like Farley leaving his shoes at the door of the hotel everytime he enters (and the janitor sweeping them up everytime) shows his native roots. The director was great at adding such small but noticeable tendencies to make it more realistic.Farley walks around looking for Allison dressed as a pimp - he is supposed to blend in with the locals - but that is not a good way to do it. All the while Gobbei, the best ninja declared by Sensei can be seen on the otherhand with his face painted to look like he is part of a statue. Throughout the movie he helps Haru and is his shadow to make sure he succeeds in his mission without Haru knowing he is being helped. Now forget the plot, it isn't going to win any awards. The meat of the film - what you really are there to see is Chris Farley pull off his hijinx. Funny scenes such as when he is in a Beverly Hills strip joint and he is up on stage and sees a hot stripper, he shakes his fists and says repeatedly I am one with the universe, I am one with the universe as a ninja SHOULD be, but he cannot resist her and starts dancing along side her, comically rubbing his nipples and then revealing his tight white undershirt which he attempts to rip. The crowd of men, all the while are cheering for him and he falls off the stage flat on his back breaking a table and is thrown out by the bouncers. Then when two men are shot out the buildings window by Tanley's goons and land by the garbage where Haru has been pushed, an Asian ladies repeatedly screams out the window which is classic and made me laugh. Another great scene is when Farley staying on his quest to help foil Tanley's plan, goes in disguise into a Japanese restaurant as a sushi cook person. This is the funniest point in the film and involves Farley flipping a shrimp down a woman's dress and he pulls it from her breasts, sniffing it and making some sort of funny comment. The final funny scenes is his pretending to be the money printing guy - I won't go into much but this was the best part of the movie and near the end too.I like the soundtrack, from I'm too sexy to Kung Fu Fighting, it was great. We see little of Chris Rock in this movie, a hotel employee who wants to learn how to become a ninja like Haru, and chases chickens to learn. It was Farley's spotlight and so deserved. Farley R.I.P.

Farley's films have always been comedies. Right from the cult-classic 'Tommy boy, to 'Black sheep', 'Almost Heroes' and 'Beverly Hills Ninja'. And in all those films, he has excelled.'Beverly Hills Ninja' tells the story of Haru, played by Farley, who was found by a clan of ninjas as an infant in an abandoned treasure chest and was raised by them. He never quite conforms to their culture and never acquires the skills of a ninja, but is nonetheless good-natured and persevering in his personal ambitions. His first mission brings him to Beverly Hills to investigate a recent murder.Now, if your a person who only enjoys 'Intelligent' & 'Real' Cinema, I'd say, Do Not watch this comedy. It's not meant for you. But for those, who admire comedy to the fullest, should not miss this. Sure, some jokes are kiddish, but some jokes, especially towards the finale, manage to bring in laughs.Dennis Dugan has the directed the film fairly. Acting wise It's Farley who really owns the film. He excels and comes across as cute and soft. If Farley lived more, I am sure, he would have gone a legend.Miss you Farley!

As a baby, Haru (Farley) appeared on the coastal shores of Japan. Legend has it that a foreigner would arrive and become the greatest ninja ever, known as the Great White Ninja. As Haru grew, it became apparent he was not the one. But when a beautiful stranger named Sally (Nicollette Sheridan) appears at the Jojo seeking a ninja's help, Haru finds his calling. Through a series of mix-ups (generally caused by Haru himself), Haru is framed for murder and he follows Sally to Beverly Hills to set things right. Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer, Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey (Chris Rock) and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei (Robin Shou) takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their purity--call it sadistic, but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these tried-and-true gags, which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick; a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mud-wrestling scene from Stripes. Beverly Hills Ninja may be considered a low-brow romp, but a romp it is nonetheless.

The humour can be very childish and silly; on the other hand one might enjoy watching this brand of silliness and absurdity. It won't win brownie points for being original, but still Chris Farley is absolutely hilarious as the bumbling, 'white' ninja that his antics had me in laughing in stitches.I am not going to say watch this movie, or buy it- Beverly Hills Ninja might have you in hysterics- or it may annoy and irritate you. It rather depends on how you view this film.Farley plays an orphan, initially adopted by a group of ninjas as a baby- however when he grows up he becomes aloof, overweight, sluggish and what you called say, a buffoon. Anyway, an attractive woman mistakes Farley as a real ninja- which he is anything but a ninja- and he is hired to help the blonde. Haru witnesses a murder and ends up in the US, Beverly Hills-hence the title of the film.The stupidity of this film stems from Farley's outrageous, and some would say laughable attempts at defeating the bad guys, despite his lack of karate skills at his disposal. If you are expecting a film big on narrative and great acting, don't bother; if you are expecting that this movie will really make you think, don't bother. If, however, you are up for a laugh and you want to watch a film as farcical, as stupid and as insanely funny, without taking this movie seriously, then Beverly Hills Ninja is definitely worth a viewing or two.Otherwise, watch something else.I however thought this was daft- very daft but also entertaining, highly amusing and a good laugh.

Now that I've seen it, while I think it is still very stupid and has some of the worst acting that I've ever seen in my life, I think this was one of those films that it was so bad that it was good. I think the only thing that really made me laugh about this film was Robin Shou, I haven't seen him in any other film other than Mortal Kombat, so it was amusing to see him in this film. He was so serious in this film and that his character as a ninja getting into these silly situations was just priceless. Chris Farley was alright, I have to admit that I could actually stand him in the film, I know that sounds bad, but from me, trust me, that's a compliment.Haru is the fat, white ninja, he was raised by the ninja master and has never succeeded at being a ninja like his brother, Gobei. But when Haru meets a girl who names herself, Sally Jones, she needs help from a ninja to find out if her boyfriend is a murderer. It turns out that he is also in a big counter fitting scam and Haru wants to help her out and goes to Beverly Hills to find a way to capture him. With the secret help of his brother and his protégé, Joey, Haru will help his dove and learn the life of a ninja in Beverly Hills.Over all Beverly Hills Ninja is a stupid movie, it has bad acting, and a silly story, but for some reason I did laugh a few times. It made the film kind of enjoyable, even for a Chris Farley film. I think my favorite part was the Japanese kitchen scene where we see Robin Shou dressed as a woman and how Chris Farley accidentally kills a guy who is about to kill him.

I even watched it a couple more times about a year later, and still liked it a lot! However, seeing it again several years later, I was no longer impressed. It no longer made me laugh at all, and I didn't even smile that much, either. Obviously, I have changed somewhat in the past few years, as this isn't the only comedy that I thought was really funny a few years ago but don't find very funny at all now (there's also Johnny English).When an American baby boy washes up on Japanese shores, he is found and adopted by a ninja clan, who name him Haru. They believe that he will turn out to be a great ninja, but sadly, as he grows up, this appears to be doubtful. Haru is very clumsy, doesn't fit in, and it seems that he will never fully make it as a ninja. However, one night, when he is left to guard the dojo, a young American woman, who claims that her name is Sally Jones, comes in, seeking help from a ninja. After some struggle, Haru soon sets out to Beverly Hills on a mission to find Sally Jones. His brother, Gobei is sent by the Sensei to secretly follow Haru around and help him. So, Haru and Gobei are both on challenging missions, but this is Haru's chance to prove himself a worthy ninja! Late former Saturday Night Live comedian Chris Farley played the starring role of Haru in this movie. The character is a walking disaster, the kind of role that Farley was always known to play in movies. Now, he COULD be funny in that role, but in Beverly Hills Ninja, he obviously wasn't given a very good script to work with, so he's not very funny here. The gags involving Haru lousing up on virtually everything (which are most of the gigs in the film) are mostly just plain stupid, and it obviously didn't take a comedic genius to write them. It's almost like the same joke throughout the film, starting out stale, yet continuing for the rest of the movie! Most of the jokes in this film are mediocre, but at least one of them is lower than that, which is the one with the Chet Walters character laughing to death.Fortunately, Chris Farley was funny in some movies (at least in Tommy Boy), and was hilarious in many SNL sketches, so we have that to remember him by, and that's why he's so sadly missed. Sadly, when this movie came out, he was getting close to his death, and he was going through a lot of trouble with substance abuse, which was what eventually killed him. It didn't help that apparently, he was upset after seeing himself in this film. So, aside from not enjoying this movie the last time I watched it, I was left with a bad feeling, knowing all this. To wrap this up, I will say that I don't recommend Beverly Hills Ninja unless you're an absolutely DIE-HARD Chris Farley fanatic, and want to see slapstick done VERY unprofessionally!

The entire film is basically just a setting for Chris Farley to show off and be funny - supposedly because he's Caucasian, overweight and incapable, and thus not very suitable as a ninja. While this idea might be fit for a single gag in a 90-minute comedy feature, it gets to serve as this movie's backbone and entire foundation. Needless to say, it grows boring in about 20 seconds, after which the rest of the film is rather akin to torture.Perhaps not surprisingly, another would-be funny person in the shape of Chris Rock also shows up. Normally this would only add more fuel to the fire and make a bad film even worse, but in this case, it's not really possible to sink much lower, Rock or no Rock.In short, avoid this movie at all costs. Kill relatives, burn down houses and start wars if it enables you to escape watching it. Give me an old school cliché-packed ninja movie that takes itself seriously any day.

Seizing the opportunity, Chris offers his services to her and thus, the adventure begins. This movie is standard Farley, humour which is buffoonish and anarchic - but that isn't a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. The best part of the film is when the aforementioned woman asks who the character who Chris plays is, and he wastes no time in telling her that he is the Great White Ninja that was foretold about in the ancient prophecies. Handily enough, the one copy of these precious words exist in scroll form, and are located nearby. Chris shows her the scroll, trying to unscroll it to the part where he is mentioned. The problem is, he is holding the ancient and valuable manuscript over a misplaced candle, and the priceless scroll is set alight. Farley reacts by throwing a bucket of water over it and ruining it forever! As if he wasn't in enough trouble already! Anyway, go and see the movie - You'll understand!

Nathaniel Parker is the target Sheridan focuses upon but one imagines that being part of this ridiculous film is punishment enough.

The plot is ridiculous. It relies on the totally unbelievable setting of a white fat guy trying to be a ninja, even though he is unrealistically clumsy, very ignorant and fairly retarded. It also makes everyone else in the film look like a grade A moron, everyone from the Sensei who would have thrown him out immediately, to the black bellboy who is convinced that he is a true ninja, even though he is as clumsy and incompetent as he is. The acting lies on a level somewhere between horrible and untalented. The characters are all stereotypes, and all seem to be equally stupid. The script is awful, and it puts the characters in a totally unbelievable amount of unrealistic, ridiculous scenes that would never happen in real life, and to top it off, are horribly unfunny. The only thing that raises this movie above the lowest rating of 1, is the scene near the end that has Chris Farley fight with martial arts against some enemies that are actually skilled at it, to the tune of Kung Fu fighting. That, unlike everything else in the movie, actually made me, not only smile and snicker, but laugh out loud at the sheer ludicrousness of the scene. Apart from that funny but too short scene, nothing in this movie is worth watching. Apart from, maybe, the female lead character, who is quite attractive.

The place  Cairo. The happening  I made an appointment with 2 of my friends at 9 45 AM near one of the biggest theaters downtown. This very cinema used to show every Friday's morning a movie for kids. Although me so my friends were in our early 20s but we managed to go in anyway.Because I'm the one who came up with this peerless suggestion, one of my friends told me he's worried about watching a movie among all-children-audience, but for experienced viewer like me who has been there more than once at many Fridays before, I made it clear that it's a real treat, and how the most annoying child is more quiet than any vexatious stupid who loves to crack jokes while the watching. The sight inside the cinema was fabulous; the kids were playing with their parents, the only echoes you hear were for laughs, till the lights went off, and the movie began, then the tranquility ruled.From the first minute he appeared (Chris Farley) captured the kids' hearts, so ours too. The movie's atmosphere, image, and fast pace made it a lovely cartoon. There was a funny moment every moment. The hot reactions of the kids and their thunderous laughs moved me in a way I can't forget.The strip club brief scene made one of my friends eye-popping, jaw-dropping and losing his capacity of talking, yet in a good way. But as for me, one of the top reasons that pushed me to catch the movie was Nicollette Sheridan's presence, back then she was so fantastically sexy, her very tiny moments in here satisfied me highly. I remember how her azure miniskirt hunted me originally from one of the movie's video trailers.. Yes, we went to the movies to see a flick that was available on VHS at the moment (but we couldn't find it ANYWHERE !).(Robin Shou) was so amusing as the guardian angel; his character was the smartest point in the script. Strangely it was, and still is, one of the rarest times to love Chris Rock's performance in anything, we got the biggest laugh when he did the TV interview at the end. However the stunt move at the very last scene was maybe the cleverest bit. Thank god that Dana Carvey didn't play the lead role as it was intentioned, he could've transformed it into Beverly Hills unbearable Ninja!I enjoyed it so much. It was without a doubt the best movie I've watched out of these showings especially at that year (surely better than ones like Flubber, Mousehunt, etc). And the 3 of us had the prettiest time. We even took some photos for us while the intermission.Years later, I watched it on TV. Of course not the same feelings. I felt this time how it's gaspingly easy sketch after another, crowded with physical comedy only. But even if, it was well-made, it prompted me to recall some of the silent cinema's liveliest comedies. And after (Tommy Boy) I won't say it's a step down for (Farley) inasmuch as another type of comedy for him, which's simpler, attracts the kids, and succeeds at making them happy. Otherwise why all the children at the cinema clapped crazily in cheering while he was avoiding the evil man's bullets by his 2 swards ?!

Of course, the boy grows up to be Chris Farley, which is a very different thing.So we have established a very bad ninja, who falls down a lot, breaks or burns a lot of valuable stuff, and is generally incompetent. So when a beautiful young girl called Allison from Beverly Hills just happens to wander by the ninja's remote secret training grounds, who better to ask for help than Chris Farley, oh sorry, Haru. That's his name in the movie, but I could have sworn he was just Chris Farley in a jumpsuit. To totally convince the girl of his competence he trashes the joint by accident, but this doesn't bother her. In Chris Farley-Land, the mishaps of Chris Farley are invisible.So, Haru finds out quickly that Allison's husband is a counterfeiter and a big-time crook. He finds out about this, because the husband drops little hints like saying 'I am a crook'. In fact, all the characters have the convenient habit of describing themselves and their actions at convenient times. This is the hallmark of fine screenwriting. But I digress.Haru decides to try and find Allison in Beverly Hills. He takes a plane and sets off the metal detector. He courteously removes all his metal weapons, including two huge swords. Do the security guards cuff him immediately for trying to compromise airline security? Nope. Do they take the weapons from him? Nope, he still has the swords in the next scene, in America! What they do is just look at each other, probably thinking why are we in this stupid movie?In America, Haru gets in a car. He makes it obvious in his own, subtle little Farleyesque way that he has never seen a car before. Then he proceeds to drive away in it. 10 IQ points to anyone who can spot the error here.Another 10 IQ points is awarded to the person who can see, that Haru speaking american in a Hollywood accent from the very first scene is a little odd for a kid raised in Japan by ninjas, who at least speak american with appropriate comedy japanese accents.Tally up 10 IQ points for each of these you can see- Chris Rock plays a character, who works in a swanky, 5-star hotel, yet lives in the grubbiest ghetto you can imagine.- The real ninja, Gobei, knows what Allison looks like, despite never having seen her before.- Paying customers to an all-girl strip joint cheer and clap, when Haru blunders onto the catwalk and begins to take all his clothes off (as part of his 'walk-in-the-shadows' strategy)- Haru's reaction to placing his nose on an incredibly hot frying surface in a restaurant is to keep his nose on the surface, smoking and sizzling away, while saying 'aaahh-wooooo-aaaaah'. In a related incident, a boiling hot greasy shrimp is flicked straight from the cooking surface in between a young girl's breasts. Her reaction to the immense pain of a grease-burn on sensitive skin is saying 'ooh' coyly.- The cover operation of the bank note counterfieting business is called 'Beverly Hills Bank Note'- After Haru exposes the entire racket and knows all the crooks' secrets, they capture him. Once he escapes, the bag guys find out, but they don't care that he's gone free.- Horses overtake a sports car, presumably going as fast as it can.If you have 90 IQ points, then, well, you have more points than the producers of this stink-bomb of a movie. Everyone and everything is stupid. The characters are flat and pointless, and so is the abundant, obligatory Farley slapstick.I know it's supposed to be a silly movie, but the writing is just so terrible it could be on Mystery Science Theater. There are good zany comedies out there, a few of the Zuckerman movies spring to mind. They have stupid situations too, but they are on some plane believable.Oh, sorry I said 'plane'. The Collective Consciousness Plane in this movie takes the cake for being the stupidest sequences in the movie. Well, it would have taken the cake, had Chris Farley not eaten it.

It could have been Crocodile Dundee with a ninja. Unfortunately, thanks to the casting of Chris Farley, an awful script, and an untalented director, this film wallows in the laugh-free zone.Farley plays a ninja from Japan who comes to Beverly Hills looking for a woman named Sally Jones, who has requested help from The Fat One. But unfortunately for Farley, tracking down a blonde-haired woman in Beverly Hills is going to be harder than he ever imagined. After he (finally) tracks her down with the help of Joey (equally unfunny comedian Chris Rock), he is led into a plot that seems put together by five-year-olds. The film obviously had no thought put into it at all.Chris Farley, Mr. Over the Top, is as unfunny as ever. Unlike John Candy - who he has been compared to - Farley is simply not funny. Candy used subtle comedy. Let's compare the two...For example, in Beverly Hills Ninja, Chris Farley goes through a security device at an airport. It beeps, and he instantly flails his arms about, screaming and yelling, punching the device. He them calms down realizing it is a machine. Before going through the device, we can see Farley waiting for his cue to slap the thing. You can see it in his eyes. He's just waiting to go out of control, screaming. And when he does so, it isn't funny.John Candy, on the other hand, is much funnier going through a security device. In Who's Harry Crumb? - a bad comedy, but nevertheless one to compare to - Candy goes through a scanner and it beeps. He looks around innocently, and does the same thing Farley does without punching and screaming wildly at the device.There's something about the energy that Farley releases that makes me sick. It's worse than watching Jim Carrey and Robin Williams combined. He will suddenly go crazy, slapping and punching and running around. Then, the next moment, he's calm. And we can just see all the energy inside him - and it can't wait to release itself again. It's more obnoxious than anything.The script is pitifully unfunny. I didn't laugh a single time at any of the gags. It's a cheap excuse for getting Chris Farley to display his unwanted energy. Perhaps Beverly Hills Ninja seemed like a good idea before they filmed it, but it doesn't look so great on the celluloid, that's for sure.1/5 stars "},{"Title":"My Feedback","Date":"3 January 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":"  This movie was so hilarious that some of us have gone crazy.

Or twice. More stupid than anything. It did have one redeeming factor David Spade wasn't in it. Although, if I had to watch this movie again, I would probably WANT him in it. But David Spade will go on to do his own unfunny movies, as I have found out. If you like Chris Farley you'll probably at least sit thru this mess, unless you want to watch some other unfunny comic's, i.e. watch a David Spade movie, or a Adam Sandler movie, or a Pauly Shore movie.....now THOSE would be a real waste of time. Why do I have to have 10 lines of text when I can't think of anything else to say about this movie except it's BAD???

Having the casts of SNL made the movie work. The late Chris Farely as Haru was really a riot. Playing a buffoon ninja who really can prove his mentor his worthiness just by believing in himself. Chris Rock, another alum was great seeing an non-Asian ninja. Just saying to himself, Now I've seen it all! This movie was full of slapstick humor, crazy antics, and most of all, love and respect.

I disagree, these kind of jokes are made by ten year olds.Weather Chris Farley can act or not, cannot be seen in a moviethis bad. And for this mentally challenged dude who likes to watch Farley'shaters get irritated, get a life ( and a sense of humour). Cuz this really IS one of the worst movies ever made. See it only for some martial arts action not featuring silly fat man. "}]
