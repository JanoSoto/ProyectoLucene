Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problem-solving message, but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story.Most viewers will have realized that Lost Highway is a story about a schizophrenic murderer (even Lynch mentioned it). But that is not the complete clue to the movie. Cause everyone is aware of Fred's metamorphosis (although no one seems to really care about). So his mutation seems to be real and till the end no one proves the opposite! But Lost Highway is not a common movie about schizophrenia like Beautiful Mind or Das weiße Rauschen (Which is a must-see, too!). INSANITY IS NOT THE SUBJECT, BUT THE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOVIE! In other words The movie is not a presentation of mental sickness, but a complete sick presentation, which means that the subjective perception of the protagonist becomes the objective reality! You'll find this way of telling a story quite often in surrealistic literature (i.e Franz Kafka's Die Verwandlung engl. Metamorphosis - just note the title!!).All Lynch-Movies refer to mental illness or the state of dreaming No character ever seems to care about the illogical and irrational twists of the plot(just like in dreams), the landscapes are unrealistic and change appearance or size and the story takes place at deserted areas (forests, claustrophobic rooms, industrial areas, desserts) far away from civilization or reality!Insanity - Sanity/ Evil - Good/ Reality - Fiction are no longer categories one can rely on. The protagonists see their surroundings and environment always threatening, but they never question it! They act with such a matter of course, that one has to ask whether it is ignorance, naiveté or self-deception. Perhaps you don't have to ask yourself how far you are able to UNDERSTAND the message. Perhaps you have to ask yourself how far you are willing to ACCEPT the message. Be aware, that once you started seeing the world at a different way you will follow that white rabbit right the way in his burrow...

Of course, Lynch isn't one to follow any kind of Hollywood Rule. His films always have a general sense of the surreal, of emotions only understandable to the characters and actions that defy comprehension. They always have lurid eroticism or at least one character with a sexual perversion. And, for the most part, his films are incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. 'Lost Highway' has just been defined for you, though not explained. Perhaps the film is not meant to be explainable, perhaps it is just an abstract work meant to involve us and toy with our emotions until we forget it right after we leave. But the film is memorable so that cannot be the reason. Maybe Lynch is just working out personal demons and only he is meant to benefit from doing the film. I'll explain what I mean.'Fred Madison' Bill Pullman is a sax player who performs at the local club. He and his wife 'Renee' Patricia Arquette live in a funky Lynchian house that seems designed specifically to disturb the audience. Their marriage and sex life is not going well. One day, 'Renee' finds a videotape on the doorstep. When they play it, it is almost like a promotional video for their house, moving down every hallway before entering the bedroom where 'Fred' and 'Renee' are shown sleeping. The tape abruptly shorts out to snow. 'Fred' and 'Renee' are obviously quite bothered by this. They call the police, who don't really impact the situation in any way. Later, at a party, 'Fred' meets an ingratiating pasty-faced man Robert Blake at a party who calmly explains ''We've met before, haven't we'' and then goes on to explain they met at 'Fred's house and that the man is ''There right now, phone me''. He does seem to be at both ends of the line. 'Fred' immediately grabs 'Renee and they leave to go home. This leads to one of the most tense and terrifying sequences I have ever viewed on a piece of celluloid since Hitchcock. Since we know Lynch is directing, we know anything could happen......And does.I have not given away anything. In fact, the events I have described might have never happened. In fact, any event or character that enters the film may or may not have happened. The film exists in it's own queer dimension. Lynch shots the film like a noir, with 'Renee' as the femme fatale. The colors are pitch-dark and lush which helps structure the film into what it is, a psychological nightmare. It manipulates our emotions to a shocking extent and we don't know how Lynch is doing it because nothing in the movie makes sense. Lynch himself uses the phrase 'psychogenic fugue' when describing the movie as he says the hero is 'inventing a fantasy because his real life is so screwed up.' Patricia Arquette is more blatant when describing the film; 'Fred Madison is a f@#$ed up guy who invents a fantasy because his real life is so f%$#ed up. But Fred is so f%$#ed up that his fantasy falls apart...'' Makes sense to me. It would explain the bizarre events and would explain the ending. Fred is so angry and so paranoid that he has a fit in his car, twisting and whipping his head around in circles because his fantasy has gone wrong and collapsed. The film reveals clues that support this explanation. At one point, the pasty-faced man says of Renee ''Her name is Alice, if she told you her name was Renee, she was lying. And you, who the f$#@ ARE YOU!'' This suggests that Renee has used him and that 'Fred' doesn't even know who he is. If you were inventing a fantasy about yourself and you wanted to create a given persona, isn't it possible that you could forget who you were in the first place?Some people have suggested that the 'Mystery Man' Robert Blake is a manifestation of 'Fred's' illness. But then why does it seem that the 'Mystery Man' is trying to help 'Fred'? Perhaps 'Fred' has created the 'Mystery Man' in the hopes that this being will solve the mystery for him, to egg him on until he saves himself. And the mob boss 'Mr Eddy' Robert Loggia is the real villain cold, calculating, abusive and spontaneously violent, just like a virus. And 'Renee/Alice' is just one of the virus' cohorts, reproduced from the DNA of the virus to spread the illness and incapacitate the victim.Or perhaps the most likely explanation; It is a Lynchian fantasy designed to screw the mainstream audience and entertain open moviegoers.This makes the most sense. People will always want to explain this film, to dig up it's secrets. Maybe the secrets will never be uncovered. Maybe there are no secrets and it is just a Lynch film calculated to please his fans. Any way you see it, it will never be solved. I wish you good luck if you try to solve the film in its entirety,... But you will certainly have fun doing it.

It is, as Lynch intended it to be, a film realization of a dream. In this regard, it is comparable, in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's _Dreams_.  Indeed, in terms of sensory experience - cinematography and sound, for example - Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However, the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content.  Lost Highway is really no dream, but a nightmare.Let's face it, like it or not, everything Lynch does is intentional.  This film has inspired polarized reviews here on IMDB.  Those looking for a plot-heavy movie that they do not necessarily have to pay attention to tend to despise it.  Those who are open to allowing this manipulative, intensely disturbing and thought-provoking film to carry them into its own parcel of hell love it.  This is, in my opinion, what good art can do.Like a dream, Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives.  It forces itself upon you with a vengeance, but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming.I recommend Lost Highway highly.  See it with intelligent, open-minded friends who like to talk about film experiences.  And expect that the conversation will keep you up way past your bed time.

Meanwhile, he introduces a bunch of bizarre &#150; but extremely fascinating &#150; characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in top-condition, in other words&#133;you almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience.  The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score (Angelo Badalamenti), a blasting soundtrack (Rammstein!) and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically, even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquette&#133;either blond or brunette&#133; looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. Lost Highway comes with my highest possible recommendation, yet I still prefer the David Lynch of the lat 70's and 80's.

This film is, however, making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching, but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery, an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching; What exactly is this film about?. As soon as the credits were over, I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you, when you see the very end, exclaim Ah! Now I get it!. This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream, or, more appropriately, a nightmare. The film is great; it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating, however. This was an excellent example of masterful film-making. Lynch's direction is eminent, evidenced by the fact that I kept watching, despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any character(something we are much too used to from mainstream movies). The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it, and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood, nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone.

In Mulholland Drive, people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway.Although it is described as a modern film-noir, it's more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The use of music to increase the suspense of the film is used a lot here and in many Hitchcock films such as Psycho.

That's the thing I remembered most from the first time I saw this film.  Amazing lighting.  Certain directors, Lynch included, are able to tell the story using camera movement, what's seen/not seen.  Lynch, however, has taken that a step further with the way he chooses to light his scenes - he sculpts his shots in a manner that seems almost more like a theatrical lighting designer's work.  The use of shadows within the home, the stark colors that accompany certain scenes, even the car lighting in the titles - all of this is used to draw the audience's attention to a certain point, and all of it thrills.  With the terse, European art-film dialogue style (at first the most distancing thing I found in Lynch's work, it is now one of my favorite elements), sharp sound work, a strong cast, and the marvelous, spiralling structure of the film only reinforcing it's strongest feature - its atmosphere - this is a work that will be discussed long after the credits fade.

You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasn't There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time.     One of the most eery parts of the film is when (Bill Pullman) is making love to his wife (Patricia Arquette) and her face turns into the mystery man (Robert Blake). A very freaky looking individual, indeed. In my eyes, he represents the devil. But, that's my take on it.     Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert.

This statement perfectly reflects how I felt about Lost Highway; I really liked the film, even if my reaction throughout was what the f**k?. The trick to understanding a David Lynch film isn't to try and decipher each individual scene, but rather to try and find out what the 'message' of the film is, or what Lynch is trying to say, and see how this message fits in with each scene. This is what made Lost Highway so much fun. It's undeniably one of the most terminally wierd films I've ever seen (maybe even more so than Eraserhead), whether you get it or not, but it's so deliciously cryptic and bizarre that you can't stop watching. At the end, you'll wish Lynch was sitting beside you so you could ask him what happened, but what you made of it is probably the right answer. The one thing I thought was a little off with Lost Highway was it's overall 'MTV-ish' feel, with it's guest appearance from Marilyn Manson and it's soundtrack including Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails, at times I just thought that maybe Lynch was just making a really wierd video clip the MTV kids will eat up.

Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction, I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things; how he shows us the elements, the language he uses, and what he leaves out for us to discover. So, then - *SPOILERS*, if I'm rightAs with MD, there's a big clue in the first few seconds Fred is shown in close-up, looking thoroughly wrecked, smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound, and light sweeps across his face and the room. *The sound is one you'll become familiar with later, in the jailhouse.* Fred looks up, warily.Major premise I believe this scene shows Fred, in the last moments of his life, having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may, in fact, be the only 'real' scene in the film, with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection, and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.As the door to his cell opens, Fred rejects the awfulness of reality, and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom, and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection, which - as he himself says - is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal, with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly, the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds - listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones' - and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.At the party scene several events take place his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy - because he's seen through Fred's eyes - lounge-lizard Andy are effectively confirmed (for him). And he meets the 'Mystery Man', a devil-figure who tells Fred You invited me (into your home). It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted. I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else a 'devil who made him do it' - don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity, or his jealousy. Or all of the above - all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.As the flashback continues, we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee, horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video, but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over - they're a blur to Fred - and he winds up on Death Row.Facing execution, and unable to tolerate his real state, Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person - an innocent young, enjoying a simple life, good at his simple job; with groovy, understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasy-made-real the dialogue is ludicrous; the events comic-book. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.Although safe in this new fantastical environment, Fred/Peter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger, initially via his unlikely relationship with the - again comic-book - gangster boss, Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a one-dimensional, violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.Even so, Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the grease-monkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger, and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee the pure-hearted damsel in distress that is Alice.Except that, once again, Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia, and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful, greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. (I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films, and one of the candidates is, I think, the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a Fred/Peter fantasy, so we continue, with the point about her ruthlessness made.)What else? The storyline continues as might be expected, with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns, and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight, during which the devil-figure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat Eddy/Dick Laurent (as we have discovered), and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless, and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.And then Fred begins another metamorphosis, which we never see completed, and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape, or his death in the Chair? I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack, put electrodes on his nuts, and extract the line-by-line details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry. And marvel.

But, without knowing it, he's caught in an infinite, time-travelling, paradox conundrum. Confused? It gets even more complex.Someone is leaving sinister video tapes on their doorstep. At first it only shows the exterior of their house. But the subsequent tapes reveal a little more and more.At a party hosted by one of his wife's sleazy 'friends' a mystery man appears out of the crowd and tries to convince Fred that they've met before. Not quite aware of the true nature of the nightmare he's falling into, Fred dismisses this man as crazy and promptly leaves the awful party. At home, Fred disappears into the shadows of the labyrinthine hallway and isn't seen again til next morning.The last videotape reveals Fred brutally murdering and dismembering Renee. Only he cannot remember doing it. Caught by the cops and sent to prison awaiting the chair, Fred begins to suffer agonising headaches. Then, one night, in solitary confinement, he goes through a psycho-genetic fugue and transforms into a completely different person.Next morning the guards and warden are freaked to discover Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), a 24-year old mechanic, in Fred Madison's cell. With no choice but to let him go, Pete goes back to his parents house while closely tailed by the cops. Something has happened to Pete a few days earlier and his parents are keeping their mouths shut. They can barely comprehend it themselves and it appears that Pete is involved in the same nightmare plot as Fred Madison was.A powerful gangster named Dick Laurent/Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia)has a fondness for Pete and his ability to fix any car. But when he swings by the garage with his new floozy Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette again) he falls instantly in love with the woman, despite having 'femme fatal' practically tattooed, in bold, on her forehead.Pete and Alice begin a relationship of nothing but aggressive shagging. And slowly, but surely, a world of mystery unlike anything you've ever seen is so vividly realised that you are practically pulled right into the film itself. The atmosphere is so thick that it'll flood over into your living room.David Lynch's direction is honed to perfection. The cinematography is flawless and expertly framed. Lynch is a master of space and sound and the world of Lost Highway is at once beautiful and downright evil. He uses sly editing tricks to keep you paying the utmost attention and even if you don't take your eyes off the screen for a slit second it will still takes dozens of viewings to even begin solving it.The ingenuity of Lost Highway is that it can be interpreted in so many ways but there is always one piece of the puzzle that Lynch has deliberately warped or hammered out of shape so that it doesn't fit and negates any theory you may have. You could spend hours (and I have) painstakingly trying to make sense of it all and you can some close to the answer but be so far from the truth.

His interest is simply described duals.All his films work with some exploration of this idea. What makes him interesting is that he doesn't work the usual way, with a reality and then a surreal overlay. Both elements in his experiments are what we coarsely call surreal. The game in traveling with him is an investment in the idea that there is no anchor to reality, that all references are among imaginations, sometimes twisted. Mulholland was a little too conventional for me because you could actually explain things and one of the realities was sorta real if you ignored a few things.My favorite Lynch is Velvet, which imposes the two warring realities on film genres. The most fun is the seemingly straight Straight story, which is perhaps the most bizarre encounters of dual strangeness because it seems so ordinary. Dualing roots that keep getting mowed.But if you are into Lynch, this is an extraordinary pleasure, this one. Its the most obvious in plan, the least hidden in the swirl of two worlds. Neither world is anchored in reality and each hallucinates the other. Probably the only anchor with reality is the most disturbing character in appearance, The Robert Blake guy.But even these two surrealities are nested in cinematic realities. One is the gangster movie, elevated to cosmic status by the French new wave. The other is visual jazz and the accompanying dream linkages that have been similarly blazed, starting with Dennis Hopper so far as American films.What you are open to determines what you can get, I suppose. What Lynch provides is a sort of post-post modern notion of film as sometimes centered in itself, with its own cosmologies and lives that always refer to other film notions and never to real ones. There is no fold of us as viewer, no acknowledgment of our world at all (except for the mysterious videos). Celestial madness.I prepared for this by watching four bad Holmes movies in a row. How we detect and discover is what this is about and is so superior to what we normally encounter, you should watch it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

The elements of film noir are these a man who is innocent of all wrong, finds himself in an inescapable situation in which he is pointed out as a culprit/criminal. He is helpless not only in wrenching free of the circumstances (usually he is set up by someone), but is quite in the dark as to how he arrived in the center of the mess in the first place. Another element is that the man is usually used by a woman.All of these fit in with Lost Highway. The Bill Pullman character definitely finds himself in bizarre relationship with his wife (played by Patricia Arquette), receives strange videos of someone entering his house, and then showing him murdering his wife. His character is completely innocent from the audience's point of view. In some supernatural, nonlinear way that must involve some kind of time warp, he is fingered as his wife's assassin and jailed for it. And you can't help think that his wife is somehow in on it.When the transformation into the Balthazar Getty character happens, it is Balthazar's turn to meet another woman (played, not by accident, by Patricia Arquette)who then seduces him and uses him to escape her relationship with her mobster boyfriend. The Getty character is unaware that he is being used, although comes to some realization that she's not as innocent as she seems.In the end, when the Getty character transforms back into the Pullman character, you realize, a little at least, why the two are connected. They, perhaps, are connected because they represent the fact that finding oneself helpless, framed, and convicted (at least on one level), is a universal phenomenon, not just one meant to tell a story.When Pullman, running from the cops, stops by his own house to warn himself via intercom of his future--that's really a nice touch, and makes your hair stand on end. The self trying eternally to reach back and save itself (or something like that).And then, when he's driving down the Lost Highway, it's really spooky because you don't know whether it is a highway to redemption or a useless attempt to escape the inescapable.It's such a great movie, and a million things could be said about it on so many different levels. Lynch's creepiness, and his use of the other-worldly elements really make the movie. To me, Lynch is the best American director alive. Jarmusch, Scorsese et al are fine, but they've yet to produce the kind of complexity of form and transcendence of vision that Lynch has achieved.

Some critics have written it off as self-indulgent swill, saying that only people who could hope to appreciate it would be Lynch himself and his plethora of wide-eyed adoring fans, etc, etc. I myself have never actually been a huge fan of Lynch, perhaps because I thought his stories didn't take themselves seriously enough, were just too darn quirky, who knows. Still, I've always admired his talent for creating beautiful, disturbing imagery, and Lost Highway has to be my favorite film of his, and possibly one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing I've ever seen! Certainly not for everyone, as those who want a definitive answer, who think that seeing it again and again is really going to explain everything, or those who are simply into the ol' explosion-packed action blockbusters are going to be left shaking their heads. It's definitely open to interpretation. Myself, I'm not one to offer any new insight, I view it as--SPOILER AHEAD??--a purely subjective movie, with nearly all the events seen and largely imagined by its protagonist, Fred Madison, and once you can simply accept him as insane (or at least very imaginative!) you can simply quit puzzling over it and allow yourself to enjoy the ride.While incarcerated for killing his wive in an act of jealousy, he embarks on a psychogenic fugue as an act of last-minute escapism from the looming dread of his upcoming execution--sort of like Ambrose Bierce's Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge--imagining himself as a younger, more likable/worthwhile guy (valued auto mechanic, Mr. Eddy's favorite), with people who care about him (his parents and girlfriend, as opposed to his real-life murdered wife who didn't even bother to go to his musical performances), and definitely more virile, as he is able to both attract and fulfill his wife (seen here as the slutty, icy femme fatale-type he always suspected her to be). However, try as he may, he ultimately can't avoid his past (notice how the fantasy him is put off when he hears Fred's jazz song on the radio in the garage), and thus after the fantasy Alice/Renee rejects him in the desert, he immediately turns back into his typical view of himself--hurt, older, sensitive, vulnerable (represented by his nakedness)--proving that even his fantasies fail him, and thus he's left to die an unpleasant death in the electric chair after all (notice the way he violently contorts in the closing moments, almost as if he's being electrocuted). Call him a modern-day murderous Walter Mitty I guess. The Fred Madison/O.J. Simpson comparisons made by some are interesting--if just a BIT cynical!--though I have to halfway wonder if that real-life spousal jealousy murder case provided any grain of inspiration for this fictional one. The cast is impressive and do a great job; Bill Pullman definitely has the haunted, deer-in-the-headlights look that his confused, out-of-it character requires, though at the same time I don't know if he quite portrays the extreme jealousy and animal savageness deep down inside that caused him to murder his wife as gruesomely as he did (if of course you even want to accept what was on that final videotape as something that actually happened in the first place!). Needless to say, the whole moebius-strip twist of having the film end at its beginning greatly complicates any interpretation; even without it, the film could STILL be difficult to decipher by some (heck, I'm still not even really sure what the significance of the Mystery Man was!)Perhaps the film could have benefited from a few extra scenes or lines of dialogue to make it a little less cryptic for the more literal-minded members of the audience, but still, even by suggesting that you'd be implying that there was one concrete explanation for the film, which there most certainly is not.Regardless, all plot and interpretations aside, you can almost certainly enjoy for its images, its music (an EXCELLENT soundtrack), for its mood and atmosphere, and simply for it as a whole dare I say, it's almost more of an experience than anything (though for what it's worth, at the same time I can't think of the last time I saw a film--or work of art period, for that matter--that provoked such a wide variety of interpretations and opinions, as should hopefully be the case with ANY great work of art).Fascinating. "},{"Title":"The movie is over, but I'm still thinking about it.","Date":"10 April 2006","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Dear reader.First of all, I must say that my review is more like a discussion and it's meant for those who saw the movie rather then those who didn't. So if you didn't see Lost Highway, and just reading the reviews in order to decide whether to watch it or not, then I'll only repeat others in saying that this is a masterpiece in every aspect. It has one of the best cinematography ever, amazing soundtrack and a superb cast. An unforgettable movie, one of those, people like spending time to talk about. Well I guess that my rating already speaks for itself.Now, a discussion for those who saw the movie.Lost Highway begins with Fred getting a message that Dick Laurent is Dead, hearing the sirens of the police vehicles. The movie ends in the same tune, with Fred leaving this message and running from the police. Which one of these scenes happened? Maybe both of them are elaborations of Fred's mind?At the beginning of the movie, Fred said to us as a clue, that he remembers things not exactly the way they happened. This is exactly what we are shown. A collection of scenes without a particular order, while some of them are real and others are not. The whole plot of this movie still remains a mystery to me, though some parts of the puzzle could be placed. First of all, there's a general consensus that Fred killed his wife. It's unknown whether he did it himself, or hired someone else to do the job, but he's sentenced for that crime to death. While awaiting the execution his mind elaborates an illusion / dream where he manages to escape his death. This is the catharsis, where Fred is haunted by what he's done.The second part, where Pete is the main character, is clearly an illusionary one from start to end. Nothing in it seems rational. Here are some of the things that make it obvious 1) Peter doesn't know why he is in prison ( because it seems to be a dream ), apparently he doesn't really have a reason to be there, so he is released. 2) Peter's parents showing little interest in what is going on in Peter's life. They just sit still in their house, watching T.V. and not interfering in his life. 3) The girls in this part are seems to be crazy about Peter. And he satisfies them - which is contrary to his real life, where he is not much of a lover to his wife. This is how he would like to be 4) When Eddy takes Pete for a ride - he does this for no particular reason ( as in our dreams we do things without a reason ). 5) The ride itself is highly fictional. Starting with the part when Pete fixes Eddy's car ( what does he do there). Continuing with the driver in the white car that Eddy's Mercedes hits. When Eddy looks in the front mirror of the car he sees the driver in the right seat, but when the driver passes the Mercedes and shows Eddy the finger he is sitting on the left side of his car. The crash itself is very unlikely either. 6) When Alice tells Peter how she met Eddy. She was forced to undress. 7) The hallway in Andy's mansion is the same as the hallway in the Lost Highway Hotel shown to us near the end.Some scenes from the first and the third parts ( by parts in this movie i mean to the sequence of scenes between two adjacent shots of moving highway ) are imaginary also. Like Fred's running from the police at the end of the movie, but in fact he's not going anywhere, he's in prison. What I think is real in the movie, is the scene of police in Andy's place. Why? Because it is the only scene where Fred (or Pete) is not participating. In this scene we have a mention of Peter Dayton, Fred's wife, Dick Laurent and a coincidence between the murder cases. Maybe ( purely a theory ) Peter Dayton is the one who has been hired to kill Andy and Dick Laurent...Lost Highway resembles in many ways Lynche's other work, but still remains original and adds something new. There are the dark corridor, the red curtain, the fade in / fade out change of scenes etc. To me Lost Highway and Mullholland Drive are David Lynche's best movies I've seen ( but not the only that are good ), where Mullholand Drive is slightly better being less cryptic and having a solid logical solution to it. "},{"Title":"Why does everyone think Fred did it? *****SPOILERS*****","Date":"14 December 2006","Score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Someone said that Lynch has said that Fred was a schizophrenic murderer. Well yes, he either killed or had Dick Laurent killed. I don't believe he killed his wife. We see the evil mobster Mr.Eddy showing snuff films in his house where someone apparently is murdered in it on the TV screen. Which seems to represent true images. Why not just porno, of course it makes Eddy look more menacing but is that necessary? Showing the snuff film is not an accident, it is necessary to the plot. We see Arquette with the mobster watching the snuff film on the TV late in the film. She makes films for a guy she knows kills people on film, she is embracing him and letting him have his way with her We never actually see Fred murder his wife. In fact Fred in the video before he is punched by the police Fred clearly has no weapon in his hand and is in shock. Why leave the weapon out of the video if Fred killed his wife? Given the people she was in with why isn't it a possibility that unbeknownst to her she was put in a snuff film, murdered, and then brought back to her house so as to frame the murder on Fred? Fred comes home sees the body and could have very well been forced to play in the gore by whoever was behind the camera. Tape ends up with the police, case closed. As far as Fred as a man he is obviously not a big time musician, he is playing in a small club. The house he and his wife share is a multi-million dollar house there is no way Fred could afford that kind of house on what he makes. So he marries a woman who has a multi-million dollar house and doesn't know what she does for a living?(heck it might even be Eddys house that would explain the horrible vibe in the house) No way. The laugh they share at the beginning of the film when Arquette says she is going to 'read' when he is out tells us all. So out of the window goes the explanation that Fred and his happy wife were plodding along and suddenly he discovers she is in porno and kills his wife, Andy, and Eddy. He had to have known she was in porno and aligned with Andy and Eddy, million dollar houses don't grow on trees. That also explains why the satanic character in the film tells Fred 'You invited me into your house, it is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted'. He invited evil into his house by living with the knowledge that his wife was a professional whore, and associated with wholly evil men. This analysis is also backed up by the fact that Fred sees the mystery man/satanic character briefly imposed on his wife's face. This sends a clear message and clearly explains how he got 'into the house' it was through Fred's wife and her evil conduct.Fred lived with his wife day in and day out with some childish notion he could 'save' her from her degraded life.(which is represented by the way the naieve Pete character treats her) When it was in fact her choice to live it, and in fact Fred benefited greatly from that life materially. He had cars, million dollar house, nice clothes, status. So really his romantic notion to save his wife was self-deception. Fred liked the life his wife's evil afforded him.However at some point he found out that his wife was in snuff films where people got killed. Instead of at this point realizing the total and complete degradation of his wife and leaving her. He hangs onto his fantasy image of his wife being forced into participating. Blames Laurent, and has him killed.Killing Laurent sets up the horrific chain of events. Laurents partner in crime, the sleazy guy at the party finds out about Fred's hit on Laurent. Which is shown in the film at the party, we see the instant where it becomes known to the sleazy guy that Fred had something to do with the death of Laurent. The sleazy guy is the one responsible for the videotapes that get the police involved. If hes not why have the long setup with the series of videotapes? He is the one who kills Freds wife to set Fred up. They probably even force Fred to play in the gore while they tape it as an added punishment.The film is incredible it really shows the type of person that lives a life like Fred. Fred is utterly human, and I think anyone who tries to write him off as 'mentally ill' would have trouble doing so. After watching the film one must admit there's a little bit of Fred in all of us.(some more than others ) "}{"Title":"Remarkable mystery noir","Date":"28 April 2011","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" David Lynch is one of the few directors that have managed to sustain a niche audience for his movies. His perception of movie making and how he views the world was very evident from his debut Eraserhead. Many critics have questioned his style and some have not been convinced also. Many people refer to him as the master of mystery and horror. However a majority of his features have dwelled more in to the mind of the individual rather than presenting a linear story. It has not been his style to present everything understandably. To confuse the viewer and raise questions has been his speciality. Each one of his movies have been different to each other. But the common factor has always existed, character driven. One element that has been very repetitive in his movies is 'black comedy'. This theme he manages to beautifully blend with mystery and horror. I admire his obsession with the mystical world and surrealism. He really has the ability to depict all this in a convincing and believable manner. He is a director to be reckoned with. One would have hoped that he would make movies more occasionally. In recent interviews Mr Lynch has commented on saying that he draws inspiration from dreams and nightmares that he has. This is easy to relate to and this is transcended to the screen. Many of the mystery elements that pervade in his movies have never been explained by him. But he is an artist and I feel that as a movie viewer one should admire and appreciate his work as a piece of art or a painting rather than attempting to decipher and unravelling it.Lost Highway is one of his movies that I highly regard as having cult status. It may well be in the archives for being the most complicated movie to understand. However I doubt it could hold a candle to the recent Inception. It is presented in a mobius strip format where the beginning comes back in full circle. The noir elements very much exist in every form and character, right from the Patricia Arquette's femme fatale wife to Robert Loggia as the gangster. David Lynch used his own residence in the first 40 minutes. It may have saved on production costs but the setting was appropriate for mysterious environment. Initially we feel that we are about to watch a movie about a couple trying to discover who is sending them videotapes with the footage of their house. But this leads to more suspense and mystery after the wife is murdered. And the movie takes a totally different turn. The movie could have turned in to a murder mystery, but Lynch cleverly averts that. Barry Gifford supported Lynch on the script and has presented a fabulous outcome. A simple plot has been presented in a complicated manner. Every scene mystifies and raises questions to the point that it feels difficult to digest. Lynch once stated that O.J Simpson's murder trail inspired him to make this movie. To what extent that is true, I could not say.SPOILERS Fred Madison and Renee are couple that live together who seem to have secrets that are hidden from each other. Fred doubts Renee about what she may be doing in her free time meanwhile Renee acts very mysteriously. One morning Renee picks up a video tape from the door step. They watch it together and there is a footage of the exterior of their residence. Later that night after a miserable session of attempted sex, Fred begins to doubt Renee even more as she sympathises with him. The next morning they receive another tape. This time it shows footage of them the couple sleeping together. This immediately become a concern to them and they contact the authorities. Two detectives arrive and after inspecting the residence fail to find any signs of forced entry. The same night at a party of Renee's friend Andy, a mysterious short man calls Fred's house and surprisingly he himself answers. The couple return back home to find nothing. Fred is then arrested and given the death sentence for Renee's murder. He however does not recall anything. After complaining of headaches his identity changes to a young mechanic Pete played by Baltzar Getty. He is released from prison and two detectives watch his movements. Surprisingly a woman who resembling Renee appears with the gangster Mr Eddy, by the name of Alice. She is a adult movie performer. Both Pete and Alice romantically acquaint secretly. However she holds a secret and has intentions of her own. END OF SPOILERSThis is one of those movies that really requires attention to the highest level. Uninterrupted concentration too can help fully enjoy the feature. To truly appreciate the movie for what is it is I would recommend that the direction and cinematography is payed attention to. The sub conscious mind also has to be engaged while viewing. Lynch and Gifford have written a script that is flaw less. They have incorporated their imagine to the full potential to create a mystery noir. This is one of Lynch's less disturbing movies but is full of psychological moments. There is confusion at every turn. Everybody will have their own individual theories and takes on the mystery elements. But I can't recall ever having heard of any being an official.The background score by Angelo Baddlamenti is top rate and suits the tone of the movie perfectly. Many camera shots are sound effects help to assist the movie in terms of special effects. Bill Pullman has the best performance in the movie. The role required a lot of emotional acting and less dialogues and his paranoid expressions are speechless. Patricia Arquette is ravishing in her two different get ups. For a 2 hour 10 minutes movie it may seem long, but it is worth it for a true noir movie fan.

I don't think I can wrap up the plot that space.I'm a recent inductee into the strange and twisted world of David Lynch. It all started when I caught a rerun of Twin Peaks on a low-budget digital satellite channel.  Since then I've been hooked, and have had fun with cult films and filmmakers since.Lost Highway is, as descried by Lynch, a new twist on film-noir.  And only Lynch could put a twist like this on a classic genre.  People keep wanting to draw comparisons to other films, saying Well, it's not Blue Velvet or It's not Mulholland Dr,...they're right.  It's Lost Highway, a unique and twisted foray down a dark highway that may or may not be entirely metaphorical...or metaphysical.One of the things that I've noticed about David Lynch--and what probably inspires much of the hatred non-Lynch fans have towards his work--is that he doesn't explain everything.  He lays it out, says Here's my story.  What do YOU make of it?  It's an incredible artistic attitude, much like viewing a Dali painting as opposed to a Da Vinci, and not for everyone's tastes.Lost Highway is open to many interpretations, as are most of Lynch's works. Are we in our world, and being invaded by some outside force?  Are we in a world we don't know we're in?  Are we in Hell?  What would you do if this happened to you?  Maybe we are all someone else, really.This film is at the same time allegorical, philosophical, incomprehensible, and satirical.  It warps understood movie conventions, and is always pulling the unexpected.All that praise aside, it is NOT the best of Lynch's work.  One would have to be a fan to enjoy this, and should establish that fanhood with his better works, like Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, or Twin Peaks.If one has a set standard of how movies should be, an A-B-C pattern, stay away.  But if it's originality, unanswered questions, and a break from standard Hollywood convention, go full ahead.In my humble opinion, it's better than Wild at Heart and Dune, but not most of Lynch's rest.  It is definitely an experience, but not one everybody will enjoy.

Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music.So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places.Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home.Skip to This Magic Moment as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelgänger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he gets more pussy than a toilet seat, but those small similarities add up.As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this other guy better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become.This loss of control is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know I'm deranged. As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride.Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex You'll never have me he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyoncé woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it.As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his fücking name is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that Dick Laurent is dead before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

Possibly the most underrated of all his films, and certainly one of the biggest cult hits.The film stars Bill Pullman as a disturbed jazz saxophonist named Fred Madison, Patricia Arquette as both his mystical black-haired wife and Mr. Eddy's stunning blonde-haired girlfriend, Balthazar Getty as a young mechanic named Pete Dayton, Rogert Loggia as the powerful Mr. Eddy, and Robert Blake as the ever-so-creepy Mystery Man. The film also features some interesting cameos from Richard Pryor, Giovanni Ribisi, and Gary Busey as Pete's father.The film flirts with such ideas as reincarnation and psychogenic fugue. Lost Highway was to be the first of what John David Ebert calls his Los Angeles Trilogy, the second being Mulholland Drive and the third being Inland Empire. Although, I must admit Inland Empire is probably the strangest and most unsolvable of the Trilogy, and possibly of all his films, ever.Lost Highway, I found, was his most well-written work. He seemed to dissect subject matter which hadn't even been seen on film before. The idea of somebody recreating their life in their own imagination upon the realization of their reality. Some may disagree, suggesting many other interpretations, or stating that that idea had been done before. Well, I must say that it has never been done this way. This film was the start of an original and trademark style of Lynch's, the style which would make his films recognizable based merely on the use of camera-work and lighting.With Lost Highway, Lynch reinvented the usual film narrative in a way which put the viewer directly into the driver's seat of a delusional and/or unstable mind. In this case, Fred Madison's. Slavoj &#x8E;i&#x9E;ek noted Lynch's prominent use of exploiting the opposite of two horrors. Lost Highway does this by observing the mystical, and noir-ish dream-land versus our much more disturbing everyday life of alienation and deceit. Lynch takes refuge on this technique in both Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire.I don't much listen to what most professional critics have to say about a film because, frankly, they're opinions aren't usually the smartest or well-guided out there. Take any film from Stanley Kubrick, for example. It's much more fun for a film-goer to discover cult films like Lost Highway, than stick with the same Casablanca-esquire formula you'll find in most critic favorites. And in the words of Robert Blake -- It's been a pleasure talking to you.

You have been warned.***I watched it two nights in the row. After the first viewing I knew I'd missed a lot - but also knew I wanted to see it again. Whatever I understood was beautiful, whatever I did not understand was probably even more beautiful and I wanted to find it. What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times Bunuel's 'That Obscure Object of Desire' and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. Quoting myself      One thing I don't understand why MD which is secondary to LH  is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her.How  does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself. That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem      There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way.      There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning.       Death Valley is so beautiful. It just goes on forever. I like the idea of shooting in Death Valley - just the name. It made perfect sense for Lost Highway.On the lighter note - You actually can learn something very important and useful from Lost Highway - please be polite to the other drivers on the road - you never know who the guy you just fingered turned out to be. ) "},{"Title":"it is art","Date":"18 February 1999","Score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I see there's a couple of smartasses writing these comments  writing stuff like  uh its not art or anything  well you try  making a movie like that.

Fred is suspicious of the relationship of Renee with her friend Andy (Michael Massee). One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the doorstep of their house and when they watched the footage, they find that someone has broken in to film inside their house. They call the police, but the two detectives do not find any clue. Fred and Renee go to a party at Andy's house and Fred has a bizarre encounter with a mysterious man (Robert Blake) that tells him that they have met before and he is at Fred's house. The upset Fred calls Renee and they go back home. On the next morning, Fred finds another videotape and when he watches the film, he sees a bloodbath with Renee murdered in bed with him. He is found guilty of murder of first degree and sentenced to the electric chair. While waiting in the death row, he morphs into the efficient mechanic Peter Raymond Dayton (Balthazar Getty) and is released from the cell, but followed by two detectives. Pete fixes the car of the powerful and dangerous gangster Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) and when he meets his mistress Alice Wakefield (Patricia Arquette), they have a love affair and the woman convinces him to escape with her from Mr. Eddy and travel to some other place. Lost Highway is one of the most intriguing, bizarre and challenging cult-movies that is to be loved or hated but never fully understood. I believe that even David Lynch that directed and wrote Lost Highway does not have answers for all the mysteries of the plot. The best and most provocative scene is when the mysterious man tells Fred that he is at his house and gives a cellular to Fred to call him. The film is shot following the style of film-noir and Patricia Arquette is the femme fatale. The beauty of the half-naked Patricia Arquette is astonishing and her strip-tease is very erotic. The soundtrack with music of David Bowie, Angelo Badalamenti, Rammstein, Lou Reed, and Tom Jobim (with Insensatez) is spectacular. Last time I had watched this movie was on 23 December 1999.

I've lost count of how many times I have watched this film and been mesmerized by it in new and different ways each and every time, and this time was no exception -- seeing it on a big screen with a proper sound system and a proper audience revealed many bits that I had not thought about upon previous viewings and, given the opportunity, I would recommend everyone else reading this do the same (regardless of whether you liked, disliked, were just confused by, or haven't seen it at all).I should mention that David Lynch is not my favorite director, and I am not some Lynch fanatic who gobbles up every last drop of pretentious nonsense the guy will drip. I think his Dumbland series is pretty much worthless, I think Mulholland Dr. is a numbingly 'over-directed' film whose content is simply too exaggerated and ridiculous to take seriously from any perspective, and I think he as a person -- while certainly having his charming whimsical moments -- is far too hoity-toity about his own work and doesn't give his fans enough credit for me to thoroughly respect him as an artist. And I do not have high expectations for Inland Empire.However Lost Highway is a perfect example of why I always come back to him. It is the perfect measure of his potential for crafting a lean, polished film that yields just the right balance of surreal and pragmatic content, and with just the right amount of subtle (and not-so-subtle) dark humor and entertainment devices to make it watchable in any number of mental states (passive, engaged, stoned, hung-over...). A significant part of the reason I love watching movies is for the temporary aura they drown you in -- most directors are more comfortable with letting the narrative carry that aura, but few are comfortable with letting the aura carry the narrative, and that is precisely what this film effortlessly does. And while the film unabashedly acknowledges its indebtedness to the conventions of the mystery genre, it completely subverts all of those conventions by assigning the role of detective to the audience (rather than to a character in the film), effectively making the clues cinematic (rather than concrete) in nature -- and thus the abstractions in the narrative become a way of paying homage to the genre rather than a way of deconstructing or criticizing it. As odd as it may sound, this film is most certainly a celebration of rather common cinematic conventions, as every last frame is crammed with them -- they're just deployed in a very surprising way, which is precisely where the film's brilliance lies. I know I'm probably not the only one who's said it, but I'll echo seeing this movie once is simply not enough. As a stand-alone piece of cinematic art, it simply demands that you drop whatever pretensions you have with David Lynch the auteur and engage it upon its own terms....As a side note, I have to mention that my favorite line in the film has to be the only line uttered by one of Mr. Eddy's henchmen during the scene with the tailgater, spoken rather quietly while Mr. Eddy is screaming at the top of his lungs Tell him you won't tailgate. You might not even notice it the first time, it's just so oddly placed. Something about the delivery.........

It's a well made film technically and artistically. It's just that it's a depressing affair which if you ask me is rather pointless in the end.When shown to psychologists it could spark a discussion that's interesting to them though. But at the same time, it's not like Lynch has shown anything new.

Lost Highway does occasionally get confusing (particularly from a psychological stand-point) as a result of trying to have too many ideas, which does seem to be what the main complaint is against it, but for me there was very little wrong (as a bit of advice it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style first with The Elephant Man or Blue Velvet being the best place to start). Lost Highway looks amazingly stylish, the cinematography some of the best of any film personally seen in a while, the colours are expressive and bursting with colour and hypnotism and the images are surreal but impeccably hypnotising. Lynch's directing is highly accomplished if not quite some of his best directing like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet. He also does a great job in not making Lost Highway too formulaic (there is a sense that formally and structurally that there was a fair bit of re-invention involved), in fact it was one of the freshest and most unique psychological mystery thrillers personally viewed. Like Eraserhead, Lost Highway is basically an atmosphere/mood piece and it works amazingly as one. It may be Lynch at his strangest but that made the film even more fascinating to watch, no matter what you think of some of the story the impact the atmosphere has in the film cannot be denied. The thriller elements are enough to set the pulse racing and the mystery elements while made obvious about half-way through have a lot of suspense. Bill Pullman's exemplary here, some of the best work he's ever done even, and standouts too are Patricia Arquette at her most sensual and Robert Blake at his creepiest. The music score is incredibly haunting with fitting use of pre-existing songs and while spare the dialogue doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too much. All in all, a bizarre film but with the mood it has and how well-made and directed it is it is a very compelling one too. Not Lynch at his best but around the top end of his filmography. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A fearsome reckoning","Date":"1 April 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" As I find with most of Lynch's films, Lost Highway works best if one can decipher the basic story framework through which the illusory doublings and wish fulfillments, and desires and agonies filter. A sort of male antecedent to the distaff Mulholland Dr., the story is likewise driven by sexual obsession, denial, and intense guilt that leads the protagonist, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), to create a dream scenario into which he can escape his inner torment. He's perhaps even more delusional than Diane Selwyn, however, and at one point he voices a maxim (I like to remember things my own way; not necessarily how they happened) that both illustrates his fear of confronting reality and neatly explains the vertiginous twists and refractions contained in the film, which is Madison's chronicle of reckoning with horrific choices. Lynch prepares the viewer for the big twist (Balthazar Getty taking Pullman's place in the story) by suggesting Madison's turbulent inner life with frames that jar in and out of focus&#x97;approximating subconscious interference and, in Getty's portion, the intrusion of reality&#x97;extreme close-ups, figures materializing in darkness, and his own disruptive sound design, full of synthesized industrial noise and heightened everyday sounds. Appropriately, Madison recasts his victimization tale as a film noir, with himself-as-Getty as a mechanic who falls in love with a gangster's pretty blonde moll, played by Patricia Arquette, who also plays his slain brunette wife. Madison deifies her as an insatiable love goddess, irresistible and ever-receptive to his needs, but tarnished by her dissolute associations with other men, a jealousy that mirrors his adulterous suspicions involving his wife, a smut peddler, and a man named Dick Laurent, envisioned as an old gangster named Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia).Further doublings, reflections, and parallels between the two stories abound&#x97;there's an unidentified incident that Getty can't remember, and the vision of an inversely exploding cabin bookends the central transformation. There is a thrill in trying to unlock the puzzle, but the film is most significant for seamlessly evoking the layout of an involved dream-delusion&#x97;Getty's repeated exclamation, I want you, to the idealized image of Arquette (who replies, You'll never have me), concurrently summing up the state of waking from a great dream and Madison's sexual despair, may even top Mulholland Dr. for mapping out tactile subconscious yearning&#x97;and detailing the bleak recesses of a tortured soul. More than just an oracle of figurative states, Lynch also displays a finely tuned sense of droll humor. Like the bumbling hit-man in Selwyn's projection, Mr. Eddy's menace is absurdly realized in his battery of an obnoxious tailgater. Aurally, Angelo Badalamenti shares the soundscape with various rock contributors, notably Lou Reed and David Bowie, whose brooding I'm Deranged sets the tone from the opening credits. So easy to get lost in such an immersive ambiance, which truly provides an embarrassment of sensory riches; one can simply coast along for the ride and still find a transportable experience. Lynch is that rare director who can illuminate unknown territory through his complementary cinematic and storytelling abilities. "},{"Title":"An intense, twisted, and brilliant thriller.

What follows is the twisting and dark road of the lost highway.It's a film that seems to be playing on multiple levels with several different interpretations being valid. Is it all a fantasy created by Fred? Is there something more sinister and supernatural occurring? Are we witnessing an alter version of events that transpired (Fred's discovery of his wife's betrayal)? It's all how the viewer interprets the narrative.

Its overloaded with the unexplainable and ambiguous surreal elements the man's fans have come to expect from him.Lynch's direction is superb as usual. He knows how to build constant tension despite the events being unexplained. Also, with the exception of the mobster character Mr. Eddy, Lynch's typical sense of absurd humor seems to be completely absent. This is a pure mindf%^k, a nightmare caught on celluloid. Despite not being a typical horror film, its more terrifying than just about any slash and dice flick I've seen. The film's only main drawback is that, unlike Lynch's finest, it lacks an emotional core. Maybe its because of the character switch midway, but we never really feel for any of these people, unlike you do in Blue Velvet or The Elephant Man. Still, its entirely worth watching for those accustomed to Lynch (definitely not a good starting place at all).The acting is really good. Bill Pullman, always worth watching despite the often mediocre nature of his films, gives a really good performance thats often painful to watch because of the character's tormented psyche. Balthazar Getty is also accomplished as his alter-ego, its a shame he didn't go on to become a bigger star. Despite not being on camera together, both actors play off each other very well. However, the best performance is by far Patricia Arquette, playing a sultry noir femme fatale often not seen in films nowadays. Lost Highway isn't Lynch's finest, but its still a very good film.

Watch first, sleep on it, and ask questions later. 'Lost Highway' is a movie that will stay with you for years! One of the decades greatest achievements.

This is a perfect illustration of it. Lynch is ahead of his time, and this film is a gem. The wide range of elements that constitute a film were given a thought, from choosing each actor and actress that constitute the cast to the various musical choices who are also very relevant to the sequences they accompany. One can appreciate the quality with which Lynch frames each one of his scenes, the humor in the dialogues, the intriguing story and concatenation of events, or how punchy and dynamic some sequences are, when it comes down to describing anger, passion or excitement. I hope the missing sequences of this film will be added in a re-release or on a special version of a DVD someday. In the meanwhile, as many people as possible should watch this atemporal film...

We wander around all our lives, sometimes in horrible situations right from the beginning, not really knowing what is going on in the big picture, without seemingly having had a choice in the matter. This aspect of the mysterious horror of life is portrayed in sublime fashion in Lost Highway. The persecution by the Mystery Man...the ultimately unatainable yet intoxicating persona of Patricia Arquette...it makes you wonder, do these people deserve what they are going through? Are they being punished for transgressions in another life? Is there any sense to all this madness? Is it all just a sick game by some sadistic omniscient power we never see? These questions could be asked about both the film and life itself. The key to this movie is to simply experience it, and not try to understand it, as, like existence itself, it is fundamentally impossible to comprehend in the bigger sense.

Ebert is more comfortable in a double-wide seat, taking in the contributions of a skilled hack like Spielberg to make an effort with a Lynch film.'Effort' is the operative word here. 'Lost Highway' doesn't treat THE NARRATIVE as some unchangeable holy institution, its narrative is fractured, self-referential. Jim Morrison believed in raising the consciousness through a persisted derangement of the senses... 'Highway' can accomplish that without the drugs.More this film has enough visual stimulus to entertain without any creative narratives whatsoever. Arquette is so intensely erotic, the low-brow experience is probably the superior approach anyway.

The Lost Highway to Hell.","Date":"13 April 2003","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Spoilers herein.I love this film. I knew I would be in for an unforgettable ride that would not give up for a second. I got what I expected because my expectations were just right. Let me explain. I didn't know about David Lynch until I saw Mulholland Drive. Sure, I remember seeing the commercial for Lost Highway when it first came out, but I knew nothing about the film or who made it then. I loved everything about Mulholland Drive except for the incoherent story. Well, that is a big part of the movie, isn't it? It took me some time to get over that, and actually think about it (although I'm not close to being done). Anyways, having watched Mulholland Drive, and learning some information about Lynch afterwards gave me the right expectations for this film.Lost Highway is not for everybody. I think film noir, surrealism, and dark movies are generally not for the mainstream casual movie audience. I think it is an acquired taste, and only certain people will like this movie. Of course, if you're an open-minded person, and can handle strong content, then you might appreciate this film. Most detractors don't like this film for the same reason they don't like other Lynch films like Mulholland Drive, mainly because the story doesn't reveal itself right away. Their main argument is that films like these put nonsensical elements together and pretend to be art, and that people just eat it up. I am glad that there are critical people like this around who question the artistic value of such films because it's good to be skeptical rather than accepting things right away. I'm not art expert, and I believe it's hard to be one because so many subjective elements make up art. Sure there are objective elements one can look at, but it still comes down to your personal views about it (somewhat like film reviews). Anyways, these disputes will never settle, and so there is no point in arguing one way or the other, it's more about how the film connects with you.For me, entering the Lost Highway, I knew I would see bizarre things with wild twists and turns. I knew the movie would not be wrapped up with everything explained at the end. So one reason I watched this is mainly for the experience. So what can I say about the experience? Most of the movie was dark (literally and figuratively). Only few scenes contained daylight. The atmosphere was intense and never let up the entire movie. The background was droning with ominous sounds. I think Bill Pullman who plays Fred did an excellent job of creating the mood. At the beginning, we see him smoking, his face distraught and lost. He gets a buzz at the intercom and the message says, Dick Laurent is dead. At the end of the film, Fred leaves that message at his home before going on the wild police chase. Supposedly, Fred killed his wife, Dick Laurent, and Andy. One key line in the film is Fred saying, I like to remember things my own way...Not necessarily the way they happened. One theory is that while he was being executed for the murders, Fred thinks back to what happened, mixing the real with the imagined (the Pete character).One question that some wonder about is who taped Fred's house along with the murder of his wife, if indeed the Mystery Man is a part of Fred's conscience. To answer this question, one might refer to the Mystery Man saying, You invited me. It is not my custom to go where where I am not invited. This doesn't necessarily answer the question if he's real or not, or if he really videotaped everything. One thing to remember is that the character is pervasive throughout the film. He's on the intercom at the beginning, at the party with Andy (and at the same time in Fred's house), with Dick Laurent when he calls Pete, at the cabin, and at Dick Laurent's shooting.The imagery in this movie is unforgettable, from the love scene between Pete and Alice to the look on Fred's face as he rides away at the end. I still can remember the scene at the beginning when Fred is making love to Renee and the time shifts to slow motion. With exasperated pants and breathes from Fred we realize that he is disturbed and disgusted as something is eating away at his mind. The look on the Mystery Man's face is haunting with his big black dark eyes, his pallid aged face, and the look of a sinister being.The soundtrack to Lost Highway is great with songs by Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and others. Lynch packed the movie with great eery sounds throughout so that it's made to feel like a nightmare. Yes, some may feel the movie is a nightmare because it gets under your skin. It makes you uncomfortable. I think that's what makes it so great, to have the power to cause real reactions.Lost Highway is one suspenseful horror that takes the viewer to the depths of the mind and reveals fears of the unknown. I loved this film, but I'm sure most mainstream viewers won't. This movie will appeal to the film noir audience and people with a love for the Absurd.

It is something else. It's not about how the plot ties and winds; it's about how you feel. As soon as the movie starts to thrill, you have this feeling of uneasiness that won't go away. Even in the most hardcore thrillers there are moments of relief where you can recover for a couple of seconds and take a sip from your coffee. Or the director uses this as a fake relief in order to achieve a great shock. But a typical moviegoer knows this trick well and expects a shocker during these fake relief moments.But in Lost Highway, there are no reliefs. At all. You have that uneasy feeling of OMG, something is about to happen all the movie; yet most of the time nothing shocking happens. Sometimes it does though, seemingly randomly. So you expect it to happen, and it happens and is still a big shocker to you. This is Lynch genius.Don't expect to fully understand the plot. Understanding does not reward you any tiny bit like in Memento for example. Just let your feelings go. This is a journey and Lynch is the driver. But everything is not non-sense random, there seems to be a twisted link between everything, you feel the connections but cannot name them.Lynch is a pure artist. But it's not an art for art movie at all. His plots could be cunningly smart. Some weird subtle gesture of an actor may lead you to think OK, Lynchian absurdity, and turns out to be a big clue for the real plot. Like I like to remember things my own way. You'd think that this is weird to say to a cop when you first hear it, after watching the whole movie it makes another sense.You can also never be sure of the chronological order of the events, it may or may not have happened now; one event can fit in so many gaps perfectly that you can have a hundred theories yet each one can make perfect sense all at the same time.This movie is something else. Watch it with zero expectations, Lynch knows where to lead you. But I should warn you, this movie haunts you long after. It will take a long time before you can let it off your sub-conscience. Not because it is so scary; it is; but because the story is told directly to your sub-conscience, bypassing your daily brain.

What a film! One thing I love about David Lynch is that, while some of his obsessions (thematic and visual) appear over and over again in his films, he doesn't seem to repeat himself or to be in a rut (as opposed to an artist like, say, Laurie Anderson, who I think made her best statements in the 70s and has been doing the same thing ever since).Lost Highway features some of the same elements as the later _Mulholland Drive_ the structure that turns itself inside out, the blonde vs. brunette woman thing ... you'll even notice the trademark red curtains (familiar from M.D. and also _Twin Peaks_) and the white picket fences of _Blue Velvet_.But there is much here that is unfamiliar and completely terrifying. I'd go so far as to say that David Lynch is the only effective director of the horror film that we have. I just posted a comment on the lousy 1999 remake of William Castle's _House on Haunted Hill_ & lamented there what I saw as Hollywood's complete inability to frighten anyone, any more. I take it back ... in a way. Of course, _Lost Highway_ is not a genre horror film, but ... is there anything in _House on Haunted Hill_ that is as terrifying as Robert Blake is in this movie?

Even at his most accessible, Lynch can't help but strike us as unusual. Lost Highway is certainly no exception. In fact, it may be even more bizarre than typical Lynch fare.The script is an extraordinarily clever example of the possibilities of eschewing all bounds of physical reality for the realm of psychological reality. Psychotic mental disorders present endless possibilities to a filmmaker, since they are defined by their breaks from reality and thus allow the sense of the real world to be ignored. Viewed in this light, Lost Highway goes from nonsense to brilliance.Lynch's direction is beautiful, and he fills the film with endless labyrinth-like shots, reminding us that reality is infinitely dark and unknowable. It is almost impossible not to feel the chills run up and down one's spine when Fred Madison seemingly disappears into the darkness in he and his wife's house and somehow seems to have been lost in it for hours when we next see him, and the metaphysical ramifications of this scene alone--questioning our senses of time and space and our ability to know anything about our reality--are perhaps the defining characteristics of David Lynch and especially of Lost Highway. The acting is, for the most part, weak. Fortunately, Lynch provides the actors with simple and plain enough characters that their weakness does not get in the way as much as it could; but it is definitely noticeable that Patricia Arquette in particular cannot do a thing (and I cannot imagine men drooling over her the way they are in this film--I really have a hard time imagining any man drooling over her). There are two noticeable exceptions to the generally weak (though not generally as terrible as Arquette) acting Robert Blake and Robert Loggia. Though much of Blake's work is done for him by the makeup and the script causing his character's undeniable creepiness, Blake plays the character with a sort of cool happiness that is even scarier than this character could be if he truly seemed malicious and then, when he picks up his camera near the end, it's as though a mask comes off and we see someone who is more pure evil than any film character this side of Al Pacino's Richard III. Loggia meanwhile has a fairly easy character but plays him with a wonderful charisma and hits everything on the money. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty spend much of the film just looking as confused as the audience but don't seem capable of doing what little else their characters ask of them, though we can hardly see what may have been Pullman's moment to shine--after killing his wife when he looks directly into the camera. Unfortunately, the blurriness of that shot makes it impossible for us to see the evil and anger he should be displaying at that moment.If you've watched the film and you're looking for an explanation of the plot, here it is Fred Madison kills his wife and her former boss (when she was in porn) then has a psychotic break, imagining himself as another person and living out the ultimate masculine fantasy in his mind. But reality (The Mystery Man, in my opinion) is always chasing him and once reality catches him, Madison is unable to maintain the illusion and finds himself still attempting to escape the police on a highway (though not the title highway, as I think the title highway is a metaphorical one--the human mind being its actual name). You can see some things rather differently as to what's real and what's not and when things happen, but the basic plot is hard to see differently, even if it might take hours of agonizing later to understand it, still. (Though I will admit that I got it the first time and just have discovered that others say it takes much more work to discover it.)All in all, Lost Highway is a brilliant psychological thriller that delves deeper into the psychotic mind than any other film I have ever seen and wraps us up in an odd mystery of wondering what is happening until there are about fifteen minutes left and suddenly the film shifts into overdrive (play on title not intended) and tells us what's been happening all this time. It may not be the easiest watch, since it doesn't really exist in the linear real world we're used to and it has a ton of sex and some very violent moments; but it's powerful and frightening, as well as deep and gorgeous. Its scares aren't cheap, and so they last far better than those of typical horror/thriller fare. Like Peter Jackson's even more brilliant Heavenly Creatures, Lost Highway preys on one's mind after viewing and becomes more frightening with thought. This is the way thrillers should be and never will be made.

Personally, i think it's his best work.  Falls somewhere between blue velvet and mullholland drive stylistically.  I don't understand people who call this a remake of blue velvet, the two have little or nothing in common as far as story, with the exception of Mr. Eddie, who's FAR more understated a character than frank booth.  This is a story of human insecurity, specifically male, and what happens when it's pushed to the absolute brink.  It's a story of, to paraphrase Lynch, doing something we can't live with, and yet we keep living.  We know, without a word spoken, that there is no connection left between Fred and Renee Madison, their sex scene at the beginning is utterly lifeless, and you can tell the wife is up to something.  You can't really blame her as Fred seems almost completely incapable of loving someone. The tapes, in my mind, represent Fred's coming to terms with the murder of his wife, Mr. Eddie and Andy.  That's about where the metaphysical in this film ends.  Everything we see happens, if you ask me.  Fred turns himself into Pete and Patricia into Allison and places them in the middle of a fantasy-like story of forbidden love.  this is the kind of relationship Fred wishes he'd had, one where Renee is completely infatuated with him and no one else.  Fred's insecurity about his wife's infidelities causes him to take vengeance on those he thinks have stolen her from him, his mind shuts it out and gives him a new life, which he becomes and lives out to the bitter end.  Robert Blake's character is the only one i haven't figured out. He might be an observer, he might be a manifestation of Fred's shattered conscience trying to get him to accept what he did, it's really left to our own interpretations.  Anyway, great performances by all, especially Bill Pullman, who perfectly captures Fred's detatchment.  David Lynch's direction and writing are flawless.

But you have to have an understanding of the dream experience, particularly falling into such an intense sleep that you actually dream you fall asleep and have another dream INSIDE your dream in order to understand what's going on. This is what happened to Fred. I remember having two such dream experiences before. If I hadn't I probably would've been quite confused watching Lost Highway. I'm pretty sure this is what David Lynch portrayed here.Fred is basically a homicidal maniac so whacked out of his mind on drugs that he is not conscious to committing these murders. In prison he goes through such severe narcotics withdrawal that he's given a powerful sedative, after which he falls into a deep, intense sleep and dream sequence. In the dream he is Pete, Fred when he is younger. Pete represents Fred's wish to break out of prison, and the sedative is so powerful Fred dreams Pete falls asleep and has a dream inside of Fred's dream. That's why there is so much wish-fulfillment going on in the last half of this movie (killing Mr. Eddy, Renee's betrayal e.g.) Pete's dream begins the morning he returns to work and his employer is Richard Pryor, the most bizarre casting call I've ever seen. But if you've had the experience of dreaming about celebrities being casual acquaintances, you understand. You know when Pete wakes up from his dream inside Fred's dream when B. Getty turns back into Bill Pullman. This is the most crucial scene to understanding what's going on in the film.The last hour of the movie is displaced. Chronologically it takes place after the doctor gives Fred the sedative, and before he wakes up in his cell and bangs himself to death on the floor. Fred wakes up after the final scene when he's being chased by a phalanx of police cars. He's having a seizure in the driver's seat, the final scene in the movie. I actually let out a yawp watching this, patting myself on the back when I predicted the movie was over, and it was. Because I kept telling myself during the final 20 minutes, Fred HAS to wake up from this eventually. The next scene chronologically (instead of the closing credits) is Fred waking up in the middle of the film on the floor of his cell.Definitely one of the most brilliant productions I've ever seen, and my favorite David Lynch film of all time.

He makes films like no other by building dark worlds which draw you in by putting you in some sort of spell. I love him so much that I put off seeing Lost Highway for over a year because it was the only David Lynch film I was yet to see. I was even considering not seeing it at all just so I could always have that one new David Lynch film, but then I thought that would just be ridiculous. Also, the revival of Twin Peaks was enough to pique my David Lynch anticipation meter to breaking point so I finally gave in and stuck in Lost Highway.Firstly, I don't think it's as grossly strange as some people make out. Yes, it has all the trademark bizarreness you come to expect from David but the majority of the film is surprisingly linear. I was expecting some next level INLAND EMPIRE stuff the way some folk bang on about it! The first 40 minutes are like Michael Haneke's Hidden in dream form. It's probably some of the best stuff our David has ever done due to the inexplicably tense and hellish atmosphere. A lot of the scariness is down to the terrifying music which ranges to ominous drones to extremely loud strings. There's one seriously nightmarish image near the start (which I've never heard anyone talk about, surprisingly) which sent chills up my spine. It's a full-on Lynchian assault on the senses which takes you down some dark and enthralling corners. The atmosphere is chock-a-block full of mystery.There are endlessly beautiful scenes including Fred playing the saxophone, the unsettling meeting with the Mystery Man and extremely frightening dream sequences. I think it's also important to note the expert positions David places the camera. There always seems to be too much space surrounding the characters and it makes for seriously eerie viewing. There's also that fantastic Francis Bacon inspired colour scheme of dark purples/pinks and shadows. He really does direct the hell out of the first forty minutes of this film.Suddenly the film changes into something entirely different as soon as Fred Madison randomly transforms into a young mechanic called Pete Dayton and takes on an entirely new life. No one seems to bat an eyelid about Fred Madison disappearing and the sudden change is quite jarring. In my opinion, this is when the film goes down a gear. I think because the first story is so strong, this second one pales slightly in comparison as the suffocating atmosphere somewhat dissipates and the overall strangeness ceases. Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love it just feels less Lynchy and more straightforward, and the Pete Dayton story is the biggest chunk of the film.There are still some spectacular sequences though, including a mysterious gangster getting road rage and Patricia Arquette's intriguing Alice character. There's also a strong feeling of everything not quite being what it seems and it gives you time to ponder over exactly what the heck you're watching. Thankfully for us weirdos things do start to get extremely strange towards the final half hour of the film before breaking down into total chaos until your mind finally explodes.Lost Highway is extremely puzzling in a similar way to Mulholland Dive. All of the clues seem to be there as well as a few abstractions to throw lots of spanners into the works (what does this Mystery Man have to do with it all!?) but there is a complex and very intelligent story buried underneath all the bizarreness. It feels like a warm-up exercise before Dave finally broke the mould of film with Mulholland Drive. Everything in Mulholland feels like a perfected version of Lost Highway from the more passionate love story to the unrelenting dreamlike atmosphere.Lost Highway is still a film to cherish on the Lynchian canon though. It's very much its own thing and I felt a strong urge to see it all again once it had all finished. Unlike Mulholland Drive there doesn't seem to be a universal theory to Lost Highway which makes it all the more interesting to watch again and again to dig for clues. However, as with all Lynchy films the best thing to do is just sit back and let your intuition drive you rather than your brain. It's not an IQ test but a piece of art which is designed to take you on a journey. No one makes films that make you feel quite like David Lynch does. Let's hope that the Twin Peaks revival encourages our Dave to get back into more regular filmmaking again. I couldn't bear to wait another ten years!

In my opinion, that's what makes Lynch a true master, and his cinematic works truly unique.Oh, and the soundtrack is absolutely fitting.I like to remember things my own way, how I remembered them.

Calling Lost Highway 'slightly obscure' is one of the biggest understatements of all time.It's a puzzle and a mystery and maybe even a visual experience rather than a traditional narrative story. You could even liken (some of) it to an 'art house' movie, if it wasn't for the fact that there definitely is a recognisable story in there... somewhere.It's about a man who changes into another man when he's locked up in his prison cell. Why? Good question. Just don't expect any answers (or at least any concrete ones).Lost Highway is visually stunning with magnificent direction and a haunting soundtrack. But is it understandable? No, not really. Yes, if you go to the lengths of looking up its 'true meaning' on various internet message boards, you will see what's supposed to be happening. But, before you watch it, ask yourself whether you're willing to invest over two hours of your life in a film where you have to research it afterwards to truly understand it. So, although it CAN be understood, I seriously doubt there are many people who can (honestly) say that they 'got it' the first time around.I love it. I love all of David Lynch's work. However, I confess that I did have to look towards the internet to finally determine what it was all about.It is certainly enjoyable, even though it's brutal, sadistic and violent. However, it - like all Lynch's work - is not for everyone. You have to be in the mood for something (more than) a little different. It's not just horror, it's mind-bending horror that may or may not even be horror in the first place. You think you're confused now... wait until you've travelled down the 'lost highway' with Fred, Renee, Pete and Alice.Special mention to Robert Blake for his portrayal of 'the mystery man' - one of cinema's truly terrifyingly creepy characters.

It shows the front of their house, but each tape sent shows more and more of the house, including the inside. The film Cache does a similar thing, with tapes of the house being sent. Cache is also a film that causes a lot of discussion, and the director is probably a devotee of Lynch.Fred is ultimately filmed with Renee's dead body, though he remembers nothing. He's found guilty and is on death row, though he is tortured by the fact that he really doesn't know what happened to Renee. As a result he has bad headaches and can't sleep.He goes to the prison doctor, who asks him how he's sleeping, and he says not well. The doctor gives him pills and says, You'll sleep now. Thus begins Fred's dream.In Mulholland Drive, the film begins with a dream; here, the dream comes a little later. And you know how dreams are -- things are different, people are different, everything is askew.In the dream, Bill Pullman becomes Balthazar Getty who plays a mechanic, Pete Dayton. The dream becomes a noir, complete with a femme fatale (Arquette). In the beginning of the film, Arquette has straight black hair as Fred's wife. Now she's a blond named Alice, who is trying to help him find answers. Pete Dayton wakes up in prison, but he gets out and seeks revenge. He knows what happened to Renee. In Fred's dream, Pete sees The Lost Highway Hotel, where Renee had liaisons with Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), who heads a crime syndicate.If you just sat through this film, you wouldn't have any idea what was happening except that it's dark and strange and the characters seem to wind up as other people. The thing with Lynch is it's a dream world where not everything makes sense. In this case, it may be the dream world of a schizophrenic.Lynch's movies feel like dreams -- they're disturbing and something is not quite right. People make weird statements. Does it all mean something? Probably, but I don't think we're meant to know everything.Another fascinating film from David Lynch.

This film fuses surrealism, horror, confusion, drama and symbolism into one unhealthy mix for two hours of viewing pleasure.The film starts out kind of odd at first, as some movies do, but viewers catch on quickly afterwards (or think they do). Then after about 45 minutes or so THAT'S when the heads are scratched. I won't go into too much detail of the films plot as I'd like you to watch it and see for yourself what happens next. As for the film itself I enjoyed it (despite being a Lynch fan already), and it has the potential of being fan favourite. The reason I don't think this ever made it as big as the Twin Peaks television show or The Elephant Man is due to the vague surrealism of the film, making this instead a cult classic. The abstract narrative of the film could be too much for the viewers who are easily entertained by simple movies because no doubt, after seeing this movie you will confused. The acting was pretty good too, with a cast including Patricia Arquette, Gary Busey and the genuinely creepy Robert Blake as the Mystery Man. Also features cameos by such celebrities as Richard Pryor, Marilyn Manson and Henry Rollins. If you're a David Lynch fan then why are you reading this? GO WATCH IT. If you're not so familiar with Lynch's work but still are looking for a good film to watch, then I say give it a shot. You might like it.

My interest was fueled by the Trent Reznor-produced soundtrack, which portended a glimpse into something brilliant, dark, and disturbing. Upon the film's release, I learned an important lesson&#150;every film released in America does NOT play in podunk Pennsylvania towns. I had little choice but to wait out the half-year turnaround for Lost Highway's VHS debut, and was impressed, intrigued, and aroused by what I saw (I was 16, mind you).What made Lost Highway so endearing after that initial viewing&#150;and what keeps it endearing to this day&#150;is director/co-writer David Lynch's gleeful belligerence toward linear&#150;and even coherent&#150;storytelling. As mentioned above, this is the characteristic that most often leads to my own love-hate relationship with his work (and what leads others to just flat-out hate him). But agreeing to sit down for Highway is like signing a pact with yourself to try, to the best of your ability, to piece the seemingly disparate elements of the plot into something that resembles narrative sense. Not that Lynch and co-writer Barry Gifford have decided to play fair here.Here goes Jazz saxophonist Fred Madison (an appropriately remote Bill Pullman) and his wife, Renee (raven-haired Patricia Arquette) exchange suspicious glances and banal sentiments and live a generally bland existence, until a series of videotapes starts showing up on their front stoop, the content of each crawling closer to the matrimonial bed. At a party, Fred is approached by a unnamed man (creepy, bug-eyed Robert Blake) who appears to have the ability to be in two locations at once. Afterward, Renee is found murdered, and Fred is sent to death row (though the killer's identity is not made clear). But one night the insomnia-stricken Fred is telepathically switched for young auto mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), who embarks on a dangerous affair with a local mobster's (Robert Loggia) moll (Arquette again).While the setup of Lost Highway contains a definite hook, Lynch's bland color schemes (lots and lots of earth tones, often set against total darkness) fall over the line between satirizing suburban/bourgeois indifference and merely perpetuating it&#150;that the appearance of the film itself isn't as dynamic as it could have been keeps a deeper engagement at bay. That being said, however, Lynch maintains his spellcaster status as well as (if not transcendent of) his other mindtwisters (particularly Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive), creating an intrigue and hypnotic pull that, while sometimes fragmented, keeps the viewer generally invested in what's going on (even if only to see what happens next). And while the plot sometimes pulls in too many directions and indulges too many excesses (trimming some of the sex would have cut down the overlong run time), the denouement will leave your mind swimming in thought&#150;an act that runs contrary to just about every film that hits theaters these days.But this begs the question is Lost Highway really worth the effort to think about? The answer will vary from viewer to viewer, but I happen to think it is, yes.Undeniably, Lynch&#150;whose fascination with dreamscapes has influenced his work from the very beginning&#150;enjoys overlapping chronologies, characters, and even metaphysical space with little (if any) explanation, but the occasional jerkiness of Lost Highway's trajectory smacks of narrative conflict, and some aspects of the plot dead-end in a tangle by the climax. For as many answers that can be extracted out of its 135 minutes, Lost Highway raises even more questions&#150;and that is its purpose.

As you watch his films, the really strange ones or those that can be interpreted in different ways, Mr. Lynch, makes you _think_.Watching modern Hollywood productions today does not necessitate using your brain at all. Everything is distressingly obvious and plain.And then you have movies like this one. Lost Highway. A movie where you have to draw conclusions, and really ponder over what has happened, and again... go outside the box. Saying this, i do not claim his movies are absolute masterpieces. Lost Highway has an eerie feeling to it, but i question his choice of actors though. Pullman was never great. But Blake, on the other hand, makes for a bloodcurdling Mystery Man.Having said this, there is not much left to say about the movie per say.

I start this review with these quotes, as I feel they neatly sum up this perplexing film.The great thing about Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive is that they are both films that engaged me, and left me with a riddle I felt I had to try and solve. This involved checking other IMDB reviews and the Internet for clues and solutions to the storylines. This is a rather futile exercise, as I do not think the answers are that simple, but it's rather endearing that movies can still have this effect within a culture that expects everything to be neatly wrapped up and explained.I will not try to explain the plot, apart from that it seems to be two stories and characters that merge together at the end of the film, only to Moebius loop around to leave you where you started (how's that for a Lynchian explanation?).I have read several reviews that ask you to let the art of this film speak to you on an subconscious level/just enjoy the images and not try to make too much sense of it. Now that's fine - but a little unfair to mainstream movie goers, who would (should?) get a storyline that at least make's sense after a little effort and thought from the audience. Lynch is well know for refusing to explain his work, and that should be his artistic right - so is he being deliberately antagonistic with this work, or does it all make sense and we are missing the message? Either way - it's got me thinking about the film and writing this review....Personally, I find this the weirdest of all the Lynch films I have seen. But I like his work, and am pleased that art-house movie making is still taking place, and known directors like Lynch can bring this to a mainstream audience.

It deals with the documented mental condition Psychogenic Fugue - when a person invents a reality - or a world - in their mind complete with a full cast of characters and events, and lives a moment or period of time over and over and over again. Take this bit of information and do what you will with it.A good reviewer though does not talk about the plot. He talks about hte film. The film is amazingly shot - it's beautiful. Lynch navigates the world he's created effortlessly. Bill Pullman is brilliant, Patricia Arquette is abnormally on the ball and Balthazar Getty blew me away.

They lack vision and they lack understanding.  This movie is absolutely breathtaking, and it is Lynch at his most extraordinary and fearless.  It belongs in its own beautiful and awe inspiring way to both the horror genre and the film noir genre, not quite safely belonging under any category because of its aesthetic uniqueness, distinctive, indescribable mysteriousness and poetic fluidity. The luminous phantasmagoria and dream logic of the whole thing puzzles, but in an intriguing way--it is not frustrating but stimulating. You might venture to say that Lynch is trying to tell us something about the human condition as a whole (and in this he might be compared to Kafka or Gogol) by leaving what is traditionally thought of as 'the answers' in terms of plot out--why give the illusion of understanding and ultimate resolution when in reality we are completely in the dark about the purpose and meaning of our lives? This movie will immediately appeal to the attentive and imaginative viewer, because it can be interpreted in any number of ways and is not bound by the conventions of mediocre, ordinary cinema.  It is surrealism at its finest, and anyone with even the slightest taste for artistic probing of the unconscious mind will eat this film like candy. Lynch makes his masterful appeal above all to the human imagination, and implies in a thousand ways that it is in this faculty alone, our subjectivity and inner life, that we are to find even a shred of hope or happiness.

Forget about those pseudo-horror movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Friday the 13th.  This is a real scary movie that won't leave you alone(I lost a week of sleep over it)!  Second, it's a masterpiece in how it's woven together and how puzzling it is.  Just so you know, I like films that make you think and ask you to connect the dots.  I'm sick of being spoon-fed all the answers and secrets.  With Lost Highway, you'll always see something new.  I purchased it because I liked it so much, and I discovered even more disturbing secrets buried within it.  This is what makes a film fascinating and unforgettable.  It just won't go away.  You can't just watch it and put it behind you.  I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet, and it's too complicated to go into the whole plot.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who likes to go to a movie with an open mind because of the element of suprise and mystery.  It's a shame that David Lynch's films aren't given enough interest by the public.

You may wonder if maybe a murder has been committed in this movie but after about half way through, are you sure of anything?One part of Lost Highway is about someone who suffers from a type of amnesia where a person completely forgets who he or she is. Now, Lynch never plays things straight and so there are events in the movie that go far beyond this basic idea but still remembering the amnesia premise makes some sense with the main character at least for a while. Another part of the film is a return to a theme Lynch has explored many times but especially in Twin Peaks. It is the idea that underneath the real world is a supernatural world of evil. (Is it possible for Lynch to have positive supernatural forces? Only rarely.) This power comes into play in Lost Highway in the manipulation of people as if they are puppets. Our main character is transported and transformed in some strange horrible way. Also, the gangster in the movie played by Robert Loggia can be seen as a representation of evil. Finally there are the dream images. At times Lynch will film something that is based on what he has dreamed. He likes that effect and for him such scenes are beyond explanation. While using dream images makes it hard to know what is going on, it is also a key to Lynch's success and the main reason that Lost Highway is so fascinating to watch. Lynch is masterful at creating filmed nightmares and they have a grotesque, hypnotic quality.The whole effect of the photography, music and acting creates an eerie off balance quality. Lost Highway spills out of the screen like ooze pulling you into another world which you think is real but after a while you may want to pinch yourself to wake up because you know this isn't Kansas, definitely not Hollywood and maybe not even earth.

Watching David Lynch's Lost Highway is like getting a new sex toy. At first you just sit there scratching your head, trying to make head or tail of it, but once you figure it out it'll give you immense pleasure. I discovered Bill Pullman about a year ago while watching an older movie, and I've been trying to find and watch all his movies ever since. I saw L.H. on the shelf every time I went to the video store, but I read so many negative comments about it that I kept passing it. Those comments were interesting though. I was surprised to find that the number of people who thought it was a piece of art was pretty much the same as the ones who thought it was a piece of crap. So at the end I got tired of the bickering and decided to see it for myself. So I took it home and watched it. After about 10 lines of dialogue I sighed and thoughtGosh, it's gonna be a long movie! Well, it sure was. At the end I sat there wondering what the heck I've just seen. It didn't make a lot of sense to me, seemed like a mess, scenes thrown together for no apparent reason, etc. Lots of nudity, silly, dragging dialogue, a creepy man with a monkey face... I thought it was either a terrible movie, or I'm a mental midget, or maybe I missed something. And guess what? The latter proved to be the right answer. I went searching for a David Lynch site and I found an interview with the director, in which he described his movie as a psychotic fugue. When I read that I felt like someone just turned the lights on. It all started making sense now, I even understood Pullman's reference to the O.J. case. So I watched the film with renewed interest and I found that I actually enjoyed it. Finally, the previously incomprehensible scenes had a meaning. I can't claim I have the whole thing figured out, but it sure got me thinking. The key is to try not to look at it as a movie, but more like a painting. First it might seem like one of those abstract things that look like a monkey dipped its fingers into paint and smeared it all over the canvas, but the more you look at it the more sense it's gonna make. So I suggest you guys just take the time to observe it before you decide it's crap, because you might get surprised just like I did. I found I didn't feel like taking the tape back at the end.It's been 6 weeks now since I saw it and I still keep trying to figure out the whole thing. Some people managed to find all the pieces of the puzzle, I read some pretty impressive, detailed reviews on other sites. All in all, once I got it I really enjoyed this movie, and I think I'll keep putting the pieces together for a long, long time. "},{"Title":"Petey!

The movie takes significantly longer to watch than the running time, and needs somewhat constant pausing to contemplate what happens.  Several times while watching it for the first time, you will rewind the tape a few moments to notice a bit more about the scene.

When I first saw Lost Highway I didn't really like it. I hadn't read anything about it up to that point so I had had a hard time following it. However, I started discussing the film with a fellow Buff and he helped me look at the film in a new way. I decided to read up on the film and I found a quote that Lynch had said about the film, he had mentioned the mental illness psychogenic fugue, a disease where you create a new identity and completely forget your past identity. Also, the term fugue used in music is for when a song starts off in one direction and then moves completely in another direction and then finally shifts back to where it started. With that in mind I watched the movie again and made sense. I started noticing a lot of beautiful visuals that I hadn't noticed before. By the time it was done, it seemed like I had seen a completely new movie. I still had a hard time getting over some of the gratuitous sex and violence but it seemed to actually fit. I'd like to end by saying that I watched other Lynch films and had better appreciation for them, well except for Dune.

On a diet of fluff that Hollywood feed us, a movie like Lost Highway will seem like weirdness as there is nobody out there making movies with any brains anymore. I'm a Lynch fan and he is my favourite director. While Blue Velvet is undoubtedly his best movie, Lost Highway easily ranks next to my second favourite, Fire Walk With Me. (For the record, I hated Wild at Heart.) Subtle visual metaphors, wonderful direction, pacing that works to perfection... This movie is terrific.This movie will of course be slaughtered by a lot of people, due to the fact that most people like their movies to be tied up in a nice little bundle at the end. Life is not like that, and neither is this movie. Sure, the movie leaves you with more questions than answers, but what questions! A film to challenge you, a film to confuse you, a film to shock you, but more importantly, a film to show you what REAL direction and film making are about. In any other directors hands this movie would have either been way shorter, or boring as hell. (For an horrendous movie which is also long, check out The Horse Whisperer. HORRIBLE!) While there are long periods of silence, camera shots that last way longer than they would ordinarily, it all adds up to a film which creates a creepy, disturbing atmosphere which just doesn't let up until the end.One footnote about the movie, it was fantastic to see Richard Pryor after all these years.Way to go Lynch.

There are many parallels--the non-linear, almost circular plot...haunting images and silences that enhance the suspense...protagonists that are at a total loss as to what is happening to them and why...surrealistic, dreamlike quality in both movies...I could go on. The main differences between these two films is (1) Jacob's Ladder contains a message of hope that is totally lacking in Lost Highway, and (2) Jacob's Ladder is a more mainstream film and will therefore appeal to a wider audience...But if you loved Lost Highway, as I did, be sure to  rent the woefully underrated sleeper Jacob's Ladder.

This doesn't mean I think everything Lynch ever did is brilliant - far from it; some of his work is grotesque and unwatchable (Eraserhead), irritating (Dune), or just plain impossible (Inland Empire). But at his best David Lynch turns out material that is as good as any; Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks (TV series), Wild at Heart.I place Lost Highway in the group of good Lynch films. Why is it good? Lost Highway is a difficult movie. Difficult to get your head around. All Lynch films to a lesser or greater extent require the watcher to suspend their normal frame of reality and open themselves up to new ways of understanding, new ways of comprehending what they are seeing. It's an adventure.I have just watched Lost Highway again after a gap of about 12 years. When I first saw it (in the cinema) I was completely bewitched by it. I bought it as soon as it came out on video (sic) and I then proceeded to watch it 5 nights on the spin to see if I could unpick it. I wrote notes, I asked my friends, I threw my degree in Philosophy at it. In short - Lost Highway got to me.Here's the odd thing - despite having seen this film 10+ times, despite thinking I knew it's every nuance, clearly I learned NOTHING. When I watched it again recently I had COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN about the Pete character - even the incredible metamorphis that occurs in the cell halfway through the film came as a surprise to me on this viewing -! Why??? (clue - it's not my age...) Why -? why did I not pick out the TWO central characters? I know why - because Bill/Pete are interchangeable. They are ONE. The story is so carefully crafted that despite the two apparent characters in two apparent bodies - the viewer merges the two and sees further possibilities as a result. It's startling! Thus Lost Highway is difficult. It's a challenging watch, complex, stimulating. The clues are there, but I'm not saying it's easy....The cinematography is total Lynch; camera angles which belittle or exaggerate, dark broody rooms which drip with a hard to grasp threat. The characters are writ sparse - they look lost, confused, actually - on the edge of being out of control. Their sparse spiked dialogue allows the viewer, in combination with the sets and camera angles, to interpose their own fears interpretations and anxieties. It's verging on scarry - but it's very controlled. Very clever stuff! I recommend Lost Highway. Careful though - it's addictive!

There's a certain dream-like quality to his movies, where things happen and people react in ways that are only slightly removed from reality, not so much that it becomes fantasy and not so little that it's just something that's been scripted, but just enough to unnerve you and make you feel uneasy. In Lost Highway, that's exactly how you feel, you feel like you're in a bad dream; albeit someone else's bad dream. Bill Pullman is the Jazz musician imprisoned for killing his wife only to wake up in his cell as someone else, and then things start to get surreal! For a large part of the movie Bill Pullman becomes Balthazar Getty - a kid with good intentions but seduced by a femme fatale into the shady underworld of pornography and murder led by her mobster boss. The usual cast of mysterious and often scary characters are all in check. Of Lynch's movies, I think this is my favourite so far; the story makes sense to me (in a weird Lynchian way) and the elements of the narrative comes together quite cohesively to give a satisfying conclusion. To me (experts may disagree) this is Lynch's take on the Noir genre, I can easily see this being a Lynch adaptation of a James Ellroy or Raymond Chandler mystery. I highly enjoyed Lost Highway, it's not for everyone though.

Another one of David Lynchs strengths is to get top rate performances from otherwise mediocre stars. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty are the two middle-weight male leads and in my opinion this is both of these gents greatest performances, both oozing mystery and a large portion of suave, its almost as if they had transported straight from a 40's noir movie. For me though its Patricia Arquette who really nails it in Lost Highway, an actress who I previously have never found attractive or found especially entertaining but in Lost Highway she is completely transformed into a Goddess and you find it hard to take your eyes from the screen whenever she appears. This film isn't as good as either Mulholland Drive or the earlier Blue Velvet but if Lynchs movies are your thing then this film will be right up your street. Dark, eerie and disturbing, this film will leave you thinking long after the end credits. "}{"Title":"Visually great but a little bit lost with its lack of purpose. Here's another good work from David Lynch, an artist above anything else","Date":"6 November 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" A saxophonist (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) start to receive anonymous video tapes of their house, and each time as each different tapes appear the content starts to change little by little. Their story gets more messed up when they meet a strange and sinister character (Robert Blake) that seems to know more about them than themselves and can be in two different places at the same time. What is revealed after that is the wife's murder by the husband who'll later be arrested, and while waiting for his death sentence simply disappears out of his cell and in his place there's a younger guy (Balthazar Getty). And from that it's a whole different story with different characters but somehow is connected with the earlier plot. Those who love David Lynch mysterious puzzles will love this classic. Critics underestimate this film and some audiences to do the opposite with it. It's not a bad film neither a great and spectacular film. What's missing here is a higher purpose, something that would made the whole thing more enjoyable than it is. The plot goes through so many twists that are efficiently put to confuse its audience but it gets lost somewhere at times; it just pretends to be a deeper film than it is, but it's not. No message, no ideas, it's given so little to start a discussion on how great the plot is. However, each person can make better readings than I did, so I won't be arrogant enough to say I'm right and you're wrong. Purely for its aesthetic and the way it is composed, that's what makes of Lost Highway a superb film that holds its viewers from the first minute until the credits roll. It is incredible slow in its first half hour but even so you're already there and there's no way you can't walk out of this movie. It's THAT good! The director thinks big in his public while making this film the soundtrack is absolutely great, one of those that really makes you feel stone cold, fearing what's going to happen next; it's an complex, exciting and thrilling film noir filled with many Lynch references and classic films references as well; it's unmistakable good. It's far more interesting to watch Lost Highway to see how the artist builds his art than to root for what's he making, the story and etc. It's far more daring to enjoy how the auteur creates the paranoia of his characters than the paranoia itself which is just a way to mindless people keep saying how crazy this film was. Lynch always knows how to fools and surprises us, never makes us uninterested or bored, he always pushes the envelope and Lost Highway is filled with those bizarre moments where you keep saying Hold on! trying to connect all the dots and process all the information given to you throughout the experience.The greatest example of how to make an audience really connected with a film, surprised, shocked and excited at the same time is the classic meeting between the mystery man with Bill Pullman, where everything surrounding them stops, silence for a moment and then it's surprise after surprise. The plot is carefully built in its device of manipulate the viewers but it never explain things in satisfying ways, it's a little bit empty. LIke said earlier the way of the artist to make his thing is what makes of this film something really worth seeing but not just that, the acting is equally great, from the minor characters to the some of the more relevant figures. Best of the show Robert Loggia playing an menacing gangster; the fore-mentioned Robert Blake, in a performance that should have gave him some awards and nominations (and as of now, his last acting job); Pullman and Arquette (playing double characters) are quite good, hold the film very well. But the director and/or his casting personal should hire another actor for the hunky guy played by Getty. While he has some sex appeal I found him a wrong choice for the part, someone good looking enough to make me believe that an blonde femme fatale like Arquette would feel so attracted to. Certainly one of the strangest films of the 1990's and a good one. Take a dare and travel to the darkest paths that this lost highway can lead you to.

It's one of David Lynch's less coherent efforts but I couldn't take my eyes off it.Okay. Here's what I make of the story. I'm going to try to cut some of the diverting flab off it. Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette (in a long auburn wig) have one of those marriages where the couple no longer has much to say to one another. At a dull party, an eerie Robert Blake pulls some supernatural stunt while conversing with him. They really are supernatural. Puzzled, unhappy, Pullman gets his wife and they leave. Then Pullman begins to get headaches and nightmares. Suddenly, he's found leaning over his wife's battered body and sentenced to death.So he's sitting in his death-row cell, right?, a little gloomy, and he begins to get a really TERRIFIC headache. One of the corrections officers hears the commotion, strolls over and takes a peek through the cell window. Then he calls his boss over. Captain, he says shakily, there's some really spooky s*** going on here. And indeed there is. Bill Pullman has changed into Balthazar Getty. Getty is properly identified and, the cops having no reason to hold him, allow him to go back to his job as an expert mechanic at an auto shop run by poor Richard Pryor, disabled by the disease that would finally kill him.One of the shop's regular customers is Robert Loggia who likes Getty and embraces him and pinches his cheeks with a warmth only a Mafia capo could muster.And here the story gets a little twisted, as if it weren't twisted enough. Loggia has a sexy girl friend, Patricia Arquette in a long blond wig, and the two of them get it on behind Loggia's back. Loggia traps the two of them in a run-down desert shack. Then -- I THINK this is what happens -- Pullman and Arquette make love outside but it's love interruptus when Loggia prepares to kill them. Arquette walks naked into the shack and morphs into the supernatural Robert Blake figure, who shoots Loggia full of holes. Pullman get into the car and drives off at high speed. A moment later, he appears to have another terrific headache, as if he's about to morph again, and then -- The End.I take it that Loggia had Pullman's wife killed and framed Pullman for the job. Blake is the spirit of justice who sees that Hammurabi's code is properly followed. As the wanton blond, Arquette was only Blake in disguise. Getty is an innocent bystander pulled into the story merely to pin Loggia to the board like a butterfly. Loggia is the only guy who is exactly what he seems, an expansive murdering thug.If you call me on that interpretation, I'll fold and you'll get only a small pot. I anted nothing.It may be a lesser effort by Lynch but there's nothing quite like it around. Nobody, except the Coen brothers, are making such idiosyncratic movies. The music is as jumbled as the plot. Source music includes cowboy songs and whatnot. The overscore ranges from bossa nova by Antonio Carlos Jobim to something called Rammstein sung or chanted in basso profundo German. The interior sets are sparse, almost barren, and the color of internal organs. Women wear excessive makeup. Daytime outdoor scenes are few and there is, lamentably, no sense of place, usually one of Lynch's strong points. We know some scenes take place in the desert but mostly because we hear of it. There are few glimpses of Death Valley, and all at twilight.It seems incomplete, mystic, mystifying. But, again, it demonstrates a vision that is anything but commercial and deserves applause if only for that.

It reminds me of the Arnold Schoenberg approach to music, i.e., the creation of 'music' through pure application of structurally determined music theory (as in a computer simulation) - as opposed to the slower, traditional, analog methods involving individual inspiration and creativity. At the same time, it reminded me of What's Up Tiger Lily - a work I find unwatchable, but which is also a collage, though a collage of music, voice and script elements over a thespian backdrop which is cinematically third-rate - i.e., Allen might as well have selected his characters from an anthill. What's more, the tone, texture, pseudo-logic, dramatic impetus of the elements in WUTL all seem to me too mediocre to endure - like a bad joke that doesn't know when to end - NONE of which is the case with Lost Highway, which is visually and dramatically gripping.

It is only in the context of this transition that these separate shots form a meaning intelligible to the audience. In Lost Highway, however, precisely the opposite is true. When, a third into the movie, Fred Madison transforms into an entirely different character Pete Dayton, it confuses the viewer. Proceedings are given even more complexity when Pete, our new protagonist in the narrative's discourse, meets Alice Wakefield, played by the same actress as Fred's wife Renee, Patricia Arquette. When the cops, who have just released an innocent Pete from jail, reveal that his gangster associate Mr. Eddie is in fact Dick Laurent, things become even more confusing. And when, by the end of the film, Pete has transformed back to Fred, and Mr. Eddie into Dick Laurent (not to mention an appearance by Andy in both parallel narratives), viewers could well be throwing in the towel.This is, then, no conventional work. Lynch employs Brechtian techniques in a meandering plot which deals, essentially, with questions of identity and character crises. When trying to justify the over-elaborate, dense narrative of his Mulholland Dr. (2001) on the Region 2 DVD, Lynch hints that questions of identity are part of everyday life, and we all have to deal with it. This contemporary noir, with its convoluted character-switching and circular narrative, may be taken as a film which labours a point which could easily be dealt with in less tortuous circumstances. But there is a fitting quote from one of Lynch's influences, to counter this point, and the director may even have paraphrased it himself at one point or another. In order to convey fact, you can only ever so do through distortion, so painter Francis Bacon was announced. Here, in Lost Highway, the distortion becomes, oddly, the only way to get Lynch's message across.Told, as ever, as a brooding Lynchian nightmare, with Peter Deming's camera accentuating the alarming reds and stark Baconesque yellows and pinks of the characters' spacious, minimalist apartments, Highway starts as a conventional film noir before turning into a disturbing, often frightening mystery, slowly unfolding itself into an even deeper, denser world of mistrust and suspicion. The opening third, in which Fred and wife Renee receive a series of mysterious videos of footage of themselves sleeping in their bedroom, comprises a succession of short, disjointed scenes made all the more strained by the editing a slow train of fade to blacks, as if to suggest falling in and out of consciousness, dreaminess, a state of nightmare. Lynch's camera lingers on the dark corners of rooms, wanting, but scared to, explore them further. In contrast, the part in the film dealing with Pete's decline into lustful desire for mistress Alice is more wordy and, to perhaps seem as far away from Fred's opening character arc as possible, told with more purpose.That Fred and Pete are the same characters has widely been argued, and to valid extent. But what if we, as an audience by now used almost too used to the language of film, and immune to its potential to create new, innovative sparks in its mechanics, are taking it for granted that, as the same characters crop up in each of the film's parallel narratives, they must belong in the same world? What if, when we cut away to Pete's story, we have been taken to a whole new world which only looks the same as that in which Fred was jailed? Looking at the film in this way, taking one world as some kind of reality and the other as a dream, each separate story, even when morphing into one, as it seems to do in the latter stages, can now be enjoyed for what it is. Or indeed, the two narratives could well be two cogs on the same wheel, and the film itself is, in true Lynch fashion, an inescapable nightmare for all, with characters taking on the names of others. Or rather, this is a kaleidoscopic precursor for Cronenberg's A History of Violence (2005), a film which deals with masculine wish-fulfilment to transform into an alter-ego in order to cope with the boredom of life. Here we have the predominant characters all with their own alter egos; Fred and Pete, Renee and Alice, Mr. Eddie and Dick Laurent, and, it could even be argued, the Mystery Man and Andy.From whose point, then, is this nightmare told? An obvious answer would be Fred's. It has been debated that the second half of the film is merely Fred convincing himself, through an extended fantasy in which he is Pete Dayton, of his own innocence in his wife's murder. But the film could equally be regarded as from Pete's point of view, with Fred the fictional character. But to ask these questions is to not necessarily seek an answer; indeed, when watching Lost Highway, you get the feeling that Lynch is simply exploring ideas here masculine doubt (both Fred and Pete have problems finishing during sex), identity crises and, to study the haunting surface level of the film, nightmares and their connection to memory and the unconscious.

The follow-up production Mullholland Drive was far more successful, and had many similarities with Lost Highway, but lacked the same intense rawness, the possible nest-ups and interesting characters in my opinion. What is most fun with this film is that you wind up thinking of it long after seeing it to try to make sense of the story, which might be possible, but it wont necessarily be what others think.

I think there could be no sure explanation of transformation of Fred Madison into Peter Dayton or duality of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield. Certainly, every viewer might come forward with his/her understanding/vision of the happenings. But you should not mind the actual plot! The most important thing is that it is so fascinating, mystic, touching and prone to diverse interpretations. I find equally enchanting and very suited soundtrack of the movie. For me, D.Bowie's I'm Deranged is a special one, but all the tracks of the movie are so in place. As to actors, Bill Pullman suits the role of deranged Fred Madison, Patricia Arquette seems to be a true personification of sexually unsatisfied and insatiable woman, Robert Blake - hauntingly real Mystery Man, and, it seems to me, no one could forget Robert Loggia's (Mr Eddy/Dick Laurent) encounter with a speeding driver.

Featuring vast amounts of imagery in every shot, apparently differing and interweaving plots, a large cast who are all excellent, Lost Highway is a film which you are not likely to forget.Bill Pullman stars as Fred, a saxophonist who lives in an awkward relationship with his beautiful wife Renee, played by Patricia Arquette. He never seems to be able to get close to her, even though they have been together for supposedly years. When he finds a videotape at his doorstep, he watches in horror as it shows the inside of their house-someone has been coming in and watching them at night. At a party, a mystery man (Blake) seems overly interested in him and claims he is at Fred's house now, even though they are standing together at this party at another house. Fred phones home, and the mystery man answers, being at both ends of the phone. Fred and Renee leave. When Fred finds another tape which shows him killing his wife he is arrested as his wife has been killed. On death row he suddenly changes into another man-Pete, with his own life and family. The cops let him go, but follow him. He is a mechanic who, like in Blue Velvet, becomes involved with a shady character called Mr Eddy with a violent temper and his mistress Alice, also played by Arquette. Pete is intrigued by Alice, and the two sleep together. Alice cries out to be rescued from her life, so Pete and her concoct a plan to save her. However, she does not appear to be all she seems, and Pete knows he is in too deep but cannot escape. He cannot get a concrete hold of Alice. Then things get strange.As with any real piece of art, you can come up with your own thoughts and explanations of what you see and hear while watching Lost Highway. The entire film is designed to haunt and disturb, from the slightly abnormal sets, to the look of certain characters, to the music, images and performances. At times this is incredibly quiet, and the volume must be played at full blast to hear what is being said. There are a few violent scenes, lots of sex which never seems erotic, but always necessary. Most of the actors give understated, cold performances and rarely try to explain what is happening to themselves, but special mention must go to Richard Pryor. He plays the wheelchair bound Arnie who works with Pete, but it must rank as one of the most terrifying performances ever. It is in an untouchable way, deeply unsettling, those eyes seem to see everything that no-one would ever want to see. Apparently at an early showing, certain scenes were mixed up so the film played in a different order. Perhaps linear story-telling is not always needed. Unfortunately for most people, the story needs to be safe and simple, so they will be turned off by this. The film never attempts to show any sense of happiness, hope, or light in the traditional sense, and is therefore always distant meaning we must watch it more closely to find something good, and inevitably succumb to the unsavoury acts and tone which can become almost unbearable. If you want a thoroughly challenging and original film, then Lost Highway is a must.7.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Stunning, absolutely stunning (spoiler)","Date":"17 December 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Not for everyone, but I found Lost Highway to be an absolutely stunning movie.

It is almost as if the first half becomes a 'b-film', played before the main spectacle (many film noirs from the defining period of the 1940s and 1950s were featured as such - deliberately low-budget). Lynch's 'main-spectacle' begins when car-mechanic Pete seems to metamorphise into Fred, a convicted murder in a death-row cell. The innocence youth Pete is released upon identity, and Lynch from then on in abounds in tributes to classic film noir imagery, such as a burning beach house, high speed west coast car chases, and a chilling camera shot that makes the viewer think the mechanic will get crushed by the car he is operating under, as poor Nick perished in 'Kiss Me Deadly'.However, the two noir motifs that blend the 'b-film' and 'the main spectacle' are the 'femme fatale', played by the same actress (a striking brunette, and a deadly blonde. Perhaps their character's relationship to the plot makes more sense in light of Mulholland Drive's lesbian sex scene?), and the obese and incompetent detectives. The development of these characters through the two 'films' within a film binds the narrative together whilst leaving several threads of the plot open to question. The most valid interpretation is as the director himself as said, in life there are no answers, so why should his films have answers? Like all noir films, that were not made under Hollywood's strict codes of production, Lynch challenges the 'safe' world of classical Hollywood cinema, in which questions are answered and film making rules obeyed. For this reason, if one can categorise Lynch, he is a director of noir films. A rebel who questions both filmmaking and becomes a modern philosopher.Lynch's genius is that he at once acknowledges the importance and ambiguity of the noir 'genre' (in film criticism it is highly debatable whether noir is even a genre in its own right, or not a hybrid of the gangster or detective), yet challenges its boundaries, presenting a 'b-movie' as both a prelude yet also an integral part of his main feature. Lost Highway takes an already ambiguous 'genre', and creates a movie that breaks even its' 'genre's codes of production. The house doesn't burn. The mechanic isn't crushed. Who the hell is the mystery man?! Lynch's ambiguities elevate the mystery surrounding Kiss Me Deadly's 'Great Whatsit' to extended hyperbole, that extends the noir 'genre' boundaries to the point where the genre is 'noir', it is 'Lynch'.This film should be looked at as a challenge to criticism surrounding the noir 'genre' and is a central part of Lynch's filmography. It should be watched after seeing 'Kiss Me Deadly' and after being acquainted with Lynch's other films. "},{"Title":"Lynch's masterpiece.

Take the scenes involving Fred coming home from the party. You'll hear certain sounds. Those same sounds apear later on in the movie. Only seen from a different viewpoint. Same as the Dick Laurant Is Dead scene. My theory on that is that the characters are stuck in a time loop. Which would explain the weird occurance during the car chase at the end of the movie. Since right after that happens Fred is at his house again and mentions to himself that Dick Laurant Is Dead.  And I think the Timeloop is caused by that Highway though the desert we keep seeing.Anyway that's what me and a couple of friends concluded after discussing the movie a bunch of times.Anyway I love this movie.

(Along with Jackie Brown and Dark City also for the same price.) A bargain I thought.After spending what seemed like a year of my life watching it, (although it was only a Sunday evening/afternoon) I felt I'd been robbed!As the end credits rolled I released a startled, choked laugh of surprise, which woke my girlfriend who was sleeping on the couch next to me -she couldn't even remain conscious throughout it's duration - and when she asked me what happened, I was at a loss to offer an explanation.. As would most people be.But - I'm not a dumb ass - and I knew I'd seen something genuinely original. After dwelling on it for a while, primarily the credit sequences - that hurtling road and Bowie's fantastic song Deranged, - I simply can't wait to watch it again. Three days later and I'm still thinking about it!I'm a fan of cheesy films, independent films, violent films, chaotic - disruptive anarchic films - good films or bad films - I don't care (hence my hysteria at watching the cornball `ghosts of mars' - it was *FUN*) - as long as they are entertaining - or have some justification in their being made in the first place. As so many films these days are made simply to expand the coffers of the studios so they can release more and more idiotic tales of stupid sentimentality and right wing propaganda.  I like films that get by on their own merits  - not by just having big name actors mug and wink at each other - which is why `Harold and Maude' is a better love story than `Sleepless in Seattle' and `Notting Hill' and their nauseating ilk will ever be! I just like films - period - I also write screenplays and novels too, it doesn't make me any more qualified mind - I'm just a big fan of cinema and the medium of film as both an art form and an entertainment media.In fact the only films I dislike are the patronising formulaic studio crap - sequels, Julia Roberts/ Demi Moore vehicles etc. mindless action films, unless they have originality or personality, (like Jackie Chan for example - I can forgive him anything as he's fantastic) and Lost Highways staunchly anti-commercial, anti-narrative, hypnotic and hectic collusion of images and scenes, the dreamlike storyline that atrophies into a disturbing, insane loop, makes it a contender for my film of the year!  - Or at least the film that I like seemingly just to confound my friend's as they never get them and think I am deliberately doing it to be highbrow!If you can relate to my tastes then you'll probably like it - if you enjoyed the uneccessary Planet of the apes remake/ debacle/ reinterpretation, then you'll find this very heavy going!What you get with Lost Highway is an open-ended narrative that deliberately explains nothing and blurs both the accepted cinematic rules and visual vocabulary of what we expect in modern movies. It's a free form, lazy, almost easy-going nightmare that glides hauntingly and quietly from one surreal scene to the next - some are simply gripping in their intensity, others alienating in their sparse, Pinter-esque dialogues. Characters are dispassionate, guarded creatures that show little emotion, and the sinister Mystery man in black, comes across as the most interesting, but is also sadly afforded the least screen time.Overall - if you watch this film expecting to follow a story and passively allow the visuals to narrate to you, then you'll be disappointed - and big time! But if you are tired of knowing what is going to happen next when you watch a film, and are sick of the sight of the same few industry assholes getting paid millions, and confusing their pay-checks with their talent, then watch this dangerous and unpredictable masterpiece of the surreal and enjoy it as a unique piece of visual artistry.It's not Lynch's best  - I'm a big fan of Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart (although I do find some parts hard to take!) But he's undeniably an intriguing intelligent filmmaker, and worthy of support. There maybe difficult moments where you may lose the thread, but it's worthy of perseverance if you are interested in expanding your movie-going tastes.It's not perfect - perhaps only Halloween and Star Wars are the only true ideals in capturing their respective genres and remaining unequalled masterpieces - You do have to invest an amount of attention to enjoy this film, and even use your brain while you watch it, but it's a hell of a lot better way to spend a winters evening than watching something like pearl bloody habroror, or whatever.I can honestly say that, now after seeing the film, I can understand why there was nothing in the way of a description or a synopsis on the back of the video box!7/10 Unique, flawed, disjointed, confusing, unsettling, disturbing - Great.

He's giving us a completely subjective viewpoint of a man who is insane, and how can anyone argue that he's doing it wrong?  What throws people off about this film is that it is so subjective it can be misinterpreted as a pointless exercise in weirdness.Subjective films are nothing new.  Requiem for a Dream was a subjective film.  However, Aronofsky is showing us these things as an outsider might view them, and ends with an outsider's perspective.  When Sara Goldfarb wanders out of her house toward the end and ends up in the television station, we see the reactions of others and can therefore accurately judge the reality of the situation.  Lynch does this a little during the first third of the film, for instance, when Fred is talking to the detectives or talking with Andy after first meeting the Man in Black, but as the film progresses, the viewpoint becomes more and more internalized.  The film doesn't make much rational sense, but then again, insane people don't behave very rationally.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!In the final third of the film, when Pete turns back to Fred, obviously because his fantasy has left him as dejected as he was in real life, he has no choice but to face up to what he has done.  The cabin exploding in reverse is Fred's psyche, which is shattered, coming back together in the guise of Pete.  As mentioned earlier, Pete fails.  After this, he mentally retraces the steps of his earlier murder of Dick Laurent, which happened before the film even starts.  He followed Dick and Renee to a hotel, waited for Renee to leave, put Dick in his trunk, went out to the desert, and killed him.  He then comes back to his house and says as much.  Of course, this is all in Fred's head, and he still can't come to grips with what happened, so everything loops back on itself.END SPOILERAnyway, I don't like to verbalize what happens in David Lynch films because a lot of the magic is lost in the translation.  It's like translating a foreign language to English.  The meaning is still there, but it loses something, its flow, its fluidity, its beauty.  I just wanted to explain that because I'm sick of people complaining that the film is pretentious nonsense.  It's not at all.

The surreal and sombre tone contributes to enhance all of the movie's different aspects. I recommend this movie for everyone with a taste for a wicked, different told story.

It sometimes resembles a contemporary art installation or video, but it's also both an Hitchcockian thriller dealing with identity and an experimental, almost underground film. The photography is superb and the actors, as always with Lynch, reach unknown territories where no one would have expected them to go. The musical score is ironic and modern. Lost Highway is something rare and precious an attempt by a famous director to explore modern urban mythology without any of the tricks of the trade most film-makers use. It is free as art itself, violent and puzzling. It shows images never seen or fantasized before. It is a masterpiece!

They shall be the ones who have learned or understood what Lynch has to say for themselves, independently. The film serves as a confirmation that there are only a handful of such people.In mind of that, I make only a fleeting observation, somewhat extraneous to the moment of this film, directed rather at the inability of the majority of the viewing public to face up to the reality of their existences. (Not that I seek to educate.)People complain about irresolvabilities in the narrative which is or might be their viewing of Lost Highway. Yet somebody capable of creating a film as beautiful as The Elephant Man (1980), conforming to somewhat orthodox narrative structures, excelling at that, does not transgress such structures either lightly or unintentionally.In a sense, this film cannot remind one what film is capable of (because it has no comparable predecessor). It rather determines what film is capable of.One could rarely say of a film of this moment that one could not have wished to have made it simply because one could not then have had the benefit of purely viewing it. Lynch has succeeded in disbenefitting himself only in this way.Camden Town, 1997; Everyman, Hampstead, 1998; L'Entreport, Paris, 2 Jan 1999; L'Entreport, Paris, 11 Sept 1999 "},{"Title":"David Lynch's Confusing Compulsion","Date":"12 February 1999","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Folks, I think I've got an answer.

I can imagine such a person, energetic and excited by his own misunderstanding, looking for a channel with which to justify his apparent ineptitude with some explanation of an antithetical sanity. I am not challenged or disturbed by anybody like that.Lost Highway is an authentic movie. Its director is genuine, and has always made films like this. He has always been somebody troubled by an uncommon lack of distraction, and therefore, when he is not seeing everything in its nakedness without an amiable song in his head or a happy facade he is superimposing on the world, he is seeing it all with a troll shard in his eye, recognizing the immanent ugliness which a nice connotation cannot conceal. Although it is a theoretical idea, one that you may have no use for, it is evident through Lynch's collection and application of sound, along with his visions of everything in the world as unassisted and scarily uninviting. Undoubtedly, David Lynch would never admit to anything like this, because he is too pure to be an intellectual. He is experiential and intuitive, a real and indisputable artist rather than a critic, theorist or didactic informant. And Lost Highway is, amongst all of his movies, the most audacious, (Eraserhead coming close but being too complete and ambitious to want to inspire much interpretive difficulty or frustration). While I will always love Lost Highway despite claims against its incoherence and frivolity, I must at least waste my time to say that the observations of the detractors are right. Those two qualities are present and actual attractions, and are demonstrative of the artistic fullness and unimpeded representational ability of the director. I go to Lynch's movies because of their incoherence, for the same reason why I go to a writer who lacks sociopolitical interest. He is someone too generous to ideas to cloud them with periodic assertions and interruptions involving social or political information. And coherence is a social product it has been developed traditionally by filmmakers, and has been proved to work because audiences generally like it. People generally like understanding what is going on. Not to say that they should be ashamed of their often anxious and natural inquisitiveness, but they should at least realize that the most timeless art is not devoted entirely to lucidity and linearity. A thought, reflection or image gestates independent of such obligatory qualifications, which is why the impositions of structure and common interpretations of quality force it through a filter. David Lynch is the real thing, and his films defy the filter. Why can't certain viewers understand this? Why is authenticity so difficult to receive, and why is it that any kind of experiment seems to them a failure to match convention, and why are you so proud of your claims regarding its incomprehensibility, as if its fans had never realized this? Why have you all made me look ridiculous, sitting here writing this tirade in support of an artist you need to come to terms with, to submit to?

On the contrary...Everybody's on the highway of life and so is Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), a jazz saxophonist at a local club. Fred's life revolves around his jazz music &#x96; he plays tenor sax at a local club &#x96; and his wife, the stunning Renee (Patricia Arquette), who he thinks is having an affair. But, Fred's not sure with whom, and he's at a loss about what to do...His seething jealousy is palpable, however, raging just behind the smooth mask of his handsome face.The appearance of mysterious video tapes at his doorstep, on successive days, changes everything about their lives first, just a video of the house front, then a second tape has some clips from inside, and when Fred and Renee see a third video of themselves asleep in bed, it is Renee who demands that they call in the cops. Puzzled, but well meaning, the cops give them some advice, check the house, and as they leave their cards with Fred and Renee, one of the cops says It's what we do. Unhappily for Fred, they do more when, a day or so later, Fred finds another tape with a video of himself, covered with blood, and the dismembered body of Renee thrown about the bedroom&#x85; Fred's arrested, tried for murder and sentenced to die &#x96; a very quick and compressed action that's done in three or four quick frames, and with no need for much dialog.Thereafter, the real story begins &#x96; and the viewer is then sucked into a bizarre and complex narrative that is so confusing many viewers throw up their hands in despair.David Lynch is on record as saying that his film art has been much influenced by Francis Bacon, a painter whose work must be seen to be...hmmm...appreciated. No words of mine can effectively describe a Bacon painting blurred images, raw flesh, body parts, blood galore, contorted faces all form the immediate images. Beyond that, it's up to you to interpret what you see. So also Lost Highway, it seems, which I would characterize as a dynamic &#x96; in a literal sense &#x96; work of art that must be seen, again and again and again.As I indicated, most would say that the complete film makes no sense at all, and you'll find many quotes from critics &#x96; including Roger Ebert &#x96; to that effect. Space, here, is too short to fully discuss this narrative; suffice to say that I disagree with the Eberts of the world on this one.Because, for me, Lost Highway makes complete sense when I accept the following premises (1) Fred is in fact the murderer of his wife; (2) he is, at the very least, temporarily insane, with all the attendant implications of that condition; and (3) he is attempting to rationalize within his mind the unbearable knowledge of what he did. Hence, from go to whoa for the whole movie, we're inside Fred's fantasy as he attempts to absolve his guilt.The irony, for Fred &#x96; and the viewer &#x96; is that we're never absolutely sure if Renee was in fact an unfaithful wife.The plot, the sequence of events, appears to be non-linear &#x96; hence my initial confusion and that of others &#x96; and yet it is not. It's perfectly circular from start to finish &#x96; from the very first frame to the very last &#x96; with the full story unfolding with each bizarre event. However, being so complex and so effectively done, it would be foolhardy for me to attempt a summary. See the movie and you'll know why.The actors in this tour-de-force are well suited to their roles. As Fred, Bill Pullman has that nice guy look that's perfect for hiding homicidal tendencies; this is still his best effort in serious acting, in my opinion. Patricia Arquette &#x96; the wife Renee, suspected of infidelity &#x96; appears as the quintessential femme fatale &#x96; sexy, voluptuous, devious, untrustworthy; her deadpan throughout is the obvious symbol of her dead love for Fred &#x96; or anybody, perhaps. Robert Blake &#x96; as The Mystery Man &#x96; looks suitably spooky as the visible manifestation of Evil. Robert Loggia does the role of gangster so well, I sometimes wonder about him&#x85;(just kidding). And, Balthazar Getty &#x96; an actor I'd not seen before &#x96; acquits himself well as the confused young lover (and as Bill Pullman's alter ego) playing with fire.Finally, if you've not seen any Lynch movies, well... you're in for a psychological treat unlike anything you've seen before, maybe; but, if you're squeamish, be warned. There are gruesomely bloody scenes, explicit sex scenes, and &#x96; for fans of terror &#x96; creepy dark corridors, a staple of Lynch's later works. In a very real way, I think, Lost Highway is the first of a trilogy of films that has a theme which centers upon the catastrophic effects of jealous rage, and which is expounded upon further with Mullholland Drive (2001) and ending with Inland Empire (2007).

All of the Lynchian hallmarks are there - the gangster, duel identities, dream states, a mysterious man - but something intangible is missing. A mood is created but it's a mood that you see rather than feel.  This film feels like an imposter.Dissecting and deciphering a David Lynch film is usually fun stuff but trying to figure out Lost Highway is an exercise in futility and frustration.  Does Fred die and become Pete?  Does Pete die and become Fred?  Is Pete real?  Is Alice real?  Are Alice and the Mystery Man the same person?  Is the beginning of the film actually the end and the middle is the beginning?  There are too many ideas/theories that could fit but none actually do. In great films like Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive I felt like the director knew more than I did and was dropping hints along the way.  With Lost Highway I get that sinking feeling that Lynch knows no more than I do about the mysterious world he created.  Weirdness has been taken just about as far as it can go here and the result is something far from brilliant and closer to simply lost.

It certainly may be his darkest film both in image and mood.  (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) Essentially it tells the tale of a man driven by jealously to murder his wife and her lover and the fantasy world he creates for himself while awaiting the electric chair.  All the essential Lynch stuff is here duality, multiple psychosis, homicidal tendencies, dangerous women, red curtains, electric disturbances, dead pan detectives, dream imagery, and non-linear storytelling.  Lynch does for wife killing here what he earlier did for incest/child killing in Twin Peaks and later did for suicide in Mulholland Drive.  This film isn't quite as fun to try and figure out as Mulholland Drive but it still makes for a good mind bender, and you have to love the mid 90's goth metal soundtrack.  With most Lynch films you are lulled into the dreamworld courtesy of composer Angelo Badalamenti's hypnotic and beautiful orchestrations, but here on this highway you are pounded into the psychogenic fugue of our protagonist with the likes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, and David Bowie.  Also, the scenes with mystery man Robert Blake seem more disturbing and creepy than ever thanks to his current real life predicament on trial for killing his wife.

However, I beg to differ with the reviewer who claimed it is a love-it-or-hate-it affair.  I neither love nor hate this film.  To me, it is a triumph of mediocrity, with the odd spiky bit here and there to remind one that someone of great filmmaking ability had a hand in it.  Here's the good, the bad, and the uglyThe good is essentially the first 40 minutes or so of the film.  The atmosphere is almost unspeakably tense, and the low-level rumbling sound present in every scene truly makes one feel trapped in a nightmare of sorts (incidentally, a theater is required for that effect).  The infamous tailgating scene is also wonderful, though it is just a fragment that could just as easily belong to another film.  An honorable mention goes to the sex scene in the desert illuminated by headlights while This Mortal Coil's version of Tim Buckley's Song to the Siren plays on the soundtrack.The bad  Almost any scene which attempts to push the plot forward.  The arguments against this film usually state that the plot doesn't make any sense.  The arguments for the film counter that by saying that it is a work of art and doesn't need to make sense.  While in the latter camp as a matter of principle, I must also state that a film which attempts to be plot-focused and intimates that its story makes sense when it clearly does not is neither artistic nor intelligent, but merely clumsy and calculated.The ugly  The sadomasochistic eroticism introduced into the film for no other reason but in awareness that the audience's patience has been stretched to the breaking point, so we'd better give them an eyeful of something.My recommendation?

Then later Fred become a participant of another murder of porno film maker Andy, Michael Massee. It's after that where he's evolved into an entirely different person altogether! Then later back to being himself Fred Madison as he again becomes involved in yet another brutal killing in the slashing/shooting of a murderous mob boss Eddy aka Dick Laurent! All this is with the help of this creeped-out looking Mystery Man, Robert Blake, who pops up in the movie in a number of scenes, unannounced and unexpected. The Mystery Man looking like he was made up to be an over-aged and over plastered Japanese Geisha Girl.The nightmare begins for Fred when he receives in the mail, with no forwarding or return address, a video tape of his house an later another tape of not only his house but himself and his wife Renee sleeping in bed. Going to the police Fred is told that they can really do nothing since no crime, other then voyeurism, was committed. Earlier we see Fred invited to this strange party where he's introduced to a friend of Renee named Andy who in turn introduces him to the Mystery Man. The Mystery Man tells Fred that he not only knows where he lives but that at this very moment he's in Fred and Renee's house! Calling home on the Mystery Man's cell phone Fred is answered by the Mystery Man himself who seems to be at two places at the same time!As both we and Fred are trying to figure what exactly is happening in this weird movie that were watching he's suddenly arrested for the murder of his wife Renee and put on death row, without the benefit of a trial and conviction, waiting execution. Freaking out to whats happening to him Fred then seems to morph into a much younger man named Peter Dayton, Balthazar Getty, in his jail cell. The warden then has no choice but to let him go free. We then learn that Peter was arrested some time ago for car theft, and given a years probation, and lives with his parents William and Candace Dayton, Gary Busey & Lucy Butler. Peter also has this hot to trot girlfriend Sheila, Natasha Gregson Wagner, who's always taking off her clothes when she's with him as both her and Peter are almost always eagerly making out with each other. If it wasn't for Fred coming back on the scene later in the movie I had the feeling that actor Bill Pullman walked off the set being disgusted in what he was offered to play in the film and was replaced by actor Balthazar Getty without the writer/director David Lynch not bothering to re-shoot the scenes with Pullman in them!It turns out that Peter is a crack a jack car mechanic working at Arnie's, played by a wheelchair bound Richard Pryor, garage who's very well regarded by gangster Eddy aka Dick Laurent, Robert Loggia, for his mechanical abilities in fixing his car. Eddy is a hair triggered hot tempered hood who you don't mess around with. We see him in action later when he works over this tailgater on the highway, who also gave Eddy the finger, by first ramming his car and then beating and pistol whipping the guy almost within a inch of his life.Eddy is also seen at the garage with this blond bombshell of a woman Alice Wakefield who's his personal squeeze and gun moll, also played by Miss Arquette. Alice get's Peter so turned on and excited and ready to go into action that he can't seem to keep his mind on his work for even a moment. Peter is instead played by Alice like first-class sucker in having him not only risk his life and freedom but also lose his overly friendly and sexually active girlfriend Sheila.Playing around with his moll behind his back can have the loose wired Eddy put an end to Peters life with a gun stuck up so hard and far up his behind and then having his brains, like Eddy told him, blown out of his head. The manipulating Alice also wants Peter to murder her former porn movie producer Andy and then take off with her to this creepy hotel in Death Valley and from there take off to Mexico. Thats after a night of fun and games in the sack, or in the desert, with her that turns the cool night temperature of the area up some 50 degrees.Getting all that she wanted from him including murdering Andy Alice then leaves Peter with his pants, in fact all his clothes, off and takes off leaving him to his fate; being murdered by her outraged lover Eddy. It's just then Peter turns into Fred and the Mystery Man, camcorder in hand, shows up together with a couple of cops looking into Renee's, remember her, murder and what at first seemed like a dream or better yet nightmare becomes a reality.Very strange movie that doesn't make any sense at all until the ending that gives you the impression that it was all some kind of hallucination on Fred's part. In that the entire story was the result of him being on drugs or somehow hypnotized until he finally snapped out, or the drugs wore off. It was then that he finally realized what he did! As the mysterious saying at the start of the film Dick Laurent Is Dead takes on a whole new meaning when it's repeated, by Fred, just as Lost Highway finally, after 135 minutes, comes to an end.

It's not just a hackneyed cliche of the chase movie, he's on the run from the demons that chase us all, and again he starts to change personality right at the end of the movie. That seems to be the whole movie summed up  the human fight between attaining god and avoiding sin and evil. It's just a shame there seems to be a little bit of male heterosexual idiocy in painting women as the symbol of sin and temptation. Some things never change.

For me, the story is about a jealous husband, who resents his impotence toward his sexy wife and acts like a rabbit when he is granted the possibility. Lynch being one of the best director ever, he sublimes this lust with art! As in Inland Empire, Lynch really does moving pictures (paintings). Starting with a beautiful frame, he adds top cast, sound, music, movement and the result is terrific and you remember for a long time those magic moments, as the song in the movie! In addition, Lynch addresses all the emotional ring, all the moods, all the genre so you are taken in a wild ride Here, there's nothing to throw away the opening credits with the dark highway, the sense of fear in the house, the stroboscopic jazz jam, the first sight, the suburban life, the desert sequences, the film noir shoots, the intimate scenes,&#x85; Maybe the story doesn't make sense but we are hostages from this mystery and finally, rarely a movie would have give such intense feelings!

In fact, it's far, far away from what most audiences are used to!The film is pretty confusing, since there's a few unexpected twists throughout the film that I could never had seen coming, and I believe that is part of what made the film so utterly fascinating and fun for me! I'm warning you, DO NOT look into this film before you see it, because a lot of the more surprising things that occur will be spoiled, and therefore loose their magic and unexpectedness.As expected from a David Lynch film, it is very surreal. There are various nightmare-like sequences throughout the film that it seems only Lynch could have made. For example, early on in the film, the first encounter Bill Pullman's character has with Mystery Man is utterly creepy and dreamlike. The ambient noise in the background really enhances the scene, and was a great stylistic decision.Lost Highway is a brilliant noir-esque mystery full of fascinating surrealist sequences, and a lot of great performances. "},{"Title":"Dark, disturbing territory as only Lynch can navigate. A wonder.","Date":"1 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" David Lynch's Lost Highway is a fuzzy, feverish portrait of a fractured mind attempting to make sense of extremely distressing circumstances that are both alienating and possibly self inflicted. Lynch is always keen on probing the cerebrally murky waters which border on the potentially paranormal occurrences, and the often frustrating line, or lack thereof, which is drawn in, around and between these two aspects. Psychological terror, ambiguous scenes that leave you scratching your head once you've caught your breath, identity crisis, elliptical narratives that leave us haunted and wanting more are all tools in his bag, ones he's employed countless times throughout his monolithic career. Usually he implements that in an esoteric, earthy way, but there's something cold, clinical and unsettlingly voyeuristic about this that somewhat separates it from a lot of other stuff he's done. The term 'Lynchian' in itself has become its own genre, there's no debating that anymore. It's usually within this self made genre that he explores, but it's almost like with this one he went in with a mindset to play around with a sordid, almost De Palma-esque style of genre, and then inject it with his trademark eerie weirdness, in this case to great effect. Bill Pullman stars as jazz trumpet player Fred, spending his nights belting out unnerving solos in smoky clubs. Pullman is an all American prototype, seen in a lot of generic, regular Joe roles. Seeing him venture into sketchy material is jarring and super effective (see his career best work in David's daughter Jen Lynch's Surveillance for an even better example of this). He and his gorgeous wife (Patricia Arquette) wake up one ominous morning to discover a packaged video tape on their doorstep, the contents of which show someone breaking into their house and filming them while they sleep. They feel both horrified and violated, and call the police who prove to be just south of useful. From there things get terrifically weird. Fred attends a party where he meets the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who plays a mean spirited magic trick on him that will have your skin crawling out the door. This was one of Blake's last two roles before the unfortunate incident that cut his career painfully short, but he's perfect for Lynch's stable and eats up the frames he inhabits, a pasty faced ghoul with beady black jewels for eyes and a piercing laugh that will stain your psyche for years. Before he knows it, Fred wakes up and is accused for his own wife's murder, whisked away to a dank death row cell, plummeting the film into a new segment, Lynch's way of letting us know this isn't going to be an easy watch. Fred wakes up sometime later... And isn't Fred anymore. He's a young lad with amnesia whose been missing for a while, played by edgy Balthazar Getty. It's a stark left turn for the plot to take, a stinging reminder that from there on out, we're in for some nasty antics with no light at the end of the tunnel. Getty is released from prison, since he's not Pullman who they arrested to begin with. From there he gets entangled in a hot mess of a subplot involving a volatile gangster (Robert Loggia), his seductive wife (also Patricia Arquette) and the ever present Mystery Man who lurks over both planes of the film's narrative. I'm trying to be deliberately vague about the plot (lord knows Lynch did as well), both to not spoil any surprises for you, and partly because after many viewings, I'm still not sure exactly what it means for myself. It's a great big clusterfuck of extremely disturbing sequences, surreal passages of auditory and visual madness and a frothing undercurrent of atmosphere that constantly pulls on your sleeve to remind you that something is terribly wrong, but never gives you the solace of telling you what that something is. Traumatic viewing to say the least. Lynch assembles an extraterrestrial supporting cast including Michael Massee, Jack Nance, Natasha Gregson Warner, Marilyn Manson, Henry Rollins, Mink Stole, Jack Kehler, Giovanni Ribisi, Richard Pryor and the one and only Gary Busey (when Gary is one of the calmest, sanest people in your movie you know you've driven off the cliff). Some highlights for me are anything to do with Blake's paralyzing spectre of a character who is one of the best Lynch creations ever, Loggia intimidating an obnoxious driver is priceless and the closest the film gets to comedy, and the final twenty minutes where the lines of reality, fantasy and the jagged planes of perception within the characters minds collide, providing us with a creepy non-resolution, part of what makes the entire show so memorable and affecting. A classic that begs countless re-watches before it can fully cast all aspects of its spell on you, and one of Lynch's unsung best.

"},{"Title":"A bizarre, mesmerising masterpiece","Date":"20 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This is a very strange film with unusual pacing and an extremely confusing plot. But there are enough hints that you feel like there must be some kind of deeper meaning. However, you'll never get a definite answer. You're not meant to. Human emotions and memories just aren't like that. Arguably the universe itself isn't like that. There are always exceptions to physical laws and weird phenomena that you thought were surely impossible that are actually possible. The important thing is that you *want* the answers, that you care about the characters and the story. And here you do, I guess mainly because the characters are very human and we see everything from their point of view. We relate to their fear, confusion, lust and curiosity.David Lynch commits so strongly to his ideas that you can't just casually dismiss them. Laughter is infectious and so are visions when they're presented so earnestly. Lynch seems to believe in what he's doing so you have no choice but to go along for the ride. It's funny because most movies are full of plot holes anyway, they have so much exposition, so many unnecessary scenes. Typical plots where you can predict later developments. Screen writing that's just going through the motions. Everything is restricted to conventional reality and a linear sequence of events.For me, movies are about ideas, emotions, themes, building tension, playing with expectations, a big climax. The aim is to affect an audience, make them laugh or cry or think or remember something. I think Lynch is a painter. His movies contain images that are hard to forget, they are very stylish. Your brain takes a longer time to process them, they enter your long-term memory in contrast to ordinary films that are often fun but instantly forgettable. His movies are more surreal or abstract, an aspect of film that seems almost completely untapped.I think Patricia Arquette's role is one of the sexiest in any movie ever. She's soft and feminine and kind. She's in most of the movie. I really like the music. It's very moody and adds to the atmosphere a lot. Many of the shots are held a bit longer or shorter than what feels natural. It keeps you guessing, keeps the flow unpredictable. The acting is good, although most of the time the characters are just concerned or confused.Lost Highway is very similar to Mulhulland Drive in many ways. In particular, both movies are split almost into two separate narratives with confusingly similar characters and plots. Like two alternate realities strangely interlinked. A common interpretation seems to roughly be that one story-line is reality while the other is a dream which explains why the same themes occur and why details partially overlap. Also the tone is similar, they're dark and sometimes scary.I'm reminded of Rashomon and The Usual Suspects, where characters recount what happened and we see flashbacks but aren't sure quite how accurate they really are. Lynch's movies exist in that subconscious part of our mind where a person can abruptly morph into another person for reasons we don't understand. If movies are like books and musicals are like poetry, Lynch's movies are like stream-of-consciousness writing - maybe Ulysses.It's exciting that this movie could have a totally different meaning for different people. I find his movies very entertaining just for their strangeness and creepiness. Horrors are meant to scare you in a fun way and thrillers should have you on the edge of your seat puzzled but fascinated. Lost Highway does both for me. I think Lynch understands the weird way our brains work and plays on that. I think his movies contain a lot of humour if you really get them. For me, Lost Highway was exciting, funny, confusing and probably won't ever completely leave my mind.

This is a Lynch film I like a lot, the rocking opening music score, a mini entree, for what follows, demands heavy concentration. This is Lynch all over again, weird moments and unforgettably dark and funny images. Sax player Fred (Bill Pullman) is framed for murder, and sent to jail. He comes out, only he's another person in the film, Pete. What happened in between? A big problem is to be solved here. Fred's wife, Alice (Patricia Arquette) was seeing Pete, while also being a mistress and star of porno flicks, for a bad arse Mr Eddy (Loggia at to peak). Arquette exudes so much sexuality, this is a talent to her acting, she's really good at, after whetting our whistles in True Romance. When she strips in a flashback scene, when introduced to Mr Eddy, it's a really gratifying moment, as is the whole film is gratifying. Lost Highway is very dark, and vaque as in trying to master it's story. Robert Blake as a mystery man, exudes so much menace, he's one of the best things about this cinematic experience, while Richard Pryor in his last acting role, and very sick at the time with MS, has minimal viewing time, running a mechanic's garage, where Pete work, where for Pryor's presence, it's kind of degrading. Lost Highway ends too on the same highway, with the same music score, and the end credits rolling along, as we speed down it. This 97 Lynch is taken up a few more notches, as in it's trying to master plot. You really have to think about, if more so don't, and just enjoy it, especially Lynch fans.

Probably. Lynch films aren't supposed to be logically deduced, I think everyone agrees on that, but is the reverence for his apparent genius so strong that people won't question whether a film of his has any substance or not? I'm curious to experience more of his films, to see if I can gauge some wider understanding of his work. Are there recurring themes and motifs in his filmography that develop an overall psychology? Anyway, this film was fairly fun. Like watching the 'best of' compilation of someone else's fever dreams. Blue Velvet held similar ideas in that it took the serene, easy-going superficiality of people's lives and then delved under the surface, to the dark foundations that we embrace by night and ignore by day. This conceit is taken to a more psychological level in Lost Highway, and rather than a disturbing nightlife we have the disturbing unconscious mind. Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a man put on death-row for presumably murdering his wife (Patricia Arquette) and from there undergoes a bizarre metamorphosis whereby he assumes the identity of another man and is promptly released from prison. The first act of the film feels relatively art-house. It's more about colour, about space, about what we feel from the environment than we do from the human characters. The house is plain and robust, often bathed in a criminal red light, with high narrow windows like something from a castle prison cell. Bill Pullman sulks around, never conveying much to his wife, and neither she to him. He is a Jazz musician, and in concert he plays wildly and frantically. The terror begins after the couple start receiving video-tapes on their door-step; videos from the perspective of someone who has apparently broken into their house, and who ethereally floats down the hallway, silently approaching their bedroom&#x85;.who is this disembodied menace? The most uncomfortable scene of the film, and a brilliant manipulation of the audience's sense of reality, is in which Fred meets a man at a social gathering, a man who seems convinced they've met before. This stranger, dressed in a black jumpsuit, with his pale white face, and penetrating eyes is like a new-wave Bela Lugosi. He holds out a phone to Fred, and asks him to call home; promising him there'll be someone to answer on the other end&#x85;..This scene allows us a vague sense of where the film is going, and the reasons for doing so. Mr Lugosi tells Fred that he was the one who 'invited him in'. But we know this stranger isn't talking in the most literal sense, and when he appears again in the film, he is never get in, or out, of reality. He is like some vampire of the psyche. After his metamorphosis, Pullman turns into Charlie Sheen's doppelgänger, a young greaser-type kid who besides his physicality shares all the lust of Sheen, but not much else. In fact, he's quite boring, and seems even more lost in this world than we do. This second act puts the reins on reality, but only a little more superficially. We begin to get overlaps between old Pullman's world and new Pullman's world, amid a B-movie story of gangster betrayal and young love. Patricia Arquette returns and claims to be someone else, and is apparently a moll, and in this introduction of parallel-Arquette Lou Reed's cover of 'This Magic Moment' is used absolutely majestically, conveying the overwhelming feelings of instant attraction, and the tenuousness of the reality here. In this act there's a lot of moody-noirish cinematography, with intimate close-ups of eyes and lips, and it's all gorgeous too look at, but it's stretched thin with the lack of emotional involvement. Even Gary Busey the redneck father only gets mere moments of screen time.Blue Velvet however, in all its feverish melodrama, had a more colourful cast of characters and a readily available emotional core. Despite the alien-rectangular-stillness of Kyle MacLachlan's face, we were given his blossoming romance that was threatened by his naïve curiosity, and a psychotic oedipal relationship that no one is going to forget any time soon. Dreams can't be intellectually appreciated, rather they need to be felt, and experienced, but you'll have to plumb through all the plasmatic layers of this film's dreams to find something to emotionally involve you. This is something that holds your interest with a morbid curiosity and appreciation for the cinematic technique.The opening credits have us plummeting down this vague sketch of a highway, lit with an ethereal blue light, and never reaching any destination. Someone likened it to a Möbius strip, and this quite reflective of the film as a whole; we travel endlessly around and arrive where we began, feeling like we've achieved very little, but both the strip and film are wonders to the human brain.

Apparently, there is a lot of speculation that much of the film is simply one character's fantasy, and not at all real. This makes some amount of sense, at least more sense than taking the film at face value. Lynch considers himself an artiste, and I suppose that this fits his oeuvre. Much of the cast acted deadened, with the dialog a bit wooden, but I do not take this to be poor performing, but exactly what Lynch wanted, to create the atmosphere. You have to give him credit for originality. Robert Blake, as the Mystery Man was creepily evil, and utterly unrecognizable. And kudos to Patricia Arquette who turned in a wonderful performance. I have known her mostly from her current TV show, where her character is very much Miss Everday.

Even so, I was really quite surprised, and a little dismayed, that none of the several dozen comments I read here came up with the fact that the Mystery Man is, in fact, Satan.

His comment, I'm not accustomed to going where I'm not invited is a classic devil reference. At first Fred is freaked out, repulsed, but by the end of the movie, when he kills Mr. Eddy in the desert, old Mr. Scratch is helping Fred out. That Robert Blake was the devil is really the only thing in the movie that was crystal clear to me.Now, whether it was a REAL Satan or simply the devil within Fred, is another story altogether! As in Mulholland Drive, we are left to figure out which story was real and which imagined (or both, or neither, et cetera).

However, others hate it. I was offended the first time I heard somebody say that they hated it, but then I realized why. What Lost Highway is is an experience. Plain and simple, you can forget about all that psychogenic fugue stuff and everything else. It is an hour and some odd minutes through which any open-minded individual who is unafraid to rent it is the witness of something exciting and unbelievable. Because this is simply what it it is, viewers are going to disagree with it because they were expecting another Bill Pullman movie that they could use to entertain themselves and then discard an hour and a half later. And they got surprised. More than surprised; even shocked. But, as all David Lynch films go, it will find a certain audience that will accept it. And this audience probably watches films for a different reason than someone like Roger Ebert. Ebert's a dork. He spreads bad news about films like Reservoir Dogs and Lost Highway, but gives Freaky Friday and just about everything else on the New York Times entertainment page Thumbs up!. I mean, he was frustrated at Lynch for the way Isabella Rosselinni is presented naked in Blue Velvet, despite the fact that Rosselinni was the one that got the idea of presenting herself that way from a photo of a starving African child. Rosselinni's autobiography, Some of Me, tells the whole story. And not only that, but, after giving Lost Highway and almost every other Lynch film thumbs down except for The Straight Story,(Lynch's most tame film), he recently gave Mulholland Drive a four-star review. The reason why this is such a hypocritical act on his part is because he disliked Lost Highway because he believes it is merely a mixture of scenes and a work only devoted to style. However, Mulholland Drive can be seen the same way! Both Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are very similar in this sense. Then why did Ebert like one so much over the other? Who knows, but I see it as hypocrisy. Maybe it had to do with Ebert meeting Lynch himself.The ones who watch films to experience something new will like Lost Highway. And that's great, because they won't misunderstand it and can love it as much as I do. But, if you are somebody like Ebert, who watches a film only to comment on its structure and how well it blends in or compares to all the other good movies, then you will hate it.

After the massive guilt Fred Madison (Pullman) suffers for murdering his wife Renee (Arquette) he creates for him self an alternate personality where he lives out the life of a young mechanic named Pete Dayton (Getty) until reality starts to creep back. This is a literally twisted story that doesn't run in an exact chronological order and leaves the viewing wondering `what the hell was that' but indeed this is what drives someone to watch the movie again to try and rule out inconsistencies that the plot produced. Lynches choice for the leads for lost highway were 2nd to none, Pullman gives a disturbing performance as a psychopath yet retains an ignorant innocence similar to Anthony Perkins in 'psycho'. Arquette in a double role hear is quite good as a seductress figure, but her subtly is to a point where her performance feels insincere. (This may be more due to my ignorance than anything else may). Getty's performance is very well done and I can't think of a single gripe. This film gives a frightening portrayal of a deranged mind, and while the plot is not that great, the way the film is made (story/cast/direction/so on...) it more than makes up for it.

He is also saved, although it seemed improbable a few minutes before the end.So let's get serious now. If you want an electric shock to your brain, if you want to check if any of your braincells are still alive this is the movie to see. Please note this, however It requires ACTIVE minds to watch it. There is nothing wrong about being passive while watching a movie, almost all of them are made for this purpose. But this is a totally different experience. It requires that you forget everything you knew about watching a movie.The movie is confusing. It is unclear why this or that happened. At some points it is unclear what happens.Don't worry about it, any explanation you may consider as reasonable, anything that pleases you personally is good enough. The movie is not the same for you or me or someone else. Some people say this is art, and I agree, although I am extremely afraid of this world and the people who use it from time to time.Anyway the bottom line is if you like something completely different, goand watch it. If not, don't go, you will feel that the filmmaker deceived you.

Everyone who thought Fight Club was a weird movie, you obviously haven't seen Lost Highway because it makes Fight Club look like a saturday mourning cartoon. Director David Lynch has always had a love/hate approach to filmmaking, for everyone who can stomach what he does you will see nothing but brilliance, for everyone else you will get a huge migrane inducing mess. WE start off the film with Fred getting an anonymus message saying that a local mob boss is dead. Fred is a saxaphone player who plays in clubs that seem more suitable for a rave than a jazz concert but since it is a Lynch film we know enough not to question that. Fred and his wife then recieve an envelope on their front stoop with a video tape in it with footage of the front of their house that they make nothing of. The next day they get another video that appears to feature the same footage but further viewing shows that the cameraman was filming from inside their home and even captured them making love. A police investiagtion reveals that there is no evidence of a break and enter. But again the next day Fred gets a video, this time featuring footage of him killing his wife. He is then sentanced to death for the unexplained murder of his wife. But while in prison Fred morphes into a 19 year old mechanic named Pete. This portion of the film seems more down to earth as Pete deals with his girlfriend, a violent mob boss, his family and a seductive blond named Alice, but later turns into the exercise in werid that that first act was. The third act of the film makes no sense at all as it tries to weave together the story of Fred and the story of Pete but still leaves no logical explanation for anything even after the credits role. All the actors, especially Bill Pullman give very mellowdramatic perfromances, like they are trying to achieve greatness but come off bland, with the exception of Robert Blake who is guarenteed to produce nightmares in a horrifying role as an Uncle Fester look-a-like, mystery man who, to me, also gives the films most important line when he says When a man is sentanced to death he is sent to a place that he cannot escape. If you can make sense of that line you may just be holding the key to unlock the movies mystery. David Lynch must be given credit for his extremely unique and disturbing style of story telling that uses unorthadox camera movement and offbeat lighting throughout the entire film. He tells the story in a manner that is part bad soap opera on acid, part crime drama and all nightmare. Although it is an aquired taste at best, Lynch has spun a horrifying tale of lust and betryal of a supernatural sort that will keep those who like it glued to the screen. Note to the more light hearted viewers, best leave the lights on while watching this creepfest, it could save yourself from many sleepless nights.

Whatever!","Date":"5 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  *Definite Spoilers Below*David Lynch has brought us some pretty strange stories. The seedy underworld in Blue Velvet, and the quirky characters in Twin Peaks, are perhaps his best-known triumphs in weirdness. But this little nightmare is just too bizarre to even remotely understand. We begin the story watching a down-on-his-luck saxophonist, Fred Madison, answer a buzz at his door. Dick Laurent is dead, says the voice. And that pretty much finished the scene. For about 30 minutes we see him  cope with marital problems and a possible voyeur, videotaping the couple while they sleep. Fred his wife, Renee, notify the police, and go on with their lives. Then, while they are at a dinner party, Fred is confronted with a Mystery Man, who tells him that he is at his house. The MM gives him a phone, and Fred calls home, only to be greeted by the Mystery Man. Sound confusing? Read on. Next, we see another video, but this one is of him murdering his wife. In the span of about two minutes, he is arrested,  convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. All of this is done very surrealistically, with fantastic lighting and cinematography thanks to the Lynchian style.But then, we are deeply confused to see a younger more virile young man in his cell, named Getty. He is released and goes back to his job in a garage. Robert Loggia enters as the gangster, accompanied by *gasp* Renee? But now, she's a blonde and her name is Alice. This brings more confusion to the audience, as we feel left in the dark about what on earth is happening on screen. The only clue we are given, is when Getty hears the energetic saxophone on the radio and hurriedly changes the station. Anyway, about for about 45  minutes we see Getty start to get it on with Alice, and at least two other women, and we are subjected to about three distracting sex scenes. Finally, Alice convinces Getty to steal from friend and split with her to wherever. They hit the highway, and make love again outside a house in the desert. Then we are confused even more, as it is not Getty that emerges from the sand, but Fred?! By now, we are just about throwing our hands up and saying, I give up. But it gets even more confusing. I won't give away any more plot points, but suffice it to say, it jerks the viewer around until the final frame.By the end credits we are left to wonder what the heck this movie was really about. Was it about two separate individuals with a paranormal connection? Was it about an insane wife-killer? Or was it all just one big nightmare? I haven't the foggiest idea what it was about. But, I'm afraid that's the point. Lynch was not setting forth to make a film where everything makes sense in the end. It seems as if this movie was strictly an exposition of style. Lighting, color, composition, etc.. are equally superb. Technologically, this film is one not to miss. However, the pacing seemed too slow in parts, the acting was fair and (to go back to the form versus function argument), it just seemed to sacrifice content for style. I have no problem with stylistic cinema, but I just think that style should complement the story, not distract it. Maybe that's what Lynch wanted. Regardless, take my word for it Don't try to find your way around this movie. Take it as an extended dream. Or nightmare.

He has said that he doesn't like films to be one genre and if a film switches genres halfway through and switches everything else then what's left is a mystery.

Let the specifics of the 'plot' glide right through your consciousness...don't detain them in your rational mind - they'll just get all backed up while you try to 'explain' the movie to yourself.  Lynch is intelligent enough to realize that true nightmares are illogical and incomprehensible, and made all the more nightmarish the more illogical and incomprehensible they are.  Ever had one?  A nightmare?  If you have, you know the best ones are those that leave a vivid footprint of fear in your waking mind, but whose characters and events elude any effort to have a rational order imposed upon them.Those who really dig this film because it makes them feel 'in' on something which defies conventional understanding are, I believe, just a bit self-absorbed.  It's not that complicated of a film, it just APPEARS so.  And, by the same token, those who rigidly condemn the film as 'pretentious' and 'muddled' are, unfortunately, rather unwilling to think just slightly to the left of normal for two hours.  There's nothing like a well-told story, to be sure - and there's absolutely nothing wrong with RESOLUTION...I prefer it, in fact.  But 'Lost Highway' needs to be seen less as a story and more as a kind of PSYCHOLOGICAL SIMULATOR RIDE.Kudos to Lynch for daring to risk being so misunderstood...and he has proven time and again that he can successfully tell a good story - one with a beginning, middle, and end - so I will give him the benefit of the doubt.Rent 'Lost Highway' and 'The Straight Story,' Lynch's delicately beautiful ode to the oft-forgotten simplicity of life.  The depth and scope of the man's capacity for probing the respective darkness and bittersweet gentility of the human experience is on full display in these two films.Then just relax.

But Lynch did not create this masterpiece of light, shadow, paradox, and metaphor to just weird us out.  Under the surface Lynch's film reveals to us a man's soul and his attempt to flee from his own despair.Fred is a man struggling.  His marriage is cold, he's impotent, and someone is taping his house.  At first it appears Fred is nothing more than the hapless victim of the story.  We see Robert Blake (as the Mystery Man) looking like the embodiment of death, talk to Fred at a party.  Call me, I'm at your house.  Fred replies, That's crazy.   The Mystery Man hands his phone to Fred.  He calls his home and the MM answers, I told you I was here.  The two separate but identical voices laugh, their voices cackling in unison.  It's wonderfully spooky stuff but what does it all mean?The key to the story is the relationship between the Mystery Man (Blake) and Fred (Pullman).   Fred is constantly haunted by him.  Even when Fred escapes jail by becoming the younger, not so-impotent Pete, he is followed.  But he's never directly threatened by the Mystery Man.  His threats only come as subtle reminders and visions.  The Mystery Man represents a hidden truth about Fred.  And it is this truth which Fred is feverishly running from.So, why does Fred change into Pete?  And why does the Mystery Man remind him of his execution after he's already escaped from jail?  The fact is, Fred is still in jail awaiting execution.  That is the Mystery Man's damning reminder and the spoiler of Fred's fantasy.  He never changed into Pete and he never escaped from jail.  Earlier, Fred reveals his tendency towards selective memory.  He says, I like to remember things my own way; how I remember them, not necessarily the way they happened.  This is a clue into Fred's psyche.  He is manipulating his memory and using fantasy to escape reality.The Mystery Man is the personification of Fred's memory.

What else would you expect from Lynch? We  would all like a logical explanation of it. But none will be forthcoming from its maker so we must try to make sense of the images and situations ourselves. To this end the first question we must ask is WHAT IS THE FIRST INCIDENT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE SERIES OF EVENTS? Not the film, THE SERIES OF EVENTS. Is it when The Musician kills the unfaithful wife, or when The Young Mechanic first meets The Gangster's Moll? Is it when the first videotape is discovered or when a man and his wife are driving home and he asks her how she first met the seedy host of a party they were just at? It's a tricky question, because of the disjointed nature of the film, where the normal sequence of time seems suspended for the sake of expressing dementia and emotional uncertainty. This is all that we can say ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Everything else seems to be the surreal attempts of a Lost Mind to embellish -or should we say Justify- a heinous act of MURDER. There are visitations from odd characters, emotional upheavals and dreamy scenes reminiscent of drug intoxication. But these do Not seem real. There is only ONE reliable witness to the goings-on in LOST HIGHWAY the VIDEO. Fred himself says it he doesn't like video cameras, because he prefers to recall moments in the past the way HE REMEMBERED THEM, NOT HOW THEY ACTUALLY OCCURRED. Also, keep in mind that the Mystery Man's skin is pale white. Lifeless. In other words, he has been killed - and there is only one murderer in the whole film,  So this appears to be the first act of the LOST HIGHWAY saga, the murder> an associate who was privy to the video-taping of his wife's pornographic films, but who knew enough about Fred not to trust him and videotaped his actions.

Watching this is like having a weird dream, but a dream we can end at any moment by our own will. We just have to stop watching it and go see something else. But i bet, that even people who hated this, couldn´t get away from it, while they were watching. Any movie who manages to keep a spectator glued to the seat through 2 hours, is a very good movie in my book. People might think they are hating it, but i bet they keep interested right up to the last frame of LOST HIGHWAY.It´s not the movie people hate, it´s the fact that they can´t understand what the story is about, that makes them frustrated,. So they attack the movie, because no one likes to feel less inteligent.If everything in this story were explained, it would loose all it´s dreamlike supernatural atmosphere, and i bet many people would have forgot it by now. This way, everyone keeps coming back to see this one more time, just to try to figure out the plot.LOST HIGHWAY, is like a supernatural event, that each time we see it, we get even more desperate to find an explanation for it. In the end we never do, but we keep wanting to experience it all over again, just for the fascination and the sense of wonder. In the case of this movie, a dark haunted sense of misterious wonder.The great thing about the movie, is that it makes us think, and we can get all the scatered plot pieces from this story, and create our own version on what we think this story is about. Because of this, LOST HIGHWAY must be the movie, with the most possible meanings and stories ever imagined. For each person it seems to be about a diferent thing.I have a friend, who thinks it´s about schizofrenia and about madness, and that all the story only happens in the mind of Bill Pulman, and the whole movie is no more than a giant illusion from a mad man. Nothing happens.Good interpretation, no ?... And knowing the work of LYNCH, everything is possible.But i prefer my way of looking at it, altough i´m almost sure i´m wrong. I like to look at this story, almost as a very dark episode from the original 60´s serie of the TWILIGHT ZONE. I like to think LOST HIGHWAY, is about what happens when two parallel dimensions, somehow got mixed togheter in one same line of time. And about what might happened, if because of that we discovered, that WE, in other dimension had a complete diferent personality, and one that we couldn´t ever think of of having in our present line of time. Whomever created that distortion of the line of time mixing the dimensions ? Well, i n my view, i guess we can call it what we want. The devil, a superior race, parallel beings who live between dimensions and control all this. You choose. It´s that open. Why ? Maybe they make mistakes, who knows. Or was just a joke.Supernatural or scientific. Anyway they could end up being the same. Think about it, if all things supernatural were explained to us in detail, would we still consider them supernatural events ? If  GOD teached us ,on how he created the universe, would we still considered him a god, after that ?So i like to view the LOST HIGHWAY as a very,very good, non-declared science fiction movie. Even if it isn´t, this movie is a much better sci-fi film than all the ones that have been made in the last ten years ! Want subliminar and parallel realities ? Watch LOST HIGHWAY, it´s better than THE MATRIX, and much more inteligent too. I know i must be an idiot, for giving such an explanation to this story, but, hey, at least i don´t hate this movie just  because i can´t understand it.A brilliant movie ! 11 out of 10.

The point of the movie is to make you think and open up your imagination. when you finish the movie, you have to sit for a while and try to piece together how the characters connect with each other, but there's no possible way that can be done because Lynch purposely didn't put enough information into the film for you to figure that out.

This movie uses a lot of a literary term, I think its shades?

The devil (Robert Blake) loves to play people like chess pieces. He also, however, likes to push people to their limit while getting them to fight one another in a sort of every man for himself warpath. In his latest game, so-to-speak, he uses a mafia-type dirty old man (Robert Loggia) to carry out his deeds. When the man finds out that his girlfriend (Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him with a mechanic, he wants to kill him. This arouses the devil and because he is unhappy with his right-hand man or unsatisfied with him for whatever reasons, (they don't tell us that), he finds another. This man, (Bill Pullman) chosen to replace his right-hand mafia-type guy, is a twin of the mechanic, who is also involved with the twin of his right-hand man's girlfriend, which only makes the game that more fun for the devil- he constantly says, it's been a pleasure speaking with you. The movie opens with the middle of the story, then jumps to the beginning, when Pullman is switched with his twin, the mechanic, to confuse us more. As the story unfolds, just as the devil's right-hand man was pissed that the mechanic was having an affair with his girlfriend, likewise is the twin of the mechanic when he finds out that the right-hand mafia-type guy is having an affair with HIS girlfriend. But what they don't realize is that they're two girls (we even see two different girls in the picture at the devil's rich friend's house)- one married and one a porno-whore, both twins of the other. Pullman winds up finding the guy who he thinks has been cheating on his wife and kills the man- the devil's right-hand mafia-type guy. When the devil sees how this game has ended, maybe he even predicted the results beforehand, he is pleased with Pullman and lets him live. However, now Pullman has the moral responsibility of carrying out the devil's deeds and when he is chased by the police, the devil rescues him into his hell by bringing him through his lost highway once more. What I mean by twin is not the literal meaning. I mean certain people (maybe only those who adhere to evil) or every person on earth have partners, special connections to others. They could look the same (as was the case of Arquette) or could look completely different (as was the case with Pullman.) Either way, when answering the evil-call, hence the devil, himself, you pass through the lost highway, a place which takes you through evilness and to transform or change places with your twin.

Although all of Lynch's characters (even in Blue Velvet, the closest he ever came to an exception) are really just thinly-disguised expressions of his own ideas. A Lynch film is never about realism. That will keep Lost Highway from becoming incredibly memorable, but it doesn't make it awful in and of itself.In a sense, he seems to be doing on a bigger budget what he did with Eraserhead--return to a deep fear of sexual suspicion, paranoia, male insecurity and control (or a lack thereof.) The sudden division in the middle between the two protagonists is not all that derailing, if you concentrate on what the movie is trying to say rather than attempting to explain how it can possibly say it (when a man is condemned to death . . . ) The ultimate question in the movie is whether that suspicion and insecurity is inevitable or preventable--whether, in other words, Pullman's character could have heeded his own warning. There are more reasons to see this movie than not see it the fantastic direction (although, as someone who grew up on MTV, I have to admit that some of it seems a little too close to shuddery video goth-noir), the bits of memorable dialogue (it is not my custom to go where I am not wanted) and that occasional moment of clarity when you think you've finally got it.

Writer-director David Lynch, working with Barry Gifford on the writing, dared to create a story drawn from as much from intuition and artistic energy as from meticulous staging and cinematic crafts of a high order. Lynch knows the making of a movie from A to Z. He knows the cinematic artistic vocabulary and how to use it. Combine these skills with his willingness to go way out on a limb in story, and the result is a masterpiece. Lynch knows exactly how long a shot should be held to achieve the result he wants. He knows exactly how he wants the set to look and how it is to be lit. The lighting and color in this movie are tailored perfectly to the story and desired effects. Lynch draws from the capable cast precisely the ambiguities and delineations of character and circumstance that he wants. Lynch is in perfect control of his craft and this film, but he also has tapped into creative levels that are less controlled and more intuitive. Cinematic intelligence plus intuitive artistic depth, the combination is dynamite.The amnesia and the traumas of war that appear in enough classic noirs to be noticeable have morphed into identity issues and serious pathologies of the mind in neonoirs. Lost Highway is deeply into the latter. The protagonist, Bill Pullman, clearly has serious problems of the mind. The story can only be understood when this is realized. The story appears to be told objectively from outside Pullman's mind but its flow can only be grasped by realizing that we are participating in his subjective dreams, delusions and fashionings of reality. Lynch has said that creatively he drew some inspiration from what he conceived to be the state of mind and denial of reality on the part of O.J. Simpson.Lost Highway is also in some respects as much a horror movie as it is a neo-noir. It has a number of shocks of action and setting akin to what occur in a horror movie. It has a Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who is a devilish figure. Even its gangster-type porno film producer, Robert Loggia, has a strong devilish aspect. The story has a mutation of Bill Pullman into another character, Balthazar Getty, within a locked death row cell, and this has a supernatural connotation. The sets throughout are typically unreal looking and foreboding. Then there is the doppelganger aspect that comes in with both Pullman and Patricia Arquette. But in the final analysis, there are no supernatural elements in this movie. There are creations of Pullman's troubled mind that bring forth a highly distorted view of reality that seems demonic and oppressive.Neo-noir is proving to be an approach to stories and cinematic story-telling that is very rich in its possibilities. Lost Highway brings to mind other films that plumb depths, such as Cache (2005), I Stand Alone (1998), and Shutter Island (2010), but there are many more including sci-fi stories whose common thread is a high degree of dislocation of the protagonist. Disturbances have occurred that displace the hero from a normal or usual state. This condition of dislocation is also common to noir films. The story-telling techniques complement the theme of displacement from the usual. Critic Mark T. Conard has written of noir's ...general mood of dislocation and bleakness... This dislocation is clearly present to a high degree in Lost Highway.

It is only an explanation FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. And since you have already seen it I will skip telling the story and only decode it for you.The real backdrop of the movie is this a man has murdered his wife on suspicion of infidelity. He is sentenced to death by electrocution. While in prison he creates a flashback and a flash-forward. The movie runs linearly through these mental compositions, beginning with the flashback and ending in the flash-forward. The flashback is the man's attempt to understand how he ended up in prison. He then creates a flash-forward to project a fantasy. The flashback informs the flash-forward and both are entirely informed by the reality that led the man to commit the murder in the first place.FLASHBACK The first 40 minutes or so of the movie are the flashback. In this Fred lives with his wife Renee, who he believes is cheating on him. Hints that this is unarguably a mental construct are 1) Renee is constantly in heels, even when she is in a nightgown and fresh out of bed. 2) The video tapes. 3)The mystery man. Renee is constructed as a seductress. The videotapes are messages from the murderer's subconscious trying to tell him he murdered his wife. The mystery man is an embodiment of jealousy/rage whom the murderer himself let into his house. Fred tells the detectives, I like to remember things in a particular way. This flashback leads him to where he actually is; in prison.FLASH-FORWARD In this fantasy he is the exact opposite of Fred. He is Pete, young, reckless, wild, and cuckolding another, much stronger man (Laurent). The woman is the same person as his wife in the flashback except in this flash-forward fantasy she is won by him (Pete) and ALSO more explicitly imagined as an out-of-control prostitute/amateur porn star/nymphomaniac who ultimately wants to be with him. The mystery man as embodiment of rage/jealousy first appears in this phase as the cuckolded Laurent's friend. When Pete kills Andy and he and Alice escape to the shed where they copulate successfully - even though at the end Alice tells Pete (who by now visually transforms into Fred) you can never have me because in reality she is dead. But then Alice disappears and the mystery man sends Fred back to the motel to abduct and ultimately kill Laurent. He in fact helps Fred kill Laurent after showing Laurent what Laurent is being killed for through the mystery man's video-phone. In this sense the mystery man is not specifically the murderer's jealousy/rage but jealousy/rage in general (hence appearing by Laurent when Laurent suspects he is being cuckolded). At the end Fred returns to his apartment and lets Fred from the opening scene (flashback Fred) know that Laurent is dead. This isn't a resolution of a through-line but hints at the loop in the murderer's mind where he will probably go over different variations of these two mental compositions over and over as he awaits his electrocution. In the real sequence of events the murderer probably suspected his wife of sleeping with a Laurent. After killing her in a fit of madness, his subconscious attempts to tell him what happened (in the flashback, through the videotapes) while in the flash-forward his imagination/fantasy constructs elaborate characteristics of the two objects of his jealousy/rage Laurent as a tough gangster whom he cuckolds and kills (this is his mind saying I banged your girl and killed you mofo - ultimate revenge), and Renee as a nymphomaniac with overly transgressive sexual inclinations (this is his mind saying man, she loved me but boy was she a slut). In either case the mystery man is the embodiment of jealousy/rage.

It is split into two stylistically and narratively distinct halves. The first half is easily the best of the two. It unfolds like a minimalist horror movie, as Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette slink around their dark apartment, with suspicions of infidelity between them and unnerving appearances of a seemingly omniscient mystery man. While even this superior first half has none of the soulfulness that makes even the most bizarre of Lynch's works truly great, it is sleek and stylish, and Lynch has never used his knack for suspense to better effect. The scene with the mystery man at the party is utterly unforgettable - the kind of warped, genuinely scary scene that only could have come from the mind of David Lynch.After about an hour, Lost Highway dramatically and abruptly switches gears. The second half is more akin to one of Lynch's previous films, Wild at Heart - it's grotesquely violent and sexual, a darkly comic film noir on acid. And also like Wild at Heart, there are indelible moments of surrealism and twisted genius in Lost Highway's last act, but it all seems far too soulless, affected and meaningless in its depravity. The violence and nudity becomes tiring, and just seems like Lynch showing off - I craved more of the subdued eeriness that permeated the first half. It's unfortunate, because Lost Highway does seem to be pursuing genuinely interesting themes in the last half - ones that Lynch would cover more fully and poignantly in Mulholland Drive a few years later. If seen as a sort of dry run for the masterful Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway's shortcomings become a bit more forgivable. As is, Lost Highway is a fascinating mess, sometimes offensive and sometimes head-scratching, but often brilliant and always intriguing.

An invitation to your house.","Date":"17 December 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Lost Highway is my 2nd favourite David Lynch film. Unlike Eraserhead, which before also puzzled audiences, Lost Highway has a ratio of meaning that is just right. It desires to be analyzed. It is also his most frightening film. It is perhaps a film that you do not want to invite into your living room. My strategy to describe this movie is as before, to decide first of all what is real, and then what is not real. Lynch told audiences that this movie is about the OJ Simpson case. He was puzzled with the notion that a person can walk away from a crime, seemingly capable of forgetting that he did it. The way I see it, the central character in Lost Highway has a split identity, triggered by murdering his girlfriend. As a grown up this character has the identity Fred Madison (someone who likes to remember things his own way, not necessarily how it happened), a saxophone player, played by Bill Pullman. Fred murders his girlfriend Renee Madison, played by Patricia Arquette, and ends up in jail. (But, for all that you know he was already in jail, for murdering her the first time. I don't know.) The 24 year old younger Fred is Peter Dayton, a mechanic, played by Balthazar Getty. Pete falls in love with one of the shop's main customer's (Mister Eddy, also known as Dick Laurent) girlfriend. The girlfriend is Alice, again played by Patricia Arquette. Mister Eddy is smooth as 'sh*t from a duck's ass' and on the wrong side of the law, with an abhorrence of tailgating. He and Andy are making porn/snuff films, with Alice as one of the actresses. My assumption is that Pete ends up killing Alice. The truth grid of the story is thus the following The main character, Pete Dayton, kills his girl friend because he can never fully have her, and keeps re imagining himself and her in fragments of the truth. He keeps re inventing the situation. Everything that does not stick to the grid is fabrications of Pete in his attempt to forget and re invent, and part of the process Lynch follows. I'm going to highlight some important aspects of the film. Pete gets very likely jealous of Alice at one point. She asks him Do you still want me Pete? and tells him then But, you can never have me. One never actually sees Pete murder Alice. My point is that what is happening, is kind off similar to what we have in Solaris. The beloved personality returns. No matter how many times Pete/Fred murders her, she always returns. In his mind, she might appear like twin sisters in a portrait. She doubles up like Dolly. If this movie would have continued, it could have opened with another manifestation of Fred, now middle age, and Patricia Arquette returning as his fixation. It is the obsession of a man that can never 'have her'. Fred meets a freaky looking mystery man played by Robert Blake at a party of Renee. The mystery man told Fred that they have met before, at Fred's house, and that he was invited into Fred's house by Fred himself, It is not my custom to go where I am not invited. This is likely because Fred has murdered before, as the younger man, Pete. However, the mystery man said the same thing to Pete We have met before, haven't we. We all know Lynch use mantra like phrases that reappear thru out his films. But I think this could reflect on the relativity theory and on the nature of time; on the configuration of Lost Highway, and likely of evil in itself. Pete invites evil into his house when he ends up murdering Alice, with the result that he is also then introduced to it at an earlier stage, to 'back up' the present. That is why he has met the mystery man before he even murdered Alice. The past is altered, and his parents, having watched parts of it, are 'lost for words'. It is kind off interesting that Fred decides to leave himself a message on his house intercom Dick Laurent is dead. I think the mystery man whispered that in his ear, after Mister Eddy is killed. Linearly that is a tough part to explain, because the cops show up at that point. It might just fall thru the truth grid. It could be fabrication.I'd like to add some references to Transendental Meditation (a process Lynch follows) here. The mantra needs to be repeated as easily as thoughts; as easily as thoughts manifest in your mind. It needs to float thru one's mind as effortlessly as clouds. I like to think here of the density of Patricia Arquette's words. Her voice has an ethereal quality. It must have appeared to Pete like utter magic on the phone. (Floating like smoke thru the holes in the receiver) It must have been an invitation that was inescapable. Meet me at the Starlight Hotel at Sycamore, in 20 minutes But her tease proved to be ultimately too much for him. Miaaw miaaw. It's me. I can't see you tonight The film has spectacular moments. One of them is when Mister Eddy had Alice at his house the first time. This is one of my all time favourite scenes. Marilyn Manson's I've put a spell on you in the background. A fire blazing in the fireplace and Alice in her black underwear, sensually, and uncertainly awaiting Mister Eddy's orders. Mister Eddy's small nod for Alice, to approach him. The gun against her head. And, Pete asking her, So, why didn't you just leave? You've must have liked it.

There's always some paranoia in the air, and nothing is what it seems. The camera-work sometimes reminds me of Kubrick's Shining, as it flows ghostly forward, almost like spying the main characters. There are many, very dark sequences, but sometimes Lynch throws in some actual comedy-noir, that might seem a little out of place for some.Also, Lost Hightway could be considered as a quite mature film, as there's a lot of nudity, violence and other wickedness that's not very suitable for children (that's why it probably received R/18+ ratings almost everywhere). The music is excellent as always, there are some compositions by A. Badalamenti, as well as contributions from such artists as T. Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Marilyn Manson, who also did a cameo in the film.A lot of talk has been about the plot, and how it makes sense. There indeed is a golden string to be followed, but i think the only person who really knows the final solution (as there probably is no such thing) is Lynch himself.After all, a film way above your average thriller, and shouldn't be considered as such.

Lost Highway already has a masters in sound FX, making sound and music a different language to guide the mood of the movie, actually, without the personality of Lynch's Music selection and sound FX, his movies would lack a considerable amount of drama content. i'm not blaming the movie to be so hard to understand, Lynch now vision to produce surrealist films had to have a first step, and that was Lost Highway, landing, of course, in Mulholland Dr. Masterpiece. The characters in Lost Highway work like symbols interacting between each other, producing in the audience feeling from their real life.

Lost Highway is an inspired piece of complicated story telling and weird characters. What the film lacks in sense, it makes up for with depth, visual gratification and style. Lynch bases his films on imagery and Lost Highway is very powerful on this front, with full intent to shock and excite the audience. Even for those who are not fans of this genre, Lost Highway is definitely an experience.As well as having one of the most talented and creative film makers there is, Lost Highway also boasts a very strong cast. Bill Pullman gives a great, almost sedated, performance, parading a great range of jealousy, rage, desperation and love. This is the Bill Pullman we want not President alien killer! Balthazar Getty is a little out of his depth in this film but comes across very well as a passionate, confused character. Patricia Arquette gives the best performance in the film; playing two characters. She is sexual yet lovable, vulnerable but domineering and caring yet selfish. Her role is so challenging and intense but Arquette raises the material with her performance. This is the role that put Arquette in the leading lady category and she's never looked back since. The rest of the cast is a mix of the weird and wonderful, ensuring Lost Highway is packed full of imagination.This film is the pinnacle of David Lynch's career and it is amazing that after Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart that Lynch has managed to keep being so creative. No one can match Lynch on imagination and visual flair, not even Terry Gilliam or David Cronenberg, and it is these elements that give Lost Highway that something special. Lost Highway does suffer from being a little over confusing and it is questionable whether it is possible to understand this film at all but it really doesn't matter. The plot manipulation is second to none and ensures the audience is never comfortable, exactly how Lynch planned it. Lynch is notorious for making dark films and they don't come much darker than this. Lost Highway is definitely not for the faint hearted and goes to great efforts to explore voyeurism, jealousy, power and the grotesque.One of the truly great films, Lost Highway is an explosion on the eyes and brain that is so powerful, that it overcomes confusion. There is a strong theme about the walls of reality closing in, and I like that very much. By far, David Lynch's best film, one of the films of the 90s. "},{"Title":"Lynch seems to have solved his problems with 'endings'","Date":"24 November 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" As David Foster Wallace has noted, Lynch has always been much better at getting past the viewer's defenses and into the viewer's head than he is at telling a cohesive, satisfying story once he's in there. Twin Peaks is the prime example of this weakness...the series invoked so many enigmas, mysteries, and disturbing questions in its opening episodes and in its 'middle acts' that the audience was agog to find out how it all 'ended'...only to discover that Lynch didn't really know how to end it, and so the whole thing trailed off with an unconvincing fizzle. However, in his recent films, Lynch and his collaborators seem to have overcome this problem by presenting their stories as an objectification of a disturbed mind's subjective fears and desires. In other words, SOMETHING in the real world has happened to affect the protagonist, but what that something is almost impossible to say...and in fact it is often almost impossible to tell who the protagonist is. Someone is crazy here, but who? So the brilliance of Lost Highway is in the way that this approach plays to Lynch's strengths as a story teller. The themes of alienation in the relationship or the marriage, of sexual discontent and longing, of infidelity, of threatened violence and actual murder...they keep recurring in both of the main characters' lives. But the viewer knows something is wrong, because the majority of events in the plot range from odd and disturbing - to highly improbable - to simply impossible in the 'normal' physical world. So it becomes obvious that the plot is following horrid dream logic, but the question is, whose dream is it, and why this particular dream? By building the story this way, by refusing to explicitly answer that question, and by never actually explicitly mentioning that denial, illusion, mental illness, hallucination or false memories could be a factor (unlike the recent Hellraiser sequels, Jacob's Ladder or Sixth Sense) Lost Highway takes the story into the nightmare realm of the most glumly mystical Kafka stories such as Metamorphosis or The Trial. In this mode of story telling, Lynch doesn't HAVE to resolve the story, he just has to be clever and sensitive enough to immerse the viewer in the circular logic and magical thinking of a disturbed mind in a fugue state. And he does that here with all his usual panache. The actual execution of the film is just what fans have come to expect and love about Lynch's work. You could even call it pure golden Lynch. Robert Loggia and Robert Blake are superb in their roles, embodying menace and creepiness in ways few actors can hope to equal. Bill Pullman also gives the performance of his career here (too bad it didn't do his career more good). The soundtrack, the costumes, the sets (especially Pullman/Fred's apartment), the photography...everything comes together to pull the viewer into a narcoleptic fog of smoldering desire, hopelessness, muted fear and alienation. I assume that's what viewers of Lynch's films are after, anyway. I have to admit, this one turned me into a fan. But I should qualify that admission in one way. I saw Mullholland Drive before I saw this ,and MH may have helped condition my perceptions and taste for this kind of story. Lynch fans will love it. Polanski, Fellini, and Kurasawa fans will probably love it too. Movie goers who think that the sun rises and sets on Micheal Bay...maybe not so much.

Pete and Alice elope to the desert, where Alice disappears and Pete turns back into Fred. Fred finds the mobster in a motel with Renee (apparently alive), takes him out to the desert and kills him. After that, things get a bit strange ...The plot summary above doesn't really begin to do justice to Lost Highway, which is spooky, confusing, extremely stylish and a lot of fun. I don't really think I understood the story but I'm pretty sure I wasn't really supposed to either - once you get rid of cinema conventions like someone can only be in one place at a time, there's a lot of creative enjoyment to be had messing with both the characters and the audience. It's a great fever dream of a film (like Performance or Fitzcarraldo), where the slightly surreal ambiance creates a hypnotic echoing effect that sucks you into the movie. It's also a fabulous cinematic treatment, almost an exercise in clever and rarely-used techniques - daringly underexposed and overexposed shots, grainy video footage, image mosaics, reversed scenes, etc, all accompanied by stunning sound design which frequently crashes from whispered dialogue into deafening music cues. The cast have great fun with their roles, particularly Arquette (frequently in some state of undress), Loggia as the nasty gangster and Blake as the truly bizarre Mystery Man. My only criticism of this movie is the ending, which is okay, but doesn't really begin to answer any of the questions (are Fred and Pete one and the same, are Renee and Alice one and the same, who sends the videotapes, does Fred die, does Renee die, and most importantly, why is anyone doing what they are doing). A mystifying but marvellous picture from the unique David Lynch. And remember - never tailgate Robert Loggia !

Of course like most of Lynch's work, Lost Highway has lots and lots of sex and violence. At times the material is such a hard R rating that it feels almost NC-17. It's like David Lych has taken someone's nightmare and filmed it. Bill Pullman plays Fred, a saxophone player who is constantly being stocked by the creepy Robert Blake. He receives a strange box on his porch, the box contains a video with footage of him and his wife (Rosanna Arquette) sleeping. The mysterious character (Blake) claims to know him. Ironically Fred's wife is murdered. (and no it wasn't Blake who did it)(well in the movie at least). All kidding aside, Fred is accused of the murder and put on death row. He has a blackout and wakes up as a completely different person, Peter. Peter is a young twenty something mechanic who has ties with the mob. In the film, the two characters morph back and forth into either Fred or Pete. Either way both guys are wanted by the law. So I felt that basically this guy is trapped in a parallel, switching back and forth into each body. It's like he's stuck on an endless highway, a hell that keeps going full force into nowhere. This is just my perspective. I could be way off. Oh hell, who am I kidding? I'll have to watch this film 3 more times. See what films like this do. They make me think too much.

By European standards, it is not slow at all. If you ever listened to 'Phase patterns' by Steve Reich, you've heard four organs playing patterns and then getting out of control until they all interact and all you can hear is harmonics; listen to it with some friends and you'll see that nobody hears the same melody. This movie does the exact same thing. The whole fun of it is to check out what other people saw and/or understood. Here's what I think I understood after three viewings (in the light of Mulholland Drive which is very similar) the whole movie is a flashback. On the verge of dying in the Chair, Fred relives his whole life. But he sees it as he remembers it, not how it actually happened (he says it himself). That is why it starts with 'Dick Laurent is dead' although he is not dead yet; he knows he will die because he's already lived the story. He changes all sorts of things, starting with himself. Instead of an older sexually inadequate murderer, he is a young, virile and innocent man. But reality haunts him (like in MD), in the form of the Mystery Man - Evil - who tells him that when you're sentenced to death, you cannot escape (reality). You have to accept that Evil can take the form of an actual man (like Bob in Twin Peaks). Which is why when Fred disappears into the dark side of his house (of himself), he reappears as two men (there are two shadows), one kills his wife, the other one puts it on film (his memory?). Or maybe Pete is really a younger Fred - everything in the second part of the movie seems less 90's looking than the first half. Except the music... But while Pete is dancing with Sheila in the dance hall, the music is fast, but everybody's dancing a slow, so he's changed the music in his mind. Or wait, maybe... Damn, let's face it, I didn't understand anything about this movie. Yet I've enjoyed it. Which is what makes it so great.

I found LHW on DVD recently in a local shop for $20 (Australian) and bought it because I suspected I'd want to watch the film at least twice. After viewing LHW the other week for the very first time, I know I will be watching the film again and again because it is a masterpiece of horror, paranoia and bizarreness. Purchasing LHW for $20 was an absolute bargain in my opinion! Lynch creates mysteries which may be difficult to comprehend, but are so beautifully surreal and brilliantly compelling that whether or not you get the story doesn't really matter. He creates scenes, dialogue and visuals which linger in the mind for weeks and months afterwards.Of course, Lynch's work is not to everyone's tastes so it's certainly okay to dislike LHW. It is a film where the plot and story jump between different realities and later, different realities start to clash together &#150; weird, weird stuff. It's definitely not `big bucket of pop-corn with extra butter' entertainment.Interestingly, I viewed LHW with a friend who is 15 years older and twice as intelligent as me. He actually doesn't really care for Lynch films because he believes that Lynch uses a lot of style, character and plot tricks to cover up rather mundane stories. In regards to the story of LHW, after the credits rolled he stated that the plot and story were actually very simplistic. He gave me his interpretation of the story which he said revolved around schizophrenia.I asked my friend about specific characters and specific events in the film (some of which went totally over my head), and he gave me logical and plausible explanations which I found both fascinating and disappointing at the same time.

If you think that telling a story is the most important thing on a movie, then you just don´t love art for what it really is. You´re ignoring almost a century of the surreal cinema begun by Buñuel and Dalí.As in other artistic manifestations such as painting, cinema just can´t be enclosed in the limits and boundaries of reason.

If you want, criticize the way he made the movie, i mean, the shots, and specially it is important to notice if the author achieved his goal.In Lost Highway, just as in the other David Lynch´s movies, the director keeps on working and goes even deeper in what has been the main topic of his career the development of mysteries.Lynch wants the audience to get surprised and to get involved with the mysteries he creates. He has said that it doesn´t matter if they are solved or not, because what is really important is the progression and confusion that mysteries can achieve. In fact, it is better for the audience not to get the solutions of the problems, because in that way, the movie will get them , they will feel confused and they will try to get their own conclusions.

Here with Lost Highway, he does it yet again. Lost Highway is probably his biggest headaches you'll ever experience. Nothing about this film is simple or easily understood, which is typical of Lynch, but while Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, or Wild at Heart are mildly comprehensible (I don't include Eraserhead because it seems obvious right from the beginning that that film was supposed to be more art than story), Lost Highway will literally require multiple viewings to even catch a glimmer of what is supposed to be going on.First of all, the plot...at least as best as I can make out. Fred Madison (Bill Pullman in one of his most divergent performances) is a jazz musician who has suspicions that his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) may be cheating on him. His suspicions are not aided by a series of mysterious videotapes being left at his door, showing him and his wife sleeping. After a strange encounter with a hideous pale man (Robert Blake at his scariest), he finds another videotape that shows him murdering his wife, and he is sent to deathrow. While in prison, somehow he disappears and becomes the much younger Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty). Pete's life is one of no complaints. He lives with his parents, he has a steady job as a mechanic, and he has a pretty girlfriend, and he gets sex whenever he wants. And then Mr. Eddy shows up (Robert Loggia), one of Pete's regulars, and a mob boss whose girlfriend Alice (Patricia Arquette...again) looks like a blond version of Fred's wife. He has an affair with her, and things start to unravel...Sound complicated? It should...because while it may take multiple viewings to piece together the nature of the plot, it seems easy to figure out that this film does not take place in the real world, but rather a translucent celluloid version of it. It looks like Los Angeles, but they never actually explicitly say that it is (despite one instance of an L.A.P.D. sign). From this, we can assume that the whole movie is a dream or fantasy...again, typical of Lynch. But whose fantasy? Fred's most likely...things start out somewhat normal, but they go bad very quick from a series of odd occurances (the videotapes, the strange man, and a strange unseen visitor who delivers an eerie message in the beginning of the film). When things are at their bleakest, he is replaced by Pete Dayton, who suffers s similar turn of events, although completely different...but it does seem clear that both suffer their downfall because of Renee/Alice. Are Renee and Alice the same person? Are Fred and Pete the same person? Is the man in black real or is he representative of something evil (well of course, but whose evil)? Ultimately, the answers are not so clearcut, and the film leaves the viewer with enough clues to figure out their own explanation, but still never be satisfied with it.Lynch once said that this film takes place in the same world as Twin Peaks, and in some ways it's easy to see how. The fact that Renee is brunette and Alice is blond mirrors Sheryl Lee's characters of the blond Laura and the brunette Maddy in Twin Peaks, the whole nature of Robert Blake's character reminds us of Killer Bob, though Blake's character's motivations are slightly more obscure. And while this may be a trivial comparison, the story starts with one pair of detectives, and introduces a second pair later...eventually bringing the two together, not unlike the FBI agents in Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me. The references to Wild at Heart are also rampant, but this is perhaps due to Barry Gifford's cowriting credit. The black car, the character of Andy (who resembles Willem Dafoe's character in Wild at Heart), one could have a field day comparing the imagery of this film to that of other Lynch films.After all is said and done, Lost Highway is a film that will mess with your sensibilities and leave you wondering what the hell is going on, doing a complete 360 just when you think you've figured it out. It is not a film for all audiences...not because of its content, which is no more violent or sex-ridden than any other Hollywood offering...what makes it a difficult film to watch is its very avant-garde nature, the lack of anything really explicit in the story or the characters. Be ready to think, and be ready to have your brain hurt when you watch this film.

It's just that it is systematic in an incredibly innovative way.  At first, it might all seem random and jumbled, and the interactions might seem trivial, but once you figure out how the film works, everything falls into place and resonates with meaning.(Spoilers)The film unfolds the inner workings of Fred's fears and fantasies regarding his wife Renee.  Fred fears that Renee does not want him, that he does not satisfy her, and that she is cheating on him.  Fred wants to possess Renee. Fred's fantasies and fears are full of contradictions, but here's how they play out Fred murders Renee; he's her virile lover and she can't get enough of him (portrayed through Pete and Alice); she's possessed by another man (Mr. Eddy) and she's a whore (as depicted through her relationship to Andy, the pornographic filmmaker); he catches her with another man and kills him, twice (first Andy, then Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent); she eludes his possession (I want you Alice./You'll never have me.).The film develops by means of the carefully orchestrated repetition and reconfiguration of thematic elements.  After revealing Fred's murderous desire to possess Renee, the film introduces doubles while inverting key characteristics Fred's an inadequate lover, Pete's a virile lover; Renee is unsatisfied, Alice is insatiable.  Through the doubles, implicit themes and dynamics are made explicit she's possessed by another man; she's a whore; he's threatened by the possessive 'other man' (literally, with a gun); he kills the man she's whoring herself with (Andy).  The character inversions are then exposed as lies driven by the truth that she eludes his possession (You'll never have me.; Her name is Renee!; And your name?.). Reintroducing the original characters, the concluding section replays and 'resolves' the plot's development Renee is with the possessive 'other man' (Mr. Eddy/Laurent); she's a whore (notice Renee in the porn clips); Fred murders Laurent while wearing his counterpart's virile clothes (Fred wears Pete's motorcycle jacket throughout the concluding section of the film). At the same time, the concluding section illustrates the contradictory outcomes of parts one and two of the film he has murdered her; she has eluded his possessive grasp.Far from being an unorganized or muddled mass of nonsense, Lost Highway skillfully repeats, reconfigures, and develops its themes in much the same way that a musical composition does, complete with three main sections exposition, development, and recapitulation.  But the genius of the film is in the details.  Pay very close attention to the way that images, music, and elements of the story are repeated.  I'll give two examples.First example Alice tells Pete about meeting Andy, just as Renee told Fred I met him at a place called Moke's. We became friends.  He told me about a job.  When Fred rather pointedly asks What job, Renee's somewhat delayed response is I don't remember.  The second time around, Fred's fears about Renee--namely, that she's a whore--are played out, to the *extreme*, through Alice's description of stripping at gunpoint and Pete's disgusted reaction (You liked it, huh?).  However, Alice is still able to seduce Pete, despite his whorish image of her--themes that will be taken up again at Andy's house and in the final scene between Pete and Alice (at the cabin).Second example Fred's explosive and virile sax performance, which Renee shows no interest in (supposedly she stayed home to read, but no one answers when Fred calls home), is repeated twice.  Images of Fred playing sax are replayed *without the sound* as Fred remembers Renee leaving one of his performances with another man (Andy).  Things have become more explicit Renee is shown with another man, and Fred's sax playing has been deprived of its potency.  Immediately after this memory sequence, Fred and Renee have sex, and Fred's sexual performance leaves Renee unsatisfied and cold, which in turn provokes Fred's response of anxiety and revulsion.  Later in the film, immediately after Pete and Sheila have passionate sex, the audio from the sax solo plays over the radio at Arnie's garage, and Pete, disturbed by the music, changes the station.  Pete doesn't need a substitute for sexual virility, but on the other hand, Pete *is* a virile substitute--for Fred. The return of the audio plays on the contradictions of Pete's dual status as virile lover and virile substitute.These are just two examples.  The film contains dozens of meaningfully organized repetitions and juxtapositions.  That is how it tells its story.One point deserves some clarification.  A lot of confusion revolves around the following question does Fred turn into Pete, or is that just in his head?  The film intentionally allows both interpretations, so don't rack your brain trying to figure out which interpretation is the right one. Just pick one and stick with it for the duration of the film.  But unless you want to adventure into a plot that violates the law of non-contradiction (with the reintroduction of Renee after her murder), I recommend the it's just in his head interpretation.  On the other hand, it is by following Lost Highway into the plot of open contradictions, where contradictory fears and fantasies come to their realization, that the film offers its boldest and, in some ways, most remarkable innovations.  Try the film both ways, but not simultaneously.As for the Mystery Man. what is his role in all this?  I'll leave that question open to your interpretation.Along with its neo-noir beauty and its powerfully atmospheric score, Lost Highway combines an innovative use of sound and image with a groundbreaking plot that develops by means of ingeniously organized repetitions and doublings.  Easily the most innovative and masterful film of the 90s, Lost Highway sets new standards for what can be achieved through the medium of film 10/10.

Fortunately, at that point Robert Loggia and Eric Chavez (Golden Glove third baseman for the Oakland A's) come along and really put the movie into gear, making the rest of the film thoroughly enjoyable. We see lots of Lynch's familiar motifs - stuff catching on fire, red velvet drapes contrasted with flashes of blue light, the non-linear structure he would later use in Mulholland Drive. Also among these these motifs we see here is the use of one incredibly creepy dude (here played superbly by Robert Blake, in the tradition of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet and that troll hanging out behind Denny's, I mean Winkie's, in Mulholland Drive.)For me, Lost Highway really feels not so much of a great movie itself as an interesting evolutionary point in David Lynch's moviemaking on the way to his masterpiece, Mulholland Drive.  It's definitely worth seeing if you're already a big Lynch fan; if you're just looking for something of his to watch, you'd be better off with Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart or Mulholland Drive.

The reason is that it is entertaining on the one hand, but also subtle on the other hand.If you know other movies of mastermind David Lynch, you won't be surprised about the strange story which seems to be senseless at the first view. When I first watched the movie, I was absolutely fascinated. I was so excited about how everything is explained at the end, but the end only gives a short clue and no explanation. So during the first watch the movie creates an unbearable tension.This is also supported by Lynch's brilliant Direction. The majority of the story is only told by images and not by dialogues. Especially in the first about 40 minutes nearly nobody is speaking. Although the movie creates a intense, dark atmosphere, which let's you feel the upcoming menace.After the first part the movie continues a little bit more usual, there are more dialogues and the whole setting is brighter. But in the end the mood and the kind of story telling of the beginning returns, and this time it's even more intense.This was the first level the second level is the interpretation. There are lots of proper interpretations for the movie and I think David Lynch won't make a movie without a message to enkrypt. So after watching the movie for the first time, you can watch it again a few times maybe with a friend to talk about possible interpretations. In my eyes this is as much fun as enjoy the film for the first time. Now you can see how subtle this movie really is.These points make the movie a brilliant artfull masterpiece, which is set in the right mood by director David Lynch and his proper cast.

But the story of murderous jealousy - as fascinating in itself as it may be - is only the start of a more than disquieting film experience.The trip into a murderer's head that Lynch takes us on unfolds with a nagging set of repetitious appearances of themes, quotes and characters that can not be resolved by any viewer. On the surface more things in Lost Highway remain a mystery than are solved, but that's not just the way David Lynch likes it, but it's the way it should be - or are you always tying up all the knots in your fantasies?To be brief brilliant acting (especially by Arquette), perfect suspense, beautiful pictures, no solution - another puzzle without a definite picture by David Lynch and a great movie.

From his outlook on modern-day middle-class in Blue Velvet to his unique interpretation of isolation in Twin Peaks, the audience gets yet another look into Lynch's unforgettable world with the film Lost Highway. As with any other Lynch film, we're first introduced to an ordinary character who has very strong footing in reality. As events unfold in the film, we get to see the characters offer very real solutions in a very unrealistic world. The film is anything but straight-forward, but it's excellent.Directing is relatively typical for Lynch -- he picks strange lighting and unorthodox camera angles to illustrate how far away we really are from the ordinary. He never ceases to direct his actors, though, and for that, I have to give the man credit. He is able to effectively convey his understanding of atmosphere to his actors quite well. As for his ordinary endeavors, his talent really shines with story-telling. While definitely not a conventional film, it's certainly thought-provoking, and it never becomes stale and predictable. Actors in the film do quite well, actually. While giving out credit to people involved, a special mention must be made for the editing department. It's interesting how the editing in the film is actually used as part of the story-telling experience.Of course, Lynch isn't everybody's cup of tea. While this is a very good film, it's also very much a David Lynch film. It's definitely not for the squeamish or fans of films with linear plots. If you enjoyed other Lynch films, however, this one's pretty much a must. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Intriguing, yet infuriatingly vague","Date":"11 April 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" *possible minor spoiler, if you can indeed spoil this film*David Lynch is certainly one of the most interesting film directors of our time, and _Lost Highway_ certainly lives up to this.  Stylistically and thematically, it resembles _Eraserhead_, though that particular film is extremely straightforward by comparison.  Although the thematic elements and character changes are emphasized in _Lost Highway_, the film often piles on so many layers of symbolism and mystique that the film is lost forever to the casual viewer.  Even individuals such as myself who pay close attention to Lynch and have some awareness of his themes get confused by this film.  Probably the most daunting obstacle to understanding is the fact that Lynch works within his own little filmic conception of reality, in which time and memory are simply two suggested options rather than objective reference points in a story line.As some advice to those who may see the film, I offer this try looking at the film from the standpoint of personal relationships and how we think about them.

Fred looses it and kills his wife. He is convicted of murder and goes to jail. He escapes his prison cell through the ceiling and breaks out of jail. He tracks down Andy at his porno pimp pad, and kills him. Then he finds Dick Laurent in a motel room having sex. He captures him, drives him out to the desert and shoots him to death.

Fred has a mental problem that has put him in a state of confusion. He's gone insane, and so he keeps seeing all these different possible realities about what happened. Fred states that he doesn't like video cameras because he likes to remember things in his own way, not how they actually happened.

David Lynch made that fugue concrete because Fred really morph into another person the young Pete. From now on the main character of the film is Pete (narration twist) and the viewer watch Pete/Fred's life. But Fred's past will always follow him.

This strange man's behavior resembles Mephisto's in many ways. He says that he only comes when he is called and this means that Fred suspects his wife of having deceived him and therefore wants to repay her for it. Fred and the strange man make somehow a deal and the strange man gets Fred's soul at the end, when it becomes obvious that both have a bizarre deal. Before the strange man appears for the first time you hear a dog barking in Fred and Renee's neighborhood. That is a further parallel to Goethe's Faust where the devil, Mephisto, appears as a dog before he contacts Faust. In one scene at the beginning of the film, when Fred already suspects his wife, he asks Who the hell owns this dog? I think that the word hell is more likely chosen very carefully than a pure accident.

What LH shows is the psychological story Fred makes up a story that he actually believes in.

I'll admit that the first time I viewed it, I squirmed.  In fact, I think I may have dozed off somewhere in the mid-section (appropriate since the film takes on a dream/nightmare-like quality).  I would've probably written this film off like the majority of the world, but I started to realize that I couldn't shake off this movie. Damn, it won't leave me.  Certain images and scenes set-up tent and camped out in my psyche.  (So, after re-reading my mangled copy  of Crime and Punishment, and after watching the E! True Hollywood Story on O.J., I came to reassess my opinion of Lost Highway and decided to reassess this film).Be forewarned, SPOILER plot-points (and one viewer's interpretation) are forthcoming...I think it's a genius-move on Lynch's part to make a film about the power of denial, set in Los Angeles - a surreal city notorious for crushing the dreams and reality of its citizenry. I'm sure many can relate to that, but don't want to necessarily be reminded of it at their local Cineplex Odeon. But I don't mind it, because there's real beauty to find in this film's surreal brutality.  I'm sure most of us wonder how a person (a seemingly normal, successful person) could murder.  If there was any grain of interest to the O.J. trial, it was that.  This experience was like hanging out in the headspace of O.J. for two hours.  After all, we're talking about a successful man, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman or O.J., take your pick) who can't take responsibility for killing his wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette). And rather than look at the truth, it's better to create a whole new life/fantasy while stagnating in jail.  Enter Pete (Balthazar Getty), Fred's doppelganger.  But Fred/Pete can't escape the truth.  Everything and everyone that Fred tries to forget re-emerges in his new reality, Pete's reality.  Thus, the descent into Hell, or Fred's Lost Highway is neverending.This is heady stuff.  This interpretation (one of many - but a good starting point for most) lends itself to the idea that one must be open to seeing this film MORE THAN ONCE in order to truly have an experience.  It's too deceptively easy to dismiss, but there's a lot here to embrace.  How many filmmakers out there are doing movies like this?  A true movie about a thinking man's insanity, starring a cast of scarred psyches (Gary <motorcycle-rehab> Busey, Balthazar <strained family history> Getty, Natasha Gregson (daughter of drowned mother, Natalie Wood> Wagner, Richard <Parkinson's> Pryor, Robert <publicized breakdown> Blake, etc.).  These choices were no accident.  This film is an incredible work of art.  It may not be for most since it is HARSH, but no one should deny its understanding of what drives sensible people over the edge.Not many films nowadays can really pull that off.And as for entertainment value, I can watch Robert Loggia smacking around the tailgator until the end of time.

Lost Highway, though, is a flawed masterpiece, the best attempt yet at a completely non-linear plot in a major movie. Discussing it without spoilers is hard, but I'll try not to give away anything too specific.The biggest problem with Lost Highway is that it starts so slowly and with such bizarre performances; there are good reasons for this, but today we're spoon-fed so many stupid blockbusters where everything is explained so that even a two-year-old could understand, and we've forgotten that some movies actually expect a little thought on the part of the audience.Most people who watch it think 'well, this is just another good-looking pointless Lynch movie with no plot'. A character changes completely in the middle of the movie, and that can't mean anything, it's just weird. A man pistol-whips a tailgater, that's weird, but it can't mean anything. All kinds of weird things happen... but they can't mean anything, they're just weird. The back-cover blurb on my video copy must be the most Clintonesque ever written; it's a precisely accurate description of what happens on screen, yet tells you almost nothing important.Once you get beyond that point and accept that the movie does have a plot, it's pretty easy to follow. The key occurs early on, when Fred talks about his hatred of video cameras I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened. Almost the entire movie exists entirely inside his head, only the videotapes are objectively real; everything else is his memories, remembered the way he wanted to remember them. He tries to avoid his fate by imagining himself as someone completely different, but no matter how hard he tries, his past comes back to haunt him. The rest of the weirdness is telling the audience one thing this is not real; but follow the links between the different imagined events and the reality behind them soon becomes clear.Oddly, most of the movie-makers I know understood it straight away, and most of the movie-watchers thought it was just weird. Certainly this movie should be required viewing for anyone in the creative side of the movie business simply because it shows how much more we can do with the film medium; Joyce utterly destroyed the necessity of linear plots in literature decades ago, it's about time movies caught up.(And if you don't believe me, go read some of Barry Gifford's interviews).

And he stunned me every time when I saw one of his movies. Only a handful of directors could manage that; David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, Akira Kurosawa. Im not talking about directors that made 2 or 3 epic movies in their entire lifetime. I'm talking about directors who have changed the way, format and concept of telling a story, in a time that was unusual for the time and place. Most of their movies left me either stunned, head filled with questions and/or pondering every now and then if I finally found a connection where I didn't see one. This movie is all that. I will not try to tell you the story of the movie, 'cause I don't like to take away of the mystery that the movie deserves. One of the things I realized early on is, if I read the story on the back of a rented movie, or saw a long trailer of a movie, I would wait for those things in the movie to happen. It takes so much of the movie magic away. Therefor I like to read short plot lines and watch teasers instead of trailers hehe. Lucky me, Lynch's Lost Highway is on the menu. If there was a rating for a movie that told a story parallel to a subconscious story, in my opinion this movie should be on the top 3 list of all time. I'm that serious. I loved everything this movie had to offer; excellent acting by everyone, managed to get a crush on a stunning Patricia Arquette (maybe the most underrated actress out there), scenes were utterly brilliantly constructed (imprinted in my memory forever), dialogs left you always wondering what it meant and I was desperately looking for connections or clues that would give me more insight to the whole thing. For this you need a master like Lynch. I have watched Lost Highway every 2 years since then (but when it came out, 3 times that week) and every time I watch it, it radiates that odd atmosphere.

As deeply disturbing as the story is and as profoundly unsettling as the score is, and as outrageously bizarre as Robert Blake's character is, I was more hypnotized by the decor. What most haunts me about this astounding film is the strangely anthropomorphic home furnishings. End tables and cabinets and bed stands all seem to be desperately hugging the walls, fearfully cowering in tight, tense, anxious postures. Their surfaces are all sickly slick but also somehow oddly textured, like coiled reptiles. These unnatural objects and the distracted people moving around them seem to be biding their time, politely tolerating one another till at any moment one might suddenly confront the other. A meager wedge of a telephone caddy might lash out with its jutting crisp edge to lacerate an artery. Or a modest, compact divan might unhinge, invert and swallow a balancing sitter. These sculpted, tailored accessories contain great menacing dread. Wall treatments are densely saturated slabs of muted fleshy color, or columns of lush velvets, or pristine expanses of immaculate coolness. It's all presented as fashionable, trendy, tasteful, but their effect is anything but comforting. There's more than a hint of that pervasive late 50s early 60s chintz that so many people accepted as modern but was really only awkwardly camouflaged poverty. It's a look that many upwardly mobile hipsters unwittingly carried with them into their new improved mortgaged lives. A faint musty perfume of timid shame clings to everything. How David has embedded that repressed, cloying, lower middle class suburban experience within inanimate forms is remarkable.And the movie is pretty amazing too. It's a complex jigsaw that doesn't all fall into place till after it's over and you've sorted through the torrent of surreal paranoia. It does all line up, perfectly, but it takes considerable cerebral effort to get there. That experience of resolving this dark, grungy puzzle is more than half the pleasure as you are rewarded with a spectacularly lucid, logical story that is equal to if not superior to any of its masterful elements.

I know many people who find this movie too long, too complicated, too boring and if you're waiting for some action, a lot of suspense and an explosive beginning, you should not even watch it. This is not just a movie, it's an art! And this movie works like a painting that you watch again and again in a museum and where you would like to analyse what the painter wants to express with its creation. It takes its time, but it's worth the wait and surely precious.The movie begins in a slow paced way and works a lot with its dark, weird and haunting atmosphere. Weird music, the filming of dark floors without an end or empty rooms, the lack of dialogs in the beginning may irritate the viewer but every detail has a certain role and a certain reason to be shown in this movie. Everything seems so slow and when the film really starts, you're all of a sudden in it and it all comes too quick, too strange and you might not be able to concentrate on the essential things.Anyway, what is the essential thing about this movie? What does David Lynch want to show us or make us learn? Or is the sense of it all that there is absolutely nothing to learn? The movie plays with our feelings, our thoughts, our expectations and always presents something unexpected. And everyone may interpret the unexpected in a different way or maybe not at all.Now wait, this may be the key to this movie Expect the unexpected! And watch this movie several times! Who is who and why and when does a person appear and disappear? Which person is the opposite of another person in this movie? Who is friend or foe with whom and why? Or why does it change throughout the movie? There are a lot of things that you could analyse and compare and even after having watched this movie at least five times, I still find new elements, new keys to a possible hidden treasure in this movie and I am now able to build up my own theory of the movie. But I won't tell you and I would give you the advice to not look for possible answers on wikipedia or movie websites because this movie is personal for everyone and before you may look for other opinions, you shall at least have watched the movie a couple of times. You must watch it in tranquility. When you watch this movie and the phone is ringing - you're out of it even if you don't think so! If you watch the movie and your girlfriend is bored and wants you to do other things with you - you're out of it! If you watch this on television and there is a commercial break - you're out of it! Just sit down and watch, take a break from everything for two hours and a half.And let it all come to you. The dark and strange atmosphere. The strange music, containing dark classical arrangements, heavy modern jazz music, pop music and even industrial metal - the music always fits to the certain situation. The three mysterious video cassetts and their strange and terrible content. The mysterious break and change of the main character in the movie. The allusions and antithesis between the first and the second part of the movie. The thin path between reality and illusion, the question of dreaming or being awake. The femme fatale and the mystery man. The murderer who doesn't want to be a murderer. The connection between the beginning and the end of the movie. There is more than a lot to discover! This movie is somehow a psycho or mystery thriller with some action and pornographic elements. There are even three movies in one a dark and atmospheric thriller, a strange romantic road movie story and a little short movie which connects the other two elements throughout the film. This movie is certainly different from everything you have ever seen before.It is sure that this movie is not the one which may have received ten Oscars, the best critics or the most attention. This movie is over the top, beyond a normal movie, beyond any critics, beyond any prices like Oscars. This is an uneasy watch and feels real and even surreal.Are you open-minded, concentrated, introspective, philosophic and intellectual enough to give this movie a try? Try it, prove it to yourself! And be sure to live an experience that you may like or dislike but which is different from any other one. Personally, this one is at least in the top 5 of my all time favourite movies! If you like it, don't try to look somewhere else for something similar. Discover the works of David Lynch and watch Mulholland Drive. Or maybe a simple movie isn't enough? Try all the episodes of the Twin Peaks series! You try to be arrogant and you would say that you like the movie but you think that is not surreal enough and even too simple? Than, go for Eraserhead!

The emotions have been captured into the characters' faces brilliantly and the facial expressions that we see are almost like painted on the big screen. They fit so well with the scenes. In Lost Highway David Lynch takes the viewer to a strange, surrealistic world full of violence, exploitation and horror. One might be afraid and even sickened of this world, but eventually if one pays attention one will see that the world of Lost Highway doesn't differ much from the world we live in.I saw this on the big screen and it added some great extra feeling to the film. In the beginning the credits are actually thrown at your face while going on a highway road and listening to David Bowie's song I'm Deranged. Also be ready to notice some other familiar songs by famous artists/bands, including Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins and much more. And the songs most certainly not are just randomly picked up.David Lynch's way of combining modern popular music with classical music is brilliant and unique. He's a man who's a great script-writer, director, musician and painter. The music for Lost Highway was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with whom David Lynch had already worked with. He had composed the theme music for Lynch's TV-series Twin Peaks and the music for Blue Velvet (1986) and Wild at Heart (1990). David probably had a powerful effect on the music Badalamenti composed for Lost Highway, because of his understanding and own musical talent. Badalamenti and Lynch have even published a classical instrumental album together.Just as Alfred Hitchcock modernized the genre of horror and thriller, David Lynch keeps modernizing surrealism. For these kind of movies you can't define an exact genre. By these kind of movies I mean postmodern films. The fact that you can't know what is the genre of the film you're watching might be a problem for a mainstream movie-goer. For that kind of person this movie will be pretty boring and sick. But for people who are interested in art and like non-commercial movies, this will be a treat. Lost Highway is all about thinking, it's built on postmodern philosophy and its conception of realities. Basically the story is this Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a jazz saxophonist, who lives with his wife Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) in a simplified modern house. You don't get to know the actual city but it looks like it is somewhere in California, probably in Los Angeles, because of the references to materialism and superficiality. Suddenly videotapes start appearing next to their door. The tapes show us that someone has been videotaping their house. After a while Fred meets a Mystery Man at his friend's party, which leads to a series of surreal and absurd events.A major thing this movie is having a replica, which I think one should keep in mind. It also deals with people's mind - the sickness of it, thoughts, memories and cruelty of humans. This movie can and should be analyzed a lot. But I will leave that enjoyment to you, I didn't want to read any analyses before watching Lost Highway. I would just like to recommend you to pay attention to the sound scape of the film and to the faces of the characters.

I promised in that review that I would watch his other films and recently I did just that with Lost Highway. Like Mulholland Drive the actors like Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette and Robert Black give great performances but it's Lynch's use of dark lighting and the editing of the film that amazed me that draws into the twisted fantasy and of course the audience have to figure out what's going on in turns of real and fantasy.I think I figured it out but it took me quite some time to arrive at this conclusion but of course it may not be correct as there are several ways you can interpret it.The basic story is that a saxophonist Pete (Bill Pullman) gets arrested for supposedly killing his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) whilst in prison he metamorphoses into a young car mechanic Fred and falls for Alison who is played by Patricia Arquettte. She is scared of her mafia husband (Robert Logia) and falls for Fred where they agree to run away together. What happens from there well you have to try and figure out. I would tell you but I find it too hard to write down. Even throughout how some may have described it as 'mess'. The plot can still be interpreted if you had the patience and the time.Sufficed to say again Lynch knows how to manipulate the audience cleverly and he creates unending suspense about what will happen next. I also have to mention one particular actor of Robert Black who played a mystery man dressed in black. He gives a terrific performance. Menacing indeed. This was a fantastic film and a another achievement for Lynch from me. I preferred Mulholland Drive a bit more because the acting was better, but Lost Highway is still terrific and it's a pity that Lynch is not really a big Hollywood director but his films will still be hugely appreciated by many including me. The next one of his I will be watching is Blue Velvet, which I know will be equally brilliant. Thank you once again Mr. Lynch for another thought provoking and riveting complex film.

So they call the cops to tell them about the strange activity going on.At a party hosted by Andy (Michael Massee), Fred meets the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) who claims to be inside Fred's house as well as at the party. Fred takes Renee home angry with Andy's sleazy shenanigans.Another video arrives at his house, only this is worse. It contains footage of Fred killing Renee!

During his imprisonment, Fred has really bad headaches and nightmares about the Mystery Man, a burning cabin and another man driving down that lost highway like Fred.One morning, during a routine check, Fred isn't there anymore. Instead it's a young man by the name of Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) an auto mechanic who was charged with auto theft 5 years ago, so he's released and is reunited with his parents Bill and Candace (Gary Busey and Lucy Butler). Back at work at the garage for Arnie (Richard Pryor) and Phil (Jack Nance), he comes into contact with a charming but hot-headed gangster by the name of Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), Pete goes out for a drive with him and his goons. They attack a tailgater for getting in his way so the gangster's car is back in the garage for repairs. During the repairs, he sees a pretty blonde by the name of Alice (Patricia Arquette in a dual role), Mr. Eddy's mistress. She comes to pick up the car and invites Pete for dinner.

Most of it, like most of the analysis here at the IMDb site, focuses on the inherently irrational/schizophrenic/moebius-strip nature of the movie characters just become other characters, and you have to accept that on its face. And I'd probably be willing to accept it too, except that I've also been watching Mulholland Drive lately, which shares a lot in common with Lost Highway, and I'm convinced that at least in Mulholland Drive the entire movie makes sense - IF you're willing to ask the questions what is real and what is some kind of fantasy? I take the same approach to Lost Highway - characters don't become other characters any more than Dorothy's uncles become scarecrows and tin men in The Wizard of Oz. Rather, like in Mulholland Drive, people from the real world become different characters within the dreams/fantasies/nightmares of other characters. Once you've started to identify what parts of the movie are fantasy, the next question is why events happen the way they do - in Mulholland Drive the entire delusion is set up as a romantic fantasy that also serves to rationalize the failings of one character. I don't claim to have any definitive interpretations for Lost Highway, but I think the same sort of analysis makes sense here. Just saying it's a weird movie is taking the easy way out - David Lynch's films are complex, non-linear, and lack obvious distinctions between fantasy and reality, but I think they ultimately make sense given enough thought.

You don't follow a linear plot, you just see things happening. At least that's how I experience it. You get a feeling how it must be to completely have lost your mind. You make rational decisions but the responses of people and things around you are completely irrational, so it's absolutely impossible to control the way things happen. A thing I like about David Lynch It's never about the end resolution (like for example in M. Night Shyamalan's movies), but it's all about the way, on which you realize that your mind is only going one of the many possibilities. Lynch is a gifted filmmaker, he knows how to build up a tension like few others these days. My favourite acting contribution to this movie is made by Patricia Arquette, she plays a real mystery femme fatale par excellence.

It could be days, weeks, or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced. This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.The Elephant Man was the first David Lynch movie that I saw, introduced to me by my dear old grandmother around the age of 10. I, at that young of an age, had never been as deeply moved by a movie yet in my life. As the years went by, it came to pass that I forgot all about it, and my next Lynch film was much later in the form of Mulholland Drive, a film that was a success in the field of critics at the time. I was wary of the fact, after researching a little bit about David Lynch, that my grandmother had done something astounding in my movie-going experience. She had introduced me into the avant-garde, experimental aspects of directing and writing, without having the slightest clue.After a binge of renting and watching a mass of films that decidedly shaped my view of film-making, the power of surreal and imagination, I was home, at last, in the hands of the creative minds behind that substance that makes great cinema.Film to me is a magical medium that makes you dream... allows you to dream in the dark. -David LynchTransfixed on worlds that delve deeper than fiction and transcend our deepest fears and dreams, I found myself in the local video store one night, and some unexplained impulse drew me to a video that only sounded faintly familiar. I brought it home, but it was awfully late, and I ended up falling asleep before I even really caught a glimpse of what the movie was about. My dreams on the couch that night were exceptionally strange, and I remember (as fabricated as this sounds), images and feelings that could only be expressed as being lost in the desert along the side of a winding road.The movie, was returned without being watched all the way through, but when I finally came back and gave it a second shot, David Lynch's Lost Highway was one of the most disturbing, dreamlike, and memorable movies that I'd ever seen. Scary at some points, to extents that I actually turned it off a couple of times to catch breathers.The filming location of most of the inside scenes were actually inside a supposedly haunted hotel in Death Valley. One actor on the set, was actually convinced that his character in the film was the devil. The film defies summarization, except that it is built out of the most bizarre events that you could imagine. Murder, kidnap, possession, demons, stalkers, betrayal; to name only a few. Some people think that the plot is unnecessary, that this is a film version of what hell must be and feel like. For this reason, you can either love it or hate it. Either way, you'll feel as you would in fact feel if you were trapped in motion and lost at every turn. The story begins with Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette), who seem to be struggling to keep their relationship afloat. Fred is a jazz saxophonist, and when he goes to a gig one night, we get the feeling that he is concerned that his wife, who stayed home alone, might be having an affair. Strange things are happening to them, including a door buzzer that when answered by Fred, seems to be answered by his own voice; Dick Laurent is dead. They receive menacing video tapes on their doorstep, apparently made by a stalker who has found a way into their house. Fred relays to his wife, one night, a dream that he had that furthers the couple's paranoia. But it isn't until Fred goes to a party, where he meets a stranger with a telephone, that the plot begins to jump from mysterious to outright creepy. Dick Laurent is indeed dead, but why would Fred receive that message, if he never met the man?Well, that's where we begin in Lost Highway, and I could go on about the plot without spoiling the real secrets of the film. This is because, as stated earlier in the review, the story is certainly non-linear in the conventional sense. Enjoy the experience for yourself, though. But keep in mind, this film is definitely in the same vein as Lynch's other mind-warping movies such as Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks.So buckle up, drink some coffee, and prepare to be taken on a ride that will permanently alter your notions about memory and the future, life and maybe afterlife.How I remembered them.

This is mostly for those who HAVE seen the movie, although with Lynch's films it doesn't really matter))) You could have seen it 10 times and still be none the wiser) So... It really makes sense after you figure out a thing or two about the Mulholland Dr. (which I think is the movie of all times, much higher than even the Lost Highway, since Mulholland Dr. has as many spiritual messages as your normal Indian Upanishad, Sutra or a Buddhist koan). First, you have to pick a point of reality here. What follows is just a possible exercise to get you going. Having liked Mulh.Dr., I figure, why not begin from the middle, from the Pete in his workshop. Most probably a VERY ordinary guy, nothing like we see in the movie. Most probably the sad reality is that the guy catches a glimpse of the local mafia boss with his exceptional lass, fantasizes about loads of easy sex with her, croaks his Sheila friend and rationalizes it with another fantasy about being Fred, protecting/revenging his family life and killing Eddie... And the truth of the matter is that Pete is never out of the prison throughout the movie, he is just sitting there awaiting his electric chair and fantasizing his double-nested rationalizations and wishes. But they don't hold well, and both at the beginning and at the end we just see an empty highway, with someone tearing at it, but who is that someone? A crazy misguided wishful thinker, a nobody imagining himself into an even worse nobody... Is that us??A wakeup call for us.

Yet, after seeing it for another time around (and each one, I forget how many, evolves with everything and nothing at one), I'm almost inclined not to figure it out as a connector of sorts between the melding of dreams and reality in Mulholland Drive, and the 'inner-soul' of a madman from TP. It's more about experiencing these characters and situations, the sort of overall seductive nature of Lynch's film-making from the cool opening credits sequence till the peculiar ending. Pullman in one of his best parts (this time having to really 'do' something with a character, however restrained he might be,) plays a musician who is sentenced to death for murdering his wife. That's the simple end of it, anyway. But then something happens while he's awaiting the chair, by way of a pill meant to help him sleep...and then suddenly, it's not Pullman anymore...or is it?To say that this is Lynch messing with his fans and non-fans is an understatement, but in the end I more remember the images, the flashes of garish, nightmarish specks from reality than the full-on story. Robert Blake in white-face, Loggia as the male-dominating gangster, two versions of a male character with Pullman as one and Balthazar Getty as the other, these are some perks to the film. But there is also a troubled turn by Patricia Arquette- one scene involving some explicit sex is more than disturbing- and a couple of twists that almost bring whiplash. It's a kind of lurid, psycho-sexually charged pot-boiler of pulpy danger and excitement while still keeping a brooding atmosphere akin Lynch at his best. For the average movie-goer not yet used to Lynch's slight of surrealist hand, you might as well take mescaline and feel a similar effect.

Spoilers about to occur. This is just my interpretation, but I imagine 'Fred' or whoever he is sitting on deathrow in *extreme* denial about the murders he committed. He imagines himself to be 'Fred', ordinary jazz musician with a beautiful wife named Renee. Renee is cheating on him, and Fred tries to maintain the belief that he's in a normal relationship. When he makes love to her, however, her disinterest is so blatant that his psyche picks up on it -- in steps the face of his devil's advocate-conscience, Mystery Man. Meanwhile he gets these mysterious tapes (made by the Mystery Man), in which at first little happens but gradually Fred's denial breaks down and sees what Mystery Man has documented Fred murders his wife in gruesome fashion. Fred dislikes Mystery Man, but the latter tells him, You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted.The insane deathrow inmate actually has two fantasies. In the second one he reinvents himself into a young innocent mechanic named Pete. He also turns his disinterested brunette wife into a platinum blonde named Alice. Alice is Mr. Eddy's girl but she's secretly in love with Pete. Alice and Pete want to run away together.

Well, I've got news for you, art house films have more substance than Lost Highway's contrived drivel.  Lynch made the huge mistake letting his images tell the story (which, I have no problem with unless the imagery lacks creativity and skill, which this film does).  As a whole, the way most of the scenes were shot were pedestrian at best.  On most accounts, Lynch failed at letting his images do the talking.  I absolutely adore dark films that have a penchant for being weird and offbeat, but Lynch can't even manage that. In Lost Highway, he uses forced artfulness.  Compositions of dialogue and images cease to be artful when they're crammed down the throats of the viewers, which was exactly what Lynch did here.  Everything about this film is so claustrophobic that it denies the viewers of their freedom to interpret what they're seeing on screen in their own way (which is the worst thing a director can do).  The lack of coherence was not one of the many main gripes I had with this film; the pacing was.  The pacing of Lost Highway was wrought out so much to the point that it was torturous.  And those damn pauses in between dialogue, and even in between words in sentences of dialogue drove me up a wall.  There were, literally, at least three occasions where there were twenty second pauses in between exchanges of dialogue between characters, and one where some moronic blond girl that has no self-worth (the movie was so mind-boglingly lumbering, I can't even remember her name) takes a twenty second pause (in the middle of a freakin' sentence!) while talking to some ugly young man (I can't remember his name, either, nor care to) while they are driving.  I guess Lynch thought that this film would be more true to life (or at least pretend to give it some sense of realism, which it doesn't) if he had his actors take those long pauses, but again, he made another huge miscalculation people in real life do not talk like that!  If anything, people talk too fast, not too slow.  The only characters that were memorable were Bill Pullman's character Fred (but this performance left much to be desired), and the creepy man with the video camera (too bad he wasn't in the movie for longer).My rating 1 out of ten.*Side note  Lost Highway rivals Castle Freak for worst film I've ever seen.

The story is still interesting, though, all the way through the film, but there seems to be no appealing essence. The soundtrack illustrates this, in part; I really like the Bowie song, but Rammstein and Marylin Manson (the latter even plays a small part here)? No way. And then there's a lot of sex and violence, which can be cool film elements, but it's just not at all working for me here.My idea about the plot is that it begins with a nightmare / psychosis, which makes the leading and real character Pete Dayton someone who dreams he is part of the Hollywood in-crowd who has a hot wife, a cool house and plays weird jazz saxamaphone - and he does a lot of drugs as well, probably. He dreams of a murder (or he possibly killed Renee already, and Alice is a figment of his imagination), and the Mystery Man would represent his bad side / the devil / death. If my idea is correct, than it would make no sense that the cops are following him, but within his psychosis, there may be more not making sense and that some things are only in his head, such as the photo in which he sees Renee and Alice, while only Renee (black hair) turns out to having been real. It's just my two cents, and I would have to watch it a couple more times to figure more of it out, but I'm not sure I'll be bothered.The film is full of lame dialogues and scenes, for example the tailgate incident; I used to love that scene, but now it's like a misplaced scene from a black comedy. I love most of David Lynch's work, but this one just doesn't cut it for me anymore, in spite of the wonderful body of Patricia Arquette...4 out of 10, for a story that is basically interesting, some odd atmospheric highlights and the only successful characters in the film Mystery Man, played by an unrecognizable Robert Blake.

And as the old saying goes, I could have more fun and entertainment watching grass grow. This movie could be a cartoon, as it chops and changes time like a pair of sox, suspense yes, story no! Of course, amnesia is a good way to explain the inexplicable.

Put all the Hollywood movies on one side, and Lynch's movies on the other- you'll get what I mean.David Lynch is an artist and an artist never presents anything bluntly. He never focuses on the surface. He rather digs deep down and gives you what your inner self actually needs.Why do we watch movies? For fun? Time pass? Stress alleviation? Whatever you call it, the implicit desire of our mind is to run away from the present reality and plunge into another world. We want to escape from reality and engage our mind into something else that has a lasting effect.We see many audience who underrate a movie either because it couldn't connect with them or couldn't create a lasting impression. This movie contains these both aspects that audience want. So THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!This movie doesn't spoon-feed you like a baby. It creates the environment where your brain plays with it's interweaving threads. I bet that after watching this movie, you won't walk away light-headed. You'll have a big question mark all over your head. You'll spend some more time asking yourself what the movie actually meant. At the end, you're the one who's supposed to fit the puzzles and understand the movie for yourself. Thus, this movie will undoubtedly have different interpretations.But, at times the movie proves to be quite unrealistic. Although it's all about a man's psychology, if it were a bit inclined towards practical reality then this would've been one of the finest presentations of David Lynch.

I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status.If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it.The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte Everything we see hides another thing. Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being Mulholland Drive &#x96; 2001 and the third Inland Empire &#x96; 2006.One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who forgot to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the popular statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything?The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible.Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams.Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film.However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans.Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story.With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean.Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a normal film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

For example, during the night when Fred kills his wife, just before it happens, he roams in his house like he's looking for someone or something.

Since he is insane, he kills his wife. But he wants to kick Laurent's butt as well for screwing his wife. So when on the death row, he morphs into Pete who happens to have direct contacts with Laurent. When the conditions are gathered, Fred is back to his own self and kills Laurent.

Lost Highway is not the first time David Lynch has broken the rules with traditional filmmaking, he did it before with such titles as Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and several of his short films. What makes most of his films so great are the dream-like feel most of them have. His films are really an acquired taste, you really have to get used to his style before you get to like his movies. I started to watch his short films at the ripe age of thirteen, most of them really scared me at that age. I think the reason why I like most of his films and this one in particular, is how similar they are to my dreams. Most of my dreams have somewhat of a plot and in the end don't make sense to anyone else but me. Another element that is similar to my dreams is the whole changing character part (anyone who has seen Lost Highway will know what I mean). In most of my dreams I am never myself, I am usually some character I made up and doesn't exist in real life. If there was one thing I did not like about the movie, it would be the second half. The second half isn't as surreal or as interesting as the first half of the movie, but in the last ten minuets it all pays off. I would give Lost Highway and 8/10.

Its story of mixed identities sure doesn't follow a conventional narrative at all. In fact the film could be regarded as something as an early riff from the director before his masterpiece Mulholland Drive. Both films seem to be about jealousy, retribution and murder, as well as the darkness within somebody. They both also share a fractured narrative and a distinctive sinister neo-noir aesthetic. Except it's even harder to fathom Lost Highway and it certainly is more explicit both in terms of violence and sex. It explores Lynch's usual territory in that it resembles a nightmare. Dream logic is the only logic that applies. The director puts on screen some of his most memorable imagery here. And like always it is accompanied by a terrific soundtrack. It's an excellent combination of Angelo Badalamenti atmospherics and rock music. The latter varies considerably in tone from the raucous industrial-metal of Rammstien, latter day Lou Reed and the dream-like Song To The Siren by This Mortal Coil. The latter in particular suits the tone of Lynch perfectly &#x96; ambient, mysterious and beautiful.The film is structured into three sections. The first part is like an extremely moody horror film that finds a cold couple begin to receive mysterious videotapes that become more and more disturbing. The whole idea revolving around the videotape is a quite brilliant one and just goes to show what a true original David Lynch actually is. The second part of the film finds identities switched via some kind of metamorphosis and the movie then becomes a crime-noir about a young mechanic, a femme fatale and a violent crime boss. The final part of the film brings things together in the desert and the Lost Highway hotel.The acting personnel are mainly very good. Robert Loggia is very convincing as a sociopathic crime boss. Robert Blake is frankly unforgettable as the pale faced Mystery Man; his scene at the party where he confronts Bill Pullman's character and says 'we've met before' is a premier Lynch moment &#x96; it's simultaneously absurd and terrifying. Pullman and Balthazar Getty are good enough in their respective lead roles, even if Getty can be somewhat wooden at times. But Patricia Arquette, on the other hand is mesmerizing. She is perfect in her dual role and is outstandingly convincing as a femme fatale. It's a truly sexy performance from her, in what cannot have been an easy role. At one point she is forced to strip at gun point, while in another she appears in a porn movie. It's pretty edgy stuff and she is fantastic throughout the picture.Ultimately Lost Highway is a very hard movie to completely decipher, and despite having seen it at least a half-a-dozen times over the years I am still not completely sure what it all means myself. I've read a few theories, and interesting though they are, I still remain not fully convinced. But the thing is that even though I cannot put all of the pieces together, I still have the urge to return to this highly compelling film. It's a bravura effort from Lynch and brilliantly combines violence, erotica and general weirdness into a very satisfying &#x96; if puzzling &#x96; whole.

No one can pin him down and one of his charms is his versatility beautiful, emotional movies like The Straight Story; complex thrillers like Blue Velvet; intriguing mysteries like Twin Peaks. Lost Highway displays the most famous aspect of his style the surreal, nightmarish and the ambiguous.Bill Pullman, in one of his finest performances, plays Fred Madison, a saxophonist who inexplicably kills his wife, Renee (played by the gorgeous Patricia Arquette). What happens next is left to the viewer to decide Fred metamorphoses into young Pete Dayton, a mechanic who hangs around with gangsters and soon meets Alice (also played by Arquette).Is Pete Dayton just a fantasy Fred created before sitting in the electric chair? Is it some afterlife where he can lead a new life? Or is Pete real? Lynch respects his viewers too much to give a straight answer; he must know by now the people who like his movies don't care much about answers and prefer the journey anyway.Throughout this journey through Hell, Lynch is up to his usual tricks of strange set designs and of creaking noises to create tension. Fred's house is a dimly-lit, labyrinthine place where one could lose himself, literally and metaphorically. The scene in which Fred becomes Pete is disturbing but reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder.And then there are the usual Lynch characters; two stand out Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), a vicious, suave gangster who steals scenes with his hilarious brutality. And The Mystery Man (a chilling performance by Robert Blake in white make-up), an 'abstraction' as Lynch called it, a being who just moves in and out of the action at crucial moments, never on anyone's side, who seems able to read peoples' soul and induce dread. The spirit of guilt, the Devil, a loon, whatever he is, he's one of Lynch's most unsettling creations, up there with BOB and Frank Booth.All in all, Lost Highway, co-written by Barry Gifford, is one of David Lynch's most interesting movies, a fascinating journey to the human psyche and beyond. Viewers who love the strange and the mysterious can't avoid this movie.

After that, enough interesting stuff and abundant gratuitous sex and violence followed to keep me watching to the end. It should probably get a thumbs down for failing to make any sense or arrive at a conclusion that would neatly tie it all together. This is one movie, however, that is about the journey and not the destination. I feel a little cheated that this film has no rational explanation, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the ride. It makes less sense than even Syriana, but is more enjoyable to watch. It is a comparable to Mulholland Drive, but at least that movie has a logical explanation and is a better film.Syriana is a political thriller that is all style and no substance. Lost Highway is more of a psychological thriller with tons of style and just enough substance to keep us wondering.

I have read somewhere around here that he is thought to be a symbol of Fred's illness, however I think he represents Fred's objective memory and consciousness. Now, here comes the spoiler He is the only character (or person in this planet besides Lynch) that seems to know what is going on in the movie. He is the man with the camera, he knows exactly what, where and how this nightmare develops; he knows the actual events and his appearance announces a metamorphosis. I mean, this mysterious man appears every time that Fred has a strong confrontation with reality and actual memories right before a crisis (like when he kills Renee, when he is sentenced to death and disappears from prison, and when he is running from the police at the end of the movie after having killed Andy and Mr. Ed, major spoiler, huh?). About Fred's Kafkian metamorphosis, it is never stated whether it is a product of his schizophrenia or a true part of the plot. In my opinion, it is the first option.I'll try to briefly summarize the plot as I think I understood it Renee met Andy in a desperate moment of her life. He told her about a job as a porn actress with Dick Laurent. Years later Renee married Fred, a man with schizophrenia. He somehow knew about Renee's former job and about Dick (and had some fantasies about her that are later shown in the movie when Alice tells Pete about the first time she met Dick and enjoyed it) although he tried to block it from his mind. He keeps repeating himself unconsciously that he must kill Dick (that explains his knowledge of Dick's death before it happens) and take revenge of Renee. Maybe those thoughts made it impossible for Fred to have a normal sexual life with her. Fred, when he is self-aware (deeply in touch with the mysterious guy), records tapes of his house as a way to communicate with his everyday self in an attempt to let his psycho instincts come to reality or probably to warn Renee. So, he kills her in a lapses. He is condemned to death; and escapes from prison in another lapses. Then he creates a fantasy in which he becomes Pete, a simple guy who has no idea about Fred's life. This part of the movie has all the characteristics of a dream, including the one of being able to invent every character's actions. Living that fantasy, he meets Alice, a blond Renee in whom Fred reflects his worst fantasies about her. Alice is a porn actress who knows Andy and works for Dick. Pete knows her through Dick and has sex with her several times. Dick gets jealous and threatens Pete. Alice tells Pete to run away with her. Dick calls Pete that very night and puts him in touch with the mysterious guy who is the contact between Pete and Fred as an objective conscience. So Pete kills Andy accidentally (this death actually happens accidentally because it exists even after the fantasy is over) and goes away with Alice. They have sex and in the end she disappears. Also Pete vanishes and Fred is back in the game. In this part Lynch lets us see Fred's lapsus. He goes to Dick's and kills him. The police follows him through the highway and when Fred's lapsus is about to end bringing him back to his memoryless and repressive self, the movie ends.This is my crazy interpretation.

He imagines himself to be 'Fred', ordinary jazz musician with a beautiful wife named Renee. Renee is cheating on him, and Fred tries to maintain the belief that he's in a normal relationship. When he makes love to her, however, her disinterest is so blatant that his psyche picks up on it -- in steps the face of his devil's advocate-conscience, Mystery Man. Meanwhile he gets these mysterious tapes (made by the Mystery Man), in which at first little happens but gradually Fred's denial breaks down and sees what Mystery Man has documented Fred murders his wife in gruesome fashion. Fred dislikes Mystery Man, but the latter tells him, You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted.The insane deathrow inmate actually has two fantasies. In the second one he reinvents himself into a young innocent mechanic named Pete. He also turns his disinterested brunette wife into a platinum blonde named Alice. Alice is Mr. Eddy's girl but she's secretly in love with Pete. Alice and Pete want to run away together. Naturally this fantasy breaks down too, in grand fashion.Somewhere in the first half of the movie Fred says, I like to remember things my own way. That's one way to put it, Fred.

I have attempted to see this every time it comes on Cable-TV but I will always fall asleep! I never make it to the end awake...ever!This is a very quiet film...and since it is, it always lulls me to sleep.  What I gather from the film that I can stay up for is that there is a couple in a very strange house that live a very unsatisfying life, including their sex-life which is obviously bad. It seems as though all of their awful life within this house is caught on tape which someone leaves at the door. What I could also see was that the Mr. Pullman character murdered the Ms. Arquette character....or did he? Who knows, but he does go to jail and then violently turns into... young Mr. Getty who bares a striking resemblence to Mr. Pullman. Now I like this change and of course Mr. Getty and his group of weird and wacky group but what does one have to do with the other?!?!? Ah, there's the lynch in David Lynch's work. And its all being done very quietly.... But let me review the one part of the film that is the funniest and best....the part that I love the most is when Mr. Getty and Mr. Loggia go on that Mercedes Benz drive. I'm telling ya, that little scene is the best part of the film.After that, I kinda fall into a deep sleep. Granted, I'm dozing off and on throughout, but after the Mercedes Benz scene, I'm actually falling asleep! I'm not writing this to down this David Lynch film, I think the film is supposed to do that. It's a very quiet film, very disturbing and very much of a puzzle. But don't ask me about the ending and whether not it all fits together because I don't stay awake long enough to get that far.

In that sense, this movie follows his other films stylistically. However, some sort of behavior or theme must tie everything together to make the movie cohesive and watch-able. Unfortunately, Lynch tries too hard in Lost Highway to throw strange, disconcerting images towards the viewer.  Although the scenes are somewhat interesting, the movie contains so much garbled dialogue and plot that it becomes bewildering. The viewer is preoccupied too much with just happened in the past scene to concern themselves with the contents of the current scene. Since the imagery used is neither lush nor as well-developed as in his other movies, after a while one feels no point in paying attention anymore.  I would suggest picking up the soundtrack instead; it contains some innovative jazz work and isn't laden with disassociative imagery.

Lost Highway is more of the same with less delivered.(SPOILER don't read on unless you've seen it.)At bottom the film is a simple reworking of an old horror/fantasy concept a hallucination of escape at the moment of death. Fred Madison is on death row for murdering his wife (presumably in a moment of insanity), and imagines himself turning into another person with another life, but in reality there's no escape. He changes back into himself and is electrocuted - in fact probably the whole thing has flashed through his mind in the moment the switch was pulled. It's a situation that has made for at least one classic horror movie (Carnival Of Souls), and there's no reason why it shouldn't be enjoyably revisited by film-makers who were willing to do an unpretentious genre piece. Here, however, it's tricked out with a mixture of long still shots, verbal pauses, arty compositions, fades to black, flashes of light and sudden cuts from noise to silence. The conventional stuff is quite shockingly lame. Vital plot points are barely introduced (for instance, the official inquiry when Madison is replaced in the death cell by his alternate self, Pete Dayton, who's then released shouldn't we have seen some legal argument?) and some good players are given roles which leave them as little more than puppets. The only person who gets an actual character bit is the gang boss, Mr Eddy, in a scene where he and a couple of heavies commit some designer violence on a driver who's tailgated his Mercedes. Complete with overwritten profanity-laden dialogue, it feels embarrassingly like an imitation of Quentin Tarantino. Robert Blake has a sinister presence in old-queen makeup as the nameless 'mystery man' who acts as Madison's taunting guide along the road to destruction - but then you remember Dean Stockwell's sinister old queen in Blue Velvet. The whole thing feels like a student film, a feeling heightened by the presence (in sound and vision) of alternative-rock mediocrities like Henry Rollins, Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor.I haven't seen The Straight Story, but Lynch was desperately in need of a change. The 'weirdness' of his earlier work has had a remarkable influence on the cultural mainstream, but in Lost Highway it just feels played out.

We've got a confused, silent leading character as in Eraserhead. 2. The production design of Blue Velvet (Fred Madison's house looking almost the same as Dorothy Vallen's apartment) 3. The switching personalities and a mystery man straight out of Twin Peaks. 4. The lovers-on-the-run storyline from Wild At Heart.I thought the first half with the mysterious videotapes was pro- mising. A bit too slow, perhaps, but otherwise pure neo-Hitchock. Alas, the films changes direction after an hour and it struck me as five or six storylines having gone through a mangler and a compactor. I liked the movie and think Lynch wasn't lying when he said the mystery can be solved (hell, defending the movie I wrote a 'consistent theory' when some friends told me they believed this movie was weirdness for the sake of weirdness), but he and co-writer Barry Gifford DO ask an awful lot from their audience. The fact that the original three hour cut had to be brought back to 2hrs and 15 minutes, doesn't help either. An interesting film and Lynch once again succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere but it's way too self indulgent and humorless. All in all, I guess it's pretty save to say that this first-film-in-five-years is far from his best. Nevertheless, Lynch is one of few those filmmakers (the other ones -alive- being Joel Coen, Scorcese, Spielberg, and George Romero)who are incapable of making an uninteresting film.

As is, Lost Highway is enticing to watch, but each great scene has so little to do with what came before it that the end whole is less the sum of it's parts.Arquette's undressing, Mr. Eddy's car chase, you'll never have me, Getty waking up in the cell, Arquette and Pullman viewing the videotapes these are all great pieces of filmmaking, but when throwing them together, you better make some kind of attempt at a continuous interpretation.Mystery Man's omni-presence seems to be the glue for holding together the film, and all his stuff is very good. However, the film's ending, the car chase that clearly signals  Pullman/ Getty suffers in the electric chair for their murder or murders--this is the best route for reconciling the film.Ultimately this attempt is very half-hearted.  A photograph double tying the two worlds is thrown in, lifted from The Shining.  However, The Shining threw out a clear possibility that the Hotel was haunted, and Lost Highway veers more towards hallucination, though mental illness is haunting.  The Arquette guy named Moke story that is repeated in each world is vague, which seems to be the quality of reconciliation the filmmakers desire.The ending and the devil characters' presence would seem to require more explanation of the 2 worlds, though this would've taken great effort, and would indeed be a different movie.As is, 6 out of 10, too abstract for recommendation.

'Lost Highway', written by Lynch and Barry Gifford(author of the novel 'Wild at heart'), makes an attempt at recreating cinema as well as David Lynch's place in it. The naive optimism and happiness that contrasted with the darkness in his earlier films is gone, and the focus is now solely on the weird and creepy. Lynch directs it like a set of music videos, and there are always songs or hissing drones and backward masked screaming in the air. As the film progresses, the  plot twists and turns in all directions, and you're bound to feel stomped on when you've seen it all for the first time. It's not boring, however, and with repeated views an interpretation will form in your mind. 'Lost Highway' is like a cloud though, meaning that it'll look different with every move of the focal point.

For example, on the Horror genre it relies the creepiness of the character's situations such as inner demons and evil presence (represented in such a devilish but stylish style by Robert Blake, brrrr). Then the movie is covered by an atmosphere of crime and mystery that will keep you on grabbing your seat.

A masterpiece on it's own.The best feature of the movie is David Lynch's direction; it's solid, dark, elegant, innovative. You just can't define what kind of movie you're watching; I mean, it looks indie at some points and with scenes such as the sex on the desert, it looks like a production made in a classy underworld.

David has always been less about spoon-feeding narrative to the audience than leading them to a whole table filled with strange items, allowing them to taste each visual, each character, each scenario for themselves, and deciding on their own what kind of brain food it is, and whether or not they like it.Who was it that said that talking about love is like 'dancing about architecture'? A fitting way to describe a Lynch film, particularly this one.But if you're a moviegoer who staunchly requires some kind of linear storytelling before you invest any time in a movie, I'll try to keep this as simple as I can. As simply as you can compartmentalize any of David's work...which is impossible.Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a musician, a sax-player in an avant-garde jazz combo. He is married to Renee (Patricia Arquette), an attractive blond woman who seems to spend a lot of time home alone while Fred plays his gigs at night. Fred suspects that Renee might be seeing other men in his absence. Renee resents this, and the tension and mistrust strains their marriage. Adding a brand new layer of paranoia is a series of mysterious video tapes that they begin to find on their doorstep each morning.At first, the image on the tapes is simply the front of their house during the daytime, and nothing more. But gradually, the images become more frightening, as the mystery cameraperson goes from the front of the house on one tape, to inside the house on the next, photographing the living room, the hallway, and finally Fred and Renee asleep in their bedroom...They call the police, who naturally can do nothing to help them. Shortly after the latest tape, Renee is murdered and Fred is arrested as the prime suspect.Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) is released from jail with a head wound and little recollection about how he got there in the first place. Pete works as a mechanic, repairing cars for full-time psychotic thug and part-time car enthusiast Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia). Adding to Pete's confusion is a world of trouble - he has the hots for his boss's woman, Alice Wakefield...who could pass for Renee Madison's twin sister.Pete wants to help Renee get away from Mr. Eddy, but while he tries to make it happen, he begins to discover disturbing clues that lead to possible answers about his amnesia...how he got into jail and what he was there for...and what part that both Alice and Mr. Eddy might have in what happened.Both of these stories play like separate but very similar movies unto themselves, with only one thread that connects them in any kind of concrete way...a sinister figure only known as the Mystery Man (Robert Blake).That's all I want to tell you. That's all I CAN tell you...Everything else you need to know is there between the lines...and the lights. The details that need filling in for someone of limited imagination will prove maddeningly elusive, because LOST HIGHWAY is less a narrative crime thriller than a tone poem of existential angst that dreams of being a crime thriller. Lynch does some of the most chilling, unsettling work in HIGHWAY with lighting or the absence of light, than in any other film he's ever made.There are times you feel that if you looked closely enough, you can almost grasp the 'key' that will make all the puzzle pieces fall into place...but at the same time, you're almost too scared to know what the answers really are...Make any sense yet?

After the metamorphosis, when Mr Eddy asks Pete to go for a ride, the tailgater is a big clue as to who Mr Eddy is. He's some type of law enforcement. When they pull the tailgater out of the car, Mr Eddy lectures him on reading a drivers manual and the safe distance to keep in order to stop safely. Like a power tripping cop.I can't explain any more than that or how he comes into play with Renee, but it's just something to dwell on.

Yet Lost Highway seems to present a mismash of his previous works. The apparent similarities of Arquette's character with Isabella Rosselinis's in Blue velvet (dark, ambiguous), Dick Lauront with Santos in Wild at Heart (bad guy with some very obscure dealings) e.tc. sit uncomfortably next to the supposed innovative lunacy that, as his trademark, Lynch is trying to portray here. Yet this is certainly not a poor film, Lynch has evoked an excellent sense of film-noir through his cast (even making Bill Pullman seem quite appealing);  silence and a sense of impending horror is used to stunning effect, certainly to the best Lynch has ever used it before; and as always we are visually and audially stunned (even if many of the symbols here are such throwaways). The mystery man has got to be Lynchs penultimate eerie character, and David Bowies voice as the road rolls on and on is glorious. Watch it - if just for the unbelievably unsettling mobile phone scene, where Lynch will prove he can still scare the s**t out of you in his own perverse way.

I remember on January 27, 1997 when I took my dad to see In Love and War for his birthday, I saw a preview for Lost Highway. It didn't have any speaking or any pictures, but it had Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette and David Lynch's name flash across the screen while playing David Bowie's Deranged. Even though I really didn't know a thing about it, I had to see it. It opened on February 28, but it took me until March 14 ('97) to get to the theater. I'm 17 now, so I was 15 when I saw it, and previously I had never seen a David Lynch film, nor even heard of him. After I saw it,I really wasn't confused, I just took it for what it was. But the Monday I went back to school and recapped the story, I scared the hell out of myself as well as them. It took me 45 minutes just to try and recount the plot points. I was so intrigued by this movie --unlike any I've ever seen before. So I went back and watched all of Lynch's other movies. The man is a genius. I have not disliked any of his movies --I even found Dune to be somewhat entertaining. Lost Highway has become my favorite film and also the best film I've ever seen. Sure the story's weird and out there, but if you don't strain yourself trying to figure it out, the answers will come easily, albeit not all of them WILL be answered --they're not meant to. . There may be no real explanation to the film, Lynch doesn't want it that way, and I understand his reasons. If you knew all the answers to a mystery, it would cease to be a mystery. Movies should make us think, and in reality, we DON'T always find the answers. The symbolism is great, as is the acting, direction, writing, cinematography, editing, et al, and of course picture!

So, I decided to rent Lost Highway after hearing its praises sung by Lynch devotees. I'd have to say I didn't find this movie viewing experience enjoyable. In fact, I'd have to say I loathe this movie.In a nutshell, the protagonist (of sorts), Fred, suspects his wife of infidelity. She is murdered and Fred receives the death penalty for the crime. From there, the movie takes twists and turns that while interesting, truly boggle the mind. As is typical with a David Lynch film there is a lot of symbolism and everything is open to several different interpretations. Robert Loggia and Robert Blake really stand out in terms of the film's acting. I can't remember seeing a creepier character than Blake's Mystery Man. Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette are total bores. Balthazar Getty is average. The look of the picture is prototypical Lynch; it's got a real dreamlike quality. This movie does have a fabulous soundtrack. The quality acting by Loggia and Blake, the awesome soundtrack and a really beautifully shot sex scene lit by headlights towards the end of the film earned this stinker 2 stars from mre. I know Lynch's work is really polarizing - people either love it or hate it. This movie just seemed like a lazy attempt by Lynch to be artistic. Ooh, how shocking, the lead character has just become someone else! Wow. Ooh, now he's back to who he originally was. Ooh, the movie is shot out of sequence and events traverse the space/time continuum. Give me a break. The thing that made me really hate this movie was the unnecessarily gratuitous nudity and eroticism. I'm no prude and have NO problem with nudity. However, in this movie it appears thrown in to distract the viewer from how pointless and unimaginative the rest of the film is. I suspect others might criticize me for not finding the brilliance in this movie. I did very much enjoy BV and MD - far better films from this director IMO. This movie is a real stinker. Don't waste your time (download the soundtrack though - it is awesome).

This worry isn't his only problem as video tapes arrive on his doorstep, each day showing footage more and more into his house and eventually filming them asleep. At this point they call the police, who duly investigate. His dreams continue to be as weird as ever and at a party Fred meets a mysterious man who says that they have met before in Fred's house &#150; where in fact he is right now; bizarrely Fred confirms this by ringing the house and getting the man. The next morning Fred is in police custody for the violent murder of his wife, a crime he has no clear memory of doing.From the very start of the film it is clear that we are in David Lynch's world and, if this doesn't appeal to you then this is probably the point you want to get off because even for fans of the man, this is far from being a perfect film. The first hour builds the mystery really well and I was intrigued by it even though it was mostly silence and mood. At the halfway mark we suddenly find ourselves with new (and familiar) characters and the main character becoming someone totally different (or not) and at this point it requires faith to stick with it and not give in to being lost and just give the whole thing up. It doesn't get any easier though and for each viewer their solution will differ slightly or totally. To some viewers this will be a wonderfully enjoyable challenge where to others it will be frustrating weird seemingly just for the sake of being weird. For me the truth lay somewhere in the middle the film didn't have to be so difficult to follow and it did seem a bit up itself at times but I was also engaged by the film as I tried to piece it all together. Enough people have filled these pages with their own theories so I won't add my own to them but suffice to say that even with the best will in the world, nobody's totally fits.Cronenberg is a great, imaginative director and despite him being difficult, he does manage the mood and tone of the film really well &#150; producing plenty of genuinely creepy and off-settling scenes. The cast are mostly good. Pullman is enjoyable and has a good presence although this is not a great thing because it means that I felt his absence when we are left with the good but not as good Getty. Arquette cannot act and why she still gets so many high profile roles after so many bland performances is beyond me. Here she is terminally unconvincing and her only saving grace is that the film's lack of real characters and sheer weirdness covers her weaknesses. The smaller roles are well played by Loggia, Busey, Massee and others but I'm not sure I really needed to see Pyor wheeled out. Of course the most memorable role is taken by Blake his scenes may make the least sense within reality but they are certainly the most impacting.Overall this is a very strange film that will frustrate as many viewers as it pleases; being a fan of Lynch will suggest that you fall in the latter category but with this film it is not guaranteed. The weirdness and mystery made it engaging for me but the lack of solutions and inner logic is not an easy thing to swallow and, for all its strengths it does have enough difficulties to make it a very acquired taste.

Perhaps the most amazing things about this movie are how a modern american director could get any funding for something like this, and how Lynch actually dared to make a movie like this. In brief, Lost Highway is an unusually demanding and powerful movie about a jealousy drama transforming to a description of psychosis, a projection of subconscious into film. Unlike in Mulholland Drive, in Lost Highway there are hardly any positive images and the viewer seems to be finally left alone with this endless run of dark nightmares emerging from the subconscious.

He is the master at creating challenging and surreal films which defy all rules of film-making (the one exception being his only straight-forward film, The Elephant Man). Lost Highway was of course another one in his list of mysteries, yet I think it is his most mainstream film to date.The opening 30 minutes of Lost Highway brilliantly work out in the form of a truly scary thriller/horror film. By the time the 40 minute mark reaches, the film takes a whole new path, which of course is expected in a Lynch film. The film is never dull or boring, and it does have a lot of surreal scenes that will mystify and confuse viewers, but I still think it is a film that would work with mainstream audiences. I can see many movie fans being perplexed by the turns the film takes, yet still highly enjoy it, and in that respect, I think it is because Lynch is probably trying to make a film that will be a commercial hit (seeing as how Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me flopped despite it being one of his best). I can definitely sense him making this one for the audience (unlike his newest film, Inland Empire, which got better reviews with the critics than Lost Highway yet seems to frustrate viewers a lot more). Saying that, I do think that parts of the film are not as engaging as some of his other films. Ultimately though, Lost Highway still builds on Lynch's impressive resume, although from the 7 films that I have seen from him, this is in the bottom along with The Elephant Man. Yet, Lynch's weaker entries are still better than most films out there, which this is because I am sure it will become a favorite of mine as well. The soundtrack also rocks, and in a way parts of the film reminded me of Blue Velvet (which is one of Lynch's most understandable films).

Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place à la the psychiatrist in Psycho, but Lost Highway is particularly challenging as regards explanation.Another commentator thinks that Lost Highway is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie &#x96; circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie.A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes.Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping &#x96; they call the police.At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him.A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end.By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense &#x96; maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea &#x96; and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; Lost Highway is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

With its furious emphasis on pricy style, and its fashionable dip into sexual violence and porn as a sort of appetizer course, it resembles an enervated version of a David Fincher movie, but instead of the bulldozing scripts Fincher uses, Lynch and his always-catastrophic collaborator Barry Gifford (who co-wrote WILD AT HEART), have built a world where noir is abstracted--made Marienbad-esque. Lynch seems to intend this movie as his 2001--his signature oddity turned metaphysical and mighty.

I have seen the cast in previous films, but nothing seemed to be able to save this film from becoming a kaleidoscope of nonsensical scenes, irrelevant plot twists, and sub-standard acting. I watched it through to it's anti-climactic 3 hour conclusion expecting at some point for it all to make sense, and ended up feeling that I had wasted three hours of my life I would never get back.I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It has justly earned the title of The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen. Please, just bypass this one and avoid torturing yourself.

Following on from his excellent 'weird americana' trilogy (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Wild At Heart) Lynch here adopts a style that refuses to get under the surface of the conflict between good and evil (his trademark 'primal instincts)', instead applying his 'bizarre' dream logic to events that take place in the narrative. As a result, twists and turns occur, and the film is at least unpredictable on first viewing, but after repeated viewings it's weaknesses are exposed (which is a problem, as Lynch films tend to 'grow' on you). The main problem is that so much of the narrative is dedicated to a twisty turny 'psychogenic fugue' (Lynch's interpretation of the film) and therefore characterisation becomes almost non existant. As a result, the film leaves you cold. The use of music too, is often so over elaborate one gets the feeling that Lynch became a hermit after the box office failure of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me (which quite simply is his greatest masterpiece and is on a par with Blue Velvet- worth another look) and reduced himself to a caffeine addict whilst discovering MTV. But the biggest problem is the fact that this does'nt feel like Lynch at all. It feels more like 'imitation David Lynch'- and resembles a cheap made for TV movie (the low budget really shows- Lynch had problems with the financing after FWWM) and if you did'nt know it was his film- you'd swear it was someone making a pale imitation of one of his films to broadcast specifically for channel 5. After the genuinly dark and unsettling experience of Fire Walk With Me (prime Lynch) this is a huge dissapointment, and if his fans appreciate it all too much, for once (which is often quite the opposite) they really don't get it.****/10 "},{"Title":"I knew I shouldn't have let him out on his own","Date":"1 October 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  There is only one thing worse than being cornered by a friend who wants to tell you all about something sweet their three year old did yesterday and that's being cornered by a friend who wants to tell you about this weird dream they had last night.

A very Lynchian moment, for sure.Here, the 'great' man gives you the inside the head bit but you remain unmoved due to the fact that Lynch is suffering from 'embarrassing dad syndrome'. You know, the one who turns up uninvited to your eighteenth birthday bash wearing an old eighties 'The Clash' T-shirt and combat trousers while ridiculing 'da kids' over their dress sense. He pretends to know all about that 'Marlon Manson' character while foolishly trying to dance to him and ends up drunk with his head in the toilet bowl. Lynch has no less subtle weapons of mass inaction. Cod-occult ramblings, Norman Rockwell/ Helmut Newton rip-offs and tedious not to mention twisted nods to kitsch Americana abound as does the inclusion of allegedly cutting edge music artists. Such as Lou Reed *giggle*. Yup, Lynch is one hip daddy-o messing with the heads of kids half his age. Nice student movie, kiddo, but look at what daddy can do! Cringe. Er, see you later, dad.

Great artists do let audiences read what they like into their work, but what Lynch seems to have missed is that great artists also know what their work is about.

At the simplest you can speed things up or slow them down, you can jump around forward in time and have flashbacks.But for David Lynch time really doesn't matter. It is like in a dream, everything is both obvious and obscure at the same time. Anything can happen, and often does.Lost Highway is probably the best of Lynch's work. We have all the old elements that pop up again and again in his work. There are gangsters, damsels in distress and femme fatals (often they are are the same character), mysterious strangers who are controlling everything (are they a metaphor for Lynch himself), sex and of course lesbian sex.I both like and hate Lynch. I always feel his work is too cheap. It is deliberately obscure and nonsensical so that the viewer has to impose their own meaning on to what they are watching. I do that anyway, and I like to be entertained on the way through.The reason I like Lost Highway over many of Lynch's other works is that it is that the weirdness is much more toned down. I guess he no longer has to hit people over the head, watching a David Lynch film is an expectation of weirdness. When things remain fairly ordinary then we are looking at them even harder.My view is that the story is both a straight line and a circle.

Instead we see Lynch back in Wild at Heart ground - in full overdrive, where it seemed to work in Wild at Heart it seems to work less here. The pacing of the film suffers  badly, mainly because Lynch is at his most ambitious, changing lead actors half way through.  Unfortunetly there is little or no humour or light touches to let up the assault, Lynch throws us so hard into his dark territory that his handling is akin to mind rape.This film sees Lynch at his most far out - while a universal idea seems to be apparent in most of his films (Eraserhead - Paranoia, Blue Velvet - Pulling the surface back), Lost Highway just seems to be a descent into darkness without any real centrifugal point and as such although by far the strangest it is by far the least interesting of Lynch's films.However by not his but typical film standards this does have a right to be seen, some great scenes take place in the film - the hideous little man talking to himself on the mobile phone being one.  The film does have those touches of Lynchs surreal genius but as a whole this mega - ambitious film just fails to work.

Unfortunately, he doesn't have a very good script here, and to make up for that he tries too hard to be mysterious and arty. The first part of the film plays like an experimental low budget amateur venture (although the acting is professional). The sets are too dark and the games with the lighting lead to nothing. The long takes on the faces of the actors add nothing, and the long time spent fading to black creates nothing more than a mood of impatience. The supernatural hooey is strictly grade B. The barroom lighting in most of the interiors recalls the apartment in Blue Velvet, but the apartment in Blue Velvet worked well because of its lay out and how it was set up to work effectively in the plot of the movie. Here we just have a lot barroom lighting with little purpose.Robert Blake, with his white clown face makeup as the mystery man, expands on the cameo character of Dean Stockwell in Blue Velvet, but he is not so interesting as we eventually see he is another tired personification of some kind of Lucifer (yawn). Patricia Arquette plays the female sex animal as Isabella Rossilini did in Blue Velvet and she is as sexy as sexy can be, but not as interesting as Rossilini because she is a little too perfect physically, and too psychologically familiar. Lynch's idea that women are evil temptresses leading men astray is worked on here, but yields nothing new.Main problem besides the script is Lynch has no Dennis Hopper. And he has no contrast. Laura Dern in Blue Velvet was a perfect foil to Rossilini, really etching their contrasting characters for us, but against Arquette plays only a variation of herself. Bill Pullman is good in a grim, spiritless role. Balthazar Getty, with more to do, does it very well.The movie is also very poorly edited. A lot of the first half hour could have been profitably tossed. The film only gets going after the prison scene. (The road rage scene in the Hollywood Hills was good.) The desert scene where Arquette seems to turn into Blake was a wonderful opportunity lost. Instead of sex by the headlights of the Mustang in front of a dreary wooden structure (I don't think the crew got farther than Victorville) how about sex among the cacti in the blazing sun in front of something adobe? And the Lost Highway Hotel? Gee how did everybody end up there apropos nothing and without rhyme or reason? How convenient for the requisite gore to follow.Lynch lost his way here as he self-indulged to overdose. It's a shame. He needs some new ideas.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex.

After an amazing run of films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Fire Walk With Me), Lynch unleashed his worst creation yet on an unsuspecting public. And yet Lost Highway should have been his pinnacle! Bill Pullman! Robert Loggia! Robert Blake as the Devil (sort of)! Balthazar Getty! Patricia Arquette! What a cast and what an intriguing premise--man maybe kills his wife who may not actually be dead but then becomes someone else in prison. It's like Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel made a movie together. But Lost Highway doesn't even come close to living up to expectations. Why? Simply put It's soulless. It honestly feels as though Lynch was going through the motions, picking up ideas from his past films and putting them to use in a different setting. He aims for a convoluted narrative and gets it; he searches the dream world for inspiration but comes up wanting. The story, with its dichotomous nature, should work better than it does, but the use of the two leads doesn't really add anything to the film. And, frankly, Bergman did the two actors as the same character thing better in Persona. And Hitchcock's Vertigo gives you a better I thought you were dead woman than Lost Highway. Most of Lynch's films play with conventions and ideas that are clearly connected to earlier films; Lost Highway feels derivative. The best part of the film, from my perspective, is the thoroughly creepy Robert Blake. Lynch's films inevitably have great bogeymen and the Blake character is no exception. He's eerie and frightening. I was 17 when I saw this film in 1997 and I had nightmares. The rest of the film pales (no pun intended) in comparison to Blake. However, here's the caveat Watch this movie. If you've never seen a Lynch film, don't start here. If you like the man's work, though, make sure you see it. It's a polarizing film and one that certain people actually like. It's also definitely better a fascinating trainwreck of a picture.

It's not clever or even original, but his followers seem to love it. He splices his films together out of sequence.So when watching Lost Highway don't be confused when, after a man is caught for a murder, the film suddenly moves to an apparently different story. It is merely that you have watched the story from its middle to the end, and are now having to watch it from the beginning to the middle.The trick means that the opening and closing scenes of the film, featuring a dwarf, are the same point in the middle of the story. It also means that when the story ends (in a prison cell) and the story restarts (in a prison cell) in the middle of the film it seems, even to the characters, that one man has metamorphosed into another.A friend described this trick as a work of genius, transforming the film into a Mobius strip (ie a length of paper that has been twisted before having its ends joined together, meaning that you can draw a continuous line on both sides of the paper before coming back to your starting point). He is a fool.If you own a DVD of Lost Highway (and God help you if you do) you could watch the story from beginning to end by using the scene selection function. If you did, you would see a rather bland, if wilfully obscure, film that concentrates more on lighting and quirkiness than plot or character.It is interesting in an artistic sense because it divorces the film from its narrative, but the two hours and 15 minutes are far from interesting in any other sense. It is all rather indulgent and, like Lynch's other narrative-juggling film Mulholland Drive, makes you think that he is using a trick to disguise the mundanity of his writing.It should be noted that out-of-sequence films do not have to be bad. Memento, directed by the infinitely more talented and less pretentious Christopher Nolan, told the story of an amnesiac avenging his wife's death by showing scenes in reverse order. It is brilliant, not only because it is thrilling and characterful, but because the plot device puts you at the same disadvantage as the protagonist. You do not know what has happened immediately beforehand.With Lynch, by contrast, his justification for splicing his films together in the wrong order is weaker. He does seem to have something to say about schizophrenia, but it would be a lot more illuminating if his films weren't so incomprehensible and, consequently, boring.

The characters show no life inside their skulls and as metaphors, they only qualify as Hot Young Things, but Lynch tries to use lighting and technique to divert the audience from this.  The movie works on a narrative conceit that is so boring it is hardly worth the effort - yeah yeah yeah, so Robert Blake stands in for the artist who is manipulating the characters.  Whatever.  Kurt Vonnegut did this better in his novels.  Thankfully, Lynch made The Straight Story next and perhaps will put this shallow piece of pandering behind him.

Either I just saw the same bad film twice, or Lost Highway was even worse.There seems to be a lot of concern over the plot of the film--most of it on whether or not one even exists. Let's take Lynch at his word and on credit, piece the fragments of the schizophrenic Pullman character together, and contrive the plot of a jealous lover seeking revenge. Presentation aside, is this subject matter new, topical or even interesting? Does the film have a comment to make on that subject? Does the film have a comment to make on schizophrenia or mental derangement? The answer to all of these questions is simply no. I don't have a problem with Lynch's escapism or surrealism as a baseline for making a film. But I do have a problem with using those formats for no other purpose than to tell an uninteresting story that has such little social comment or value beyond being a different way of telling a simple, unappealing story.There's a trend and flood of movies recently that seem to take place in the mind of the protagonist where the audience is forced, due to mental illness, a dream or some other reason, to accept the main character's mental state as the objective reality for the audience. But a writer/director should have a reason beyond just keeping the audience as confused as the main character for using that subconscious or alternate reality to tell the story. A few good examples of uses of this technique are Jacob's Ladder, Memento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I would even add Shutter Island (though quite predictable) to that list. But Lost Highway uses this medium/format with no good reason other than to keep the audience as confused as the characters for the majority of the film.With Mulholland Drive, the best you could take from the story was that Hollywood is a vapid and lonely place. In Lost Highway, I can't pinpoint anything Lynch has to say that hasn't been said before, let alone said exponentially more succinctly. And any style points are washed out by the lack of substance from the narrative.

But then the only Lynch I've seen before this was Twin Peaks. The documentary showed that Lynch considers himself primarily a visual artist and designed all the set furniture (I thought the camera was lovingly looking at an odd-looking couch for too long). The visual images are alluring.He has influenced TV and movies so much that he's been bypassed by The X Files and Tarantino (while Robert Loggia seemed really grateful to be in an art house movie for a change his character was straight out of Reservoir Dogs). Robert Blake too seemed grateful for not being cast as a cop and I think this was Bill Pullman's first arty movie.But this movie is really just an explicit X Files episode and was a mile-wide and an inch thin in theme and meaning. I think a major theme was proving that Patricia Arquette's breasts are natural and not implants. I did appreciate in the documentary that she complained that it was the most physically grueling shoot she'd done - must have been hard to get all the sand out of everything. There was some lame effort to make some point about pornography and violence but I felt it was a fig leaf. The movie Bound was way more interesting in providing an updated take on the femme fatale, as Lynch has a very stereotyped view of that. Par for the course, a couple of people walked out of the theater. It'll certainly lose its visual beauty on video so if you turn off your brain and just go for psychedelic images and want to see Arquette naked a lot, go see it in the theater.Lynch was very much involved in all the music and it was wonderful, both the pre-existing songs and Angelo Bad Angel's score.

There were other small sub-plots that could have been interesting, but they were not explored and therefore were of no merit. Just like in Twin Peaks, Lynch teases you. The tease is that there is an actual story developing, but there is not one. It is simply a third year film student attempting to show people that he is unique. How anyone could give this movie a thumbs up is beyond me. I believe even Lynch would admit it was bad, well, maybe not.

I've seen it and it's ever apparent now that the motive behind his silence was not the preservation of my viewing experience, but rather that he didn't have a clue.

I figured that perhaps it would get better, it never did. The entire picture was shot like a bad film school semester project. He simply tries way too hard to be deeply artistic and the fans of this movie fell for it. You can find deeper meaning in nailing a toilet to a wall, but that doesn't make it artistic. The same applies to Lynch's work. Even supposing the story line did make any substantial sense (no one can seem to agree on what it means), it has a myriad of other shortcomings. It was shot poorly. It was like the DP was high and used whatever alternative shot composition he felt like at the time. The acting is terrible. All the talent look like robots. The writing sucks. The scarce dialogue was entirely mechanical, shallow and awkward. Finally, it seemed that the majority of the film was simply an excuse to get Patricia Arquette naked.

I know Lynch loves weirdness and sometimes I share his sentiments. Few movies are as bizarre as Wild At Heart, but I own it and watch it every now and then, as I do with Lynch's Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. I can even watch a really slow film of his like The Straight Story. However, one viewing on this movie was more than enough. To me, this is Lynch at his worst, and when he's bad, he's almost unwatchable.Speaking of weird, what was up with actor Robert Blake dressed almost as some woman with a lot of facial makeup? Well, he certainly fits into a Lynch film, I'll say that. Blake has always been a strange dude......but you know that.Bill Pullman is jazz musician Fred Madison and Patricia Arquette is his sexy wife, Renee. Fred thinks Renee is cheating on him. Enter the mysterious black-dressed, ultra-white faced Blake and bizarre things with videotape ensue, all leading to a murder and Fred (along with us) not sure what the hell is going on. It gets far more confusing when an entirely new set a characters begins another story. It's too bizarre, too weird and simply too much.

After a party Fred finds a third tape that show's him standing over Renee's dead & bloodied body, Fred then abruptly wakes up to find himself sentenced to death for Renee's murder. While on death row Fred goes to sleep one night & inexplicably wakes up as a different person, a young car mechanic named Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), baffled the police let him go free to return to his life. However Pete has an affair with Alice Wakefield (Patricia Aquette), the girlfriend of a violent man named Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) but not all is as it seems in a bizarre world where anything can happen...This French & American co-production was co-written & directed by cult director David Lynch & Lost Highway is as culty as any of his other films, after a five year absence from making films after the critical & financial failure of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me (1992) he storms back onto the silver screen with yet another bizarre, surreal & often incomprehensible thriller that really has no logic or sense to it at all. To be fair to Lost Highway the first forty odd minutes are great, the deep mystery surrounding the videotapes, the murder of Renee, the strange little things that keep happening like the message telling Fred that 'Dick Laurent is dead' & the bizarre encounter with a creepy man at a party who seems able to be in two places at once but once Fred transforms into Pete the film never recovers from such an audacious & frankly odd moment. All the intriguing videotape & murder angle is abandoned completely & is frustratingly never explained, sure there are the odd character that is the same or the odd line of dialogue or the odd reference to what has gone before but for all intents & purposes Lost Highway completely changes it's main character's, it's location & it's entire plot about halfway through & it's a rather jarring experience. The boring romance between Pete & Alice had me wanting to know what happened to Fred & who killed his wife even more, sure Fred makes an appearance at the end but what actually happens during the final ten minutes or so is anyone's guess, quite simply it's incomprehensible & makes less than zero sense. There's a nice reference back to the opening scene but otherwise I was just baffled by the end like I am sure most people will be, Lost Highway just isn't that satisfying as it never delivers anything substantial or even concludes any of it's various plot lines. Lost Highway is a really strange film, it really does make no sense despite all the 'theories' that people have written & posted on the web, I suppose if you have to think about the symbolism & commentary too much like me then the film isn't clicking with you, to fully enjoy & appreciate a unique & different film like Lost Highway it's messages & parallels should be obvious & instinctive so maybe if you have to think about it too much it didn't work for you as well as maybe it might other's. At over two hours long Lost Highway is sometimes a slog to get through but I always found it fascinating & hoped that it would deliver on it's inventive build-up & narrative but it never does & it just fizzles out as it gets weirder & weirder as it loses all touch with reality & logic.Lost Highway is a great looking & very stylish film, I can imagine a director like Lynch wanting everything perfect. Apparently Fred & Renee's house in the film is actually where Lynch was living at the time he made Lost Highway & which he designed, it's a very modern home with a slightly odd look & feel about it that sets you on edge & works in the film perfectly. Lynch has said the 'Dick Laurent is dead' incident actually happened to himself in real life, he also states that he was inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial while writing Lost Highway. For some odd reason although filmed & released in 1997 Lost Highway wasn't released on DVD in the US until 2008. There's a bit of violence & gore here, there's a nasty slit throat & a bit of blood splatter as a guy is impaled on a glass coffee table(!). There's a fair amount of sex & nudity too, Patricia Arquette strips a few times & there's a few sex scenes here.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 this had quite a decent budget, it's extremely well made with striking production design & visuals. The acting is very good from a solid cast, Bill Pullman is great even if he gets to sit out the middle hour while Patricia Arquette is very sexy here, Robert Loggia & Robert Blake are both suitably creepy as the bad guy's.Lost Highway is a film I enjoyed for hat it was, a collection of striking images & visuals randomly strewn together in a bizarre plot that made zero sense to me. Sure, you could say part of the fun & charm is coming up with your own theory & what Lost Highway actually means to you n a personal level but for me it meant nothing overall & I really don't want to be spending hours dissecting a film in some attempt to find the meaning of life or reality or whatever Lynch was aiming for.

But a second vision helped me to follow it better because I had Lynch's definition about his movie in my head the story of a schizophrenic killer told from his different personalities' point of view. This helped me to follow better the film. However, it didn't gain my adhesion for all that. Lynch's movie may be entrancing, scattered with strong sequences and fascinating characters. It is even reminiscent of Family Plot (1976) Hitchcock's last movie in its structure by the transition from one story to another. However, it brings out an impression of pretentious as if Lynch wanted to prove the spectator that he is the best filmmaker in the world. You can also notice that throughout his movie, he doesn't hesitate in multiplying the gaudy effects and erotic sequences. These particularities make the movie much too long. Then, certain points remain ambiguous and notably this one who is this mysterious black man who appears throughout the movie like a leitmotiv?In the end, breaking the narrative conventions, David Lynch signed an ambitious but pretentious film. Nevertheless, the director offers several possible interpretations about his work including this one the whole film might be a dream. It would be the most convincing outline. Anyway, Lynch's fans since Eraserhead (1977) will be elated. As for the others, I would advise them to refrain from watching this work. One last thing I would say to Mr Lynch originality is nice but there are some limits.   "}]
