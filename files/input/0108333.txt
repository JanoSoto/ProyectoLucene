[{"Title":"A fun film, if nothing else.","Date":"8 September 2002","Score":"49 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  First and foremost, if you have read the Dumas book, then you realize that this movie doesn't resemble the novel in the slightest.  The only thing that this movie got right was the names of the characters! However, I am a big advocate in saying that you should never compare a movie back to its book, and I use this movie as an example.  This story has been Disney-fied so that it can be called a family film.  If you read the book, a true adaptation would not be family entertainment.  Disney changed everything that they do.  Read the Tarzan novel and compare to the cartoon.  BIG changes there.  The Little Mermaid.  How convenient that Disney left out the fact that Ariel dies at the end of the story.But what we should judge is the end result.  This movie is still entertaining, despite having nothing to do with its literary influence.  The characters are portrayed with the same attributes that they have in the book.  For instance, D'Artagnan, while very duty bound and honorable, is young and headstrong, and prone to impulsive decisions that will help him to prove his skill and worth.  Porthos is self serving and self praising, very vain and cocky, yet has a lust for the finer things in life.  Aramis is humble and religious, but very skilled and intelligent, making him a very formidable soldier, yet he also loves the finer things in life.  And Athos loves his wine, trying to bury himself in a alcoholic haze to hide the pain that he suffered in losing the love of his life.  All of these come through in the movie, and all of the actors were great in performing them. As far as the story is concerned, Disney likes things black and white, good vs evil.  And so, the story changes to make the Cardinal a power hungry man with his own interests in mind.  He wasn't like that in the book or in real life, but he was underhanded, and Tim Curry does another great job as the villain that he steals the show.Overall, a great and enjoyable movie, worth watching with the family.

Umm, does nanyone really care?  Dumas' plot, while interesting in and of itself to many, is probably not one that many folks who think of the Three Musketters could actually _tell_ you.This movie sets out to more or less capture the feel of such films, rather than the source material itself.  In that regard, it's not too badly done.  The characters are pretty broadly drawn, but adequate for the younger audience they're aimed at.  Sutherland, Platt, and Sheen all seem way too young, but at least the first two are entertaining.  Platt in particular manages to steal every scene he's in.By the same token, Richelieu's character is simplified to generic bad guy.  The King and Queen seem too young as well (although they're represented age may be novelistically and/or historically accurate - again, could most folks really tell you, or care?).Overall, I'd recommend the movie for some light entertainment, but don't take it too seriously.

There are more great one-liners in this movie than a Clint Eastwood film, a Sean Connery film, and a Arnold Schwarzenegger film combined.  This movie is definately worth seeing and worth owning.  Again, Tim Curry and Michael Wincott's performances really do it for me. Evil!

Film versions of classic novels should at least bear some resemblance to the plot of the novel from which they are adapted, even if they are just pot-boilers intended for a family audience like this one, and not meant to be taken too seriously. But this is a very loose adaptation indeed.The acting is just up to the level required and the dialogue is a mix of pseudo-17th century and contemporary Americanisms which fail to convince the viewer that he/she is watching a picture set in 17th century France. Though the production is quite a handsome one, with the sets, locations, and costumes all nice to look at, the characters are not well-drawn, in particular those of Cardinal Richlieu, portrayed as an out and out villain, admittedly enjoyably, but with little depth, and D'Artagnan who is played as naive, arrogant and pompous and not as a particularly likable character.Other comments stress that this is a Disney picture made for the family, but that should not save it from criticism. Compare it with Disney's Treasure Island, or Kidnapped, both much superior adaptations. Nor have they helped children understand the novel. Because it is so loosely based they would hardly recognise it as The Three Musketeers if the characters' names had been changed, though I do agree that film adaptations don't have to follow the source novel absolutely faithfully.But is it entertaining? Yes and no. The villains are hiss-able, Aramis, Arthos and Porthos are sometimes entertaining, despite the questionable dialogue they are given, and Richlieu, though often over the top, has his moments. The action scenes are OK but not done with any great verve compared with the Richard Lester version. Milady does not feature as a really central character in the plot as she should and in fact many of the novels' characters do not appear in the film at all.Read the book and see the 1973 version and forget this one if you are over 16.

It's not a book. It's Hollywood and it's a cartoon. That's what the writer, director and actors envisioned. It's what they portrayed. The basic triumph of good over evil, of justice over self-serving malice. Escapism! And in that light, it's brilliantly done. Come on, it's not a literary masterpiece, nor was it intended to be. It's every child's vision of The Three Musketeers. No different than Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirtate. Just plain fun! Have you ever known any real heroes? The archetype is men or women who laugh in the face of danger, give all for those who are weaker and have an attitude of irreverence for all they encounter. They don't think of themselves as greater than others. They just know what their responsibilities are, and they execute them. Sheen, Platt, Sutherland, and O'Donnell all act this out in expert fashion.

At all. I found this on TV and though wow, Keefer Sutherland, Tim curry and Charlie sheen with swords, must be a cool movie. if you go in saying that, you will be disappointed. However, me and my brother were laughing the whole way through. The action is insanely over the top, the bad guys make the funniest noises when they die!! Also, EVERY clich√© is in this movie. The harsh character who hates everyone and then has a stand-off against the enemy allowing the others to escape and think he's dead and then miraculously come back! Me and my bro were cackling as we pointed out this and similar stuff. Tim curry is funny as heck too. it seemed like he was thinking I'm stuck with this, so why not have fun? and makes the main baddie, Cardinal Richelou the biggest perv the world has ever known. This guy comes on to everyone in the movie who vaguely resembles a female, that includes the young king, who looks a woman disguised as a man disguised as Micheal Jackson. The dialog isn't anywhere near the correct time period and while the minor characters at least have accents (though often not necessarily french as they should be) the three musketeers remain pretty darn American. So if you enjoy movies that are side-splittingly bad, filled with cheesy lines and even cheesier enemy death, this is the film for you!! Otherwise, keep your sanity and stay away!

If you're looking for a fun adventure film full of action and comedy well... that's still the Richard Lester version.Still here?This is a popcorn movie. You watch this when you don't want to be bogged down by complex characters and twisting plots. It is a film full of obvious cliches and key moments that, should you be at all familiar with movies, are neatly spelled out within the first 5 minutes. There isn't anything wrong with that but lets not pretend that this is in any way a good movie. It is a mindless action flick made by Disney. If you like that, then yay and may you enjoy the movie.Quick Guide to Understanding the Movie (minor spoilers)The King and Queen are both extremely noble and deep down are very much in love. They're just afraid to admit it. Sure, you might be asking yourselves where's Buckingham? but we're supposed to forget he exists. So never let it enter your pretty little heads that these people are anything less than rulers by divine right because they're simply FABULOUS!Rochefort not only betrayed the musketeers (he was one) but he also offed D'Artagnan's father. You might be wondering where THAT one came from but it looks more damn noble when D'Artagnan not only kills a baddie but also is avenging the musketeers and his father at the same time. There must be no ambiguous characters in this film. All of the antagonists here are REALLY, REALLY EVIL!Except maybe Milady de Winter. Why? Milady de Winter redeems herself. Seriously. Why are you looking at me that way? I'm not kidding! Right before she's about to be hanged for her crimes she tells our heroes all about the Cardinal's evil scheme and jumps off a well placed cliff. So she's redeemed and kinda splatty.The Cardinal is evil. No, not working for the good of France but from his own (perhaps slightly warped) perspective. Clear cut, open and closed, baby eating evil. Okay, he doesn't eat babies. That we see. But I'm sure he does it! He's evil, he wants the throne (or the equivalent power) and he also wants Anne (the queen). He REALLY wants Anne. Can I tell you all how much I miss Buckingham?If you're looking for depth, GO AWAY! Run, even. But if you're not then its an okay film, I guess. It is pure light-hearted cheese but that can be fun at times. Personally, this one was not my cup of tea. Oh, except for Paul McGann being in it. If you're a fan of Paul McGann and you want a good laugh, go see this film! He's a hoot as Girard (and Jussac).

Keifer's dramatic undercurrent to the frivolity going on around him works very well, and helps this from becoming too schmaltzy.

Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen, before he became a surly twitchy mess, is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter, she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu, in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer.

For one, it has Kiefer Sutherland in it (though he's stuck with really lame dialogue).  And secondly, the horse work in the movie is excellent--I especially like that little Spanish horse that D'Artagnan rides in the beginning.  Aside from that, it's just a bunch of Hollywood cliches in sequence. It has a tacked-together feel, as if they had a bunch of scenes they wanted to include, but didn't really know how to integrate them into a seamless whole. In some scenes, the Musketeers are light-heartedly slaughtering people, as if it's just a day's bit of fun, and other scenes are more serious and dramatic, but they don't work because the characters aren't adequately developed and don't seem very realistic.

And as I have made clear blahdeblahdeblah...this is one.The atmosphere is mad and more fun than a barrel of chimpanzees on LSD. The underground dungeons with flaming torches and people sticking their arms through the sardine-like grids and the eeeeeeeeeeevil villains who are shown as ruthless from the word go, are textbook cheese, and just what is needed in this film.Straight away, we are thrown into the action, with some very pleasant surprises. Chris O Donnell as the hotheaded D'Artagnian, Keifer Sutherland as the (fairly) straight-headed Athos, Oliver Platt as the bonkers but ingenious Porthos (with tricks up his sleeve that come out of nowhere such as a triple-bladed dagger), Charlie Sheen as the religious Aramis, the beautiful Julie Delpy as lady-in-waiting constance, Tim Curry and Michael Wincott as the classic bad guy double-act (with evil villain and secondary baddie with eyepatch), even Paul McGann in a hilarious double-role, sometimes playing a leader in the Cardinal's guard, but mostly playing a wuss who has it in the neck about his sister's 'honour' with D'Artagnian (and was clearly never breastfed by his mother). Not to mention the hilarious mullet that Hugh O Connor sports as the king of France!The entire film consists of swinging thin swords about, jumping onto moving carts and up and down walls while swinging said swords, meeting beautiful women, and with an exciting climax at the end. If you've read the book, good for you. I hope you enjoyed it. But if you're devoted to it, then avoid any contact with this film. It's action all out romp where the brain does not have to work hard, but just sits back, relaxes, and escapes. If you want deep 'real-life' and 'gritty' stuff, then forget it. This film has none of that. Good vs bad, simple as that.I'll be honest, I deeply loathe, despise and detest Disney Fairy stories (though animations such as Toy Story and The Lion King get a thumbs-up from me). Having said that though, the mouse house do a damn fine line up in feel-good action romps such as this one and Pirates of the Caribbean, and if you disagree then dive head first into a hospital surgery bin.

From the first scene, when D'Artagnan duels with an annoyingly shrill caricature (he didn't deserve to be called a character). His opponent is a blatant walking gay joke and is completely inappropriate for what pretends to be a family picture. Also out of place in a family picture were some of the violent images and the generous cleavage shots. Obviously the movie veers from the novel, but it veers so far that the book becomes source material in name only. Aramis is no longer the pious gentleman of Dumas' novel, but instead he is...well, Charlie Sheen with a Bible and cross. The plot is almost completely thrown out and the exact opposite of virtually everything in the book happens. Worst of all, Milady DeWinter is transformed from one of the most evil creatures ever into a sympathetic character who is not really bad and only dies because she chooses to sacrifice herself. The script, if it can even be called a script, is hopelessly corny. It feels like they were trying to do the kind of movie they ended up making with Pirates of the Caribbean but failed miserably. The screenwriter hacks it up, showing no knowledge of ballistics (for the last time, cannonballs DO NOT EXPLODE!), anatomy (a wound to the gut may be fatal, but it will not kill a man within a few seconds), or military procedures (the King's guards would be going into war with the King, not disbanding!), and certainly no knowledge of the Dumas novel. Some things were kept, those things being the three-way duel and the fact that Athos used to be married to Milady. That's pretty much it. Really. That's it. I know we can't expect a page for page adaptation, but this was just awful. Oliver Platt's performance as Porthos was the one good thing, and even then I think it was more Platt being himself than playing the character.

What does the 1993 adaptation have in common with the source novel? Practically nothing. (What else did you expect from a Disney film?) The characters' names are the same, the character traits remain to a lesser degree. And...well, that's about it.Now, I love the novel. As a relatively sophisticated reader/movie goer, I know I should really take the movie to task for removing pretty much all of the depth and color of Dumas's story and interpreting everything in basically the most cartoonish and two-dimensional manner possible. I really should.But...I just can't let this movie go. It's a rollicking, fast-paced swashbuckler with a decidedly old-fashioned feel. The use of vibrant color, the grand and elaborate sets, the simple yet energetic action sequences; I'm reminded of a sweeping adventure film MGM might have made in the forties or fifties.The cast is particularly strong, and all the actors seem to be having a ball in their roles. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect for the brooding Athos; Charlie Sheen is wry as the pious Aramis; and Oliver Platt chews the scenery as the arrogant, eccentric Porthos. Chris O'Donnell, as the ambitious D'Artagnan, interjects himself quite ably into the group dynamic, and the four leads develop great chemistry with one another throughout the film. Tim Curry and Michael Wincott soar to great heights in their cartoonish villainy, and Rebecca De Mornay is alluring and tragic as Lady DeWinter.Michael Kamen's score is romantic and bombastic and triumphant--perfect for the tone of the film. Heck, I even like the Rod Stewart/Bryan Adams/Sting collaboration, All For Love, that plays over the credits--clearly calculated to help the soundtracks sell copies, but dammit, I still believe in their sincerity! (Well, maybe sincerity is too strong a word.)

The main problem for this it has to be said is the casting of O'Donnel as D'Artaignion he doesn't have the screen presence to pull it off.The other problem is that the story has already been done fantastically in Richard Lester's Musketeer films comparing the Musketeers across films it shows just how good the 70's cast were. Sheen is no match for Chamberlains Aramis and how can anyone compare to Oliver Reed as Athos? Certainly Sutherland doesn't here. The films main successful cast member is the always excellent Oliver Platt who steals every scene he's in and is the only truly memorable feature of the movie.Of the bad guys Curry is by turns brilliant in one scene and hopelessly over the top in another, Michael Wincott is menacing as Rochfort but again comparing it with the 70's version not as good as Christopher Lee.This isn't a bad film , it's average and why make an average movie of a story thats been done brilliantly before by a far superior cast?

The plot in this movie did not follow the original plot and there was not enough dialogue between some very important characters from the book. Yes, this movie is meant for entertaining the kids and family, and I will admit there were a couple of times where I laughed at it, but that was mostly because of how stupid and inaccurate the screen writer made the movie.The whole plot is where the Cardinal, who is portrayed as an evil, merciless man, dismisses the musketeers as the king's bodyguards so the musketeers wouldn't be in the way of his evil plan to become king and in comes D'Artagnan who is just itching to be a musketeer like his father finds out about the Cardinal's plot so he and the three musketeers have to go and stop the evil plot. D'Artagnan is a naive and hot-headed little boy and perhaps a bit stupid; Athos is a brave drunk; Aramis is a humble, religious man yet a seducer(?); and Porthos is an arrogant womanizer and a pirate?!?!?! Where exactly did the pirate come from? When D'Artagnan found out Porthos was a pirate, he was actually AMAZED by it! Amazed by it? If D'Artagnan ever first found this out in the first place, he would not even step a foot near Porthos again! Did Disney even know back then that if you were found out to be a pirate or associating yourself with a pirate, you would be hanged?!?!?!?!?! Obviously not! They just think that everything they do in this movie is possible, even with a pirate being able to be a musketeer, not to mention a religious man such as Aramis being a seducer!And where exactly did the ninja come from? This takes place in the 17th century in France, so how exactly does the ninja fit in this movie? If this was a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then maybe I would find the ninja believable, but since this is NOT a ninja or samurai version of The Three Musketeers, then I would have to say that Disney did a pretty poor job at creating this movie!The movie was entertaining, but just stupid. Do yourselves and your kids a favor, don't have them watch this horrible crap because it just gives them the wrong idea on the actual historic figures and facts.

And I was right - but this one isn't bad (although re the former, I wish the film quality was a little better and Faye Dunaway wasn't quite so over the top). Maybe a purist would be a bit offended, but I found the chemistry, the clowning, and the come-as-you-are attitudes of Oliver Platt, Charlie Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland great fun. They didn't take the movie too seriously, so neither did I. Chris O'Donnell did a basic job as a country yahoo come to the big city, and tagged along with the other three quite well, which is, after all, what D'Artagnon was supposed to do.With the man who is apparently the hardest working chap in show business, Tim Curry (is there anything he hasn't done?) playing the evil Cardinal with slight panache (didn't overdo it, which could have been so easy), and Rebecca De Mornay playing what I thought was one of her best roles ever as the Lady deWinter, the overall cast wasn't too bad.The stunts and sword fights also weren't bad; contemporary realism was much better in the 1973 movie but this one was much more lighthearted and that's a fine thing. There are shifts from Dumas in character attitudes, in keeping with that lightheartedness; again, purists may be offended but I found them in keeping with the overall tone of the movie (which, after all, is a Disney flick).I found the song rather an abrupt change to the soundtrack - all for one and one for love put me in mind of a fast food jingle - but that's just my taste (puns, I just walk into them).OK, maybe it's not going to last forever as a classic, but it has some fine lines to pass the time, and it's got Porthos the Pirate in it.

Have the scriptwriters even read the book???! It's as if all they have bothered to research is 'All for one and one for all' - which is repeated again and again (even though it is in fact the wrong way round!) There are so many bits missed out so many vital parts of the plot - (there is no diamond studs episode, Constance survives etc) and so many inventions (musketeers disbanded, Rochefort as an ex-musketeer murdering D'artagnan's father etc) The characters are mostly miscasted - mainly because they are all about 10 years younger than they ought to be (or 30 years younger in the case of the king). The are a few comic lines from the Three Musketeers who do their best in an awful movie, and Tim Curry is quite evil but unfortunately has one awful line after another which completely undercut his leering and evil grins. Rebecca DeMournay gives a pretty flat performance as Milady but this is simply because of the appalling script. In most cases the actors are trying their best but with such a film they are doomed to failure.I understand that this is Disney and they want to make a film that children will enjoy that has action and adventure etc. However I fail to see why they have to ruin a masterpiece of a story in order to achieve their aim. As a child I adored the 1949 version with Gene Kelly so there is no reason why the plot has to be changed so much for children to enjoy it. Dogtanian was a brilliant childrens cartoon of the three musketeers which left all of the characters and storyline intact - Why does Disney have to ruin it? It is not even as if the true spirit and honour of the Muskteers and what they stand for, comes across successfully. Having every other character 'All-for-one-ing' all the way through is not the same thing at all. Having a lecherous Cardinal who is more interested in sex than anything else is hardly ideal for a children's film anyway. And what is all that rubbish about the Cardinal inheriting the throne??! What sort of rules of succession did Hollywood think existed in France?Children might enjoy this film but I will never show it to mine.

Most of the performers are miscast. The only one who does an OK job was Kiefer Sutherland as Athos. Charlie Sheen, as Aramis and Hugh O'Connor as Louis XIII are useless. Julie Delpy (one of the greatest French actresses) is used only to show Chris O'Donnell gets the girl. She is on the screen for five minutes. Oliver Platt was supposed to be fatter for this role and Rebecca De Mornay scarier. Remember her in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle? The second biggest problem is the villain. Tim Curry is not frightening at all. He is definitely no Glenn Close (I made this comparison because she appears as Cruella DeVil in another Stephen Herek movie).But let's dissect the plot. The biggest problem of the movie. The Cardinal will become king after the king is assassinated? If I did not know any French history, maybe I would believe it. But since I know some, the idea is laughable. If the king of France does not have any male heirs (girls were always excluded) the crown goes to the younger brother. The Cardinal had absolutely no chance of getting the crown if he was not related to the king, and he was not. And anyway that's not what happens in the book. The script is a very bad adaptation. 3/10.

Many reviews defend this version by saying that it is a family film. In fact it is probably less tame than the novel. For instance, Cardinal Richelieu is always (hilariously) looking down the shirt of every woman he comes into contact with, including Queen Anne of Austria. At one point, he actually tries to grab the breasts (!!!) of Milady deWinter, but she stops him with a dagger. No mention is made of D'Artagnan's adultery with Constance Bonacieux; however, towards the beginning, priest Aramis is about to commit adultery with a bombshell whom he is coaching in theology!!! There's plenty of death (albeit without blood) and even a bit of torture. So you see, this isn't really a family film, so why not stay true to the original plot? Perhaps, if the intention is to lower the IQs of movie-going families, the filmmakers have succeeded.That's not to say that the movie has no saving graces, which is why I gave it a 3, not a zero. There are actually plenty of witty lines, but that's all this movie has going for it, besides the inadvertent humor. Most of the funny lines revolve around sex, like when Milady tells Richelieu, I don't think you're burdened by chastity.Now let's talk about funny things that make this movie so bad. D'Artagnan's name is laughably pronounced in an American accent, Dartanian. Chris O'Donnell interprets the role of D'Artagnan as an imbecile. He lands himself in prison for confronting a bunch of the Cardinal's guards alone, and then he threatens his captor (Captain Rochefort) during interrogation. It's a miracle he didn't get killed right then and there. D'Artagnan is supposed to be boorish but smart, not a numbskull. Much of O'Donnell's acting is absolutely wooden!The Cardinal has this goofy goatee that makes him look ridiculous when he smiles. His plan is to make a secret alliance with the Duke of Buckingham who is going to invade France, and then make himself KING OF France!!! Why this complete reversal of the plot into something completely unrealistic and stupid? Anyway, I could go on and on. I think even as a kid I thought this movie was stupid. Any kid could benefit more from seeing the Richard Lester version or, better yet, reading the book! To sum it up, this movie would probably make Dumas roll around in his grave.

More than often the plot of a book HAS to be changed significantly (cutting minor characters, subplots...) to translate well on screen. But there are times when this revisionist attitude goes too far, and this version of The Three Musketeers is one of them. The classic novel by Dumas p√®re is a fairly straightforward action/adventure tale, so it's surprising they felt the need to dumb it down by ruining the character of Richelieu, radically altering the story and adding an abominable final act - which features scenes such as Richelieu shooting Aramis with a hidden gun and ludicrous boss battles.Sutherland is not a bad choice as Athos, and could have been acceptable in a serious adaptation. Sheen and Platt, two capable performers, are miscast - or better, their characters have been rewritten to suit them. O'Donnell simply lacks the charisma and fire required by the part.It's not entirely Curry's fault (albeit his Monty Python-ish performance is an embarrassment), but Richelieu is the movie's worst blunder the Cardinal in the book is an intriguing, textured character, not a ghoul-like, sneering ubervillain. Other players (De Mornay, Wincott, Delpy) are better, although saddled with pathetic material.Watch the 1948 adaptation instead (the one with Gene Kelly, Lana Turner and Vincent Price) a better movie, closer to the book and with MUCH BETTER sword duels.4/10 "},{"Title":"Made to fit in the family movie category.","Date":"8 March 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" This is a quite safe, undetailed and conventionally entertaining adaptation of the Musketeers' story directed somewhat towards young audiences.

It may be called a good family movie to watch in a tired mind.The cast is not bad. Keifer Sutherland, whom I consider as one of the most underrated actor of our time, is a good Athos. Charlie Sheen as Aramis is also fine. But Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan ? That was perhaps a poor choice. And I don't know, Oliver Platt is just not good enough to be Porthos.

You know, the one that doesn't require to you pass a certain height, or bring along an adult?The definitive interpretation goes to the Salkind Brothers' production of the early seventies, directed by Richard Lester.

Most of us know this wonderful tale of male bonding and intrigue from the many translations of this series and, for those who don't like to read, from the many films which have appeared.  The role of D'Artagnan, the young farmer's boy from Gascony, who comes to town to join the King's Musketeers has been brought to the screen by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks, Gene Kelly and Michael York.  This role and story makes for lots of cinematic fun and the lead role is a great one for a scene-chewing ham.  But, with Chris O'Donell, we don't get ham, we get bad baloney.  The truth is, this film, like the gharish DeCaprio sequel which appeared a year or so later, Man in the Iron Mask, is a made-for-high-school-kids, costume teen flick.  That, I guess, is forgivable but this version is a bad one.  Tim Curry, of Rocky Horror fame is a grinning parody of the insidious Richelieu and the supporting fellows of the wannabe musketeer, O'Donnell, Sutherland, Platt and Sheen-- while competent actors in their own rights-- seem to stumble through their roles making the entire film, a caricature of this wonderful classic tale.If you love costume drama and the classic tales of adventure, you'll no doubt be very disappointed with this piece of celluloid manure.  If, on the other hand, you're a teener with a love for loud music, catchy & defiant phrases and pure nonsensical action that has neither historical connection nor relevance to life in general, then you'll likely find this film worthy of the price of a Blockbuster rental.Alas, the bitter truth, with the array of talent such as Curry, Platt, Sheen and Sutherland, this could have been a decent film.  Having seen all of the classic remakes of this film, including all of the offshoots that I could find, I found this mindless, poorly written abuse of a great story to be the worst.

I take only one example of what I say a physical fight between the King of France, and Richelieu, on a small boat, ending in the fall of Richelieu in the water. I do not at all object on making funny movies about historical personages, showing them ridiculous, etc,.. but this movie refers to a book with a perfect story.

But along the way our excruciatingly lame hero D'Artagnan insists on picking fights with everybody and wasting time, thus missing a hostile takeover of the group he wants so badly to be a part of.  Only three of the most noble musketeers remain, and along with the arrogant asshole D'Artagan they stab villains, inadvertently seduce women, make lame quips, stab villains, kill a dungeon-ridden freak, kill Tim Curry, save the king, stab some villains, and stab some villains.  The very first fifteen to twenty-five minutes of this movie seem promising, but it soon becomes very repetitive and predictable (even if you don't already know the story). Also, the musketeers are shown bludgeoning, belittling, shooting, and stabbing victims without any weapons to fight back with--  and they're supposed to come off as honorable men.  Fooey.

And for a good reason, for it is a great story, full of adventure, political intrigue, great characters and daring deeds. Yet I'd claim that it is not really suited for being a movie. Or at least I haven't seen a version yet that manages to capture the spirit and greatness of the original novel.That being said, despite its obvious flaws, this particular film is actually rather enjoyable. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Oliver Platt portray Aramis, Athos and Porthos, respectively, while Chris O'Donnell plays D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is a son of a musketeer, an elite guard of the king of France, and is all set out to become one himself. Unfortunately, just as he travels to Paris, Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) has disbanded the musketeers as obsolete and outdated, all while vying for power over the young king. And thus all the musketeers have put down their swords. All except three, thus the title.What the movie gets right is the energy and the adventure. All the main characters are played by good actors and they give solid, entertaining performances. Curry is especially enjoyable as a completely over the top villain. The action scenes are also very good and the whole film looks very nice, having great production values. Definitely a film for all adventure fans.Where the film fails is as an adaptation. The events of the book are not followed all that closely and a lot of the story lines have been completely dropped. And even when they follow the book, it seems that they are in a rush. Like the scene where D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers meet for the first time. It is a classic scene that been imitated countless of times, but in this film it happens in under five minutes. Like they were in a terrible hurry, which is a real disservice to such a great scene.All in all, The Three Musketeers is at its best if you don't know all that much about the original story from the book.

Now told under the name of Walt Disney Productions, and from the director of Bill & Ted and The Mighty Ducks, Stephen Herek.Although it may not the most accurate or layered adaptation of Dumas' tale, Disney's 90s version still offers a decent swashbuckler. This is down to a charismatic cast, special points towards the great Michael Wincott and his icy voice as the deadly Rochefort, alongside a wonderfully charming Platt as the bon-vivant Porthos, who provides the brunt of the comedy in the film with his hands-off lifestyle. Throw in some nifty and uncluttered sword fights shot with patience and grace instead of clumsy shaky cam, and even a playful yet also thrilling score by the late Michael Kamen, and these go a way to help out.However, don't expect a lot of the intricacies, extensive development and politics of the original story, or the self awareness of the more renowned Richard Lester films of the 70s. This as basic and lean a 'Musketeers' telling as you'll find anywhere. Plus, being a 90s Disney live-action film, it's super safe and predictable, even for a story as often told as this one. You can tell who's good, who's bad and what happens next right from the word go, thanks to often hammy performances from the support cast, as well as rather basic, rote dialogue.Regardless, as far as its brethren of that era go, this is one of the company's better live-action efforts amidst a slew of lame remakes and comedian star vehicles.

Never a great actor, he seems to have been very fortunate to get some great roles. He starred opposite Al Pacino in 'Scent Of A Woman' the same year as this. Al Pacino acted him off the screen, and won the Oscar, but he was there none the less. Then he managed to nab the role of Robin in 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman & Robin. He then landed a few leading roles in movies, before he turned to TV for regular acting work. Not bad for a guy who can't act and has zero charisma. De Mornay's performance is baffling as her performance gives the impression, she thought the movie was something totally different. Hugh O Conor as King Louis is another weak link, as is Gabrielle Anwar. With a better d'Artagnan, someone like a Brad Pitt or a Johnny Depp (tho Pitt had 'True Romance' and 'Kalifornia' out that year, whilst Depp was starting in 'Benny & Joon' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' so maybe they weren't available.... Likewise Leo DiCaprio, Depp's costar in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' He also started in 'This Boys Life' with Robert De Niro. Maybe a Neil Patrick Harris (famous for being TV's Dougie Houser MD then) and some improvement in the supporting cast? this would have done better, and would have had franchise wrote all over it. Sheen and Suthwrland are both as fun and reliable as you'd expect, and Platt (the go to fat guy of the 90's) steals a lot of scenes, and had some good lines.

I am hear to tell you that that's the point. This version of The Three Musketeers was never about being an accurate adaptation. While it highlights key components of the story and some history (like who the Musketeers were, etc) it was meant to focus more on (to quote Charlie Sheen on the Behind the Scenes on the DVD) the camaraderie. the essence of brotherhood. I also noticed people complaining it's not a family film. Of course it's not. It's not just Disney it's also a Touchstone film. Yes, I know Disney (either owns or is merged with Touchstone.

It's not *our* history. It is (implicitly) set in a parallel world, possibly - no, probably - the same one in which the delightfully silly sword-romp At Sword's Point (1952 ) is set. And this too is a delightfully silly sword-romp, not to be taken seriously in the least.Almost every time the story is revisited, the character of Athos gets another softening. In the book he murdered (or attempted to murder) his wife out-of-hand, without waiting for her to regain consciousness and try to explain (what an SOB!), and still hates even her memory. The relationship never comes up in Fairbanks Sr's The Three Musketeers, and is barely hinted at in a reaction-shot in The Iron Mask - which still manages to make clear that there's some real bad history there. By the 1948 version, he merely repudiated her - and never ceased to love her. In the 1993 version he believed her guilty of murder and turned her over to her enemies, and grieved for her ever after.I don't have a favorite version of The Three Musketeers - each and every one I have seen is flawed, usually in different ways.

Perfectly easy viewing, yes, but also uninspired and disposable.D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) is on his way to Paris to become a musketeer as was his now-dead father before him. However, his timing couldn't be worse, for as he arrives in Paris he learns that the musketeers have just been disbanded by the scheming Cardinal Richlieu (Tim Curry). Only a handful of musketeers remain loyal to their uniform &#x96; most notably the daring trio of Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt) and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Via a series of coincidences, D'Artagnan falls in with these three adventurers and finds himself fighting to restore the musketeers and overthrow the Cardinal before he seizes control of France. Their main quest is to track down a cunning spy, Milady De Winter (Rebecca De Mornay), and force her into revealing how the Cardinal intends to put his plans into effect. They must also save the King (Hugh O'Conor) from an audacious assassination attempt.Considering how slight and unambitious the film is, the makers have managed to get together a truly star-studded cast. On the whole, though, each actor is wasted in a largely underwritten and forgettable role. Sheen in particular seems to exist pointlessly on the periphery of the action and has virtually nothing to do. Likewise, O'Donnell and Sutherland have too little to work with to make their characters genuinely identifiable. Platt has it slightly better as the boozy and high-spirited Porthos, while Curry easily walks away with the movie by doing his best impression of a pantomime villain as the sinister Cardinal. The film's many action sequences are well choreographed and spectacular, but lack true spirit. Much of the photography &#x96; with Cornwall and Austria standing in for 17th century France &#x96; is pleasing to the eye and lends the film a polished look. It's not hard to sit through The Three Musketeers &#x96; it moves quickly and smoothly from one entertaining sequence to the next. But it IS hard to view it as anything more than a simple time-filler, and a dumbed-down version of a story that should really contain so much more depth "}{"Title":"I really like it!","Date":"5 February 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I have read the book, which is very good, and I have seen the Gene Kelly version and the 1973 film which I think are both better.

The king and Queen were a bit young, but at least they can act, particularly the lovely Gabrielle Anwar. Now for the pros. Great music by Michael Kamen, and Tim Curry's (one of the better actors in the film) Cardinal Richelieu is very slimy. It's not his best performance,he overdid the character at times, but I was entertained by one of my favourite actors, as he had some good lines like Austria's loss is France's gain . Kiefer Sutherland was good too, and Michael Wincott was also impressive. Charlie Sheen likewise, but Oliver Platt had some truly funny lines, and delivered them with zany zest. The film itself looks beautiful, with nice locations, cinematography and costumes, and I liked Rebecca DeMornay as Milady. The only problem I had with Milady was the way she died, completely unfaithful to the book.

The four of them are going against the villainous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) who is trying to get King Louis (Hugh O'Conor) off the throne, to rule England for himself. His right hand Rochefort (Michael Wincott) is the one who officially announces the disbanding of the King's Musketeers, but fighter and drinker Athos, pirate and lover Porthos, priest and poet Aramis, and eager and brave D'Artagnan refuse to throw down their swords. After capturing fellow villain, the mysterious Countess D'Winter (Rebecca De Mornay), they uncover this plot and do whatever they can to stop the Cardinal, and protect King and Country, all for one and one for all. Also starring Gabrielle Anwar as Queen Anne, Paul McGann as Girard / Jussac and Julie Delpy as Constance. O'Donnell is a little more bearable than usual (only other time is Batman Forever), the three stars as the musketeers all get their moments, but the Americanisation is a bit silly, and there aren't enough action bits, but it's a swashbuckling comedy adventure worth seeing once at least.

DeMornay does what she's known for doing, if toned down what with this being a family film. Parts of this are irritating to everyone over the age of seven. The story is easy enough to follow.

The fact that I liked it is a fact about ME, and not the film, which is not, I'll admit, very good.  But there is one fact about the film I'd like to draw everyone's attention to.  The musketeers  clearly think morality is something very important, but their concrete notions of right and wrong are decidedly odd.  In fact they're downright primitive like Aristotlean physics, only sillier.  There is so little common ground between the code of honour of the musketeer and our own code that we throw up our hands in despair; we don't even bother to adopt the musketeer's code as our own for the purposes of the fiction; and yet, somehow, our sympathy is always with the musketeer.I shouldn't say `somehow'.  This strange feeling of sympathy is something to write home about when one encounters it in the novel, whereas in the film we have a villain - a cardinal, no less, and who likes cardinals - who all but has horns and a tail.  Still, SOME feeling of forlorn bloodlust carries over from the book, to give a tint to what would otherwise be a very colourless film.

The 'wronged sister' gang, apparently inserted for comic relief, is entirely unnecessary, as the Musketeers are comic enough themselves. Nor is the gang particularly amusing.The tragic love affair involving the de Mornay character was quite touching in Dumas' original, unfortunately the film makers dropped the ball here. My guess is they substituted action for story development and this fell by the wayside. Of course, casting the King as a good guy, or any French king, is laughable. Especially amusing for the idealistic values he espouses. All the kings of France got a good laugh at that little speech.Which leads to the 3rd failure too much action, i.e. way too many casualties, more than necessary.

King Louis XIII was a real person, as was his wife, Anne of Austria. Cardinal Richelieu as prime minister held France together during the reign of a weak king, and D'artangan was a real person as well. Dumas made up a great story about the general's early life and threw in a fictional plot involving the queen's love for the English prime minister. In the end Richelieu wins, D'artangan's love Constance dies and the Musketeers barely preserve their lives and their freedom.There have been many movies made from the book, or parts of it, and discussions can center around how good the film was, or how faithful it was to the book, but that doesn't apply here. There are things to like about this one, notably some of the acting, but the story has nothing whatever to do with the book. I like Tim Curry, but his over-the-top style is way out of place for the great nemesis of the story, and Constance as the gun-toting defender of the Queen?I can't call it the worst Three Musketeers ever, becauseA) It has absolutely nothing to do with the Three Musketeers except for the names, andB) I haven't seen the Ang Lee movie The Musketeer.

D'Artagnan, a fresh-faced wanna-be Musketeer, comes to Paris seeking his fortune and future and manages to get mixed up with the legendary Athos, Aramis, and Porthos, as well as one of Queen Anne's comely ladies-in-waiting, and a sinister villainess.This Disney version isn't completely faithful to the novel or to history, but then, if you want historical accuracy, you shouldn't be watching something inspired by the works of Alexandre Dumas! As it is, its a ripping good time, with Oliver Platt as Porthos being the stand-out in the Musketeers, and Tim Curry chews the scenery quite effectively as the good Cardinal. Unlike the kung-fu Musketeer, this version not only keeps in Constance (though altered from her literary counterpart, and given a happy ending), but also Buckingham, and my favorite, Milady de Winter. Though, sadly, I hate how every movie feels it must tone down or redeem her character -- such an icy cold villainess is just too threatening, I suppose.One thing I remember clearly from this version is the bright, rich colors -- the brillant red of Richelieu's cloak, which swirled and breathed like a living creature, and the smooth whites and golds and blues of the French court. Though the characters are a bit cleaner and have more teeth than real 17th century Frenchmen would, I much prefer this look to the drab Man In the Iron Mask with Dicaprio. Besides, unlike the Dicaprio-helmed vehicle, I didn't notice nine or ten different pronunciations of D'Artagnan's name! .Nichol.

Well, more accurately, swords and guns, but mainly swords? This movie attempts to recapture that, a time back in France when to be a musketeer in the service of the king was one of the greatest honours you could possibly have.D'artagnan (O'Donnell) is a young man who has dreamed his whole life of becoming a musketeer, just like his father before him. He is on his way to Paris to join the musketeers, only to get there and find out that they have just been disbanded. He gets this information from Athos (Sutherland) when he stops by musketeer headquarters, and he manages to get himself penciled in for a duel at twelve o'clock with Athos. Later in the day he meets Porthos (Platt), offends him as well, and gets a duel scheduled for one o'clock. Shortly after that, he encounters Aramis (Sheen) and arranges a duel with him too, for two o'clock. Sounds like a busy day. Too bad he didn't know ahead of time that these three men were the last musketeers.When D'artagnan gets ready to have his first duel, the Cardinal's guards show up to interrupt the party and arrest the musketeers. D'artagnan fights with the musketeers, then they ride off, leaving him alone. It's about then that a few more of the Cardinal's guards show up, along with Captain Rochefort. D'artagnan is arrested and taken to the dungeons below the castle. He then escapes and eavesdrops on a conversation between the Cardinal (Curry) and the Countess D'Winter. In this conversation he learns about the Cardinal's secret plans to make an alliance with the Duke of Buckingham in an effort to overthrow the king and take the throne for himself. D'artagnan is caught eavesdropping and brought before the Cardinal, and then the order is given for him to be beheaded.Our three friends who were scheduled to duel with D'artagnan and seemed to have just disappeared show up to help D'artagnan out of his little jam. He tells them about the Cardinal's plans, they get the heck out of there, and go to find the spy that is heading over to the Duke of Buckingham in order to find out in more detail what the Cardinal's plans are.So, I think that's enough of the general gist of the story.

Rather serious, mildly funny, and wanting to be what his father was, this young man shows excellent rapier technique, cool moves, and the unwillingness to leave others behind that characterizes the musketeers. And we cannot forget the delicately adorable king who they are fighting to save, or the dastardly villain Cardinal Richelieu.

Defend it.","Date":"8 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  I not only liked this movie, but I feel a need to defend it and the Walt Disney company.Walt Disney movies are notorious for plot changes. Almost no movie touched by them is safe from this process. From cartoon production to live action films, any adaptation by Disney is going to have plot changes to suit there vision of the final product. For example, their cartoon The Sword in the Stone bears almost no resemblance to the original story of King Arthur.To say that Disney does not stick to the original plot is like saying an elephant does not ride a bicycle. It is obvious, even before you see it, that this is not going to happen. This is why they are adaptations. The definition of adaptation is The condition of being made suitable to an end. Disney sets what they want the end product to be and adapt the story line to meet that goal. They did, however, remain close enough to the original story line that one who had not read the original might be intrigued enough to do so.This movie was made for one reason... to entertain. Sure money was a motive, but if it does not entertain, it does not make money. And, as with most Disney adaptations, if you approach it with the understanding that liberties have been taken, it not only can entertain, but can be downright enjoyable as well. Disney will never fully stick to an original story line for any adaptation they produce. This is how they make it theirs. This is how they give it that twist that a lot of people have come to expect from a Disney film. And once this IS expected going into the movie, you can watch it in the spirit in which it was released.And remember this, the cast all had the opportunity to read the script BEFORE they agreed to make the movie. If they had any qualms about the quality of the writing, you can be assured they would not have put their reputations on the line.

It is not only the closest to the book, but it is also the wittiest. The casting in itself was genius. With Oliver Platt (Lake Placid, Dr. Dolittle) playing the wise cracking Porthos the pirate to perfection, Charlie Sheen (Spin City, The Chase) playing the god fearing Aramis with ease, Chris O'Donnell (Batman forever, Batman and Robin) playing the youngest musketeer D'Artagnan with a subtle charm and arrogance, and Kiefer Sutherland playing the brooding, melancholy musketeer leader Athos with undying depression, you can't miss. I highly recommend this film to anyone who remembers playing swashbucklers or cops and robbers as a child. Not only does this version have the best looking musketeer, but it also has the most magnetic person as the villian, Tim Curry (Congo, Rocky Horror Picture Show). Although most rememebred for his untouchable role as Dr. Frank N. Futter in Rocky Horror, Curry captures Cardinal Richelieu with such perfection, it's hard to remember he is only acting. I found myself so enthralled my this movie, I was actually yelling at the acreen.

It's really a kid's movie but I found it to be funny and exciting.  I have read a lot of criticism of the fact that it is not a precise recreation of the book.I would respond to that with a resounding DUUUUUH!  This is a Disney movie folks.  Do we get upset that in the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarves the wicked witch doesn't stab Snow White in the head with a poison comb?  Nope.  Disney took a concept and tried to make a fun adventure movie out of it.  They succeeded.I love the characters, especially Porthos.  Oliver Platt pulls off the role like a champion.  He's pompous and brazen.  My favorite line comes in the great carriage chase.  Porthos pops up from the Cardinal's carriage with a bottle of champagne.  Champagne?He offers. Porthos, we're in the middle of a chase, points out a slightly annoyed Athos (Kiefer Sutherland). You're right...Something red.  That kills me.So if you're looking for a family-safe, exciting adventure movie with swordplay and great cinematography check it out.  If you're looking for a critically acclaimed recreation of a classic novel, GET THE HECK OUT OF THE DISNEY SECTION!

I believe it could have had  a slightly more serious tone to the story, and maybe should've been a little bit more dramatic. There were to many scenes where it goes from serious to comedy. I couldn't tell if the Producer was trying to get into a serious sub-plot with Countess DeWinter(played by Rebecca DeMornay)and her Ex-Lover Athos(played by Kiefer Sutherland)and after the movie takes a turn toward a more serious story line when Countess DeWinter commits suicide, and then the story goes back to being a comedy again. But the action scenes are fun to watch and the costumes are done well. However the 1998 film Man in the Iron Mask will blow this film away.This one as fun as it is to watch, it just doesn't take itself serious enough. Ironicaly I belive this was the best acting that Kiefer Sutherland ever did, He played his role perfect, there is a scene where the 3 musketeers are in a brothel and D'tagnan (played by Chris O'dennell) approaches Keifer's charactor who is drinking alone because he is remembering his past heartaches, you can almost see the years of heartach in his eyes, and hear the echos of his regreted past in his voice in that scene. Kiefer gave his best ever performace as an actor in this movie.Kiefer plays the role of Athos with seriousness,drama, and believebility.Unfortunatly, Kiefer's briliant performace is surrounded by often comical scenes which makes Kiefer's briliant acting seem out of place in this film.

Richelieu may have been indifferent to the suffering of poor folks but he was a statesman, not a monster. I was looking forward to some lighthearted fun.
