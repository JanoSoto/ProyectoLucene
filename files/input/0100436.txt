Parents do seem to hate you, it is incredibly hard to talk to a girl that you want to ask out and school is the last place you ever want to be. This film had the emotions just about right.I now see its faults but I still feel that it is an excellent movie to its targeted age group, everyone who ever wanted to rise up in the cafeteria and stab them (teachers) with your plastic fork.I could fill this review with quotes, the speech on why teen suicide is a bad idea is up there with the Am I funny? scene in goodfella's.Christian Slater is excellent, apparently it's his favourite movie and you can see that he enjoyed making it. He does dark-teen like no one else, this is Nicholson at 16! In my humble opinion this film is at the top of the teen-flick chart alongside Heathers.Samantha Mathis makes an intriguing leading lady, she really gets her character spot on. Miss Mathis also provides one of the best sexual tension scenes ever in this genre. (it's all in the music)A young Seth Green also makes an appearance that I am sure he would rather forget, his acting is fine it's how he looks thats the problem !!This film is dark, funny and brutaly honest. If you are under 20 and still hate the world this will kill a couple of those boring 'too old to play to young to drink' hours.Highly recommended.

Aside from a couple of things that make it dated (I'm referring mainly to the opening credit sequence and the way some of the characters dress...mulletts WERE acceptable back then), the message remains the same and I think that's what has made this movie stand the test of time.  Along with Heathers, this is some of Christian Slater's best work ever.  His performance alone is enough to reccommend this one, but that combined with the message, make it a cult classic.

Also brought out the tension between media for the people and free speech vs. media polluting the people and issues of censorship.  While the film clearly made the latter out to be the bad guy, a mature person might look beyond the pointed message and see the important issues on both sides -->  Does media come from culture and speak truth, having the responsibility to honestly represent reality, or does media influence culture and thus should it responsibly rise above mediocrity, challenging people to something higher in life?  Tough issues in media studies.  How to bring the two concerns together is the challenge, in a completely corporate-driven media culture that really stands for neither.  ummmm....

Upon viewing the film for the first time as a ten-years-old kid back when it was released in cinemas, I remember feeling profoundly moved by the main lead and the events his character sets in motion. This genuine masterpiece doesn't only teach us about leadership and the ability of one individual to make a difference in the world; it is also a triumph of the human spirit in general and of the youth over decadent grown-up ideas specifically.The story presents us Mark Hunter (a then young and extremely talented Christian Slater), a teenage high school student that moves with his parents from the big city to the suburbs, when his father gets a new job as an educational consultant for a middle-America region. The days are the early nineties, when internet was probably considered radical science fiction at best, and Mark finds himself all of a sudden pretty lonely in the new school. Luckily, his parents buy him a ham radio in order to keep connected with his friends back east, and Mark finds a unique way of passing time by transmitting his thoughts about the suburbs and the lousy life of 1990 teenagers, using his ham radio as a local broadcast device. Upon gaining fame and listeners, Hunter adopts a pseudonym, one Happy Harry Hard On which brings messages of freedom of speech and thought to his fellow classmates at school. When stumbling upon information concerning illegal steps his school has taken regarding problematic students, things start to get out of control. As Mark, he tries to keep a low profile and doesn't blend in with the ongoing events, but as Harry he feels he must take a stand and speak up his thoughts and ideas. But can a voice be heard without its owner taking responsibility to its actions? The notions and ideas which arise upon viewing Pump up the Volume are intriguing and fresh until this very day, 16 years after its initial release. For the younger ones, it teaches how to stand up for what you believe in and try to right society's wrongs. For grown-ups, it serves an interesting conflict about the bounders of democracy and the part the media plays in each and every one of our lives. Look out for Samantha Mathis's powerful role as Nora DeNiro, Hunter's female admirer, and one of the only people around him that know he's behind the controversial broadcasts. Also look out for a very very young Seth Green (Austin Powers, Without a Paddle) as one of the students that helps spread Harry's tapes across the school.On a personal note, I have to say that I hold credit to this movie for a lot of who I am in my grown-up life. The film taught me I could use my words to make a difference, and for the past ten years I've been doing just that as a journalist and newspaper editor here in central Israel. For that I will always be thankful to the makers of Pump up the Volume, and I suspect it'll stay my all-time favorite for years and years to come! Naturally, I rank this one a must-see film, with a 10 out of 10 rating.

The movie starts out with Mark Hunter (Christian Slater) a.k.a. Hard Harry running a pirate radio show, he is listened to by the students of Hubert Humphery High School and by a teacher, Ms Emerson (Ellen Green of Talk Radio and Glory Glory). The school is being runned by a corrupt principal Loretta Creswood (Annie Ross of Superman III) who weeds out kids who she thinks are losers. Harry becomes a reluctant hero to all the students in the school, he has some raunchy moments on his radio show but he reaches in the humanity of all who listen. A girl in his class,Nora Diniro(Samantha Mathis)learns who Hard Harry is, but won't tell anyone. Mark is so unhappy with moving out to Arizona, His father, Brian Hunter (Scott Paulin)who runs the school district and mother, Marla Hunter (Mimi Kennedy of Dahrma and Greg) try to help him but only push him away, Mark has some inner demons he has a hard time dealing with, one of his callers, Malcolm Kaiser wants to commit suicide and Harry does little to talk him out of it. Harry feels bad that he doesn't do anything to help him, he says somethings about being a teenager and also suicide, he made some real good points their. Harry falls for Nora, he opens up to her. Later on, the FCC are called in to find Hard Harry. Miss Creswood is later exposed and is suspended by Brian Hunter after finding out about her shady ways, thanks to Ms. Emerson. Harry tells his listeners to not to give up and live, he is nabbed and taken away.I feel that this movie really touched on some issues on being a teen and being to speak your thoughts. The cast really did a wonderful job, the supporting cast, Andy Romano (Admiral Bates of Under Siege 1 and 2) as Mr. Murdock, Cheryl Pollack as Paige Woodward, James Hampton (Teen Wolf 1 and 2 and Sling Blade) as Arthur Watts of the FCC.

I was a DJ during that time. And you have no idea what schools tried to get away with back then. Ask anyone who was in high school in the 1984-1990 time frame.

If you never heard it, then you have no basis for an opinion on it. If you could jump into the Wayback Machine and travel back to the 1984-1990 time frame, you'd be able to listen to the AM and FM pirate stations of the time.

The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine.It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched &#x96; and not for him &#x96; Young Guns II) as well as a star I would fall in love with for thereafter Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie.I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting &#x96; finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the gay lifestyle I heard around me.)And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his Clark Kent image of Mark was transformed into the Superman Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it.Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of.Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious Lois Lane of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry?A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true.They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue &#x96; he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone.I rated this with the highest rating I give 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold &#x96; see well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out.This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality. - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of Network or Rebel Without a Cause, Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution.In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called the end of history, a time populated by what Nietzsche called the last men; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to something better. This goes against the there is no alternative (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of no alternative politics and its credo of permanent scarcity and necessary poverty. Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas.One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, he argued that the existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit, and that the cruel monotony of the system produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face. From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in Principles of Political Economy essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because that way they wouldn't breed too heavily. In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity.So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself Hard Harry, and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, the lyrics everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed heralding his audio rants. All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks, he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths.Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). The truth is a virus, Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most! Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's Freedom of Speech by Above the Law, Ice T states I've no time to whisper in your ear, Hunter plays Wave of Mutilation by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say Accused and convicted for nothing and Liquid Jesus Stand, and they will make you crawl.Nothing is more important than a good education! adults tell Hunter. Except the basic right to it, he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism.Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man. Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down.8.9/10 &#x96; One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

Unfortunately he can't always help and after a student he spoke to on air carries out his threat to commit suicide the school uses it as excuse to clamp down on anybody who might know who he is.Also trying to identify him is classmate Nora, played by Samantha Mathis, she however has more luck than the authorities. When he has doubts about carrying on his broadcasts she is the one who talks him into continuing.The acting in the film is fairly solid especially from Slater and Mathis and the story is both interesting and amusing. Like most good films it isn't without its weak points; the students seem rather too uniformly fans of the broadcasts and the authorities attempts to catch him seem highly amateur although I guess if he'd been arrested five minutes into the film it wouldn't have been as interesting.Even though it was made almost twenty years ago it still feels relevant today as it did back then the only things that really dates it is the fact that there is no internet and none of the children have mobile phones like they would today.

I was tentative about the movie because the DVD had no special features whatsoever, and Christian Slater has made some bad movies over the last few years (e.g. Alone In The Dark (2005), Hard Rain (1998)). This film, however, is up there with Slater's best such as True Romance and Murder In The First.This film was made just as the decade of cheesy teen flicks had come to a close, which is why I originally thought this film would fall into that category. However, this film is remarkably good. It's so good in fact that I have already seen it twice, and will soon see it again a third time.So what makes this movie so good? For one, the insight of Hard Harry is often times hilarious, and the music he played on his pirate radio station literally foreshadows the ends of the hair metal days and the beginning of grunge. There are no hideous trends capitalized in this film, and no dated catch phrases. If this movie came out today, it would fit in pretty well aside from the fact that there are no computers in the film. Besides that, though, the film is timeless.Some people had some quarrels with the ending where you hear a collage of voices on other pirate radio stations. Some people said it was too cheesy, especially the part where the girl said, Can anyone hear me out there?. I didn't think so, though. I thought the movie ended on an inconclusive but appropriate note, and without being too over the top.If there was one thing I would have liked to have seen added to this film, it would have been more in the beginning about Christian Slater's character building the radio station. I would have liked to have seen how he did it, and also how he began building a huge following. But then again, that kind of beginning would have focused more on the rise and fall of the station than what Slater had to say as Hard Harry. It would make for a pretty good prequel though, if anyone wanted to make one by now.Overall, though, awesome film that is a vital component of my DVD collection. If you who are reading this review ever get a chance, pick up a copy at your video store. Not too many rental stores have it to rent, but Netflix probably does. Check it out for yourself.

During the 80's I felt that current teen movies were too fluffy. This movie was perfect for the 90's.While I have issues with some of the sub-plots and 2D characters, I felt it successfully illustrated the problems teenagers have, while allowing newer concepts that would have never made it to a Hollywood screen marketed towards teens during the 80's (homosexuality, and a more seriously portrayed alternative character) to be properly addressed. Oddly enough I became less closed minded about gender issues and became goth several years after first seeing this movie.I've seen most of Slaters films, and several of Mathis. I enjoyed the chemistry they share on film, and was happy to seem them together again in Broken Arrow. Slater's role in this movie was excellent, and certainly one of his best.I also appreciated the way they presented the voice that freedom of speech can take. It was a perfect prelude to the vast community of free speech that exploded around us via the Internet just a few short years later. It's sad that it would take a truly dedicated person to have such an impact online, considering how large the Internet community has grown.To all teens of this current age, I urge you to see this teen movie before any other made during the 1980's. Or even if you're an adult who recalls what it was like to be that shy, nervous teen who never fit in.

I've seen this move a lot of times on cable, and purchased the DVD when I saw it in the rack. Why?  Mainly because I'm a fan of Slater's just-this-side-of-deranged intensity, and also because of Mathis's portrayal of a not-in-the-popular-group teenager who still has a soul to speak with. Apparently the two dated for awhile; I can see the chemistry in the acting, and think it a shame that they had a falling out.  The two clicked well on screen.  Oh well, So Be It.Having been a geek with a speech impediment myself (my tongue locked up and made incomprehensible noise in the presence of cute girls, really embarrassing) AND having been the Self-Assured Voice Behind The Microphone (radio operator for a search/rescue team in college), I really think that people like Mark/Hard Harry are a tonic for what ills us.Watch this Movie.

Unlike 90% of so-called teen movies, this one doesn't rely on guns, violence or gratuitous sex.No, Pump Up the Volume raises questions - about our society, about being young, about questioning authority.  It doesn't pretend to have neat solutions to difficult problems any more than Christian Slater's character does in the film.  But it tackles more stuff than most movies, and you can laugh to it.  That alone puts it head and shoulders above most movies made for teenagers.

I'm not saying not to see this film because this is one incredible movie. But what I am saying is Everybody Knows is a song about a bunch of things that people do to deceive, cheat, lie, coerce, judge by race and many other issues that virtuous people believe that they could never be a part of. Pump Up The Volume is an important film because it shows how difficult life can be for everyone. Whether you are rich, poor, brilliant, not so smart, loner or popular socialite, we all have our problems. And this shows it from a high schoolers perspective. I think Pump Up The Volume was perhaps the complete antithesis of fun teen movies like a lot of the John Hughes comedies that came out in the 80's. Not that his films didn't show kids with their share of problems growing up, but this one is much grittier, much darker and more angry than Sixteen Candles, Fasttimes and even The Breakfast Club. PUTV had a lot to say and those of us that did see it when it came out instantly related to it. Mark/Harry brings up a lot of issues that we should all pay attention to. And I think this film relates to people on a level that very few films can. It talks to it's audience. It has insight, it has advice and sometimes it just says that it understands.Every generation has their own version of stress When you are elderly, perhaps you are worried about when your number is up. Maybe you worry about if your retirement fund is adequate enough to survive on. When you are in the prime of your adult years, perhaps you worry about how your kids are turning out, if the mortgage is going to be paid on time, if your job is secure, taxes and such. But when you are a teen your worries may not seem all that great to some adults but when you are feeling secluded, or left out, or geeky or a failure because you can't live up to your parents expectations, or you feel like a loner because you don't play sports or you don't have as much money as some of the other kids, those are very traumatizing issues. That is what this film does. It breaks down barriers and shows that kids have a voice. Kids have a mind and if it is allowed to be used properly, then that voice can help others. Maybe even open other eyes to some of the inequities that surround us. Pump Up The Volume has so much to say and so much of it gospel. I really believe that this is more of an important film than people gave it credit for. It should be checked out. Besides all the hoopla that I just ranted and raved about, it does have a great cast, great music, a wicked story, and it is funny in many parts. So it does have something for everyone. But there is so much more to this film than what is first thought of. Maybe if films like this were more adulated, then we could see the warning signs for things like Columbine. Because when it comes down to it, all Columbine was, was kids speaking out. They did it the wrong way but they were speaking out. They could have been characters in Pump Up The Volume. They could have been. And maybe movies that talk and have something important to say about todays youth should be adhered to a little more.Steve Martin's character in The Grand Canyon said  watch the movies. they have all of life's answers.

This movie grasps the pointlessness and meaninglessness of their lives at the turn of the 90's. It is not that they have no direction, but rather they are seeking an identity that is not forced upon them by their parents.I guess the main theme of this movie is the nature of one's identity, and the reality of freedom of speech. Both of these come together to help us understand the struggle that teenagers face today. Happy Harry Hardon, through a pirate radio station, is the voice of the teenagers in this town, and has enlightened them and given them a direction to go. Through his radio station, he simply speaks his mind and tries to relate to all in this town, whether they be a jock or a nerd. It is not the typical struggle between the teenagers here, but rather a united front as they struggle against their parent's rule.What we see here are not people who want to be fiercely independent but rather they want a voice. In years past, there was no such thing as a teenager. You were a child and then you were an adult, and the time in life between 12 and 18 was a time when you became an adult. Now, with the marketing ploy invented in the fifties, we have a group of people who feel grown up yet treated like children. They have their own problems, not just fitting in with each other, but fitting into a society that treats them like children, while they believe that they are no longer are children.The life of a teenager was not always as bad as it is these days. This movie does address the idea of youth suicide where one character kills himself simply because he has been isolated. Harry feels responsible because he was the last person to talk to him, and this was the beginning of what can be seen as his epiphany. The entire movie is him not only coming to terms with who he is, but more so what he has become. He is torn between closing down his pirate radio station and getting out while he still can, or continuing and leading the teenagers of the town in a united front against the oppression that the community puts on them.At one stage he attacks guidance councillors, and in fact is constantly slagging guidance councillors. Now, I actually agree with him to a point because I remember my guidance councillor from my school, and it was simply somebody who seemed to force people to do things that she wanted us to do. The thing that he is attacking here is the adults' habit of mapping out their children's lives. This is more so the case with the councillors because they will pick a job for the students and then force them to do it. In some cases, at that age, we really do not know what we want to do. We are being bombarded by images everywhere, being told what to think and do and not being allowed to think or act for ourselves. They claim that it is for our own protection because we don't understand, but sometimes it is good for people to grow through having their fingers burnt.I think this movie is important as it not only tries to open our eyes to the state that teenagers, and youths, are in, but also it tries to tell us that we have things to say, and as human beings, we have a right to have a voice. That is the essence of the end of the movie. The state is trying to shut out our voice, but we want to continue to speak because we have issues that we want to discuss. It is not that Harry was shut down at the end, but rather because before he was taken away, his message went out to all of the youth in America, and as he was taken away, he was taken as a martyr whose message touched the hearts and minds of all the youth around the nation who went off and followed him. It is not that we find out what happened to him, but rather than in the end the message got out. He went down a martyr, but martyrs live on and leave a legacy behind them.

But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network.He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression.But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast.

It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction...Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of Heathers, Pump up the Volume strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again.Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named Hard Harry. He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class.He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on Harry for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air.I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

I first saw it somewhat around 1993/1994 and was impressed by it. I had just left my teenager period back then (being born 1974) and could still relate to many issues of it. The story is about a shy kid, new to a small town in the backwoods of Arizona, with no friends. Being a talented writer but too shy to speak openly, he used other ways of expressing himself, utilizing a short-wave emitter to pump his own radio show in the air. He talks about the inhuman politics of the local high school, whose dean was only obsessed with her grade record and not the kids. Many teenager problems get mentioned in this movie, which were important back then and will be as long there are teenagers. The problems of being not understood by the parents or other adults (teachers), the problem of dating, loneliness, homosexuality, free speech and suicide. The movie does not patronize or try to impose any opinion on any of these issues (maybe except suicide). The acting is superb, i count it to be one of the best Slater movies. And the supporting cast is excellent. The obligatory love story is played so sweet and shy that you have to love it. Slater and Mathis fooling around the next day after their first kiss (which is memorable in its own way) is so awkward and sweet like any fresh teen couple.I only give no full 10/10 because of some bad editing and i find the clothes not always correct to date.

I was a teenager when it came out. I saw a trailer for it and thought I've GOT to see that movie!. However, none of my friends were available to see it on the premiere night, so I went alone. That's how excited I was to see it. Funny how you can remember details like that, 16 years later. I guess this movie really spoke to me. I know it did. 'Cause I also remember barely talking to my parents for weeks after I saw it.Today I still remember it as the ultimate teen flick, perfectly describing teenage frustration and depression like only The Breakfast Club had done before it.Christian Slater does his best role ever as the introvert Mark Hunter. His family has just moved, and he is unable to make friends at his new school, which is strictly ruled by an uncompromising, unfair principal. At night, Mark sheds his shyness and lets his frustration out on his short wave radio set, believing that no one is listening to the ranting of his pirate radio alter ego, Happy Harry Hard On. He is soon to discover however, that Happy Harry has become the talk of the school.If you haven't seen this yet, you should, especially if you're a teenager. In my opinion, this is an absolute teen classic!

This movie tries to shout the desperation of a whole class of people who just do not want to follow community standards, who do not want to follow community standards, who want to be themselves regardless of all standards.It is, in my opinion, not a teen movie, because the subject of the movie is not so much the so-called high school hierarchy among teens that has been described at length in most of the teen movies but much more movie about the relationship between the youngs/teens and their environment (family, schools, university, etc) that try to restrain these youngs, regardless of their academics, in their life, behavior, relationship ; forcing on them their own beliefs - religious, behavioral - without giving any thought on evolution of society, desperately wanting to reproduce a way of living instead of exploring new ideas and new thoughts.and Pump up the VOlume does a very good job at depicting all this, serving by a great Slater and a good Mathis.

As a group of people in contemporary society with plenty of time to think and question, they are denied the ability to participate fully in the life of their society (through the vote, meaningful employment, or even, as in this case, simply being heard).So it is ironic, though realistic, that even despite their decision to struggle against these restrictions, they need the help of adult allies to achieve their goals.Show it to your friends/children/siblings of that age - they deserve to see their angst has meaning!

I've seen this move a lot of times on cable, and purchased the DVD when I saw it in the rack. Why?  Mainly because I'm a fan of Slater's just-this-side-of-deranged intensity, and also because of Mathis's portrayal of a not-in-the-popular-group teenager who still has a soul to speak with. Apparently the two dated for awhile; I can see the chemistry in the acting, and think it a shame that they had a falling out.  The two clicked well on screen.

The moral of the movie always finish what you start or don't start what you can't continue.  The movie rips off the classic and amazing Network for its ending (which was called strangely prophetic).  Network came from the early to mid '70s.  It also had elements of the far superior and more meaningful Heathers. Plot  Teenage kid is loner who moves to Suburbia.  He makes up his own pirate radio show.  The show is controversial it gets really good ratings (see Network).  Suicide is involved (see other two movies).  This all leads to an almost fitting ending, which seems strangely reminiscent of Heathers.  *****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS*****  So, the ending it leads to is that the loner got a huge teenage following and an adult enemy.  He is arrested, sacrificing himself to change the lives and attitudes of the teenagers.  That is Heathers in a nutshell.  However, in Drama, everything seems so black and white, and uncomplicated.  In satire, you know that everything was made almost one-dimensional on purpose, and have to delve and think to get the depth of the meaning.    Acting  Better than usual quality for 80s teenage movies.  Look for Lin Shaye in a cameo (she was from the first three Farrelly Brothers movies i.e. Kingpin).  So, check this movie out, however, you really should see both Heathers and Network which are both far superior in their attempts to satirize a) the media, b) the followings of the public, c) teenagers (Heathers only), and d) self-sacrifice.

Being that I was only 2 years old, it really wouldn't of had much effect on me, like Cinderella did at the time. Little did I know that from my ages of wanting to be a Disney Princess, in the make believe world of the happiest place on Earth, that I would view this film and be hit hard by the Hard Man himself, flying me into a f-you state of mind that would change my life forever. Even more than the hopes of meeting Prince Charming and wearing glass slippers. It wasn't until about two years ago that I watched this film for the first time. My stepmother, a true member of the why bother generation of the 80s decided that now that I was entering High School, it was time for me to watch the movies that really counted way back when. So, she got started, the 80s became my Bible-thank god for that. Being a freshman, I started to assume the roll as a blah blah life sucks kid- because thats what you do. I sat back in complete silence and watched this film, stupified, touched, p***ed, sympathetic, humored and everything else relevant to the teenage world in this movie. Suddenly, the high school world I had tarted to see became a hell of a lot more clear, and a hell of a lot more worthy to fight. After the movie was done, I got dressed into a rebelling outfit, cranked up my stepmoms pixies album, and ran around the house screaming. I was injected with this raging excitement that I could be a Harry and Talk Hard. Steal the Air. I can't truly explain what it was, but in one word-liberation. PUTV became my life. I asked everyone, have you seen it? Barely anyone remembered-I was amazed. Of course, every single one of my friends HAD to see it-they year 2002 and I am having a PUTV party. No, seriously I did. We discussed it in our movie club. I talked to all of my teachers to see if they remembered. Hell, they were lucky I was too occupied to go to the Principal and demand that he suggest it for the learning criteria. I wrote a piece with Harry flowing through me, which has stirred trouble and gotten somewhere every where I take it. And everywhere I go, Hary comes with me and infests a few more kids. What else more is there to say? This incredibly compelling film gives you a straight shot of Adrennaline as the mindset of the world where nobody cares, nobody listens, and every word from you is a rebellion bitch and complain-the world of a high school student.

"},{"Title":"Set in Arizona, echoes of River Phoenix","Date":"17 July 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" This is an engaging and original take on the High School is Hell theme. But for me the most striking element was the performances of the two lead characters, Christian Slater as Mark, and Samantha Mattis as Nora -- not just for themselves, but for what they reminded me of.My all-time favorite movie is Running on Empty, by Sidney Lumet (1988). The story, style, tone, and production scale of that film is entirely different than Pump Up the Volume. But...But the two teen characters of Running on Empty, River Phoenix as Danny Pope, and Martha Plimpton as Lorna Phillips, were evidently the inspiration for Slater and Mattis in PUTV, so much so that I wonder if Pump Up the Volume was originally written for River Phoenix.Slater is a fine actor in his own right, yet his Mark is an echo of -- or tribute to -- Phoenix's Danny. This is true on a broad scale, both characters' isolation as the new kid in high school, with lots of profound secrets; both characters' pursuit by, attraction to, and turning away from, the alienated pretty but crazy girl in the class -- who yet proves to be the woman who makes a man out of each of these boys.Vaudeville quote Life has a way of evening things up. For every woman who makes a fool out of some man, there's another who makes a man out of some fool. It's even more true in detail Mark's manner of walking and talking, his self-effacing modesty around his peers, even the way he flips his hair and fidgets with his eyeglasses, all echo Phoenix's Danny.Mattis's Nora is a stronger character than Plimpton's Lorna. Her role in the story is more active, and so her performance is more dynamic -- not better, just different. Her look is also very different, unlike the uncanny physical resemblance of Mark and Danny, but this mainly reflects differences in the stories and their settings. Mattis's Nora does seem to have borrowed many of her mannerisms, and her articulate manner of speaking, from Plimpton's Lorna.Is this character emulation a bad thing? Not at all, at least not here, because it works. Of course when you have a seen Running On Empty as many dozen times as I have (hmm, I think I'll go watch it again -- yup, still great), it is more than a little distracting.This sort of character emulation is not unique in Hollywood. Another example that leaps to mind is Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road, playing a sort of downbeat Harrison Ford. I expect you can think of others.As to the movie itself, Pump Up the Volume is no more realistic a depiction of high school than most of the movies in its genre -- for the very good reason that a realistic movie about high school would be too boring and too depressing to watch. The best high school movies (e.g. Dazed and Confused Bring It On Foxfire) don't show more than a few moments of classes, because no one cares about or remembers most of their high school classes. This is a good thing -- my high school biology teacher said in 1960 everything we are teaching you here will be obsolete in three years (she was overly sanguine. Facts were either already obsolete by the time they sifted down to high school, or were wrong to begin with). If anything, PUTV's vision of high school is even darker than most, and to me this is a plus. Are there really high school administrators out there who are as vicious and depraved as the characters in this movie? Sadly, yes, quite a few, and some even worse. So although this movie is a fantasy, its message should resonate for anyone who was, or is, a teenager.If you have dug this deep into the website, you probably have a pretty good idea what this movie is about, so I won't recap. I am both picky and eccentric in what I like in movies. PUTV is no classic, but I liked it a lot. If you find you like it, too (or even if you don't), by all means take a look at Running on Empty, which is certainly a classic. Both films' DVDs can be found in Walmart's $5.50 bins.

It explores the pains of high school pressure by centering unrealistic situations around honest, human themes. Moyle's style challenged me, because while every scene of the movie was uniquely entertaining, it was also corny. However, Moyle keeps it so fresh and fun that the camp is forgivable. Bottom line, Pump Up the Volume is a whole lot of fun.Christian Slater's character has a very unique duality that he makes excellent use of. Almost like a superhero and his secret identity, he plays a timid, scared and paranoid high school student by day and a foul-mouthed phantom disc jockey by night. And what discs he plays. Tracks from the best of the fading new wave scene and the re-birth of alternative are deployed beautifully as Peter Murphy, Was (Not Was), Concrete Blonde, Stan Ridgway and many others enrich the film greatly.He comes alive as Harry, emitting his angry and confused demons with raunchy, electrifying broadcasts. It's no wonder he attracts increasingly large numbers of classmates who become loving and loyal fans. Little by little Harry starts stirring up controversy because of the obvious influence he has on his listeners. Soon an epic revolution is at hand with Harry on the very top of it.Pump Up the Volume is an essentially fun movie. With a performance like Slater's and one of the best soundtracks of all time, it is an endlessly enjoyable high school farce that you'll be quoting for years.

What starts out as an irreverent teen comedy, with some serious social undertones, morphs during its final 20 minutes into something self-conscious and simplistic. Characters who had been shades and gray suddenly become black and white expressionistic (i.e. not realistic) caricatures without adequate explanation for the transformation. So Pump Up the Volume is really two very different short films within the same feature.But while this disconnect is a fatal flaw it is also the biggest reason for studying this film. Your first impulse is to assume that Moyle, who was both writer and director, had to tack on the lame ending when he got well past the midway point and discovered he had nowhere to go with the story. But upon reflection it seems more likely that the tone of the final 20 minutes was what Moyle wanted for the entire film, that he was forced to concoct a lighter slant on the situation for commercial reasons. Taking that speculation still further, Moyle hoped to unify the two segments by making the first part less upbeat and the second part less downbeat, which only managed to hurt both parts without providing the unity he needed.Had Moyle been able to actually make the expressionistic version he wanted it might have been a real treasure. Had he stayed with a relatively light-hearted escapist teen movie it would have been quite entertaining. Unfortunately the compromise is neither treasure nor especially good entertainment.Which is not to say that Pump Up the Volume is totally unwatchable. Moyle gets an electrifying performance from Christian Slater (arguably his best ever) and a young Samantha Mathis is perfect as his semi-goth love interest. The first part of the film is entertaining and the second part does make make a powerful statement. Mark (Christian Slater) is a new kid at an Arizona high school. He has no friends and rarely interacts with anyone at school. But at night Mark rules to air-waves with his pirate radio station which soon turns his radio character into a local cult hero. The high school is a teenage version of Stepford and Mark's radio program begins to agitate the students who in turn assert their individuality, abet collectively.Moyle's film is honest in that it does not provide easy answers so much as offering challenges to his target audience. Like all of Moyle's teen characters, the students remind the viewer of just how awkward and rotten the young adult phase can be. They connect with the audience even as his adults are missing the mark by a wide margin. It was not until New Waterford Girl that Moyle began to consistently get his adult characters right.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

It's so underdeveloped that you see it more as a plot point than a tragedy. The movie tries to handle topics like homosexuality with one student, but like the kid that shot himself, there isn't really much to say. It's more like the writer-director wanted to make his movie as interesting as possible, but all we get is this gay kid with a sad story and that's it! The actor who plays him has such an attitude that we can't even sympathize for him.I thought the idea was cool. A highschool loner who just moved in from the east starts a pirate radio show and becomes the teen messiah of his angst-ridden public. But too bad all the characters are practically cardboard cutouts of punks, yuppies, shy geeks, and jocks who all have one thing in common they can't express their innerself or something.The only character that comes out with more than one dimension is Sarah Matheson as outgoing Nora.

A misfit young man (who, like the rest of this unlikely suburban high-school populous, is very good looking) moves towns and joins the local school. This immense brat-breeding ground is run by a Draconian headmistress intent on weeding out students who she considers sub-standard (and her standards are high). Slater - the unlikely misfit becomes an anonymous pirate radio shock-jock and is quickly elevated to a benign cult hero (take note Cahrles Manson). He is loved by the young and hated by the old, including his totally unobservant, unaware parents who it is clear he will eventually become.His idolising students at the school rise up at his unwitting command and fight back against a system that didn't really deserve such a fuss being made over it.

His rabble rousing broadcasts of rebellious antiestablishment rhetoric and crotch talk makes him a cult hero among the student body turning them against the school's fascist principal while his lame parental units remain utterly clueless and he falls for the campus babe and preaches silly teens are people too sermons until everyone from the cops to the FCC are trying to track him down. Stupid stuff only a teenager could love.

Originally a teen idol with studio heads grooming him to follow in the footsteps of fellow Brat Packers such as Emilio Estevez or Anthony Michael Hall, Slater has instead floundered in a sea of indecision as to which path he is taking since around the time Pump Up The Volume was released. Films that attempt to state the plight of youths living in the time of production are literally a dime a dozen, those that make this their sole focus even more so. When one looks back on the deluge of films in this mould that were made in the 1980s or 1990s, however, one notices a bit of a commonality between the ones that are remembered today. Classics such as Heathers or Repo Man put a spin so unique on the genre that they become almost a genre onto themselves. Pump Up The Volume, however, has a script not even a hundredth as clever as Heathers, and its artistic sensibility is completely flat when measured alongside the total anarchy of Repo Man.In 1990, the idea that school administrations and staff could be so flagrantly abusive and neglecting of students was literally taboo. Going after a teacher for child abuse was the equivalent of running a four-minute mile. Especially if the needs of the student were not already categorised and defined. Needless to say, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of teenagers from the 1990s are now adults with major psychological difficulties that continue to interfere with their ability to fit into society in a productive manner. I say this not because I wish to highlight that what happens in this film happens in real life with even great outrage. More, it is because I wish to point out that treating the subject in such a shallow and childish fashion tends to do much more harm than good. In the time when this film was released, a popular defence teachers put on when confronted with accusations of mistreatment was that the accuser got this idea from films like this. The problem being that such accusers were often making rock-solid accusations.Another problem that severely discredits Pump Up The Volume involves the hero's taking of calls from listeners. Legitimate radio stations do this all the time, of course, but they also screen callers in order to keep their proverbials covered. A talk show programme, when confronted with a caller asking if they should kill themselves, would contact health services in all haste in order to ensure the caller does not successfully go through with it. Not because they wish to save a life, mind you, but because they want to cover themselves in liability terms. I point this out because when Harry attempts to speak with a suicidal teenager on the subject, just about every move he makes is the wrong one, and the film commits a grievous error in attempting to elicit sympathy for his position after the police begin to pursue him for criminal solicitation. Still, if you are curious to learn why your local radio station will not let you on-air as soon as you call them, this is a good place to look.Some occasional performances stand out and give a platform on which to highlight some serious hypocrisies. After the aforementioned suicide, we are told by one FCC man that unregulated radio would result in programming of the lowest common denominator, the rule of the mob. Even way back when I first saw this film, I stood flabbergasted at how anyone could possibly listen to, or say, something like this and believe it. The difference between what he is describing and what we had then is so non-existent that it would have made this part of the film funny, were the matter not so serious. Sadly, the film never goes beyond scratching the surface of this subject, and a retort from Harry that I would have loved just never comes. Still, if you are looking for reasons why the MP3 explosion of the late 1990s all but killed radio as a place to find new music, then this is a good place. But again, instead of digging a little deeper and really blowing the mind of the audience, Pump Up The Volume gives us a display of fashion victims reciting lines.One area where Pump Up The Volume does stand out is that when it calls for moments in which the kind of music people who have commonality with Harry would want to hear is played, they actually get it right. Classics from The Descendants, Was Not Was, and Bad Brains display just how big a gulf there is between what the youth of Western society listens to or makes, and what mainstream media would have you believe the youth of Western society listens to or makes. That is the sole selling point that Pump Up The Volume possesses in spite of its shallow treatment of what has recently been revealed to be a very deep problem in the age of the Nuclear Family. So you can imagine how much of a conflict exists between the part of me that wants to condemn this film and the part of me that wants to praise it. Sadly, if you have seen Repo Man or Heathers, then you really have no compelling reason to even give Pump Up The Volume a second look. A much better, although much more painfully subtle, examination of how clueless society has become in terms of addressing the needs of those in vulnerable places or transitional phases exists elsewhere.Pump Up The Volume is a five out of ten film. It had such great potential but ends up falling so painfully short.

Slater is smart-mouth D.J. 'Happy Harry Hardon', who broadcasts on his pirate radio station from 10 p.m. nightly. His rebellious attitude is soon adopted by his many teenage listeners, and the once troubled High School is soon in mayhem. 'Mark' ('Happy Harry') never quite does the right thing, as he continues to transmit even though he knows he should stop.Allan Moyle's film only succeeds in being irresponsible. It does not give our youth a message of hope, but a message to stick it up everyone and do whatever they please. Hardly sensible!Sunday, August 16, 1992 - Video "}]
