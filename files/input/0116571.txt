The acting is not superb but it's cute and the kind you would expect from a movie like this. The one person I will hand it to is Jennifer Tilly, who really stole the show as Jennifer Love Hewitt's teen-like mother. Not bad at all, though not near to becoming one of the best.

This movie may not be the most realistic portrayal of how a kid would act when he found out his parents were thinking about splitting (ie locking your parents in the basement) but the reactions are pretty genuine in the fact that just about all kids have problems with their parents. Some things were def. over-exaggerated though, like when Grover (Kyle Howard) finds divorce papers in the mail and then 'flips' out by shoving a bunch of papers around and knocking stuff over. No kid, well usually, would be that mad about their parents divorcing (I'm sure they would be upset, maybe cry, but like wrecking stuff in some sort of manner, yea right). The acting wasn't bad, I thought it was pretty good all around. The story was funny and if your parents aren't like any of the ones in the movie, you probably will appreciate your own family more.

We wind up with a bunch of kids upstairs who know how to relate to one another but gradually have to work out how to keep practical things running, and a bunch of adults downstairs who are just the opposite. In truth, neither side does very well, but at least this is not the tired condescension of the kids screwing up and needing to be rescued by the adults both groups are portrayed with a mix of severity and sympathy. Throw in a meddling retired chief of police across the street, and make him Ray Walston whom I think everybody loved most in Picket Fences, and you have a film that is very entertaining, and also carries across some deeper meaning about what contributions young people and older ones can make to each other's ongoing development. Kyle Howard was 18 trying to play 14, which took a good deal of suspension of disbelief, but that miscasting seems to be an obsession Hollywood just can't seem to grow out of.

As Actors you have to make a living so please don't blame them, although I would say that the one that didn't fit was kevin pollack. He gave no reason for us to either empathise or sympathise with his character. Jennifer Tilly stole the show in this instance but I will have to admit Her daughter played by Jennifer Love Hewitt showed signs that her acting ability in comedic roles suits her better than he more serious roles she has been given. Admittedly she doesn't have a gutsy enough part for the film. In fact the characters were all too shallow to be taken seriously in any respect although the storyline was entertaining there is no real depth to it. The film needed more background to each of the families involved to succeed. As it happened the only redemption was Jenifer Tilly whom not seen until almost all the parents were kidnapped, made the best of a bad situation and became a catalyst for the the other characters to play off of. Verdict Most of the actors made the best of a bad script. But not a bad film I felt the Director could have done better.

I think the version I saw had been cleaned up for TV, but still not enough to satisfy some parents. So let's say it's a fantasy for older kids.Never in real life would parents have given in and stayed in the basement like that, though most of the time they were plotting to get out. What keeps this movie from being completely formula is that at times, the parents seemed content with their situation and tried to live with it. Some characters were just silly, but others had some substance. Jamie Lee Curtis gave her usual good performance and at times went beyond just the angry parent who wants out. And she was willing to humiliate herself for our enjoyment, as were many of the cast members involved in hilarious pratfalls and bizarre situations.Even the kids weren't always just what one might expect. Our hero Greg had regrets about doing this to his parents. I think it was T.J. who started as the bully but ended up as so much more. There were a couple of scenes I could have done without, because it would have been better just to keep this movie light and funny. I won't say what happened, although this development gave the movie somewhat more substance.Jennifer Love Hewitt was so cute back then, and she showed potential here. Jennifer Tilly was also quite adorable, driving her poor daughter crazy by trying to be just like her.Ray Walston wasn't necessarily at his best as the crazy neighbor, but only people such as this would have allowed the kids to get away with what they did, since he couldn't be taken seriously. Or did the kids get away with it? I won't say.Even Patrika Darbo was here! How many times have I seen her in the past month? Though I don't even remember her performance here now.Some good music, but most of the music wasn't my taste.It wasn't a bad movie but just could have done more.

Two children lock their bickering parents in the basement to work out their marriage problems but when word gets around, more parents are brought to the same basement. While the parents continue to bicker, the kids wreck the house and invade the liquor cabinet. Why is this suppose to be funny? The children are in deep hurt and director Harry Winer seems to indicate that viewers will be humored by it. Story is predictable and it praises the deviance in the conclusion. Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Pollack are at the mercy of bad writing. The yell and blame at each other but will get back together in the conclusion because the screenwriter prefers happy endings as oppose to realistic ones. Jennifer Tilly plays a drunken idiot whose daughter, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt whines about it. They are the kind of mother daughter combo usually separated in the court system because responsibility is not amongst their code of ethics. Ray Walston plays a spying neighbor who is likely hiding out on his agent for having him cast in this junk. Instead of the damage of parental separation it advertises lewd behavior. It should be locked in a basement and never seen again.

The idea of a bunch of kids being able to lock their parents in the basement and party till they die is one thing that crosses a kid's mind every now and then. Kyle Howard and Amy Sakasitz are Grover and Stacey Beindorf, two kids who have just been told by their parents (Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Pollak) that they're getting a divorce. Like most kids, the Grover and Stacey don't want their parents to separate, and can't understand why they can't just try to work things out. So, they come up with a new kind of anarchist therapy--they decide to lock their parents in the basement and force them to work out their problems. A plan like that is pretty incredible, especially when some of Grover's friends get wind of it and decide to add their parents to the mix. And they don't get along too well. Grover's bully-turned-buddy, TJ Krupp, doesn't get along well with his father (Christopher McDonald) a loud mouth obnoxious attorney who cheats on his timid wife. Mr. Krupp consistently berates those around him, even while the parents are in their brief moments of enjoying themselves in the basement. Brooke's (Jennifer Love Hewitt) trying to reform her mom (Jennifer Tilly) so that she won't keep acting like a teenager. And Matt (Mooky Arizona) is using preventative therapy because his dad (Wallace Shawn), who has been divorced twice before on the second anniversary of each marriage, is coming up on his second year again. And, Beindorf's parents just can't seem to talk out their problems without getting into a fight. While the parents are stuck downstairs in a cleverly assembled cage (sort of), the kids take advantage of their independence. A house party, a dinner party, etc, until Grover sees that things are getting out of control and their losing sight of their objective--to get the parents to fix their problems. They eventually wise up, and behave like adults, in a well-meaning, but wholly naive way to get the parents to sort things out.The funniest moments arise when Roy Walston shows up as the former police chief and nosey next door neighbor. He suspects something's up at the Beindorf house, and the kids find themselves going to great lengths after a while trying to keep their therapy plans a secret. Russell Harper as the wild and crazy TJ is also a load of laughs, because once the bully, the other kids aren't sure how to behave around one another. Also, too, the kids start to confront their own problems with each other, which are normal problems that arise in the High School caste system. Grover, for example, likes Brooke but never admits to her how he feels. TJ accuses Brooke of being an obnoxious princess who never paid much attention to anyone considered below her status as the Ice Queen. And so forth. And finally, whenever Christopher MacDonald blows his top as the irritable Mr. Krupp, you get some pretty funny sequences. There's just so much of Mr. Krupp one can take without acting out violently (but kid-safe violence...after all, it's a family movie). It's a pretty good movie for kids. They'll likely enjoy the cast, though older ones could be old enough to appreciate the family problems that arise.
