Then, something else happened. Teenagers started to like them, but on a totally different level of the disco music and costume theatrics.When it came time to make a movie, which audience do you try to satisfy?Well, I guess Alan Carr thought you could satisfy them both.The result is one of the most incredibly bizarre, unintentionally funny musicals ever made. One that tried to balance Family friendly and Gay friendly to help VP's duel followings to come and enjoy.But even my naive, young self who saw this movie when it first came out could sense that... something was amiss in the village )I mean, the YMCA sequence has quick, almost subliminal cuts of a bunch of guys in the shower, one slapping a towel on the others butt (swear to God!) in between loving, slow motion shots of buff oiled athletic guys and an all male sychronized swimming team scene.Hmmm....That was a bit sledgehammer, even for me back then.Then, I watched it more recently and found a gay movie that was in denialYou have a movie that never says the G word but has an incredibly effeminate man with TIGHT gold shorts come in and Juggle Flaming fire batons.The Indian,Felipe Rose, has that nice, smooth look and wears cut off jeans and a headress and when he prances around, makes noise like a wind chime tinkling.The Leather man, Glenn Hughes (rest in peace)sounds pretty effeminate.The Construction worker, David Hodo, has a musical number where he tries to escape from a bunch of adoring women...Then there is Lulu, who seems to be female... mostly, but she reminds me of a drag queen.Which begs a question? How come almost all the Homo imagery here is for males. How come the lesbians get left out?And how come a lot of this movie is looped. Even a lot of stage shot stuff seems to have been redubbed in post production. It made me think I was watching a forign movie sometimes.Ahhh well, you'll have a lot of fun with this. You'll be in disbelief that the thinly disguised homoerotic undertones went over the heads of the powers that be. Perhaps they were too busy watching Valerie Perrine stick out.Bad movie fans will be in their glory too. It's not everyday that a big budget movie like this is so hilariously and ineptly executed.And hang on to your hats boys and girls, that great video company Anchor Bay has bought the rights to this movie and it will be on DVD in April 2002. Hopefully it will be a special edition, with a widescreen transfer and 5.1 remix and I'll be one of the first to get it.I still like the Village People and love this campy, bizarre, collosal misfire of a movie.

Rarely in the history of mankind have we seen a movie so incredibly awful that it becomes a must-see film. And, interestingly enough, this film is one of four from 1979-1980 that I have reviewed that all fall into this same category. To what do we owe this honor? Well, 1979-1980, for those of you who are blessed to be too young to remember it, was time of the last gasp of disco AND the short-lived roller-disco craze. And, all four horrible movies I strongly recommend are so bad, so stupid, so over-the-top bad that they are truly must-see films for bad movie fans. So here is my list of the unholy 4--XANADU, ROLLER BOOGIE, THE APPLE and CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC. All four are chock full of disco as well as crappy dialog and minimal production values. My vote for most awful of these is the sci-fi, disco, religious epic THE APPLE, but any of the four is strongly recommended for a good laugh! Now, for the specifics on CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC--which, when you watch it you may want to re-name CAN'T STOP THE RETCHING. Back in 1980, the least well-kept secret in America was the fact that the Village People were gay. Believe it or not, many Americans who loved their music lived in complete denial that these were six gay men from Greenwich Village. Well, all doubt and ambiguity is erased in this film! While a few times in the movie, the ultra-horny character, Lulu, makes very clumsy passes at these guys, the long, over-the-top and strongly homo-erotic music videos within the movie make it obvious these men were quite gay--and this is especially true of their rendition of YMCA--which looks sort of like a gay version of Heaven. In fact, the campiness of the movie is sort of like a combination of Liberace with gay disco--with the most flamboyant and silly sets and costumes you'll see outside of a gay pride march. BUT, despite the singing being so incredibly overdone and campy, it actually works in some cases as you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet and getting into the songs--or at least some of them. They are BAD, yes, but still kinda fun at the same time. The final song, CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC, initially is very catchy as well, but goes on and on and on and on until you are nearly ready to go berserk! So, if the music is strange but not THAT bad, why did I give the movie a 2? Well, that's because when they are not singing, the members of The Village People have very little to say and absolutely no charisma because they are not actors. So, they fill in this gap by having real actors(?) do almost all the dialog. And, for the most part, they assembled the absolute worst actors Hollywood had to offer!! So, the main problem with the movie rests not on the Village People but on everything else about the movie!! To help illustrate HOW bad the acting is, one of the big stars for the movie is a very young and obnoxious Steve Guttenburg! He is assisted by the pleasantly built but incredibly bland Valerie Perrine and the ultra-wooden Bruce Jenner!!! This movie, in fact, single-handedly ruined Jenner's bid to become a serious actor, as he had all the personality and chemistry of Mr. Potatohead.Now, so far this movie offers us one music video after another (many with very gay visuals that will make a few uncomfortable but most just laugh), horrible acting and dialog, a dopey story and wretched direction by Nancy Walker (yes, the Bounty commercial woman). And, when you put them all together you have a movie that is even worse than a sum of all its parts--so bad, that you'll most likely laugh yourself silly and have great time making fun of the ineptness of the film. Call some friends and make this the party film you all won't soon forget!

I have often wondered this because let's face it, if indeed this is one of the best bad movies ever made, then, let me go on record as saying that of the three classic disco movies of the early 80s --- the other two being Xanadu and Thank God It's Friday  --- this one, directed by the Bounty lady herself, Nancy Walker --- holds up against the ravages of time because of its basic premise it is nothing less than the story, as presented through songs and film fantasy, of the origins of the Village People. Particularly, the prime mover of the saga (indeed, its true hero) is Jack Morell, played by Steve Gutenberg. This one-time record store cashier is in love with beautiful, retired fashion model Samantha Simmons, played by Valerie Perrine. Eventually, Sam gets her heart stolen by attorney Ron White, played by Bruce Jenner. It is the odyssey of Jack, Sam and Ron to bring together six men from the diverse subcultures comprising Lower Manhattan's Greenwich Village to form an unusual singing group called the Village People. Before long, their adventure culminates in the Vilage People's first-ever live concert performance, in San Francisco. How is it, I wonder, that after 21 years we still think of this particular film as the ultimate nail in the coffin of Disco? Frankly, I would like to see this film done proper widescreen justice on AMC. And as some of you, my two most favorite moments in the film are here the re-mixed YMCA and the always awesome Milkshake. Milkshake is especially tattooed in my brain because it was the last major original song written and produced by the Village People's founding threesome Jacques Morali, Henri Belolo and Victor Willis. Jacques having long since died of AIDS, and Allan Carr himself having succumbed to prostate cancer, we will never know how much of the magic of Can't Stop is, and yet is not, the accepted truth. One thing's for sure Can't Stop the Music is the last great effort by six awesome guys to make disco the safest music on the Planet. Well, that's my salute to Can't Stop the Music. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go do the Shake (do the Shake), do the Shaaaaaaake (do the Shake), do the Milkshake, the Milkshake (do the Shake)!

Well, when this film came out in 1980, the straight and gay world generally said Whew, something stinks. This film, with its then very popular stars, the Village People, Guttenberg, Perrine, and, yes, Bruce Jenner, bombed big time at the box office. Now, nearly a quarter of a century later, I saw this film at a friends and I must say, the sexual innuendoes, the absurd plot lines, the hysterical cameos of Tammy Grimes, and the outrageous music videos of the People themselves had me rolling on the floor. Very Funny! This may have bombed back then because the straights finally saw how queer it was and the gays were embarrassed at how silly it was. Also, one remembers that shortly before this film hit wide release in 1981, the Gay Cancer showed up in New York and L.A. Suddenly Gay was not so funny. Whatever the reason it did not make a hit back then...it should be seen now for its very entertaining smaltz and great, but where else can you see a young and luscious Valerie Perrine and a hot and studly Bruce Jenner in SHORT SHORTS dancing in a YMCA with the Village People.

The mirroring camera tricks are sophomoric and silly, and the entire sequence sets the tone for the implausible film that follows. I wouldn't be surprised if that scene took months to film as Gutenberg was probably beaten up a multitude of times and they needed to splice together bits and pieces of footage. It isn't exactly Rocky running through the warehouse district of Philly, is it? No... No it's not. How about the brilliant decision to cast Bruce Jenner, fresh off the crowd-pleasing performance on a box of Wheaties? The best moments of the film are of the Village People following closely behind Jenner in his bare midriff t-shirts with cozy little smiles on their faces. Not even Jenner's classic method acting style was enough to help the rest of the cast rise to the ankle-level material here. I seem to recall a scene where they decide on a name for the band... Hey... We're all from the Village, so why not The Village... PEOPLE? Then the Village Person dressed as the Indian chief showed his approval by employing the classic Indian war call; hooting while popping his hand over his mouth. I nearly fell out of my chair.And what about the fellow who comes to the band try-outs with the flaming batons?

Though no one had the nerve to say the 'g' or 'h' words in this film, the site of the People singing 'Liberation'--and the other more subtle hints laced throughout this film--must surely be considered revolutionary.

No-holds-barred, super-fast direction, flashy sets and special effects, glitzy musical numbers (the YMCA scene is awe-inducing!) and actors that really looked like they had a lot of fun cooking the whole thing up! It was the best cinematic experience I ever had. Never once did I glance at my watch, which for me is rather amazing. After gobbling up the whole enchilada, I started wishing I could find a copy of it somewhere. Alas, I still haven't.A few months ago, the same theater showed the film again. I usually don't see a movie twice in a theater, but my memory needed refreshment, and my soul some cheering up. I went, and had just as much fun as I did the first time.What's most amazing about CSTM is that although the director (whom I recognize as the deaf-and-dumb maid in the equally enjoyable Murder By Death) makes the actors rush through their lines and behave like over-energized hyperactive brats, and narrates the story so fast there's not even time to develop moments of crisis that last longer than a few seconds, the movie actually clocks in at two hours! Be grateful to the director and the screenwriters - a third hour would just have been asking too much of the audience.CSTM contains some of the most pointless attempts at comedy I've ever seen, and probably ever will see (Bobo Lewis's bread woman - um, huh??), and the only clever line I found was uttered by Perrine when she says bye to Paul Sand's Steve the Record Producer - it's made up almost entirely of song titles. But the actors' eagerness makes up for the lame humor, and salvages even the scenes where Jenner has to make a complete fool of himself (the trouser incident and everything that follows).I fear that if I ever find CSTM on video or DVD, the small screen will terribly banalize the film, but I won't care.

First of all, it loosely depicts the story of how VILLAGE PEOPLE developed through love and support of friends and family.  Village People and their music are so widely loved, identifiable, and preserved by their own magnitude.  Almost everyone has done YMCA with their arms SOME time at SOME event, or dressed up like one of them (or all 6) for Halloween or played in the yard as the different characters. If you at least know who they are, this movie must be intriguing to you hopefully. In terms of the writing of the movie, it took me a few watches to realize it, but the script is very clever and has some GEMS in there (Jack's front door with Samantha and Samantha at Marrakesh Records' office) but you have to listen carefully.  The script is tantamount, however, to the production numbers involved in the movie.  It's VILLAGE PEOPLE!!!!  It's Village People MUSIC!!!  The musical numbers vary in location from studio sets to the outdoors, but I must tell you all this little hint watch for the musical number that is the commercial for the American Dairy Association.  It will literally blow your mind.  The year at the time was 1981, and the musical numbers' sets were replete with long legged skinny models with wet, glossy lipstick applied perfectly, and that I don't care what you're thinking attitude. Village People's supporting cast include Bruce Jenner, Tammy Grimes, whose rendition of Samantha's boss Sydney is PRICELESS. ALtovise Davis, who was married to Sammy Davis Jr., also appears as a friend, roadie, good time gal. The movie, however, would not be complete without the main lady Valerie Perrine who plays Samantha Simpson, manager of Village People.  First of all, she's stunning.  I could watch her for 10 hours, let alone 2. Secondly, she HAD FUN on the picture.  You could tell everyone was having fun during the making of that movie.  I believe she is the driving force in the picture. Now, I understand this movie did not win any Oscars.  That fact is unfortunate.  Yes, the plot is not political, financial, legal, or has even a little resonance with most of the American public.  However, this movie is about organizing your dreams and dovetailing the right elements to produce a group that took a nation by storm.  These characters do it playfully, colorfully, and with little caution to idiosyncracy.  Sounds like my kind of movie.

Most delightful in this throw-back to bright & sunny 30's screwball comedy-musicals -- especially for gay  audiences -- is the hilarious attempt to pass off  The Village People as STRAIGHT!! Too bad director  Nancy Walker and producer Allan Carr have other  ideas (unintentionally?) the homo-eroticism runs rampant! Check outthe YMCA number, or the awesome Do the Milkshake number, and LOVE those skin-tight short-shorts that  EVERY male in this movie sports. Valerie Perrine  does a few topless shots in a hot tub full of men,  but it's quite obvious they couldn't give a damn. And witness what may very well be the worst  supporting performance in a top-line film (yeah,  yeah, I know top-line??? Remember, this WAS a  big-budget movie!), provided by Marilyn Sokol, who  leers, sneers, flails her arms, rolls her eyes,  contorts her mouth and thrusts her hips out in a  truly pathetic attempt at what is either lust or  comic relief; she is truly an embarassment. Ace  sportsman Bruce Jenner, on the other hand, is  amazingly enept at conveying even the most basic of  emotions, and spits out his lines as if he's in a  rush to escape this movie. Nearly as bad is Tammy  Grimes, whose one-liners, meant to establish her  as a Class-A bitch of unmistakable wit, leave one  slack-jawed in disbelief; worse is her major scene  involving a long-nailed finger stuck in the rotary  dial of a phone in a booth. Do not be mistaken THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL!!! However, you'd be a FOOL to pass  up this chance to see Hollywood 'comedies' at their  very worst!

I see the IMDb lists the gross for this film as just $2m...well let me tell you all, about $1,999,990 came from Australia. In 1980 this film was a gigantic box office smash and ran for 6 months! The Village People came here for the Gala Premiere at the beautiful (lost) Paramount Theatre in George St Sydney (and then to the rest of the country) and the entire population went to see it. I kid you not...it literally ran months everywhere across Australia. Parents took their kids to see it over and over....until XANADU came out...then we all went to that 55 times as well. Last night, March 8th 2005, I saw the Village People in person, In Sydney, at an indoor concrete arena, as the support act to CHER who is touring here on a some endless farewell tour. What a demented double act! There were 12,000 other idiots in the audience (most over 50) all chanting YMCA etc to music....The Village People's tired act of high school level warbling and tinny disco (they sang to a tape!!!!) and limp 'moves' can only be described as..well...flaccid. They played for 25 minutes in a gargly medley of all the horrible songs from this film, so loved and memorised by seemingly every Australian. At one encore (don't ask) the cowboy (not the one in the film either, dunno where HE was) admitted they had been together 28 years but had toured Australia 33 times. That sort of says it all, doesn't it! Anyway they are all so old now, and so exhausted, they need to call themselves The Retirement Village People. Felipe Rose, the Indian, is SO overweight he just looked like Ernest Borgnine with turkey feathers. The Cop and The Army dude were the right ones so was and the Construction Worker who had vocal 'parkinsons'. So I watched the DVD again (every home here has one) and roared with shuddering delight at the glitzy awfulness of it all. On TV now they repeat some Gym scenes over the nudity in the shower scenes but the DVD is there for all to see. Steve Guttenberg is like Mickey Mouse after 15 cups of coffee.

But, gosh darn it, I liked them anyways.I am somewhat unfamiliar with The Village People with the exception of said stereotypes and at least three songs I grew up with and, yeah, danced to&#x85;even in public. But, I knew of them and actually got to see them preform at a State Fair when they opened for a favorite band of mine growing up The Monkees. They performed well, from what budget they were allotted on a State Fair stage and only opening for another band.But, I digress. What captured me during this crazy movie was the positivity. Well, the jokes, too. Some of the jokes actually did work and the characters including Miss Tesch-mac-her! and Commercial Agent Channing were a ton of fun to watch. Despite all the looney and completely unrealistic occurrences and coincidences, everyone remained so positive like they really wanted to perform and be here. (It's been reported that might not have been the case, but they could've fooled me.) Additionally, some of the music and segments did get me moving. Admittedly, I watched this for a bad-movie podcast called How Did This Get Made?, since they covered it recently. And I did think it was a complete mess at first &#x96; even stopping it about half-way through and giving up on it until the next day. But, the more I think about it, I unabashedly enjoyed it. Helps there was full-frontal male nudity in it even with a PG rating. Um, I digress, again. The movie is supposed to be a loose description of how the band, The Village People and its creative genius (Mom's words) got started. It's pure fantasy and simply can't be taken seriously.It's just for fun and if you liked The Village People and the many more actors in here, it's worth the trip.***Final thoughts I really only had two disappointments. One they didn't sing my favorite Village People song Macho Man. Come to think of it, In The Navy was also not performed and though I like that song, too, Macho Man can stick in my head all day. And two Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner. He was simply not fun to watch. His character was all-over the place and a total buzz-kill. Yes, he was meant to be at first, but then he grew to be one of the gang and suddenly he was back to being a dick, so to speak.

A recipe for disaster that everyone saw coming except Allan Carr.Can't Stop the Music is another one of those can't-miss ideas that failed horribly and from the cheap and corny opening credits, it's easy to see why.Most of the acting is horrible; the standouts being Steve Gutenberg, Caitlyn Jenner (as Bruce), Marilyn Sokol, and Felipe Rose (the VP's Indian), but for entirely different reasons. Forgotten camp icons Tammy Grimes, Barbara Rush, and June Havoc dress and act so silly that you could recast them with drag queens and nobody would notice. Valerie Perrine, the female lead, gets lost in the shuffle.Gutenberg's performance is morbidly fascinating, especially when compared with his most famous roles. He plays Village People founder Jacques Morali (Americanized to Jack Morell here) as a hyperactive flake with delusions of grandeur who can't hold a job or sit still for five seconds yet is inexplicably allowed to stay rent-free with fashion model gal pal Samantha (Perrine).Jenner and Rose give hopelessly wooden performances. While Rose seems game, his delivery is flat, his expression rarely changes, and every ten minutes or so he gives this badly dubbed Indian call that's like nails on a chalkboard. Jenner appropriately plays stuffed shirt tax lawyer Ron White and looks visibly uncomfortable. The other Village People aren't much better, but Rose gets the most screen time so we get subjected to more of his acting. Up next is Marilyn Sokol. While she isn't as bad, the script gives her lame entendres that even Mae West would find distasteful. Also someone should have advised her to wear a wig or change her hairstyle because she bears an uncanny resemblance to Tim Curry from Rocky Horror. Every time she came on screen I expected her to break out into Sweet Transvestite when I wasn't cringing at her sleazy one-liners.The movie's biggest failure is lack of lasting conflict. Every obstacle seems to be resolved in less than two minutes usually by introducing a character who just happens to have the solution. Altovise Davis serves as a walking deus-ex-machina, bringing in two of the future Village People off the street and wandering in and out of scenes like a fever dream. Perrine finds the others on an ice cream run and she also conveniently dated a record exec. Ron White's mother announces out of nowhere she can give the VP their big break in San Francisco when said record executive rebuffs them. When money gets tight, Perrine signs on to do a commercial. The whole movie is like this, which makes its two-hour runtime seem like an eternity.The script is also packed with failed humor. The movie thinks, among other things, that getting your finger stuck in a rotary dial, dropping a contact lens into a pan of lasagna, and dropping said scalding hot lasagna in someone's lap is funny. It also throws in a pointless humor scene where Grimes and a random woman attack each other with a loaf of bread just so the director can have a cameo.For a movie supposedly dealing with the music business, it knows surprisingly little about it. Jack can easily compose fully-produced demos with a complete string section despite using a keyboard and headphones. He also thinks DJing an original song one night will lead to instant stardom. He records the VP's first demo in his backyard. The VP perform choreography in full costume in a studio session while recording their parts at the same time! Even non-musical people are bound to notice it's so bad.Nancy Walker is a lousy director, and it's never more obvious than in the filming of the VP's concert finale. It starts with an all-female opening act that alternates from filming them fifty feet away to pointing the camera up the ladies' skirts. The VP get the same medium and wide shots mixed with closeups that cut out half the group. While Ray Simpson does his solo parts, the camera either focuses on the others or films him from behind. Is it any surprise she never directed again? Finally we come to the undeniable gay subtext. The movie tries to have it both ways, hiding it for middle America while pandering to VP's gay fanbase at the same time and the results are perplexing and often hilarious. Jack is weirdly asexual unlike his real-life homosexual counterpart and the VP are filmed flirting with female groupies and Sokol. Perrine flashes her boobs in the YMCA hot tub scene but given Walker's clumsy directing, it's hard to tell if this was deliberate.For the fanbase, Jenner wears a crop-top and Daisy Dukes for no reason at all in the lead up to the infamous YMCA sequence where young, muscular men are lovingly filmed swimming in speedos, wrestling, and baring their backsides, and occasional fronts, in the shower. The song Liberation is unapologetically a gay pride anthem. While comparatively tame, the fantasy song I Love You to Death also takes on a disturbing tone considering the upcoming AIDS epidemic.The music is fairly solid if a little formulaic. Morali reliably cranks out catchy disco tunes, though VP classics Macho Man and In the Navy are sadly absent. The only misses were the stuttering Samantha and I Love You to Death due to being uninspired, repetitive, and sung horribly.You have to wonder how anyone thought this would be a success. Disco was dead and even if it weren't, this movie is too shoddily made to be taken seriously. Nevertheless it makes an interesting time capsule for a bygone era and just how much you could push the boundaries of a PG film back in the day. "},{"Title":"This movie wasn't macho, man. It was just plain bad.","Date":"5 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Musical","Review":" I really don't like this film, because it didn't do the musical group, Village People, any justice. The movie delivers an unbalance, vague resemblance pseudo-story of the Village People's formation, rather than their actual story. I can't blame them, too much on it, since the real-life band creator, Jacques Morali & lead singer, Victor Willis weren't willing to pitch in, with this film production. I don't blame them, after all, the production for this film, was full of reports of cast members getting injury, tension between actors and the director, and last, but not least, complicated film locations, due to adjacent protests by gay activists over the 1980's film Cruising. There was no way, Morali and Willis was going to do this film. So, it makes kinda sense that they had to do a lot of rewrites; but why, did they, went way overboard on the certain things. A good example is the use of nudity. This really shock me, because the movie was supposed to be rated PG. So, why is there scenes of male & female full-frontal nudity!? Who bright idea was to rate, this movie PG? I guess, they thought, the film was a cartoon, due to the over the top cartoony humor, the film has. They really went overboard with this. Honestly, what does filler scenes like an old granny mugger or a woman stuck in a phone booth, has to do with the Village People!? Don't get me wrong, I like the fact that the movie directed by Nancy Walker tries to funny, but most of the jokes really fall flat, because how stupid & childish, they were. Honestly, if their music wasn't there, this movie would be nearly unwatchable. It's their disco and dance music that make this movie, somewhat entertaining. Sadly, some of their instant classics are somewhat missing. Two of the band's three biggest hits In the Navy and Macho Man did not appear in the film. I was really disappointed, by that. At least, the band, biggest hit, 'Y.M.C.A was feature. Still, I could had done, without any of the other mediocre minor hits songs like 'Milkshake', 'Magic Night' and 'Can't Stop the Music'. Their song, 'Liberation was a great tune, but really feels, out of place, without the pacing of the film. I really didn't like, the film, use of other artist songs, such as New York - The Sound of the City & 'Samantha by David London. Nor did, I like that the movie is giving free-advertisement for Jacques Morali's other band, the Ritchie Family, by featuring their songs, Sophistication & Give Me a Break. Surprising, for a movie that features the Village People, it doesn't show much of them at all. Instead, the movie focus more on how the group was made by a struggling composer, Jack Morrel AKA Jacques Morali (Steve Guttenberg), with his friend, former supermodel Samantha Simpson (Valerie Perrine) & her on & off, boyfriend, Ron White (Bruce Jenner). These three have more screen time, than any member of the band. I get that, the movie didn't want the Village People try to act, too much, so they wouldn't make complete fools of themselves, but gees, Valerie Perrine, Steve Guttenberg and expressively, Bruce Jenner, are not great actors. They all, pretty bad! Not only that, their characters are written, horrible. Steve Guttenberg's character comes across as a smug businessman. Valerie Perrine's character is just sex bait. Last is Olympian Gold Medalist, Bruce Jenner's character, who comes across as a minor character that shouldn't even be there. He rarely does anything, besides being the victim to a bunch of awkward slapstick gags and wince about it. 124 minutes is wasted on these characters, and by the end of the film, you still, don't know, much about the Village People, since coming in. The movie's pacing is also overwhelming. Lots of long takes, and general emptiness makes it a hard watch. Most of the musical numbers didn't look fabulous and crisp, due to the picture quality in the prints that the early 1980s had. Lots of key scenes look way too discolored & grainy. Another problem is the movie was film, without thinking of using any widescreen aspect ratio. There is a lot of bad framing, throughout the film. With a budget of around $20 million, you would think the picture quality would be, better, but half of the budget was spent on a lavish world-wide dinner parties and a Baskin Robbins promotion, during the biggest Disco backlash in history. Really bad judgment call right there. So, it was no surprised that, Can't Stop the Music, the most expensive musical at the time, bomb at the box office. It became so notorious bad that the Razzies was created, just for it, to win Worst Picture of that year. Even members of the Village People, Policeman (Ray Simpson), Construction Worker (David Hodo), Indian (Felipe Rose), Cowboy (Randy Jones), Leatherman (the late Glenn Hughes), and the soldier (Alex Briley), have stated in interviews that they dislike this movie, because, how much they were wasted. Also, the fact that the movie has them, playing heterosexuals fantasy roles, despite their influence in gay male subculture. The only true heterosexuals members, was biker, Glenn Hughes and replacement lead singer, Ray Simpson who took over for Victor Willis, as the Cop gimmick. Nonetheless, there is still a lot of gay imagery here to create a gay cult following and it did. As much, as I kinda like Disco and the Village People; Overall I really can't defend this movie.

Alas, we shall never know, but one thing's for certain, Bruce did appear in this shiny disco ball and we're all better for it, 34 years later.CSTM remains the final nail in the coffin of what we call disco. Released too late to fully cash in on the ebbing national dance craze, this astoundingly bad movie hit every wrong note and cemented itself in memory as a wreck the size of the Titanic. So, what's really it's appeal all these years later? THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. Three little words that finally showed all the good folks in the heartland what was going on in NYC's Christopher Street area. Ostensibly a biopic of how the People got together, the plethora of wooden acting and gay denial is so thick you could cut it with a knife. What was once refused is now revered, camp has triumphed, and the People became a national treasure. No one in their right mind who finally sees this unintentionally hilarious mess can believe that the G word is never spoken. Despite being a near-documentary about life in the gay district, everyone is presented as heterosexual. Perhaps someone living under a rock in North Dakota believed this, but no one else did. Today, the clues and innuendos are all out there ( pun intended) and we can enjoy the gloriously horrendous acting by everyone on screen. Of course, YMCA went on to become as well known as the national anthem, played at every wedding reception since the song first appeared. Of note here areThe auditions for the new singing group. Featuring Leatherman Glen Hughes belting out Danny Boy in full leather drag while standing on a corporate boardroom table. He gets the job, while the real star of the audition, Mr.Flaming Baton twirler is sent packing. Hughes, who has since passed away, has the movie's best line. When he arrives for the audition in his leathers, Valerine Perrine asks what he does for a living. He tells her he's a ticket taker on a toll highway. When she replies Do all ticket takers dress that way?, he snaps Only the HOT ONES! Construction worker David Hodo is given a weird solo song called I Love You To Death. He gyrates around a number of women who throw red glitter on him. Seeing as how AIDS would present itself in the gay community not too distantly after this movie was released, this song takes on a whole new meaning that no one could have foreseen.Bruce Jenner in a crop top taking the gang to a place for young men. Steven Guttenberg rollerskating through New York and not getting mugged.Director Nancy Walker, Rhoda's mother and Bounty paper towel hawker never directed another movie. Sad, seeing the genius she brought to CSTM.The all-white versions of the People's street drag while they do the Milkshake.Fun Fact Despite the events depicted in CSTM, music man Jacques Morali resorted to advertising in the want ads of the Village Voice to find singers for a new group. After stating was was needed by applicants, the ad ended must have mustache. That pretty much described every man wandering Christopher Street at the time.Just try to not to sing along while watching! Oh, by the way, the Cop Victor Willis was the only straight man in the lineup. He was briefly married to Phylicia Allen (who became Phylicia Rashad The Cosby Show) and left the People because he allegedly didn't like the image of the group. You can't stop the music. Really.

Comedienne Nancy Walker directed this musical chronicle, purporting to relate the legend of the formation of the disco group The Village People. It is a pseudo-biography of disco's Village People which bears only a vague resemblance to the actual story of the group's formation.Valerie Perrine is Samantha Simpson, a helpful ex-model who attempts to get her roommate, Jack Morrell's (played by Steve Guttenberg), songwriting career off the ground by assembling a motley group of her Greenwich Village friends,The Village People themselves,together to cut a demo tape of Jack's ditties. All Samantha has to do is charm the square lawyer Ron White,played by Bruce Jenner,in order to get him to listen to The Village People's scintillating disco strains.This movie was simply going nowhere for it was all singing and all dancing.But the cast involved like Steve Gutenberg,Valerine Perrine and Bruce Jenner cannot sing,dance and act.Also,the Village People were simply left to be montages rather than characters.What also was going against them was that people were no longer into the disco bandwagon and they are going on into the New Wave bandwagon.Although the music was enjoyable for it presents The Village People hits like Can't Stop The Music and YMCA,the story was just full of cheese,uneven acting,awkward scenes and corny jokes.The the decline of the Village People's popularity was attributed to the original singer,Victor Willis,leaving the group but I suppose that this movie being a box office flop and the several Razzies nomination like Worst Picture and Worst Original Song,could also be reasons behind that.

This movie is just as bad as everyone says, but it has one thing going for it. It doesn't care. You can say what you like about bad scriptwriting, acting and direction, but this thing is just going to damn well party down, no matter what you think. Gay? 'CSTM!' is so 'festive' that the DVD should come wrapped in a pair of gold lame shorts (although there's Valerie Perrine and those remarkably sexy dancers in the outlandish 'Milk Shake' sequence to unashamedly ogle). 'Bad'? Think 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' bad. In other words, if you appreciate 'good' movies (and a beer or two) then you'll definitely enjoy this total affront to all things 'good' (and 'tasteful'). There's something wrong everywhere you look; watch out for such choice moments as the 'recording session' held in Valerie Perrine's back yard. Most musicians and producers prefer purpose-built soundproof recording studios, but not these guys. I've been a musician for over 30 years and every few minutes had me doing another face-palm. The songs (e.g. 'Magic Nights', 'Milk Shake' etcetera) mostly sound like they were written on the back of a beer coaster after an all-nighter, and the crazed 'audition' sequence has to be seen to be believed. You don't have to know anything about music to have fun with this movie (although it certainly helps); there's plenty for everyone. How about the insanely amateur camera angles covering the big San Francisco concert at the end? When you're not staring directly up the wildly gyrating Ritchie Family's skirts (and their song goes on for an utterly ridiculous time), you're looking at five of the six Village People on the stage. That's after seeing them arrive on stage in spectacularly excitement-stifling middle distance. Look, I genuinely could go on for several pages listing stuff like this, but you're better off witnessing it for yourself. Imagine a 1940s screwball comedy put through a concrete mixer and brought to fruition by well-intentioned Martians with a less-than-firm grip on Earth culture circa 1980 and you're there.

Man, what an ultra cheesy movie this was! Where to start...Steve Guttenberg getting the multiple-image treatment when roller skating on the streets of N.Y., a couple of audition scenes like when that guy singing Macho Man starts stripping as he shows off his muscled body or that other guy twirling a couple of flaming batons just before it sets the water sprinklers, Bruce Jenner getting hot food dropped on his lap which gets both Steve and Valerie Perrine taking his pants off, and that whole bizarre Y.M.C.A number...there's plenty more but I think you get the drift. There's also some funny and some very unfunny moments galore here though it's interesting seeing such accomplished character actors like Jack Weston, Barbara Rush, Tammy Grimes, Paul Sand, and especially June Havoc as Guttenberg's mother do what they can with the material. Actually, while I mentioned that the Y.M.C.A number was pretty bizarre, it also provided some energy along with many of the other ones that made many of the just talking scenes just so monotonous or pointless in comparison. In summation, Can't Stop the Music was a mess that first-and-only-time director Nancy Walker couldn't fix and it must have knocked screenwriter Bronte Woodard and his co-writing partner and producer Allan Carr down a notch after their big success with Grease two years before though Carr wouldn't really decline in power until that really awful production number involving Snow White and Rob Lowe at the 1989 Academy Awards. That said, the cheesiness did contribute to the fun I had watching this and I may watch this again if I so desired. Certainly, some scenes with Ms. Perrine would make it worth my while again...P.S. Once again, I have to acknowledge someone involved here that's from my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. This time it's Mr. Carr. And one more thing A critic back in the day said, By 2010, this movie will become 1980's The Gang's All Here. Now, considering that picture had such icons as Busby Berkeley and Carmen Miranda, I don't think the comparison's apt. They both have similar camp value, however. "},{"Title":"It's A Magic Night!

Guttenberg is cloying and annoying (that rhymed), and Bruce Jenner sashaying around in a pair of sassy short shorts, is well, kind of gay and more than a little embarrassing since Jenner is a straight actor. i'm sure he spent years after making this movie telling people I AM NOT GAY.sometimes it seems that today's younger audience has no sense of humor about bad movies. mostly the people who can laugh and have fun during a bad film seem to be largely 'baby boomer' types. younger people just get so serious about their entertainment.but good movie or bad movie, who knows? we all seem to love it for some weird reason. just keep smiling, laughing, and never stop the music. who knows, maybe they will play 'I Love You To Death' at our funerals.

You going to see things that you've never seen before","Date":"29 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Musical","Review":" Is funny to talk good about a movie that for much people is actually bad, that is the reason of why talk about Can't Stop the Music is funny.Cant Stop the Music is a semi - biographical musical of Disco famous group The Village People, and when i talk about the biographical is because there some facts that actually happen to build the group, only that the film put some fictitious characters for give reason to some funny situations. So, the story is about a Steve Guttenber who wants to bring his music to the world and be famous, and how with the help of a Valerie Perrine (Bob Fosse's Lenny) get men with good voice - You know who are they - for build a group and in this way be famous. This was the plot of Cant Stop the Music, one of the first 80s musical (Of course, with Xanadu).The movie win big of fame, but not as the Big and Great musical of the 80s, only as This movie is bad than ...  and that kind of things. And is undoubtedly, Cant Stop the Music is one of the cheesy musicals of the 80s, for not saying THE cheesy. Anyway, this is cheesy funny film, that i think that don't deserves the fame that have for some reasons Maybe, even if you like Village People don't going to love the film, but if the supposed problems that have doesn't care to you, and you love Village People, you going to fall in love with this film. And, for being a musical in the 80s, times very hard for the Musical genre, this film have great and dazzlings choreography for each song. Besides, for a plot, yes, the things seems to be a fast unworried script, where well, it seems that don't much happens, and some of the problems not are the interesting, for much, thing, but that's part of all the fun. This is a easy and funny movie, but never unworried.There's another point that nobody ignores and even, blame this film, and is about the gay subtext. Unless this bother you, the time of this movie was 1980 and the musical was about The Village People, now, is not a secret that this music impact in a lot of gay discos in San Francisco, the most shocked public by this music (In spite that the YMCA is very well known even between straight guys) was gay community. Even some of the Village People moved in the gay ambient (Felipe Rose, for example, was the first of the rest of integrates who begin the group, of course not alone. However, he was found it in a gay disco as a waiter, but this waiter have an Indian costume), and the costumes that their put it on, represents, i guess, all the worldwide masculinity symbols and are a kind of spoof of critic about machismo (Sorry if i'm wrong with that). So, with all these characteristics, How you can expect a film without that certain elements? They said in production notes that the movie have to be made of something straight. However, we see some scenes like the famous YMCA scene where a lot of hunks playing between them naked in the shower and even dance in a choreography for the exercises. So, this thing is don't bad, look it in this way, it was inevitable, it was them.There is another thing to understand the movie moods and this is explain thanks to the character of Valerie Perrine, Samantha, who told us a thing that is actually truth This is the 80s ... Your going to see things that you've never seen before ... Well, Cant Stop the Music is one of that things, but it was the newly born 80s. It was the 80s of joy, before, no much much time before, but before anyway of the born of the doom of AIDS. Cant Stop the Music is actually that, the happy newly born 80s.Cant Stop the Music is not so successful but really exciting and funny musical, really good and to pass good times, because, no matter in what time you born, Cant Stop the Music is like a time capsule that take you to an optimistic and happy 80s anytime you want.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.

After Alan Carr hit the stratosphere with Grease, he was hoping lightning would strike twice.  Unfortunately, he missed the mark entirely.  He made the mistake of playing it safe and trying to make a family musical.  If he didn't try to hide the gay theme, and if he would've used some major supporting talent, this might have been a minor classic.  Let's be honest, Bruce Jenner is not an actor by any stretch of the imagination, nor was Nancy Walker a film director.  Carr should've tried to incorporate some of his Grease cast and crew.  For example, cast Jeff Conaway (Kinicki) instead of Bruce Jenner.  He did go the nostalgic Hollywood route as he did in Grease (with Eve Arden and Joan Blondell) by including minor roles for Barbara Rush and June Havoc, who were both a joy to see on film once more.  Finally, a golden opportunity was missed at the end of the film when the entire cast is on stage.  A classic campy ending would have been to have June Havoc (Gypsy Rose Lee's real life sister) step to the edge of the stage and yell out the gay crowd, Hello everyone, my name is June!  What's yours?!!  I agree that American Movie Classics or VH-1 should show Can't Stop the Music just for fun. But it has to be in its original widescreen format, and with full stereo surround sound!

I think the thing that I love about it the most is the fact that the band's(and I use that term VERY loosely,) target audience seems to be lonely, middle aged women. All throughout the movie, those are the people that are helping them along the way and they are the ones who are joining them onstage for their dance numbers. Now I realize that the disco movement in music was a very safe form of artistic expression. I mean, you wouldn't find women such as this helping out the Dead Boys or Ramones. I am also sure that since the director, Nancy walker, was a middle aged woman herself, she probably reasoned that she was hip and therefore all women of this age were just as much into the disco scene as she was. The other thing that I found just astounding was the totally unrealistic portrayal of the music industry. One moment these guys are practicing in a makeshift, backyard set-up with car speakers for a PA system, the next they are in the recording studio. Not only are they in said studio but, wow, there just happens to be pre-recorded music for them to sing to for these original compositions. I know that lightening does occasionally strike and a smalltime band is discovered and launched into their careers very quickly. But for this to happen to the Village Persons after practicing a total number of...hmmmm...how many times according to the movie? Oh yea.....ONCE? Well, all I can say is realism must not have been a priority for Ms. Walker.There are also a few things that are just downright irritating about this movie though...the first being the fact that Steve Gutenberg has a smile that NEVER leaves his face! OK, a person that is THAT happy ALL the time was just, well, annoying. The 2nd is the fact that there is a man that dresses in a Native American headdress wherever he goes...and this is before the Village Persons came together as a band. As a Native American myself I was a little put off by that...and I am not the type to get upset over such trivialities either. For instance, I don't get upset about the Cleveland Indians logo or the Washington Redskins name. But a man who wears that garb as a meaningless costume is a bit much. Finally, Bruce Jenner's acting is well beyond bad. I got a chill every time he appeared on the screen because I knew that I was going to feel embarrassed FOR him, on his behalf! Where as other people yell at their televisions when their sports team is doing badly, I was screaming for him to EMOTE, REACT, or merely LOOSTEN UP! It was simply painful!For pure, unadulterated and wide-eyed terrible movie watching pleasure, you simply cant beat this film! It has everything required for such label simplistic and unconvincing plot, acting so bad that wood and ham are embarrassed to be compared to the cast, atrocious dialog - both in writing and in it's delivery, and, sadly, direction that has no ambitions of being the least bit complex or challenging.

The supposed story of hit disco group The Village people (blatantly, satirically Hollywood cleaned up) was laughed off the screen when it first came out for picturing one of the most obviously successful (and successfully obvious) gay singing groups as having been brought together by their (literal) girlfriends.Yeah, right....and yet, there is all that music. It's actually pretty darned good in a disco ball meets Busby Berkley fashion.Producer Alan Carr, who effectively captured the cartoon style of the Broadway hit GREASE in a smash cartoon of a movie, gave Broadway, movie and TV comedienne Nancy Walker a chance to direct her first big budget Hollywood film in a day (not yet passed) when the number of major women directors could be counted on one hand - with several fingers left over. Sadly, the commercial fate of the film Carr wanted set the cause of women directors back another decade or two. The producer wanted a cartoon - it had worked with GREASE - and Walker gave him one - presumably trying to satirize the old movie bios (remember the factually ludicrous but musically satisfying NIGHT AND DAY or 'TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY?). They ignored the well known and reported facts of The Village People and expected their music to carry the film. Had they caught the peak of the group's vogue it might have worked, but the wave had already crested and the Post-Stonewall audience was ready to demand TRUTH, not obviously silly Hollywood myth.The only real ongoing sin of CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC is the continuing involvement of its lead, the presumably straight but 8trying to be enlightened Steve Guttenberg, in gay associated projects which he has managed to clean up with an almost CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC-like, arguably homophobic, distortion. Note how when the play P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD (a flawed but enjoyable novel and play by CHORUS LINE writer James Kirkwood about a supposedly straight actor who finds a gay burglar in his apartment on New year's Eve and ultimately reaches an improbable rapprochement with him) that had a modest Broadway run and a successful life in stock was finally filmed in 2002 with Guttenberg in the lead and directing, he managed to leach almost every visage of legitimate gay threat or edge out of the actual staging! It became another dishonest cartoon and lost most of the target audience which was eagerly anticipating it.In both CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC and P.S...., it just doesn't work when straight or closeted film makers try to play with trendy gay themes but can't bring themselves to do so honestly. It's also a recipe for commercial disaster on projects that could have offered so much honest entertainment for modern open audiences.What a pity. There's still a LOT of fun to be had here, but you do have to ignore a lot to get to it.

It fails almost completely. Nancy Walker may have seem a weird choice for the director but she had directed some TV shows and she was very comfortable with gay men (for instance, her and Montgomery Clift were the best of friends). The studio obviously wanted a director who would be comfortable with the gay subtext AND keep it PG!

The dialogue is truly atrocious (the actors deserve credit for saying their lines with a straight face); there are the horrendous 70s styles and fashions; dreadfully unfunny comedy; trying to sell the Village People as a straight group--come ON!; Felipe's bird call gets annoying after EIGHT renditions and totally unneeded romance between Perrine and Bruce Jenner! Also WAY too long (2 hours). However there ARE some good things about this.The songs aren't bad and the production numbers are certainly elaborate; there's a nice sequence with Perrine recruiting 3 of the Village People; a beautiful rendition of Danny Boy; a truly hysterical song and dance number about MILK!!!!; and the YMCA number.

The acting career of Bruce Jenner, whose ill-advised sashay through the village in shorty-shorts and a half-shirt will forever live in infamy? Not so much. Hindsight, as poor Bruce no-doubt laments to this day, is indeed a beyotch.What is perhaps most remarkable about this film (aside from the blizzard of blow that had to have been trucked in for the shoot) is that first-and-last-time director Nancy Walker - yes, THAT Nancy Walker - manages to create what is arguably the gayest film ever made, without ever actually broaching the subject. Indeed, the mind-bogglingly homo-erotic YMCA sequence alone has the power to elevate the legendary Walker to the loftiest of honorary homo heights. The sequence, which features all of the can't-even-act-it-away group trying to play it straight in a hot tub with a topless Valerie Perrine, is so queer that if one were to come across a crystalled pink leprechaun face down in a rainbow sling at a Montreal bathhouse, snorting poppers and greased halfway up his back in liquefied Crisco, you *might* be in the neighborhood.Rent, don't buy this DVD, and play with care around small animals, impressionable children, and bi-curious clergy.

From that period on, they became an icon in music. We know songs like Y.M.C.A., Macho Man, and others. They made really exciting disco songs.Can't Stop The Music takes the well-known band and puts it into an enjoyable family movie. Enjoy it, and don't forget to wear that disco suit and platform shoes!

Thier music is great (although some of the new stuff for the film is sub-par) and if you are a fan, you'll get a kick out of seeing them sing on stage, perform in odd musical sequences, and bop around New York City.The timing of this flick was especially bad, but even that isn't anyone's fault. When the film was being made in 1979, disco was huge and The Village People were among the hottest groups in the country, playing multiple nights at arenas all over the world and selling millions of records. But when this film was released in 1980, disco was dead, and The Village People were has-beens. Instead of being cool, this film was laughed at when it was released. No one saw any of this coming.The big mystery to me is, how did Nancy Walker get the directing gig? Because this movie is directed absolutely horrible. She got the gig with a 20 million budget, starring one of the country's hottest groups (at the time of filming)? Who on Earth gave her the greenlight?You can tell right from the start that the film would have problems. The people who DID go to see it, did so because of The Village People, and the song at the start during the credits isn't even a Village People song, it's some crappy throwaway off the soundtrack! It plays while Steve Guttenburg rollerskates through NYC (this is all to show how wild and carefree NYC is) in a silly sequence. Even during this part there's a problem - Steve passes a manhole, and the camera goes for a closeup, and out pops the head of David Hodo, the VP construction worker! That's pretty cool, but even this little sequence got messed up somehow because there's an obvious edit in there!The acting, well it isn't so bad, even talentless Bruce Jenner isn't so bad, he gets bad when he actually tries to hard. Valerie Perrine is hot. Lulu looks like a cross between Paul Stanley and Tim Curry. And the VP aren't bad at all.The music - who was the genius that decided that the audience had to wait over an HOUR before a familiar Village People hit came on? Over an hour!! The first familiar one is YMCA, one of three tremendous smash hits for them, and that sequence is pretty decent and entertaining. The Milkshake isn't so bad either, way over the top with hot girls, although you have to wonder it is a looong TV commercial (what it was filmed for in the plot). The end concert sequence is good but way too short. Another one of their huge hits In The Navy is nowhere to be found, and the only mention of their other gigantic song, Macho Man, is when some dude in silly looking tights starts to sing it. Two of the Village People's biggest songs totally gone to waste.Really, the way the film is made is much worse than really anybody in the film. And the dubbing - there is SO MUCH post dubbing that it looks like an old Godzilla film sometimes, especially because you can hear the change in the audio track of the dub. This film is a huge mess - but it does have the Village People in it, so that's good enough to sit through it.Anchor Bay released a great DVD of this that gives the VP proper respect. To their credit, The Village People still tour all over the world and put on a hell of a show, blowing away all of today's boy bands.

Just...wow.","Date":"4 June 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Musical","Review":"  If there is a better movie that combines hilarity and pure crapiness so perfectly, I don't know what is. Can't Stop the Music is supposedly how the Village People (yes, the Village People) got started in the music world. But, from the looks of it, this story is highly exaggerated and not exactly your typical E! True Hollywood Story. Where do I start, honestly? The acting is horrible, the editing is atrocious, and just about every musical number (oh, did I mention this is a musical? Yeah, it's a musical) goes on for waaaaaaay too long. Sample songs include I Love You to Death, where the VP Policeman dances with chicks in red dresses who throw glitter, YMCA, where the viewer's eyebrows raise at the startling abundance of homo-erotic images (and this thing is rated PG??? HOW?!), and Do the Milkshake...which I'll leave for you guys to experience. But trust me, the last one is the best of the lot. The story unfolds in traditional musical style, with a romance thrown in for good measure and some false suspense, but none of it rings true. Other highlights include Lulu, who is supposedly played by a woman but looks like Tim Curry from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, STEVE GUTTENBERG (star of Cocoon, loads of Police Academy flicks and Three Men And A Little Lady), who can't act out of a paper bag here, and the acting skills of the Village People. I read on this site that the movie cost 20 million to make, but made about 2 million in theaters, and that doesn't surprise me in the least. It was also marketed as a family picture from what I hear, but there is nothing here that could label it as a family picture. The story would not appeal to kids, there's more than a few instances of cursing, and it's...how should I put this...really, REALLY gay. It's more than a little obvious that those who made the film were trying to make this point, but they stress it so much and wink to the viewers so many times it becomes pure parody. Oh look, a man doing gymnastics...in slooooow motion. Ohhhh yeah. Hey Phil, zoom in on his crotch will ya? Heh heh, I can't believe we're marketing this as a family picture. But in the end, you have to see this if you're into craptacular Hollywood because it will crack you up. 0/4 stars.

It was not THAT BAD of a movie, but it was released during the height of the anti-disco era.  If it was released in 1977 or 1978 it would have probably done well.  Saturday Night Fever did - for the life of me, I can't understand.  This movie seems to operate at two speeds.  The plot seems to really drag, but the characters seem to be acting at warp speed!  Steve Guttenburg, Bruce Jenner & Valerie Perrine just seem to have too much energy.  The Village People tried to act, but I don't think anything could save this sinking ship.  From what I remember, Valerie, Steve & Bruce get some brilliant idea to promote a disco group from the Village.  That's about the premise of the plot, with lots of Village People music thrown in-maybe a little too much.  This movie, I think, would just appeal to diehard fans of the Village People and that's about it.  For fans of late '70s disco movies, Thank God It's Friday or Roller Boogie are a better bet.

Perhaps as a party film, where you can feed off the comments of others watching - this film has some potential; but, on its own, it is simply dire. Energy abounds (Steve Guttenberg appears to be ready to self-combust at any moment), but it is completely wasted on third rate schtick and incredibly awful dialog. The musical numbers have no sense of structure or style; and they all stink. If disco wasn't already pretty much dead, by the time of this film's release, this surely would have killed it. On DVD, Anchor Bay has given it a first-rate treatment (2.351 widescreen and 6.1 DTS ES Surround Sound!!) Not that it helps at all, the film is so poorly made. Although the film is loaded with homoerotic overtones, it couldn't possibly appeal to anyone, regardless of their sexual preference. NOT recommended!
