Its characters are fleshed out human beings capable of good and evil and in the grips of intense suffering, not the formulaic cardboard creations which populate so many recent Hollywood productions. The movie's atmosphere and mood are thick and the bleakness of the New Hampshire winter comes alongside its beauty and majesty. Paul Schrader achieves here what has eluded the Coen brothers in Fargo. The photography of Paul Sarossy is of a rare beauty and his compositions are breathtaking. Think of the scene of the two brothers in the barn lit by light sneaking in through the slits in the wood exterior, the beauty of the snow covered New Hampshire chalets, the camera receding from the barn fire until we get to watch it through a slightly off-center picture-window from the main house, and finally think of the snow in its serenity, its menace, its domination. The two stories are so naturally intertwined that one can spend most of the time convinced one is watching a thriller, until in the end this thriller dissolves into the main story which explores the violent undercurrents of human love and bonding. This whole is as thick and rich as cream.I am in awe of Nick Nolte's spectacular performance. It is honest, complex and totally convincing. Nolte is ably supported by James Coburn and others. This is moviemaking at its best.

Recently, with movies like American Beauty and The Story of Us, Hollywood has portrayed American households as candidates to be on the next TV tabloid talk show. Paul Schrader's dramatic portrayal of a troubled family in Affliction is as intense as any suspense thriller released within the past few years. The thought-provoking power of his script, based on the novel by Russell Banks, and the methods he uses to execute the vivid, interpretative character study creates more than just a sense of emotion and empathy, but places the audience in the character's shoes, allowing us to explore a tense atmosphere on our own.	The movie looks into the life of a struggling person named Wade Whitehouse, played with extreme intensity by the descriptive Nick Nolte. He is the lowly sheriff of a small backwoods in New Hampshire. Nothing much happens in Lawford, however, thus Wade is usually restricted to plowing the snowy streets and serving as the local school's crossing guard. His ex-wife, Lillian (Mary Beth Hurt), has most custody of their daughter, Jill (Brigid Tierney), and neither relative enjoys his company. Wade's alcoholic father, Glen (James Coburn in an Oscar worthy performance), who abused him and his brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) as children, continues to abuse him emotionlly.The subtle town of Lawford is turned upside-down when a rich businessman is mysteriously killed while hunting with Wade's friend, Jack Hewitt (Jim True). Finally given something to investigate, Wade takes his job seriously, even when complications arise when his mother dies, his brother comes home from Boston, and his waitress girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) meets Wade's parents and realizes what she gotten herself into.	As Wade's life starts to completely unravel, the filmmakers neglect to leave out any details; from flashback of his fathers abuse to an uncompromising toothache, Wade is developed vividly and clearly. The movie is best when allowing Nick Nolte and James Coburn to come to terms with each other's hatred for each other. The performances are what make this movie much more distinct than similar but lesser films like The Other Sister and The Story of Us, and even better acted than the masterpiece Award winner American Beauty.	Instead of milking the dysfunctional family material to the maximum, the film also has tender dialogue and heartfelt scenes that exhibit a loving relationship between Wade and his girlfriend. These scenes make even more tragic the production's unsettling conclusion and increase the overall dramatic impact, which is tremendous. 	By the end of Affliction, like in The Ice Storm, we feel for the main character's losses. Although this film is more conclusive, it is also unmerciful; we receive no happy ending, no satisfying motifs, this movie takes itself seriously and has no pity, regrets, or agreements. For Wade Whitehouse, the climax of the movie represents death, grief and sorrow. For us, we can only stare at the screen and try to comprehend what we have experienced through his eyes.

James Coburn is excellent as Nick Nolte's father, a brutal and angry old man who typifies a sick machismo which has in turn afflicted his son. His acting is extraordinary as is Nolte's although their styles are different. Noltle is subtle; his facial expressions are controlled and typical of a man who has learned to hold in emotion.  Coburn's face, on the other hand, is more deeply expressive;  his eyebrows move, his mouth hardens, his eyes glare.This is the kind of dark, brooding movie that I like.  For a brief few hours I enter its world and get completely absorbed in the characters in the way I did with A thousand Acres or The Horse Whisperers.  Like these films, there are no easy answers and the conclusion does not wrap up in a neat little Hollywood package that is soon forgotten.

And while I agree that some of the performances were flawed and that an evening spent watching it can hardly be called entertainment, still, in terms of its writer's objectives, which are summed up in Rolf's concluding VO (which I quote below), in my opinion Affliction it is a superb accomplishment.I write thusly because I as a child -- as I must suppose the writer was also -- was beaten often and most violently by a totally out-of-control father who himself was the product of his father's violence. Which is not to say that I did not afford ample provocations for sound thrashings (or possibly a more effective form of chastisement, for, as the proverbial fool, I indeed kept returning to my follies), still there are limits. Nevertheless, I have thought often of the effect these beatings must have had in shaping my personality and destiny -- and being now some 85 years of age, I have had a very long post, post graduate course in introspection.Whatever, the writer's conclusions did indeed resonate with me, and well written they were indeed ROLFE (V.O.) The historical facts are known by everyone -- all of Lawford, all of New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts.Facts do not make history. Our stories, Wade's and mine, describe the lives of boys and men for thousands of years, boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth and whose best hope, if any, for connection with other human beings lay in an elegiac detachment, as if life were over.It's how we keep from destroying in turn our own children and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love us; how we absent ourselves from the tradition of male violence; how we decline the seduction of revenge.

James Coburn is the dark, angry patriarch of an abusive household, whose abuse and anger are inherited by his son(Nolte).  The story is told by the youngest brother (played mainly in voice-over and a small cameo by Willem Dafoe), and traces the events of a small town murder investigation that leads to the mental collapse of Nolte's cop character.  The film weaves us through a buffet of sub-plots and bit characters (including a nice appearance by Sissy Spacek), which is at times whish-washed.  However the tone and style of the film are quite fresh and unique.Penned and directed by Paul Schrader, who will probably always be known for writing Taxi Driver, the film is a stylish take of what is most likely a much better novel.  The tone is cold and dark, and serves as the perfect backdrop for the anger and isolation of the two male characters. In my opinion, the voice-over narration takes away from the feeling the picture leaves, basically serving the purpose to tell us what to feel. The images and performances on the screen do a fine job in dong that on it's own, without re-enforcment.  On a whole, the film is powerful and moving, and is a great look into the heart and soul of lives that are truely tortured.  I would recommend this film if for no other reason than to see the brilliant performances of James Coburn (Oscar winner) and Nick Nolte (Oscar nominee).

It's mostly a delve into a man's (Nick Nolte) psyche, a divorced alcoholic man who was abused as a child by his drunken father (James Coburn).  He tries to cope, he tries to make something of himself by attempting to solve a hunting accident which he thinks is really a murder.  He claims that after this, everyone will remember him as a hero.Luckily the audience isn't made to believe Nolte's cause, to us he looks just as mad as he does to the characters around them.  This is well done, because it could've been presented as some big twist at the end.Anyway, the mystery element to the film isn't that important.  It's mostly about how hard - and almost impossible - it is to prevent an emotionally abused man to make the same mistakes his father made.  This idea is presented well, but by the end it just feels so thick and depressing that it's hard to take anything from the film, because you don't want to remember it.Acting-wise the movie is quite good.  Nolte delivers what I think is his best performance here, with a quiet desperation wonderfully put out by his eyes, voice, face, and so on.  James Coburn does his usual well, but I have to question just why he won an Oscar for this.  Don't get me wrong, he was a terrific actor and his performance in this is great, but he's not in many scenes, and the scenes he is in are mostly just a variation of the same thing Coburn drunkenly and violently mumbles at his sons and eventually starts to yell and thrash.  This is all well and good, but his scenes never go beyond that, except for (maybe) at the end when he spews his own sort of twisted philosophy to Nolte.Other great performances come from Sissy Spacek as Nolte's increasingly uneasy girlfriend. Also Willem Dafoe as Nolte's brother who is so concerned with being quiet and not problematic that he cant prevent the build-up of violence and abuse in his family.  I'd say that this performance is more Oscar worthy than Coburn's.This is a good movie with a great message, but it doesn't put enough on the table, 7/10.

There is one story line here  Wade Whitehouse, town police constable of Lawford, New Hampshire was raised by an abusive alcoholic grouch of a father.  He has remained in the town while his siblings have fled.  His terrible relationship with his father has infiltrated every relationship that he's had, and acts as the lens through which he sees and judges the world.  Because of this, his relationships with different people are all ambivalent  He either respects them and turns to them as a pupil would his master, or he hates them, and violently lashes out at them because they have disappointed him in upholding his preconceived 'high assessments' of them.  Wade is very unstable in that he seems to have a drinking problem, an inability to manage his anger, and as a result but also as a constant circuitous reason, a very low moral view of himself. In this elliptical plot, an important crystallizing event is the hunting accident that results in the death of a rich Bostonian with suspected links to organized crime named Evan Twombley, whose son in law--Mel Gordon--is in business with Wade's boss, Gordon LaRiviere (whom Wade both admires and despises).  The New Hampshire State Police seem to think this is an open and shut case of accidental death  Twombley goes hunting with Wade's young friend Jack, winds up shooting himself, and that's that.  However to Wade, this is not the end of the story.  Wade's low assessment of himself, his having to deal with his father more closely after his mother's recent death, his financial destitution and reliance upon Gordon LaRiviere, as well as his failing attempt to have a close relationship with his estranged daughter Jill and ex-wife Lillian causes him in a desperate act of self assertion of his 'authority' to insist that Twombley was in fact murdered, and that all characters that surround him--his boss Gordon, Jack, and Mel--are involved in a sinister plot to not only get away with murder, but to deceive him and make him look foolish.  As Wade's fantasy elaborately blooms into a wonderfully baroque and intricate starcaise to psychosis, his relationships with the people of Lawford and particularly with his close friends and family rapidly begin to deteriorate.  Watching this occur is like witnessing an avalanche, and exemplifies Kierkegaard's assertion that one does not hit rock bottom in despair, but instead can always sink lower, perhaps infinitely.  Needless to say, the film does not end on a happy note, yet I would commend this film to anyone because the plot is intense, the cinematography is excellent, and Schrader's directing is magnificent.

The effects of abuse are similar to implanted medication. It continues to seethe inside the victim long after the original event or implantation. Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a shell of a man about to lose everything he has and knows, including his sanity, due just as much to his inability to learn to function as a person outside of the abusive environment he grew up in as his overbearing father's alcoholic stupors and redneck machismo. Nolte's mumbling has been criticized as indecipherable hogwash, but it's consistent with a person who has lost direction, confidence in himself, and his reason for being long ago. James Coburn plays Glen Whitehouse, Nolte's father, winning the best supporting actor Oscar for his mind-blowing portrayal of an abusive father who has simply played the same record over and over and over for many many years. Coburn's acting is a rare treat; in that, every action, gesture, nuance, and word of dialog coming out of his mouth makes up a portrait of abuse hanging in an imaginary gallery of contempt. Ironically, Wade and Glen share the name Whitehouse, which of course symbolizes purity, goodness, and an idyllic existence all rolled into one but in reality is everything but that. Nolte's character is a small town sheriff with nothing much to do except plow snow and double as a school crossing guard until a hunting accident occurs and uncovers a possible financial conspiracy. Meanwhile, Nolte must deal with fighting his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) for custody of his daughter who has either been programmed by Hurt against Nolte or has other reasons for disliking him. Every aspect of and social interaction in Nolte's life reduces him to nothingness, whether he tries to buy his daughter a hamburger, plead with his ex-wife (Hurt), give a person a ticket for a moving violation, interact with his best friend or his boss, or has cross words with his father (Coburn). There is not the slightest hint of success in Nolte's past, present, or future, except for the possibility of his current relationship with his new waitress girlfriend played by Sissy Spacek. Watching Nolte's life unfold layer by layer, it's no surprise to viewers when Spacek bails on Nolte as well. Director Paul Schrader wrote the script based on the novel by Russell Banks, and as in every good Schrader film, the acting and the dialog are outstanding. There is never a false note or Hollywood moment. Willem Dafoe, who previously starred in Schrader's earlier best effort Light Sleeper, plays Nolte's younger brother Rolfe who distanced himself emotionally and physically from this quagmire of a family years ago. So much so that Dafoe's ill-advised opinion regarding the hunting accident serves as the catalyst leading to a sequence of events, culminating in Nolte's Pyrrhic victory at the end. It's clear Dafoe's character did not know just how deep or how long Nolte's abuse was festering inside when Dafoe says at least I was never afflicted by that man's (Coburn) violence. Nolte's character replies with that's what you think with a laugh and a tone of voice that makes it clear Wade Whitehouse has never been so sure of anything else ever before.Schrader sets the film in New Hampshire (although it was filmed in Quebec) during a snowy winter and features several shots of bleak landscapes and dimly lit night scenes, the perfect complements to a script depicting one man's small world of despair and desolation closing in and trapping him like an unexpected winter storm. The script's dialog is balanced with fantastic scenes during which the characters reveal much by doing only a little at times. The flashback scenes showing Coburn interacting with his son(s) are like home movies in the Bizarro world; Nolte recalling a family life and memories not worth the effort but always there nevertheless. Sissy Spacek, as Nolte's waitress girlfriend, has a scene at Coburn's house with Nolte present, and she rolls up and tightens her hands in her face, realizing immediately what Nolte took a lifetime to do, if even then. Nolte's toothache throughout the film and how he ultimately chooses to deal with it serves as a metaphor for Schrader's exposure of Nolte's festering rage and his inability to appropriately express anger. He turns to violence, just as his father (Coburn) did, to assert himself, combat his feelings of inadequacy, and to solve his problems. Abuse and violence begets abuse and violence. The film does not necessarily lead to any great redemption, resolution, or revelation. Instead, it builds quietly and slowly telling a story that many viewers are probably familiar with themselves, whether they share the similarity of alcoholic loved ones, a lack of success in their work or personal lives, or just shattered lives. It tells a story of how a man regresses from using his wits to his primitive instincts in order to survive emotionally. It's an interpersonal tragedy, and viewers with unflinching sunny dispositions may not identify with it at all. Viewers have complained about the film being too depressing, pointless, and a waste of their time, so liking the film a lot may be a matter of taste and tolerance, or it may just be that some viewers are unable to accept films without a happy or satisfying ending before the fadeout. ***1/2 of 4 stars.

Did you really expect a happy ending? The film is a dark side vision of Richard Russo's Nobody's Fool, which Paul Newman and Robert Benton turned into a tale of redemption on screen in that same part of the world. No redemption here. As Wade's brother's final voice-over lets you know that Wade is still out there, reliving his father's life, you are relieved to be permitted to leave this claustrophobic world.Painful scene after painful scene are piled on each other, none more so than the painful rejection of Wade by his little girl. Children go through periods where their parents are embarrassments to them, but in this case, it is more of a fear than a shame of Wade that makes her want to be in her mother's arms.This is a great film of uncompromising realism. It is a modern Jude The Obscure, but at least you were allowed to see Jude when he had hope and some happiness, and at the end he simply wore himself out. At the end of Affliction, all that you know is that Wade is out there in the world, his angers banked.The film works because of Nolte's performance. Coburn has an easier job, but he carries it off. The sub-plots mean little, but show us Wade/Nolte in a field of action, and demonstrate that it is not only his personal life that is a mess.Odd that Banks' The Sweet Hereafter locale was moved from upstate New York to British Columbia, and this film of bare rock, flinty New Hampshire was made in Canada also.

The father has successfully destroyed his sons, in a long process which began when they were young boys, who stood and watched their father in a hot temper strike blows upon their mother. The sons are unable to touch him, to feel any emotions towards him, but fear and loathing. The father instills fear in the viewer of the film. He is scary. There is nothing to redeem this father. The son who escapes tells this story as the narrator. The scalding and searing hatred and loathing that each holds to some degree for the other is viewed against stark black and white photographs of a New England winter. Seething unrelieving pain is the film's central character. The father and son anesthetize pain in alcoholism, which the narrator-son manages to just escape. Torture, brutal and mental, is shared in this sad family and memories of it loom large and don't go away. The mother's world is silent, and viewing this film, the viewer is just rendered silent there are no words to describe the lives of the father and his two sons. Wasted, brutalized, and lost are not enough. How many families are there living as the Whitehouses do in our world? Calculating this pain and sadness is the film's bottom line.  Metaphors for these realities bounce about and jar the viewer the son's rotten tooth, the pleasure the father expresses in giving pain to his two sons, the vocabulary of brutality that destroys the human spirit.

I am, so I loved it.It will remind you of the Paul Newman/Bruce Willis film Nobody's Fool. This is a variation on that theme, which is about a loser guy stuck in his ice cold hometown with nothing but bitter memories of his failure and an alcoholic father.But in the Newman film, the guy had come to terms with who he was. He was taking it in stride. In this one, the dad is still alive, so the memories are more vivid, and they're driving the guy crazy.I love the dynamics of a small town, and this one portrays them well. Everyone is like family, for better or worse. He goes into a bar and young guys are telling some story about his childhood. What are the odds? In a small town, they are high.It also follows the other movie in the trend of having one main guy who generates all the business for the town. It's usually a builder and someone who owns a lot of land and businesses. In this one, it's a French Canadian guy. It's not clear if he came down years ago from Quebec (which is where this one was filmed by the way). The setting is central New Hampshire, about a half hour north of Concord, the capitol.Besides the dark, unforgiving landscape and weather, what really makes the film, is Nick Nolte's convincing conveyance of desperation. We get the sense early on, that we have walked in on his downward spiral.Everyone thinks he's a loser, including his ex wife, his daughter, his employer,his dad, and his friends, but he has a soul mate to turn to in the darkest hours of the night. It's his little brother in Boston. These phone calls are his refuge, because only his brother can relate to what he's been through. He was there.One flaw is that we never hear what this guy has been doing since high school, yet he's in his 40's. He mentions having been in the service, but that's it. In this movie he is a lackey for the guy who runs the town. How long could he have been doing that? I want to know if he ever had a long term job or profession, and also what his drunken old dad used to do for a living. That would round out the character development.Dysfunctional families and guys who dig huge holes for themselves usually do not resolve things happily. You find yourself asking why this guy doesn't just move to a bigger town and get a normal job and start fresh. But then you realize that his troubles will follow him wherever he goes, because they are in his head.I could take or leave the narration. Willem Dafoe has an intriguing voice, which is I'm sure part of why he was chosen for the brother/narrator role.I suppose it would be better without it, because it makes it seem like you are watching an episode of The Waltons,albeit a desperately dysfunctional version.James Coburn was fine. His role was repetitive,but he did it adequately. I don't think it was a huge challenge to play a drunk. Sissy Spacek was also not called upon to stretch too far. I don't know why a native to New Hampshire would have a Texas accent, but I guess it is supposed to double for a small town, rural accent nationwide.

Why are Jill's parents so dang old when Wade mentions he got married when he was just a kid?  Why does Rolfe suggest a conspiracy theory regarding the shooting accident and then later describe the plot as existing only in his brother's imagination, as if he had nothing to do with it?  Why do the flashbacks suggest bad camcorder more than forty year old memory?  And is it just me, or does Wade's boss have a weird accent?  In this film Schrader has created a mess of underdeveloped plot lines which he can only salvage by tacking on a voiceover at the end to finish up the story and try in vain to explain to us why we should care.  The alcoholic father is a one-dimensional monster (despite Coburn's noble attempts, I found myself praying that someone would kill him early into the movie), and the protagonist is so multidimensional that he is impossible to grasp.  Mostly, I just didn't care what happened to any of these people.  After shelling out nine bucks at the box office, I couldn't bear to leave, but I'll confess I did whip out a magazine and try to read, but it was just too dark (a good description of the film overall).  The last time I was so bored by so much gratuitous familial dysfunction was when I saw _The Sweet Hereafter_, also based on a Russell Banks novel.

Defined as a state of pain, distress, and misery. One word and yet it means a lot. It also makes a catchy movie title, enough for me to check it out. The film focuses on two different unrelated stories about murder conspiracy and family abuse, seen through the eyes of a small town cop named Wade Whitehorse (Nick Nolte). While the film favors more of the later story than the former, it makes a mildly interesting character study of the movie's protagonist Wade. He is a very imperfect being. He drinks, he smokes, he is estranged from his ex-wife and distant daughter, all the while plagued by harsh memories of his alcoholic father (James Coburn). As the stories progress, they converge and overwhelm Wade as he desperately fights against both and makes some decisions that could harm his life as well as his loving girlfriend (Sissy Spacek). In the end, it comes down to whether his past afflictions from his dad will turn him into a wicked individual. The apple does not fall far from the tree they say.No doubt director and writer Paul Schrader is heavily inspired by old film noir. The movie itself feels like such a genre-a character trapped within himself and from the world, unable to escape, aided with a melancholy score and obtuse camera angles that make the world seem like an inescapable void. The story itself is good noir, but it unfortunately drags. Some scenes go on longer than necessary and when things turn even more interesting, the movie abruptly ends. However, it makes up for with a great cast, particularly with Dafoe as the younger brother and James Coburn as the father. Coburn won an academy award for his performance, and it is not surprising. It is a very good role. He has a very strong dominating presence on screen that dwarfs Nolte, as it would with a cantankerous father with his sensitive son. Nolte is decent; his Neanderthal movements, gruff grumblings, and occasional tirades work well for him in this movie. Though I do think his Oscar nomination was a bit of an overkill. At times, it seemed that he was just being himself whereas Coburn immersed himself with his character. Dafoe on the other hand is very subtle and does a fine job.Affliction overall is a good movie.

It premiered at the 54th Venice Film Festival in 1997, was shot on location in Quebec, Canada and is an American production which was produced by American producer Linda Reisman. It tells the story about a middle-aged policeman named Wade Whitehouse who lives in his father's house with his girlfriend Margie Frogg in a rural town. Wade is in a dispute with his former wife Lillian Whitehouse Horner about the custody of their daughter Jill, but when a fatal and questionable hunting accident occurs he becomes absorbed with the case.Finely and engagingly directed by American filmmaker Paul Schrader, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated by one of the main characters and from multiple viewpoints, draws a literally afflicting and instantly involving portrayal of a domineering and abusive father's relationship with his two contrary sons who has differing views on their upbringing and a crime which one son embraces as it temporarily takes his mind away from his horrible childhood memories. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions and sterling cinematography by Canadian cinematographer and director Paul Sarrosy, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about family relations and a man's strive to break free from his father's shadow depicts some pervasive studies of character and contains a great score by Canadian composer Michael Brook.This conversational, throughout dramatic and literary psychological drama which is set in the state of New Hampshire during a deer hunting season, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, poignant flashback scenes, conflicted characters, emotional substance, distinct acting performances by American actors Nick Nolte and James Coburn (1928-2002) and the fine acting performances by American actresses Sissy Spacek, Mary Beth Hurt and American actor Willem Dafoe. An unsentimental and heartfelt indie from the late 1990s which gained, among numerous other awards, the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor James Coburn at the 71st Academy Awards in 1999.

Schrader's screenplay is so interesting and well-nuanced that your gripped throughout. The biggest plus point of the film, is, that it doesn't try to be REAL, because it pretty much is.'Affliction' is the story of Wade Whitehouse, played amazingly by Nolte, a depressed/frustrated and deranged man who hasn't recovered from the child-abuse he suffered from his father, played by the late James Coborn. As Wade is a small-town policeman in New Hampshire, he begins to investigate of a recently-deceased. 'Affliction' is a sad story of a sad man, who slowly starts aping his evil father as life comes to him. Which becomes his biggest defeat. But, it's a memorable character nonetheless.Paul Schrader's direction is brilliant as well. It's a tough subject to execute, understand and believe in. Schrader is at the top of his creativity in here. Performance-Wise Nick Nolte as Wade, is amazing. The veteran sinks his teeth into the character and delivers his careers finest performance. The Late James Coburn is astounding. He plays the evil-part superbly and it doesn't come as a surprise that he was awarded an Oscar for his work over-here. Willem Dafoe is wonderful in a brief, but substantial role. Sissy Spacek is good. Jim True passable.On the whole, 'Affliction' is a must watch. It does depress you, but that is it's sheer power.

Here, Nick Nolte plays a local lawman and jobbing handyman Wade Whitehouse, a man whose entire life seems to be crumbling all around him. His marriage has ended, his daughter hates him, the town considers him a joke, and added to that he spends the entire film suffering from a severe case of toothache. Like many of Schrader's iconic anti-heroes, Wade is a man trying desperately to do the best he possibly can, but is unable to shake free from the grip of his abusive, hard drinking father Glenn; an almost personification of benign evil here, swaggering around in front of his children and casually beating his wife with a gleeful abandon. However, as the film progresses, Wade himself slips further into darker territories, revealing himself to be closer to his father than he initially expected as the film draws to an exasperating close.Much like his scripts for Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, as well as his best film as director with the haunting and surreal Mishima; A Life in Four Chapters (1986), we know that the film is going to reach an eventual violent and downbeat final, as Wade continues to try and find his own kind of redemption amidst a series of unfortunate events. However, the film is so much more than just a meditation on male aggression, but a microcosm of everything from failure and defeat, as well as issues such as domestic violence and the impact that it has on the children of these families, with both of the central characters here affected by their father who casts a terrifying shadow over both their lives, and the film.If there is a fault with the picture however, then it's the ending. Right up until then we're drawn into these character's lives through the great all round performances from Nolte, Coburn, Spacek, Dafoe, et al, and from the low-key direction of Schrader. But the final act seams so rushed that I really needed to take a second to think about how it affected the film as a whole. A minor criticism admittedly, especially given that the rest of the film is definitely worth experiencing.

The characterization in Schrader's screenplay (and in Banks' novel, I assume) is absolutely astonishing. One rarely sees characters with such detailed psychological profiles in movies as short as Affliction is. James Coburn's Oscar-winning turn as Wade's father, Glen, is also very memorable, and his part is certainly very well-written. The rest of the characters play more minor roles in the film both in thematic terms and in terms of screen time, but Schrader doesn't push them to the side and focus only on the main character. No, Sissy Spacek's character here is very detailed and important, and although her role is relatively small child actress Brigid Tierney is quite excellent as Wade's daughter.The original score by Michael Brook is haunting and memorable and helps keep the film's intensity and atmosphere going, as does Paul Sarossy's cinematography which is suitable to say the least given the harsh setting and subject matter. Paul Schrader absolutely nails the direction on this film. Everything just feels right, the pacing is fantastic, and I'm certain he had something to do with the stunning performances here. The locations are used to optimal effect, and feel just as harsh from the safety of your seat as they would in reality.Affliction may not be an easy film to watch repeatedly, as it is relentlessly intense, but it is also a highly involving and sophisticated dramatic thriller, something that is certainly becoming a rare event in American cinema.

This is one of the best I've seen, and coming off McKellen's performance in Gods and Monsters (against which Nolte will compete in the tightest Best Actor Oscar race in years), that's not an understatement.  I don't remember if I've ever seen Nolte disappear into a role (as Hanks can as easily as breathing), but his Wade Whitehouse is one for the ages.Coburn is exceptional as well, and Spacek provides perfect support, but none of this would have come off as powerfully and as believably were it not for Paul Schrader, who's one of the best screenwriters/directors in the business, yet he still can't get people to remember that he's done other things besides write Taxi Driver. Schrader's use here of handheld 8mm and black-and-white flashback are prime examples of his imaginative style (check out his tri-styled Mishima when you have a chance), and it's a shame that Schrader's not even up for one of the Oscars that either Nolte or Coburn may end up with that night.  Not for the psychologically (or dentally!) squeamish, but deeply rewarding on many levels, especially if you've survived life in a dysfunctional family. It's all true, folks. (BTW, those of you're upset that the murder plot goes nowhere or were bored in general, you're COMPLETELY missing the point of the film.

I stick to those words! Paul Schrader has always been a good director of unflinching bravery. He tackles the toughest subject matters head on! Here we have a story about Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) who is the sheriff of a very small New Hampshire town and gets no respect from anyone in his life. He's divorced and gets to see his daughter part of the time. He's also a hard drinker and smokes pot on the job. But he's also the victim of a very brutal childhood at the hands of his monster of a father Glen (James Coburn). Wades mother is found dead in her bed and Glen cannot acknowledge it. Wades brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) comes for the funeral and Rolfe also acts as the films narrator as he lets the viewer in on little details about they're upbringing. Wade has a girlfriend named Margie (Sissy Spacek) and she seems to genuinely like Wade but as the film continues we see her growing tiresome of the situations with him. What is fascinating about the film is watching Wade try not to become his father. Nolte is a big guy and is usually the biggest thing on screen but Coburn is enormous. With about 40 extra pounds of padding, Coburn dwarfs Nolte. We can understand why he is afraid of his father. One of the things that stand out in this film as I watched it is the location where it was shot. The cold and snowy New Hampshire setting is the perfect bleak landscape for a story with bleak characters. There is a subplot about an accidental shooting on a hunting trip that Wade investigates and ends up being about real estate and when Wade uncovers this it erupts a false confidence in himself and he thinks that when he breaks the story people will finally respect him. I didn't care to much about this part of the film because the main point of the film is Nolte and Coburn and this is what the story is really about. Also, Wade has a nagging toothache and it represents his past that will not go away and is slowly driving him crazy. *****SPOILER ALERT***** The end of this film is haunting and powerful as we see Wade become his father Glen. We know its going to happen and I think Wade knows it also but seems to be powerless to stop it. Margie finally has had enough and leaves Wade and when he tries to talk to her his daughter thinks he's attacking her and she flails at him. When his daughter has finally turned her back on him he reacts with violence, like his father would have. Wade gets rid of his father the same way he got rid of his tooth, with a blunt instrument. Coburn is so menacing and cruel that its a wonder that Wade didn't react this way earlier. Nolte is just riveting and his beaten gruff exterior is perfect. The scene where he pulls out his own tooth with a pliers is haunting. Its a tough film to watch but the performances and the no holds barred script make this a film that just can't be forgotten. Nolte didn't win an Oscar for this role but he should have. He's never been better and never will be again. Very powerful film.

The distance between the two is apparent and about to get worse.  They arrive, daughter dressed as a tiger, Wade dressed as a cop.  He is a child dressed as a man.  The daughter is out of place and unhappy, making this known to Wade.  Facing a challenge that is beyond him, he steps outside where he is pulled into the life of some younger people, driving around town, getting stoned and being generally small-town. Why does Wade shy away from being a man?  Because his definition of a man is his father, an abusive and alcoholic ogre.  Wade has found peace in being a parody of an adult.  He can hang with kids just shy of high school because he has not permitted himself to grow any older than just short of manhood.  He is pathetic, but he is also very amiable.  He could live his whole life this way.  That is, he could if he hadn't already committed to fatherhood and if the new love of his life didn't expect a bit more.His new love, Marge, is a small town woman through and through.  Perhaps she has been passed around a bit, but she has a good heart.  She seems barely content with drifting through life, staying just short of ambitious.  Perhaps she'll marry her bear-cub boyfriend Wade and have a family while she can.  Perhaps not.  She is smarter than Wade, but he is fun and harmless, it seems.Wade's brother, Rolfe, is the kid who managed to avoid the blows of his father.  He is the smart one.  Smart enough to stay far enough away from his father, smart enough to distract himself from the ruins of abuse with intellectual pursuits.  His intelligence bought him a way out.  He is committed only to himself.Exposing his own aggression, Rolfe plants seeds in Wade that will soon be Wade's undoing.  To Rolfe, it's all a bit fun.  When he's back in his home-town, he returns to a role.  He and Wade are kids up to no good.  They are sleuths, unlocking the truth of the grown-ups.  There is no risk to Rolfe since his brother has and will be the shield.Wade's role is stressed in a series of events.  He has been powerless in keeping his family together.  His ex-wife outgrew him and has moved on.  He is powerless against even the will of his daughter.  He has not seemed to even notice that she is not 6 anymore, and that she has begun to recognize his shortcomings.  All this, he must change.  He had been handed the role of a cop, not for merit, but for obedience to the town's owners.  This must change.  His father has become incompetent and might have even let his mother die from exposure.  Wade becomes the head of the household and thus launches his new interest in a commanding role.  But a commanding role requires a man.  For Wade, a man is an monster.  Needless to say, it doesn't go well for Wade and all who surround him.

It's one of those independents that got overlooked by the public but not by the critics and certainly not by fans of the incomparable Nick Nolte. I won't give a lot of details or a plot summary since it's been done several times already.Affliction is the story of how alcoholism is a disease some family members catch but all are affected by negatively in some way. James Coburn, family patriarch, has the disease. Nick Nolte, eldest son, catches it. And both Willem Dafoe, youngest son, and Mary Beth Hurt, wife, are affected by it. The wife is beaten into submission years before while the youngest son in scared to death of his father and as he says in the film, I was a careful child and I became a careful adult (explaining how one episode caused him to be very careful around his father and thus, it is now his role in life).But for this film, we are focusing on Nolte and Coburn who are so intense in this movie it is beyond belief that there was not a two-fer Oscar win for their performances. This is a father-son screen story for the ages worthy of a Greek tragedy. And as we join them at their current ages and the current stage of the battle, they are a frightening dynamic to watch.See the story in the Trivia section of the preparation conversation between the director Paul Schrader and Coburn. It is a true shame that we were not given the opportunity to see Coburn truly act more often. I always liked Coburn since he seemed likable but his career was a string of mainstream mediocrity in which he was punching a clock. This role shows us the depth of this man's talent that sadly Hollywood and he wasted with choices more like the embarrassing Snow Dogs than true acting vehicles such as this.For Nolte it was yet again another shaft by the Academy. People seem to be happy to equate Nolte's talent with the infamous mug shot that is so happily reprinted from a substance-related arrest. Why I do not know. I cannot think of another actor that I would lay down my money to see and know that am guaranteed my money's worth from his efforts at least. As someone mentioned in the comments, Tom Hanks (who also lost out on an Oscar in the same category losing to the lead role from the most insulting and disrespectful film made in many years, Life is Beautiful), would never have considered taking Nolte's role. Never. He is not going to take a role which contrasts with his good guy image and so we are treated to an endless stream of average, nice guy wins roles from him while Nolte, who takes more chances than any other actor in Hollywood, is continually ignored. This part is as skillfully crafted as his role in Mother Night. You can see more of his talent in Nightwatch and more recently in Off The Black, another small film he makes a big impact in. All ignored by the Academy.Nolte's skill makes his paranoid reactions to situations believable where other actors would make it comical or simply awkward. His anger and angst as well as his broken personality bursts out of the screen. Throughout this film his character PLEADS for help in every way he can without sacrificing that tough, leathery exterior that real men are supposed to have in this country (at least of that generation, that last generation it was expected of) and that his father holds up as the highest achievement any man can attain. But he is a broken man, broken deep inside where it is nearly impossible to repair and must start with a soul being opened up completely like a gutted, helpless fish which is not something men growing up in a situation like this can ever do, during or after (though honestly there is never an after ... it is always during ... and it is for the rest of your life). Nolte makes it all so real and genuine many comments on this board say he must not be acting and must really be like this. I don't know Mr. Nolte personally and I am certain others saying this do not. It's just one more way of snubbing his immense and honest talent in favor of what the news media and the hammerheads on the internet would rather have you believe is the Nolte that matters, that is, that infamous mug shot.And what different thing does Nolte bring to every role? What makes the actor so unique? One thing I always notice is the walk, the gate of each character. In Affliction it is a rhythmic, self-assured stride as he is protecting what little of his insides there is left to try to save. But as the anger and the madness take him, the stride is hard, punching, and off-center.In Off The Black, his stride is also off-center, physically with his right foot pointing out and his left foot pointing in as he angles through his uncertain life, uncertain of himself and his place in the world.I'm running out of room as I always do but Sissy Spacek and Willem Dafoe make big things of their smaller parts and flesh out the fun house mirror-feeling of the central figure's life that keeps us all off-balance to the sudden and brutal end.Schrader directs this group to a perfect film in my opinion. It builds to a deafening, disturbing crescendo in steady, well-timed measures. He was also overlooked for the Oscar for what is his best film since American Gigolo.See this film. It cuts to the bone and then scrapes across the bone in a long slow draw.

Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is the sheriff of a small New Hampshire town. He's also a heavy drinker with an ex-wife who can't stand him and a daughter who spends her time pouting and asking to go home to her mother. One day a hunting accident leaves a wealthy businessman dead, and Wade sees this as his opportunity to prove his worth to his family, his town and himself. Under the hands of Schrader though, someone who has never taken the safe road as a filmmaker, this small town neo-noir thriller turns into a wrenching study of a deeply disturbed individual.What began as an intriguing mystery instead takes a descent into madness, unraveling this man and exposing the brutality that has long been dormant, waiting underneath the surface for the right circumstances to come about. Whitehouse is subtly picked apart by small disturbances, like a gnawing tooth ache and his ungrateful, unloving daughter, that Schrader intelligently weaves into this building sense of aggression and frustration. By the time his daughter refuses to get a Big Mac because her mother says it's bad for her, the audience is down to their last nerve the same way that Whitehouse is. It's an incredible display of bringing the viewer into the mind of it's main character, which builds to a final act that is shattering and terrifying.Schrader's script is immaculately staged here, the kind of intelligent writing where there isn't a single wasted moment. The first hour of the film is almost all character development, which services everything perfectly. It's all building the sense that things are coming to a dramatic climax, where every path, no matter how large or small, ultimately leads to one destination. As these minor distractions plague on him, Whitehouse continues his investigation into the death, but what takes a more center stage as the film progresses is his chaotic relationship with his father, portrayed by James Coburn. We start to see that it's this father/son dynamic that has made Whitehouse such a disturbed individual, his father being a terrifying bastard of a man who abused him as a child while he drank himself into short-tempered rages.In this dynamic, Affliction starts to become a study of what kind of impact that relationship can have on the development of a person, that can grow inside of him and change the course of who he is to become. Is Whitehouse a bad man at heart, or was he made that way by his father? He seems good when we first meet him, trying his hardest despite his character faults, but as he goes down this descent the audience is left to wonder if the father makes the man, if a different patriarch could have led him down a path much less dark. Coburn is a terrifying force here, a man who makes you uncomfortable from the moment he steps into the room. Even when he's not in a rage, you can feel it in the air, the fear that it can come at any moment. It's a palpable sensation that anyone with a short-tempered father can immediately relate to. Casting this man was a hard task for Schrader, as he had to find someone who could make the intimidating Nick Nolte quake in his boots, and there couldn't have been anyone more suited for the job than Coburn.Nolte's performance likewise is a work of art and takes us so thoroughly down this road to darkness that Whitehouse experiences. He makes you sympathize with him, perhaps even empathize as I most certainly did, which makes his explosion, his unbridled descent all the more wrenching. There's a scene where he lets loose, completely explodes on a tirade about how this town needs him, that is one of the most shockingly chilling moments I've experienced in some time. It leaves you unable to move, a towering display of machismo in the face of potential emasculation. This is what the film boils down to in a lot of ways, the things that make a man and what being a man really means.Interestingly, the story is told from the outside perspective of Whitehouse's brother Rolfe, played by the always great Willem Dafoe. Instead of having the story told through the eyes of Wade, instead we see it all as Rolfe looking back, filled with an eerie sense of remorse that he wasn't able to stop what was coming. Dafoe only appears physically on screen for about ten or fifteen minutes, but you can feel his presence looming over the picture the whole way through, as we occasionally hear him through voice-over. His intriguing voice captures the audience, giving Affliction a troubling, almost poetic neo-noir feel that broods while the characters explode. It's the perfect contrast to the towering work delivered by Schrader and his actors on screen. This is a shattering picture.

In the meantime he is having custody problems with his ex wife. His daughter is a spoiled brat who never wants to spend time with dad, even though he goes out of his way to try and make the visits enjoyable. His girlfriend Margie, played by Sissy Spacek, is a sweet loving girlfriend who stands by her man until she too has had enough. The stress of his job and the fact that his life seems to be crumbling is too much and eventually Wade starts to crack.What I got from this film is that this is a man who is plagued by many problems, who is just trying to do the right thing. He thinks a murder has taken place and tries to solve it. He is trying to get along with his dad, even though dad is an abusive drunk. And he wants to spend time with his young daughter, who does nothing but whine that she wants to go back home to mom. I started to feel sorry for this man by the end of the film, with all the obstacles he had.Overall, I was glad I finished this film and give it a 7/10. Great performances by all.

In this wintry Film Blanc (nods to the Coen Brothers), the circumstances are completely different instead of a suffocating, scummy NYC, we have an isolated, miserable town in upstate New Hampshire. The psychodrama of the main character's complex family relationships, especially his father (Coburn, in the most serious role of his career), unfolds slowly and inevitably; by the final minutes, the audience can fully grasp his ravaged soul, almost ready to lash out themselves. Nick Nolte's performance (truly worthy of a best actor Oscar) literally builds the whole project he stumbles, growls and snaps with the despair and ferocity of a wounded bear. The climax of his sufferings, however, is not fully realized, as the buildup of the film's tension is released too soon. We do not see the vengeful grandeur of the De Niro kind, and thus the picture limps down prematurely. Remarkably, as it is so rare in modern cinema, Affliction sustains the tone of a true Tragedy, offering absolutely no redemption or a single scene that is somehow uplifting.

After a so-called hunt accident, that ended up in the death of a powerful man, Nolte's character decides to seek for the truth as a way in which he may finally find redemption. This is a Schrader film, so don't expect happy endings, but is exactly this aspect that makes Affliction such a vigorous psychological drama.This film is closely to a masterpiece, but the slow rhythm and the lack of basic action and emotion turns this drama into a good, but not excellent, film.

I'd imagine that the sore tooth removing scene was very symbolic -- the tooth resembled his misfortune, sufferage (and likely his father) and he just wanted to take it out of his life.

Such as?  Well.  The structure doesn't work; some of the major characters (Jim True and Gordon LaRiviere) are underwritten and don't come to life, and it's occasionally silly or incomprehensible (Wade Whitehouse's frozen Jesus while acting as crossing guard).But.Something about it won't leave me alone.  Something to do with the story. A lot of maybes spring to mind - the structure's wrong, something's missing, something's in the wrong place, the voiceover is preachy, it's badly paced, it's too much of a message film and the message is obvious anyway; I don't know what it is.  But it's like listening to a messy performance of a great piece of music; some of the notes are wrong, but - and even though you've never heard the piece before - you know which ones they are and what they ought to be and you go and find a better performance of the piece and listen to that.  You can see the film they could have made and it's better than the one you're watching.The problems, by the way, are down to Schrader in the writing, direction and editing (unless they're down to Russell Banks' novel, and if they are it was up to Schrader to sort them out).  Nolte, Coburn, Spacek, Defoe and Bridid Tierney as Wade's daughter are excellent.  The camerawork is fine (except for one of the worst pieces of back projection I've ever seen, which does the film no favours as it's right at the start).  The music is also worth a mention (even if much of it does sound suspiciously like an old piece by the Cure called Carnage Visors).Overall it's one of those films that irritates the hell out of you as you watch it, but you'll find yourself thinking about it for quite a while afterwards.Which is why I've just bought the book.

I knew it would be like A Simple Plan, which is by the way a better film in all respects, in lack of shock value and its concentration on how characters changed their relations between one another after an incident.  But Schrader doesn't pull it off here, no matter how good a job Nick Nolte does.  I'm watching Raging Bull right now for a class, and I realized he can't direct his own screenplays as well as Scorsese can.  Take any scenes between Cathy Moriarty and De Niro in Bull, vs. Sissy Spacek and Nick Nolte, and you'll realize there's something missing in Schrader's direction.  The cinematography, the atmosphere, the music all seems dulled somehow, losing its focus.  I mean, if Joey had been able to wax philosophical to us about Jake's decline, would the film's images have had the same power?Examples of relationships Spacey and Nolte's relationship could have been performed much more interestingly- there was no JOY there, only empty, almost forced smiles.  Just like it's no surprise for a sinless man to yell out I'm saved! it's no great tragedy or drama to watch a joyless couple decline.  It seemed like Schrader really didn't know what to do with Spacek, even more so with Jack Hewitt.  The relationship between Jack and Wade is kind of at the heart of things, their similar economic positions, their friendship going back a while.  Wade lets Jack slip by every now and then for a few favors, etc.  Schrader sacrifices this tension in the process of exploring every possible dimension of the life of Wade Whitehouse and then show it ALL declining.  This made for a rather hammering, dulling film in which we could almost predict and soon not give a damn about where Wade was headed in his paranoia and frustration.A Simple Plan gave us four characters and a palpable tension created between them over a bag of money.  How did it transform their relationships?  Why? Who suffered, who gained?  How do we arrive at the deaths at the end, what went wrong?  All these questions were central in my mind after seeing A Simple Plan.  Similarly, Affliction created a catalyst, the strange death of Twombly, but didn't take it far enough.  An IMDB criticism here was just right Rolfe's character had a SEVERE effect on how Wade interpreted the incident, but Dafoe's narration somehow allowed him to back out.The narration was excessive that first shot of Affliction with the car coming in could have resembled Heat's grand opening shot of the subway. Dafoe screwed it up with words, since film must be primarily a medium about the power of visual suggestion.  I was disgusted by how far Schrader let it go ending it on the frame of Nolte drinking and the house burning in the background would have been fine, though horrible.  The final ending was real overkill.Nolte is always interesting to watch, but you don't give a damn eventually because nobody else here really interests you.  Jack, Larriviere, Spacek, Rolfe, even his father by Coburn, who should not have gotten the Oscar over Thornton, don't create really interesting situations or tensions with Wade. Even if they are created, they're not sustained.  For me, the most interesting relationship has to be between Wade and his ex-wife's family and daughter.Yes, the daughter was way too whiny and I could see how we could dislike her character, but watching Nolte struggling to be tender and commanding with the girl was my favorite part of the film.  His not knowing how the hell to get her to trust him or even like him was all over his face, body language, tone.  The way she says, Don't WORRY, Dad.  I love you, and the look of doubt that formed on Nolte's face really captivated me.  For me the tightest, best performed scene in the movie was when the ex-wife came to pick the daughter up.  Everything gets so screwed up for Wade, when he so wants to be good.  Don't say a word....I didn't hit him, I didn't hit him was probably the most human, fragile moments in the film (thankfully without any strange, depressing music in the background.)I don't know what Schrader was trying to do here, but the film seemed to fail for everyone in the audience.  Definitely, Dafoe's closing narration rotted a lot of the effect of Wade's burning the barn.  Certainly, the parts of Affliction didn't hold together.  And even though Nolte is a dynamic actor to watch, if we can't really care about the people he interacts with, what's the point?  A film where the supporting ensemble outranks the lead actor is usually a better scenario than one where the lead has no support. That was the case here, due to the faulty structure and direction of Affliction.I'm just waiting for a Mel Brooks snow movie he could really have some fun with this genre we've conjured up...  "},{"Title":"Sins of the Fathers.","Date":"4 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This is by any measure a superior movie, yet it's hard to form any global judgment on it because there are several ways of looking at it.The story involves a small-town New England police official, Nick Nolte, who is plagued by personal problems. He's about to engage in a custody battle with the wife who has left him. He's trying as delicately as possible to handle his new romance with Sissy Spacek. His estranged daughter doesn't really like him much. He doesn't get along with his boss, not only the head of law enforcement but a Selectman (whatever that is) who is buying up local real estate in anticipation of building a world-class ski resort. Nolte's younger sibling (Willem Dafoe) is a professor in Boston and has little contact with him. His mother dies. His father, James Coburn, is a wretched and abusive alcoholic, the kind of guy who once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like. And on top of that, a Boston power broker is killed during a deer hunt, the killing is classified as an accident, only Nolte believes he has reasons to put quotation marks around the word accident. Worse than anything else perhaps is the toothache that fills his day with pain. (I think it's a symbol.) He winds up yanking the offensive bicuspid with a pair of pliers.All of this tsuris drives Nolte up the wall and he begins to act half crazed -- thumping his little girl away when she knocks him down, destroying half his boss's office before being fired, boozing it up, driving Spacek away, ranting on about how he's going to crack the murder mystery that has been simmering in the background, yanking open kitchen drawers aimlessly then slamming them shut. When his drunken dad hits him over the head with a bottle, he retaliates by whacking the old man across the head with the butt of a rifle, as a consequence of which the old fellow dies on the spot. It seems (it's not really clear) that he shoots and kills the suspect and then takes off for parts unknown. The end.The acting is close to being splendid. Nolte has never been better and Coburn deserved all the praise he garnered for his performance. Sissy Spacek's role is relatively small and not nearly as flashy as the others' but I think she turns in the best job. Example. In the drab farm house kitchen, Nolte is shouting and slamming things around while Spacek sits at the table. The standard reaction shot would be Spacek staring in horror at the pyroclastic Nolte, shrinking away from his wrath, her fists curled against her cheeks, protesting, perhaps screaming. But no. She doesn't even look at him. Her chin in cupped in her hand and her big blue eyes stare thoughtfully into empty space. You can practically hear the wheels clicking.It's the story of a fundamentally decent and entirely ordinary man who is undone by childhood demons, a tragedy of almost Shakespearean dimensions.That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is that it is a simple fairy tale about child and spousal abuse by redneck men, and that abused children grow into abusive adults. We are periodically pointed towards this heuristic by the super-literary and overly sanctimonious narration by Nolte's distant and unhelpful brother, the big professor at Boston University. The murder conspiracy, the narration tells us, was all a delusion. The professor ought to know because he's the one who reinforced Nolte's conviction that the conspiracy was real. And -- if one were to stand back and objectively look at the way Nolte is treated in his social world -- really, some of his anger would be perfectly understandable. Spacek leaves him not because he has abused her in any way but because she seems tired of living with his drunken, lecherous old man, and because she has second sight and anticipates what Nolte is liable to become. Like the absent brother, she doesn't really offer much in the way of understanding or help, though of course she's only human. Nolte's boss comes across as generous but unpleasant, a mean and vengeful anti-smoker. And Nolte's little girl, the one he wants custody of? What an intolerant little snot! He takes her for a drive and offers to buy her a hamburger. She reproaches him for the offer. Fast food is no good for you. Mommy says so. She wants to go home. The benumbed Nolte offers another suggestion How about the Pizza House? Abusive fathers are one thing, but who put all that power in the hands of a ten-year-old kid? Does anyone want to live in a world in which little kids set the rules? Or overprotective mothers or people offended by a whiff of smoke and use it as a justification for demeaning others and demonstrating their own moral purity? Where does all that leave Nolte? It also seems unfair to the child, to burden her with that much responsibility. If one can get past the cumulative stupidity of that oppressive morality, it's a well-executed picture. I've seen it twice and enjoyed it, but I have to shut down half my left hemisphere to do it.

This movie does an excellent job of showing how a man can both function in life and be troubled in life due his past. Nolte plays a sheriff of a small town in New Hampshire (actually, filmed in Quebec, though). He is rugged and probably the strongest man in town. He is a good old boy. Yet, he has an abusive past. His father, James Cobourn, was a mean man who believed that terrorizing and torturing his family was the way a father should be. He learned that from his father. Cobourn's father is an old man now, but still a town pest. He can be likable for a few minutes, but then people discover that he is just a mean man. Nolte plays a seemingly normal man who is starting to unravel throughout the movie. He is troubled, because his wife left him, and in his mind, he feels that his daughter is being unfairly manipulated and estranged by his ex-wife. It is hard to say whether it is imagination or somewhat true. This movie is about perceptions. Because Nolte was raised in an abusive, alcoholic family environment, he can never feel safe and loved. He is paranoid and perceives people being against him, when it is not clearly the case. I liked this movie because it does take a hard look at how hard life can be when there is something wrong in your past. The part I didn't like is how awfully politically correct the movie was. You never completely understood why his daughter was so sensitive and afraid of him. He never really did anything wrong to her. Maybe, it is representative of how things have maybe changed too much. In the old days, stuff happened and was accepted. Nowadays, any sign of any trouble is immediately seen as a threatening situation. Who knows? Maybe that was part of the point of the movie.

He hopes that it might make him the town hero, but several conditions work against everyone. First and foremost is Wade's alcoholic, abusive father (Coburn). Pretty much anytime that we see his father, the man is still drinking and being as nasty as possible to everyone around him. Wade's brother (Willem Dafoe) is too afraid to speak his mind.

Far from any winter wonderland, the setting backs up Wade's depressed mindset affected by his upbringing. Everything in this movie has the purpose of making you feel like there's a lead weight on every square centimeter of your body, and they succeed.

He's not a very good man, he smokes pot, drinks booze, has a poor relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, and doesn't care much for life.  He is still haunted by memories of his abusive father who still lives near by.  James Coburn (Eraser, Payback) plays the father making him a chilling character in a wonderful Oscar winning performance.  The one saving grace in Nolte's life is his girlfriend, well-played by Sissy Spacek (JFK, Blast from the Past). Another person in Nolte's life is his brother who lives miles away, Nolte talks to his brother over the phone and gets along with him when he comes over.  Willem Dafoe (Platoon, The Last Temptation of Christ) is great in a very under-written role as the brother.  At the start of movie a man has died in the woods because he accidently shot himself, Nolte thinks its a conspiracy and tries to solve it.  The murder mystery is not the main story of the movie, the main story is the gradual breakdown of Nolte's character. Nolte is fantastic in a wonderful performance that in my mind (from what I've seen) is the second best performance of the year (behind Edward Norton for American History X).  Nolte is always convincing in a subtle performance of a man who is losing his grip on life.  Highly recommended for superb performances and a well-written script, though a downer movie.

Nick Nolte has in Wade Whitehouse's interpretation one of his great moments, without a doubt, Affliction  is the best film of his career, that was already being found losing it's breath. Therefore, Affliction  went very good for the star's career.The Oscar of this year, without a doubt, deserves to go for him, because the actor achieved to pass for the audience all the emotion and suffering, being, in some moments, impossible to contain the tears.The story is simple, without great moments, it tells a common man's life, equal to me, you or your parents, who, from one hour  to another, decides to place all his mistakes and  defects back and to look for inside of himself his largest virtues. And it is on that moment that  Affliction  gets into the tracks it's basic ideas come, about redemption, the blame that torments us and the redemption that frees us. Wade Whitehouse is a depressed and tough sheriff of a cold and small city, wich is close to the border of Canada. Nobody in the city seems to respect Wade, nobody seems to like him, even his daughter sees him as somebody distant. It is when Wade decides to look for the justice and to end at the same time with his sad and disturbing problems that  Affliction  is consecrated as one of the best films of the last times. It is on that moment in that Wade challenges his largest fears, and in which his greatests qualities come to the top, where the film deserves to get an Oscar nomination as best picture.And the end of the film  is glorious.Attend this film. Unlike garbages of the gender, Affliction  is one of the best works, one of the best films already done, it is a touching, sad and thrilling work , that talks about love, about blame, redemption and about the anguishes that sometimes destroy our lives. With a superb cast, led by Nick Nolte (in his best performance since  The Prince of Tides ), an efficient and diligent direction, a picture that combines with perfection to the climate proposed by the film, Affliction  is a small masterpiece, a study about the man, about, for more incredible than it seems, the human spirit and about the fact that it always triumphs in the end.

The movie shows plenty of flashbacks of when the father tortured not only Wade, who was only a child at the time, but his younger brother, Rolfe, and their mother, too.  Are those scenes excruciating and painful to watch? Yes, however; the moments serve as a crucial element of the story which can't be forgotten.Recent Oscar nominees Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom) and Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire) round out the cast as Wade's girlfriend and Rolfe, who's now grown-up and left the town several years ago.  Their characters add another key piece to the tale, making it very clear and better to understand for the viewer.As I conclude my review, I was satisfied even though there were moments where I cringed.  Nolte is fine here, but the movie truly belongs to Coburn, who certainly makes his presence felt here right away and won a Best Supporting Oscar for his performance.  Plus, he(Coburn) makes some old pros of being sadistic like Kevin Bacon and Dennis Hopper look lame.Affliction may not be Schrader's best film, but it's irriestable to watch.

There's a toothache, a murder, a divorce....and why do I care? This movie struggles trying to decide what to be. Is it a murder mystery? A drama? Or just a pointless waste of time? Mostly the latter. The ending made absolutely no sense at all and was completely unfulfilling to the script and the audience. The expected gradual buildup one anticipated was completely absent...there is no descent into madness or anything like that. It is more like 2 hours of nothing, horribly drawn out, followed by about 5 minutes of a series of events that should have been the climax, mostly reduced to flashback and 3rd party offscreen narration! (And bad narration, I might add - Willem Dafoe might be a great actor, but he should never be allowed to read/narrate a film again. He sounds like he's reading out of a book.) I understand the deeper intent, but the execution was pathetic. I would not curse sitting through this entire film again on anyone.

Twice divorced from the same woman he is unable to connect with his daughter, at those times that he has parental rights to see her. As the town cop he is hardly a notch above Barney Fife, drinking and smoking pot on the job and beholden to the town mayor. Most everything Wade tries to do turns sour. A central event in the movie is a hunting accident involving the death of a wealthy out-of-state union man who had been accompanied by a young local guide. Wade suspects that the death may have been a murder and his investigation stirs up conflicts with the local power structure. Wade had some theories about the shooting but he did not even conduct a thorough investigation of the crime scene, like the position of the body, the angle of the entry wound, the consistency of the story from the hunter's guide--things thatwould have gone a long way in solving some of the event's mysteries. Even more to the point, there was no search for the bullet that killed the hunter-- that would at least have proved whether the bullet came from the hunter's own gun, and thus have ruled out the theory of an independent shooter. When we meet Wade's father Glenn (James Coburn) we understand a lot about why Wade is the way he is. Glenn is a man who takes out his life's frustrations and failures by drinking and dominating those around him. Coburn gives a remarkable performance--he is physically and emotionally intimidating. My anxiety levels went up every time he was on the screen, and even when not on screen he cast a shadow over the proceedings. My reactions to him were probably similar to Wade's and I could feel what it might be like to live in the shadow of such a man. The score accentuated my anxiety levels. Actors are interesting--how could James Coburn get himself to play such a despicable character so convincingly? I do have to admire his acting here. Willem Defoe turns up as Wade's more stable brother Rolfe. Rolfe had the good sense to escape the toxic family environment of his youth. Unfortunately Wade did not have the spine to stand up to the withering force of his father's personality. Whenever Wade was around his father he reacted to him like he was dealing with a vicious feral animal.Pretty far from the end I had to think that things were not going to end well. The only spark in Wade's life was a relation with a local waitress (Sissy Spacek), but the humiliations Wade had suffered finally culminated in uncontrolled self-destructive behavior.There is an epilogue that wraps things up a bit, but I am not sure of the truth of the comment made there that Wade is an example of someone who broke the chain of abuse; I think his daughter was pretty scared of him. Growing up in such a household as Wade would indeed make future relationships difficult, particularly living in the same small town with such a father.

I truly believe that he is one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood who should get the chance to play some bigger roles in more important movies. Take for instance this Affliction. It has been directed by an unknown director and when we are talking about money, than this is clearly not one of the biggest Hollywood productions ever. I wouldn't even be surprised if this movie never made it to the movie theaters over here. I certainly hadn't heard of it before and I only watched this movie because Nick Nolte played an important role in it, but that doesn't mean that it can't be any good of course.Wade Whitehouse is a police officer / snow plow driver in a small town who hasn't exactly had the most perfect life. As a kid he was always humiliated and mentally tortured by his father and as an adult he wasn't able to save his marriage with his ex-wife Lillian, causing him to lose all contact with his daughter Jill, and his job doesn't really give him any satisfaction or respect. The only person that cares for him is his girlfriend Margie, who accepts him the way he is. When on the first day of the hunting season his best friend takes a wealthy businessman on a hunting trip and that man gets killed in suspicious conditions, Wade decides to play detective and starts investigating the case despite the fact that Jack insists that it was nothing more but an accidental, self-inflicted shot. Gradually Wade finds more and more evidence that Jack lied. But is this really what happened or is Wade gradually losing his last grip on reality?I must say that the concept of the story is very intriguing and I'm convinced that this could have been an award winning story, if done properly. And that's the problem with this movie. The idea behind it is more than OK, but the execution left me with a double feeling. It just wasn't as compelling and gripping as I hoped it would be. It wasn't bad, but the entire movie didn't completely convince me either. However, the acting certainly hasn't got anything to do with that. All actors did a good job, but Nick Nolte was in my opinion really outstanding. His performance is probably the best reason why you should watch this movie.In the end this certainly isn't a bad movie and I'm already glad that it is so much better than so many other Hollywood products, but saying that this is one of the best movies ever would be exaggerated as well. I liked the fact that the characters were quite well developed and that the movie tried to be original without impossible explosions or other action shots, but the story wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.

Wade has many virtues we find in our heros. He's the chief law enforcement officer in a small New Hampshire town and popular with many of his fellows. He's a father and a twice-divorced husband but both to the same woman, so he's very likeable yet he has problems. And he stands up against the strong in protection of the weak. I'm grieving (wading in sorrow) for Wade because his life plunges down an abyss, and by the film's end we learn that he is no hero. This powerful emotional response to a film is what make Affliction a great movie, well worth renting.The road to Hell Wade takes began in his childhood. Back then, a demon blocked his path, a demon he called his father, Glen Whitehouse, played by James Coburn. Glen, who throughout his life abuses alcohol, then his wife and then his children, presents the challenge to Wade to develop into a hero, a dragon slayer. And Wade does fight back against this bully, a prototypical figure of fear that many of knew growing up. Glen picks on those who a smaller than him, easily hurting and tossing to the ground little Wade, then towering over him and tauting him sadistically to come take some more punishment, finally to ridicule him with laughter when Wade remains sprawled on the ground. But Wade cannot slay this dragon, and Glen continues to feed of the fear of his family.Coburn, who many know as playing the debonaire title role in the Flint movies, has been cast against character as villianous Glen. In this movie, he is once again playing the title role; he is the Affliction. All though a good deal older than his Flint days, Coburn remains handsome and charismatic. His calculated acting skill, and some fine directing, turn him into a very scary man. His portrayal haunts you way past the closing credits. In fact, his performance won Coburn the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. After watching the film, ask yourself whether you would break every moral and legal code and murder this father if he were yours.In the movie's story, Wade could go either way. He's planning his future, trying to take the good parts of his past, such as his daughter, Jill, and start a new life with a woman, Margie, played by Sissy Spacek, who has known him since childhood. Yet there's an unexpected turn. When Wade brings Margie over to his parents in an attempt to introduce her to them, Wade discovers that his mother has died in her bed and his father seems to be suicidal. Without his mother, the barrier restraining Glen from entering Wade's life again no longer exists. Wade re-enters his father's sway.The film follows Wade as he descends. What may seem petty to the film watcher, turns out to be egregious to Wade, who, like his father, uses violence to control his stress. What seems to me as a turning point, or a place in the film where the audience suddenly discovers Wade is not really the hero they thought he was, is when he spends a hefty $500 to proceed with a legal battle to gain control of his daughter despite the warning his lawyer gives him that what he will be doing may hurt his daughter emotionally. Soon following this decision, Wade forgoes the cost of visiting a dentist to extract his own aching tooth, using an old set of pliers.By the end of the film, Wade, who doesn't realize it, has become the demon he knew to be his father. This is a very good film and what I enjoy from the independent film industry. It's not mainstream with a Hollywood story and a feel-good ending. This is about a dysfunctional family and how that kind of damage can afflict a person, a family, for generations.-- Glass Charming  "},{"Title":"Great acting","Date":"9 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  This is a very sad movie about a lot of very real people-alcoholism, and it's close companion domestic violence, should be on post office walls as Public Enemies #1 and #2 in this country, the Land of the Free.

Everyone else in the town, including his own brother, has washed their hands of the old man years ago, why can't he?  Why does he persist in trying to have a relationship with someone who is so psychotically mean he should probably be committed?  Maybe the nasty old man is right about his son after all.

Willem Dafoe's heavy-handed closing narration manages to wrap up some aspects of the story, while opening up new mystifications.  Some bloopers  Although the story of Affliction supposedly begins on Halloween in autumnal New Hampshire, it already appears to be mid-January with a heavy snowfall on the ground.  That's because the film was actually shot in Canada in mid-winter.  So even the look of the movie doesn't quite ring true.

It's about a man (Nick Nolte), his father (James Coburn), his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) and his daughter.  It tells the story of Nolte, who is wandering through a pointless existence.  The film, to me was about how Nolte tried so hard to not be like his physically and mentally abusive, alcoholic father, but no matter how he tried he just became more of the  same.  The film captures small time life so dead on, like few films this side of The Sweet Hereafter and The Straight Story.  This film is also based on Russel Banks' novel, the author who penned The Sweet Hereafter.  While this film doesn't boast the visual beauty and intelligently interwoven narrative structure of The Sweet Hereafter, it has its similarities.  Both set in small town in winter, both extremely well acted character studies, both dealing with tragedy.  The tragedy of a bus crash in The Sweet Hereafter, the tragedy of a man's wasted life in Affliction.  The acting is  superb, even Spacek who has little to do is worth watching.  There is a police murder investigation subplot that detracts away from the main road, but it establishes Nolte's more paranoid side of his character and gives Nolte's brother (Willem Dafoe)an excuse to make a few more appearances.  My favorite part is when an outdoor structure is engulfed in flames, visible through the window beside Nolte sitting at his kitchen table.  If you have a tendency to get depressed, this isn't a movie for you, but if you have a generally sober mindset and you're not bothered by downers, Affliction should be a welcome addition to your film oevre.

In my view, it is a sad comment on the taste and intelligence of the movie-going public that this near masterpiece should have been greeted as boring, pointless, or even, in one especially gross instance, as , of all things, a turd.In my view, there are both aesthetic and sociological reasons for this lack of comprehension. First of all,the film is a character study..an analysis of two men, Wade Whitehouse and his father, and how they ruined each others lives. It is not a shot em up thriller. In addition, its not Pulp Fiction'..there are no spectacular camera flourishes, no dazzling contrivances. In addition, there is not a single special effect in sight. Instead, we get a restrained, compassionate study of some pretty sad human lives.That it also happens to be emotionally violent, tense, and, in places suspenseful, is a tribute to the acting and to the directing. Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Spacek, and Defoe are uniformly excellent, as are all the smaller performances. In addition, for all the lack of outward directorial showiness, Paul Schrader not only reminds that he is as close to Bresson as any American director is likely to get, he also reminds that he is , with John Sayles, the only one capable of sympathetic portraits of the working class. Of course, chastity, compassion,and restraint are NOT what a lot of movie-goers are looking for. Sadly, even fewer are looking for compassionate portraits of the working class. Despite the false image of National prosperity created by politicians of both parties and by big business, many Americans-especially blue collar Americans- live lives of quiet desperation .Sadly, Many Americans would rather retreat into the fantasy world of the Matrix than be reminded of the suffering of their brothers and sisters. In a weird way, the presence on the movies soundtrack of long forgotten country songs by Bonnie Guitar and Skeeter Davis underscored this. For all its faults, the best classic country music did portray the sufferings of the working class with wit, and tenderness... Shania Twain and Garth Brooks would never think of doing so, and sell Millions, while the Lacy J. Daltons and Merle Haggards are forgotten. Oddly, Affliction reminded me of a classic country song, filtered , in this case through the oddly compassionate Calvinist sensibility of Paul Schrader.

Well; you'll be disappointed.This item was pulled from the bran-tub. Suspiciously, it came in one of those very thin plastic cases which usually betoken a crap movie, but for £1 it seemed worth a try. The case didn't deceive.Set in small town New Hampshire, USA, during the winter, we are treated to a dismal and rather confusing drama. Once more, the lighting crew appear to have gone on strike and even the interiors of buildings are places of unremitting gloom. The script may be 'realistic' but it is largely boring. Most of the dialogue is spoken in a hushed and hurried way that is frequently unintelligible. You strain to hear a clue that was never there, or a snippet of conversation that wasn't worth your attention. Nick Nolte's character has family problems. Yes; he's a dead-beat dad. Aren't they all? His own father (played by Coburn) was himself a violent man and - well; the abused eventually turns abuser.Partway through, a homicide bi-line appears in the form of a suspicious shooting. Is it an accident, or is it murder? It begins to look as though the movie will finally develop into something. 'A Perfect Plan' comes to mind, or even 'Fargo'. But not so. This issue just limps confusedly along with the dead-beat dad plot to no particular outcome whatsoever. It's also rather curious how many movies depict small-town America as cultural black-holes riven by disillusion, drink, and unhappiness. Can't humans ever be comfortable together? Just occasionally there are moments - all too brief - of tension, drama and tenderness, but for the very most part it's just a 109 minute dirge.The movie begins with a long-winded and convoluted intro narrated by Willem Dafoe (who plays Nolte's little brother) and ends in a similar way, but this time with a reproval of universal male domestic-violence that is as heavy-handed as it is plain wrong. It's a piece that might have been written by the most embittered, self-righteous feminist. And it absolutely stinks.The politically-correct with no discernment will love this crap.

We are told that right away at the beginning by his brother, Willem Dafoe, who narrates.The story is about why he disappears. This story is told slowly and with big detours that make it seem as if that's what the story is about, but they are not what the story's about. They apparently are meant to shed light on the central character, that of Nick Nolte. He's a cop in a small snowy town in New Hampshire (actually Quebec locations are used). His father, James Coburn, is an alcoholic. Coburn's part seems to keep repeating over and over the same thing, which is that his sons are not men. They do not put women in their place. Coburn's father was a real man, he tells us. Indeed, Nolte is little more than an errand boy for the big local businessman who is busy buying up property. The story seems to be about that for awhile. It's not.Nolte's pal Jack takes a man hunting and that man dies by gunshot. The story seems to be about that. It's not. Nolte has suspicions that the accident was murder. He fulminates and imagines, but the story never mentions any facts of any investigations. None at all. We are supposed to believe that Nolte's suspicions were made up out of thin air.Nolte has a hard time with his estranged wife and daughter. He even goes to a lawyer to try to change the custody arrangement. The story might be about that. It isn't.The story is about how Nolte carries on with respect to his wife, his dad, his job, his employer, his affair with Sissy Spacek, and the hunting accident. It's a character study of Nolte's character, who suffered from his father's trying to make him into a man.How is this story or characterization handled? Not very well. One minute Nolte seems rational. The next minute he does something really emotional. He does some things that are really very irrational or stupid. We are not shown anything that his father did that could have influenced his character's behavior in this way. Yes, he made his boys chop at some frozen wood. Is that it? No, of course not, but still the story doesn't hang together well.After awhile, we see that this is not a thriller, not a mystery or detective story, but a drama about a man with problems and no tools to cope with them. He won't listen to the one person he's closest to, which is Sissy Spacek; and he places too big a burden on her. He won't even go to get a tooth extracted when he has a toothache.The acting is more than adequate. The locations are fine. Paul Schrader's screenplay is where this picture runs into problems. Although the movie seems to have impressed voters and many IMDb reviewers, I was left with a very lukewarm feeling. I didn't believe the characters. I didn't believe Nolte as this weak man. I didn't believe the one-note Coburn character or even his long-suffering wife. Dafoe's part and narration added very little, except a paycheck.

But the investigation results to be the catalyst for his ending degradation and all goes wrong, including a teeth suffering.This cold and thought-provoking drama deals about desperation, madness and distress.Outstanding performances, particularly from Nick Nolte as damaged sheriff who looks for redemption during an investigation but gets worse, and James Coburn who won deservedly Oscar for best secondary actor. Downbeat musical score by Michael Brooks. Bleak cinematography by Paul Sarossy with a flashbacks during the childhood in a documentary style. Interesting script by Paul Schrader in the finest work of his career, he adapted it from Russell Banks' novel. Schrader is usually director and writer tales referred beaten-down men who fall into despair as their world crashes around them, such as 'Mishima a life in four chapters,Blue collar,Hardcore, Light sleeper, Autofocus and Affliction'. Rating  Good but is quite depressing.

Nothing about his youth and how his high school sweetheart and he supported each other through their family issues, nothing about the 2 older brothers who died in the war, totally sugar coated the violent father (one smack in one flashback!), cut major plot points altogether.

In wintry New Hampshire we follow Nolte as Wade, the local sheriff, whose wretched situation we're told by his brother in voice-over, given that Wade is too busy drinking or getting high. Wade has one or two smouldering camp fires of hope in the otherwise ubiquitous snowscape of his world - his girlfriend Margie and the impetus of re-establishing some kind of self-esteem by clearing up a shifty-looking accidental shooting incident.All hope is snuffed out the moment that James Coburn, as his father Glen, appears on screen. Key to the film is that Wade's mother is discovered to have died of hypothermia in the Whitehouse home - that Glen has neglected her sufficiently, as he has the rest of his family, for her snuff out. The film is a study in these metaphors, the extreme danger of the cold and fiery anger and the precious rarity of consistent inter-human warmth. Nolte and Coburn go at each other relentlessly throughout the film, barely ever physically, but in perpetual horns-lock of machismo breast-beating. It's a splendid spectacle but ultimately thoroughly dismal. 4/10 "}{"Title":"Mature but misguided","Date":"7 June 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" A haunting though unbalanced character study/murder mystery benefits from the dreary, snow-drenched setting and an experienced cast dishing up some pretty harrowing scenes, although the final product does not articulate it's grim themes nearly enough. Instead, Dafoe's narration feels out of place, while Nolte's commanding lead performance leaves more of an appreciation for the man's inherent and effortless talent as opposed to the strength of his character outlined here. As an obviously foreshadowed downward spiral sets in for this character, even his corrupted mindset will not let the strenuous conclusion feel completely legit. Coburn turns in a great performance as well which is frightening, despicable, and mesmerizing at times, but does end up playing into the stereotype a bitter old drunk would entail a little too often to justify a pivotal character performance here.While the two different genres worked into this script do get ironed out accordingly in the end, throughout the proceedings it seems as if Paul Schrader suffered from this identity crisis himself. He tries to direct these split personalities with the subtle grace of objectivity but instead looses focus from each side, only regaining his thematic footing after Dafoe's forced final narrative. Short of the assured and nuanced work I was expecting, Affliction still sucker-punches with a few powerful moments of profound resonance while stumbling the rest.

Set in northern New Hampshire (although the film is actually filmed in Canada, the location shooting looks remarkably authentic to an area I am quite familiar with) `Affliction' traces the lives of the Whitehouse family. The word `family' does not really apply to this group except for the fact that they are related. There is no love or compassion, just a lot of detachment and alcoholism. Nick Nolte plays the lead role of the oldest son Wade, and as usual he delivers a convincing performance. Wade is a man with many demons that have been brought on by the nightmarish upbringing meted out to him by his alcoholic father Glen, frighteningly portrayed by Academy Award winner James Coburn (`Hell is for Heroes' `Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'.) Sissy Spacek also plays wonderfully as Wade's girlfriend who wants to believe things can change. Spacek again does a wonderful job playing a norther New Englander in a tough situation (`In the Bedroom.') Willem Defoe plays Wade's brother Rolfe. Dafoe also serves as the narrator to the story and he is perhaps the one true survivor in this sad tale as he has become educated, does not drink and has escaped the nightmare of his past. The downside to this of course is that he generally avoids or denies his past, or at least distances himself. One could argue that this may the only way to move on from this hellish existence. Schrader has a knack for the story and angle in these tales of horrific commoners. Not unlike the material he worked with in `Taxi Driver,' `Blue Collar,' and `Hardcore' his work in `Affliction' shows us the dark side of many people's seemingly normal lives. The filming techniques used to show the flashbacks to the childhood of Rolfe and Wade is well done. Schrader uses a grainy and angular home-movie look that makes Coburn look even more menacing and the boys and their mother look more frightened.

One day a man is murdered while deer hunting with his young friend and everyone suspects that it is the young man named Jack who killed him. Wade tries to get to the bottom of the murder but everyone around him gives him hell. And he keeps having flashbacks of his father abusing him and his brother. He goes and visits his father and finds out that his mother has frozen to death and that makes him even more distant from his friends. Wade is very hot-tempered and he kills his father during one of their fights and he burns his body. His girfriend leaves him and his daughter never wants to see him again. This was a very sad and dark film and I thought it was pretty good even though I haven't read the book. The ending was somewhat peculiar but all the actors did pretty good jobs.

It's really just a grim, exceedingly ill-tempered public service announcement on the devastating lingering effects of child abuse.Although he hits a couple of false notes, Nick Nolte deserved his Oscar nod for digging deep and delivering an agonizingly authentic performance as a lifelong failure haunted by memories of an abusive upbringing. The same can not be said of James Coburn as the decrepit, still-abusive father. He's just two-dimensionally mean - he never finds the humanity that must be buried somewhere underneath all that hate.Most of the blame, however, goes to director Paul Schrader. He does a poor job of establishing who's who and what's what (one character's first name is Gordon and another's last name is Gordon, leading to all sorts of unnecessary confusion.) and by the time you think you've sorted everything out, it turns out not to matter! There is also a snide, simple-minded attack on those who find strength in religious faith. (Coburn has just had one of his explosions and his born again daughter feebly offers Dad, Jesus is more powerful than any demon. HA HA Funny stuff. As Ellen Barkin said to Kevin Bacon in Diner - Real mature, Fenwick, real mature.)The weak resolution is all superfluous voice over narration that is supposed to tie up all the plot threads, and essentially makes the happy argument that HEY!

It was a brutal toothache that existed in the upper right part of his mouth and the film tries to drag on with stupid subplots and hide the fact that it was his painful toothache that made him go off the edge. A toothache can do that to some people. But who can make a 2 hour movie about a toothache??? So Affliction adds 1 hour and 52 minutes off irrelevant nonsense to make a full-length film. It was the 8 minutes of tooth pain that was the most pleasing and relevant. Watch for the scene where Nick Nolte is arguing on the phone because he can't get an appointment at the dentist's office to fix his toothache, even after bribing a nurse and secretary $40 each...A Classic Scene. I admired his heroic action of personally dealing with the toothache by finding the painful tooth and ripping it out of his mouth with a pair of pliers, while thinking of how lousy his life has been.

So you think _Hurly Burly_ is the worst film you've ever seen? Well, have you ever seen _Affliction_?  I also recommend that you sit in the front row of the theater, so that every yuppie in the audience who is praising it as the best thing since _Forrest Gump_ can see you leave half way through.

Instead I was only able to bang my head against the wall every time don't sas me gal, you done gone and done it, or some other putrid line of dialog was uttered.  This film had no real characters; every persona in the film is an exaggerated stereotype - a caricature - of a various members of what could constitute a northern redneck town.  The plot involves an insane undertaking and undergoing for one man; which at first seems a possibly great notion for a movie, and then is quickly lead into the land of absurdity.  One wonders why Willam Defoe took the role (one does not make such a speculation concerning Nick Nolte, for he as contributed nothing to American cinema); the voice-over he gives, especially during the denouement, is a pathetic attempt to analyze an obvious movie, and is insulting with its incorrect (and illogical) conclusions.  The climax of this film is not shown but rather contained within the objectable final narration; and the one saving feature of this film, the obnoxious daughter of Wade Whitehead, is not brought out enough.

In MY opinion this was one of the best films of 1997, and certainly one of the best Paul Schrader has ever produced, which is saying a lot considering he also conceived Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and the Last Temptation of Christ. Nick Nolte is one of my favourite actors working today, and he's in top form, delivering one of his best performances. Sissy Spacek, of course, is great, and James Cobourn is truly staggering. His performance is amazingly multi-dimensional, and he manages to convey a corporeal frailty in his withered body, and brutal ferocity in his soul. The direction, as one would expect from Schrader, is wonderful, and the quiet, snowy, and textured cinematography sets the perfect tone - one which is methodical, introspective, realistic, and profoundly sad. One previous reviewer criticized the film for having unlikable characters that you would rather not watch, which is precisely the point! It can't be considered voyeuristic when the ultimate purpose is to learn from what you're watching, and not to derive sadistic pleasure from others misfortunes, or as an act of cinematic masochism. This is a film about the hereditary nature of violence, and the trajectories that we share with those who raise and shape us as individuals.As described in the final narration, the cycle of violence, from father to son, is an ancient and brutal one. For those millions of young men afflicted with that circumstance, I think that this story would seem all too familiar. In the end I think it's a tragic cautionary tale, though not an entirely pessimistic one. In one of the final shots, in which Nick Nolte is framed against a burning building, Willem Dafoe gives his final narration and we see both potentialities how a life can be pre-determined though circumstance and ultimately consumed by it, but also how one can choose the more arduous path and step out of that cycle (provided that they can find a way before it's too late). My criticisms, which I would be remiss to acknowledge, are insignificant to the point of irrelevance. A terrific 10 out of 10 film.

Willem Dafoe plays Wade's brother and Sissy Spacek is Wade's girlfriend. Divorced and not liked much by his daughter, Wade does a lot of drinking and has quite a temper.  He seems to be taking after his father in many ways.  A murder takes place and Wade gets involved in this and takes Rolfe's (Dafoe) advice and looks into the matter with a different perspective.  Wade's father comes to live with him and Spacek which drives him insane.  Nolte's performance is terrific and very intense.  The scene where the family is gathered to mourn the loss of Mrs. Whitehouse was great.  Coburn interrupts the prayers from the Jesus freaks and insults everyone there.  Wade finally stands up to him.  Wade and Rolfe's conversation in the garage was memorable and it shows the bond between the two.  Dafoe's role is limited although he narrates the story.  Wade and his father have some funny moments like the part where they are arguing in the car and Coburn spits in Nolte's face and Sissy has to be the peace mediator.  Her character tries so hard to be compassionate, but, soon enough, she can't take anymore. Wade obsesses over the conspiracy he thinks is going on between co-worker Jack, his boss Gordon and the son-in-law to the murdered man. The part where he throws his boss' desk over and gets in the face of some of his co-workers was great.  Nolte, in this film, reminds me of Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant and Jack Nicholson in The Pledge. He is a man on the edge and he is about to lose it.  With flashbacks of the abuse his father forced on he and his family, the divorce and custody of his daughter, he knows things can't go on like this.  Coburn has great dialogue in this film.  He was hilarious and intimidating in this one like Dwight Yoakam in Sling Blade.  Nolte knows the scars won't heal and decides he has to take action into his own hands.

In fact most of the characters were, lacking even the charm and vitality of real life much less what viewers expect of the big screen.The mysterious appearance and later disappearance of the younger brother was distracting as well.  When the film ended I was relieved albeit horrified.  A good idea, a less than perfect execution.

In many ways it might be better - the performances by Nick Nolte and James Coburn are so phenomenal that they might push this film slightly above Atom Egoyan's film in my mind. The only problem with this film might be the flashbacks, which don't quite work as well as they should. But aside from that, I think this is a wonderful film. Nick Nolte should have won the Oscar for so fully embodying a man driven to the edge by alcohol, his family, and his own inability to control his anger and paranoia. James Coburn deserved the Oscar he won for his terrifying portrayal of a cruel and abusive man, and watching him we understand why Schrader said he needed an actor who could convincingly terrify a character played by Nick Nolte.

A meditative, brooding film which relies on how much is not seen or said with some truly breathtaking scenery as its backdrop.  A small town with dark undercurrents is the setting and the characters are hurting, metaphorically bleeding, on the inside from the mistakes of the past.  James Coburn is pure malice with his comments on women knowing their place while he terrorises his sons and their mother.  Most of the violence is implied and the snow which blankets the town is a fitting symbol for the cold, sterile feelings which pass for affection.  'Affliction' is an apt title - these characters are not affected by the pain but afflicted with it as Willem Dafoe's character says at one point.  Nick Nolte is good, very good - showing a range and subtlety, working with the other actors to create a moody ensemble piece which has one thinking long after one has left the theatre.  A lot of this film takes place in the mind, echoing intrusive thoughts which drive a man to his ultimate tragedy.  This has Shakespearean undertones - the chaos of the natural world, the sins of the past rearing up to claim those in the present and the sheer waste of love and tolerance on recrimination and cruelty.  A fine cast - Sissy Spacek, Mary Beth Hurt, Jim True all help to make this movie memorable.  The film, however belongs to James Coburn, Nick Nolte and the impeccable direction of Paul Schrader.  Part thriller, part psychological study - this is a great film and worth a second and a third look.

A pathetic man who wants to be a good father, husband, lover, son, friend but who  is a paranoid delusional dysfunctional alcholic.

He is divorced and trying and to get custody of his young daughter who rejects his fumbling efforts to be nice to her.  James Coburn is excellent as Nick Nolte's father, a brutal and angry old man who typifies a sick machismo which has in turn afflicted his son. His acting is extraordinary as is Nolte's although their styles are different. Noltle is subtle; his facial expressions are controlled and typical of a man who has learned to hold in emotion.  Coburn's face, on the other hand, is more deeply expressive;  his eyebrows move, his mouth hardens, his eyes glare.This is the kind of dark, brooding movie that I like.  For a brief few hours I enter its world and get completely absorbed in the characters in the way I did with A thousand Acres or The Horse Whisperers.  Like these films, there are no easy answers and the conclusion does not wrap up in a neat little Hollywood package that is soon forgotten. Recommended.

I don't understand how a film as bad as this can be made.  Where does the praise come from?  Is it because James Coburn came back one more time to play a drunken alcoholic one more time?  Is it because Nick Nolte plays a character that he could play in his sleep?  Or is it because it is written by Paul Schraeder?  Whatever the reason it is not sufficient enough to make it good.  It is not sufficient enough to make it even tolerable.  This is not entertainment, this is not even good film making.  This is as close to torture in film as it comes, unless you include Magnolia and then Affliction is the best film ever made.  But excluding Magnolia and what you have is a slow moving, ABC after-school special plot, well casted mistake that really never should have been made.  To make a film you have to have lots and lots of money.  And even though this film is obviously a low budget film you still have to wonder who this film was made for?  What was it's target audience?  Who wants to see a film about an alcoholic father that lives in a small town that is broke and used to beat his kids?  That does not sound like a great film idea to me.  But then you put Nolte and Coburn and Dafoe and Spacek in it and all of a sudden people will want to see it?  Give me a break.  This once again is Hollywood trying to pull the wool over our eyes.  There is nothing redeeming about the film.  Sure the performances are good but so what, that is expected.  There are some pretty good actors involved here, I would hope that the performances are good.  But what else is going to keep people coming in?  Nothing.Affliction is torturous.  That is the best way I can describe it.  It is slow and unintersting and really quite boring.  There is only so much you can do with alcoholism.  But the one thing that I did get from the film is that if you don't have money, life sucks.  That's what Nolte's character shows us.  He was broke and now his life sucks because of it.  Hows that for a curveball.  That is the only point I got from the film.  Life sucks without money.  As for the rest of the film, it isn't even worth seeing.  The only reason I did is because I heard that Nolte and Coburn would be nominated for Oscars and I had to check out the apparent Oscar caliber performances.  And I am glad that Benigni won for Life Is Beautiful.  Maybe Nolte will start to pick roles in films that people actually want to see.2 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Well titled - this movie was an affliction!","Date":"6 January 2001","Score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.

After getting my ticket, I stood in the crowd of ticket-holders marked We're Seeing it Because It's Another Russell Banks Adaptation, and discussed my anticipation with the frozen Cambridge denizens, most of whom, at any other time, I wouldn't spit on if they caught fire.A little under two hours later, I was horrified at my own disappointment.The performers are no less than stunning; Nolte, Spacek, and Coburn all deserved and received rave notices.  Added to this, I appreciated the feeling of faith in Paul Schrader, as director and screenwriter, that Great Cinema was being done.  Most bad films, you can tell when the actors know what they've got themselves into, either in interviews, or in the film itself.

All the elements seem to be in place, but something seems lacking in each.  The Schrader character gallery is littered with dislikable leads, and some demographics are programmed to believe that, if they hate the film's characters, they must be watching great art.  The reality is, a film must be great first.  Unpleasantness is only an attribute, and despicable people does not a great story make.The test I've devised for long films about abominable people doing abominable things is this  if you saw these people from a distance of a hundred or so feet, doing these horrible things to each other, and your only choices were to  A) stand and watch voyeuristically, or  B) run away as fast as you could, what would you do?  For Raging Bull, I could watch the proceedings for hours.  With Affliction, I'm out of there, in a hurry.  I would have absolutely no desire to witness any more shenanigans, and I would care less whether the people lived or died.At the end, Affliction had the opportunity to end gracefully, with just the shot of Nick Nolte -- sitting and drinking, drinking and sitting. Instead, Schrader opted for the most gruesome, ham-handed voiceover from Willem Dafoe, which explains why child abuse is as inevitable as it is tragic.  Schrader also gives us wrapping up scenes (in grainy b&w, of course) to show further damage done by Whitehouse.  Also, in a move that was calculated to be both foreboding and enticing (failing both), the film lets us know that Wade Whitehouse is still out there, prowling, on the loose. Then again, Godzilla ended that way, too, but I don't think there's a great many people who want to see that old bastard's return, either. "},{"Title":"No! No!

What a waist of film.  This has to be one of the slowest and boring films of all time.  What were they thinking.  This story has been done 10 million times and I'm tired of it.  I didn't feel sorry for any of the character nor did I want to.  This should have been made into a Movie of the Week or something.  I'm very disappointed.Paul Schrader is a great director.  I truly hope he makes up for this film in future pictures. "},{"Title":"Good acting, cliches galore","Date":"4 January 1999","Score":"7 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  There's a good deal of buzz about Nick Nolte's performance as the tortured son of James Coburn's physically abusive father, and the buzz is deserved, but the impact of Nolte's performance is blunted by a nearly incoherent script.The point of what's on screen (I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if it's any more sophisticated than this), is that physical abuse, like a disease, is passed from generation to generation; oh, and it causes low self-esteem and the inability to form close relationships. If you already know this, there's nothing more here to learn.Watching this, I wondered if director Paul Schrader had seen Fargo too often but without really getting it. There's an attempt at injecting a murder mystery into the spine of the film, but in the end you're not sure if there even was a murder, much less who did it.The only reason to see this film is if you're a major Nolte fan.  Coburn's performance is intense but one-dimensional, Sissy Spacek plays the Anne Archer character but with a weird southern accent that is wholly out of place in the backwater New Hampshire town in which she's supposed to have grown up, and Holmse Osborne's French Canadian accent seems borrowed from Twin Peaks. Oh, and Willem Dafoe's narrator/brother can't seem to figure out why he's in this film in the first place.Pass. Seriously. "}{"Title":"strong story deflated by a flawed finish","Date":"16 July 1999","Score":"8 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  What if, at the end of Cool-Hand Luke, in the scene where Luke is being driven away to die in the warden's station wagon, we had been treated to a voice-over on the historic cruelty of the Southern prison farm system??? Would have sorta deflated the whole movie, wouldn't it have??This is the effect of the Hillary Clinton-ish little speech on male violence we get at the end of this otherwise strong story which leads us up to the tragic conclusion that Wade cannot escape the forces that shaped him. That little monologue clubs us over the head and deflates the whole movie, transforming it from a moderately engrossing story with a good feeling for tragic destiny, to a social uplift screed.Wade's daughter, who we sympathise with at first, I found to be somewhat of an unlikeable little whiner by the end, especially when she snubs Wade's desperate efforts to buy her a Big Mac because junk food is bad for you. (When she whined I want to go home for the 100th time, I wanted Wade to say Fine by me!, and turn the truck around). Coburn's performance is a bit ham-handed and the script doesn't help him at the end when it calls for him to congratulate Wade at the point when the son seems, a bit too obviously, to have finally become his father.  The murder mystery subplot seems a cheap device to try to give the movie some box office boost, and is completely gratuitous.Having said that, Nolte's beautifully-paced performance does have a gripping urgency to it, as Wade tries more and more desperately, against the odds, to escape his destiny. The tone of the movie is wonderfully bleak and foreboding, and the sense of impending doom is well-conveyed. The final scene, of Wade sitting, drinking, at the kitchen table with the window framing the burning barn outside, is a memorably powerful image. Unfortunately it is destroyed by that awful voiceover.The movie is still, however, far superior to most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood nowadays.  "}]
