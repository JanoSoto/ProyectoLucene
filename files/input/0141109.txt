It's not too cute though so that it becomes unlikable.  It was interesting to see Michael Keaton in the Dad role (I've never him as anything besides Batman) and I think he made a really good Dad. I liked the way they dealt with death, it had a very real sense about it. Which is strange, because you have the Dad come back as a SNOWMAN (hah) but once you get over that (it does take a little while, don't give up) it becomes really nice.  I like the ending - I guess I shouldn't give it away, but it was sweet without being corny.  There is a really thin line between cuteness and overkill, but this movie is still on the cute side.

I know, I may be biased a bit towards anything MK-related, however even my best friend (who was with me at the time when we saw it) liked it a lot, even if we saw it closer to Summer rather than Christmas (it came out in Malta, Europe - where I was still living at the time - like some 6 months after it came out in the US!). Anyway, Michael Keaton yet again gives a great performance as a 'snow'man trying quite desperately to make up for lost time. Kelly Preston is good too as his wife and the kid is ok-ish (we've seen much better kid actors, in my opinion). It's only Mark Addy who seems like a fish out of water and looks like he's only in it either because he's a friend of the director or something! He just doesn't seem to gel! All in all, a very cute and neat movie, with good work from Keaton and a rocking good soundtrack, with tracks from the boys Hanson, among others, and Keaton himself raunchily singing a couple of tracks penned by someone from Yes. Great for a night in with the family.

I obviously had reservations about going to see this movie, but our 2 1/2 year old daughter wanted to go. She wanted to go to see Jack Frost, the snowman.Hey, a movie of a real live snowman - Is this what it really is about? This movie has a story to tell. And that is what makes this movie a little more special.  For those of you who overlook or can't see the meaning of the story, probably do the same with the 'magical' season it is intended to represent.*** out of *****  "},{"Title":"A great family film for Christmas time!","Date":"3 December 1999","Score":"24 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  This film definitely deserves higher marks, I don't know why anyone would give it a 1???

Keaton and Cross seem to have a lot of fun making this movie together and it showed in their performances. Scenes like the one that had Jack Frost throwing snowballs at the school bully and his friends as well as the chase that followed made it all worthwhile to see because this is what makes movies so good.Watching this movie, it reminded me of Ghost because of its sweeping and heartwarming storyline.Chemistry is one of the elements I look for in a great movie. Jack Frost has this element and more. While an unusual but a brilliant pairing, Keaton and Preston bring chemistry to Jack Frost, a movie that seems to be better than others I've seen before.I think Michael Keaton is one of the best actors I've seen and his performance in Jack Frost is one of his best films to date so WATCH it.

To me, it's not really a Christmas movie, but more of a family film that could be watched around Christmas time. (If that makes any sense.) A musician named Jack Frost spends too much time with his music, than with his son and smokin' hot wife. He gives his son, Charlie a harmonica that he says is magic. When Jack has to leave on Christmas Eve, his son gets mad and gives him back the harmonica. Jack changes his mind and decides to go back. While driving, he has a terrible accident and dies. A year later, we see how Charlie and his smokin' hot mom deal with the pain. It's actually quite sad to think about having no dad at Christmas time. Charlie builds a snowman just for the heck of it, and later plays his dad's harmonica. Jack comes back, but in the body of the snowman. Throughout the film, Charlie and Jack have fun and get into misadventures. Until it gets hot, Charlie tries to save his dad from the heat, but Jack knows that he only came back to temporarily for a 2nd chance.

This movie deserves better treatment than it's been given by the critics and by many reviewers on this site. The characters and the character development are really pretty good, and this drives the rest of the movie. There is the required (and implied) suspension of disbelief about a snowman coming to life, but all of this is tied into father/son, husband/wife and other relationships that I personally found believable enough to care about them. They take a little time to develop these before the fantasy part begins. There are some really nice moments here, and some layers in the relationships that matter for the story. It's not a perfect or hugely important movie - I just think it's hard to find good options like this one for the whole family and I think Jack Frost hits a really nice sweet spot. (Double entendre works here...) I found it very entertaining but also more emotional and real than I expected. Great soundtrack for a family Christmas movie, too.!

You get Michael Keaton doing voice work for the Frosty the Snowman look-a-like (there's even a funny moment where his son comes across the Frosty Christmas special on the tube much to Keaton's chagrin), but at least he had a chance to get in a good forty minutes work in his own skin as a dad struggling to get his Jack Frost Band (his name is actually, really Jack Frost!) a music deal after a lot of neglect to his boy. His son and wife have tolerated his missing the big goal in the little league hockey game and the snowball fights with the neighborhood bullies, so in the form of Frosty, Jack tries to make up for lost time. What does come out of the weird plot is the dad gets a second chance to be there for his son in a winter bonding missed while in human form and the leads do what they can to make it work. The snowball fight with the bullies as Jack comes to his son's aid, and the subsequent sledding escape from those snowboarding pricks could be perceived as highlights if they weren't so strange (I had a hard time suspending disbelief as Jack the Snowman uses his stick arms and muffin hands to hurl snowballs at an accelerating rate, and skinnied after squeezing between two close trees (and snowboarding when the sled splits in two for that matter)). When Jack and his son get away for one last adventure and Kelly Preston (as the mom) hears her husband's voice across the phone when he calls from their cabin, it is a really emotional moment that is actually poignant&#x85;give it to the cast to really take their parts seriously even though the plot is so ridiculously absurd. One scene has Jack the Snowman melting while watching his son playing hockey that, again, is kind of surreal but makes sense considering how the father was often absent when his boy wanted him there so badly. I think for many it will take a hell of a lot to shake the premise, but maybe if you can, then Jack Frost might just be an agreeable bit of whimsy that seems best watched during the Holidays.

The story is about a work-ethic musician named Jack Frost who dies of a car crash one winters night. So his son Charlie plays the harmonic that he gave him and he is magically reincarnated as a snowman. YES A SNOWMAN hilarious right?? So Jack in his new form spends the Christmas with Charlie and they spend some father/son time together.Yes its a bit stupid and silly in a way for having Micheal Keaton being reincarnated as a snowman and he should have been reincarnated as a human instead but still I loved the scenes that his son and himself spend together.

One stormy night as he races to get home for Christmas, his car skids off the road and he passes away leaving his son Charlie and wife Gabby devastated. A year passes, and it is clear that Charlie is still deeply affected by his father's death. He decides to make a snowman one evening, and dresses him in Jack's clothes. Playing his father's old harmonica magically brings the snowman to life! The snowman has Jack's voice and his personality/memories. Charlie is at first terrified of the talking snowman (for obvious reasons), but eventually realizes that his dad's spirit is inside of it. The only problem is that the weather is getting warmer, and we all know what that means for snowmen...I am really shocked at how low rated Jack Frost is on here. It wasn't the best Christmas movie ever made, but it's not a below average one either. I really thought that Jack Frost has a lot of heart. It can be very sad at times knowing that Jack was dead, but then they throw in some funny moments which really work. I think it was successful in pulling the audience's heartstrings. The acting was close to top-notch. Michael Keaton really only did voice overs in this film as the snowman, but that was well done. Kelly Preston as well as Mark Addy were convincing in their supporting roles, and Joseph Cross puts in a terrific performance as the young boy who lost his father.Jack Frost was a box office flop in 1998, but I honestly can't see why. It was a solid Christmas movie that throws a lot at it's viewers in terms of emotion. I know when I was a kid and I saw it in the theaters, I teared up!

You can read just about any review out there for this film and words such as disgusting, creepy, ugly, rude and traumatizing are going to be used. I must admit that there are times when I watch movies and I just can't see what people see in them and there are times when I view a movie where I can't see why people hate them so much. Look, I agree that this kids film has a rather ugly subject in regards to a kid losing his father but for the life of me I can't figure out why there's so much hatred thrown at this film. I thought the film was very sweet, featured some good performances and I think its heart is in the right place. I really don't understand why some are taking such a strong moral clause with this film and throwing a judgment on it as to what damage it might do to kids. Really? Countless Disney films have scared young children yet no one says a word about them. E.T. scared me to death as a child but no one bashes that film. Is JACK FROST in their level? Not even close but no matter the quality I don't see the need for the moral police. Again, I thought the film was innocent enough and had a good heart. I thought Keaton did a very good job early in the film when we actually see him and I thought his vocal work as the snowman was terrific.

Given the opportunity to return from the dead, Keaton instructs his son on a hockey move, fixes a long broken sink, and then disappears into swirling magic vapors. Talk about  underachievement, I would have preferred Keaton to given more important life lessons and refrain from innuendo about cold balls. Also, Henry Rollins' minor character could have been omitted from the story. Slamming to `Black Flag` twenty years ago, I had no idea that he would become the Nat Pendleton of the nineties. English actor Mark Addy manifests a natural pleasantness to his part. I subscribe to the theory that women become more attractive with age. Kelly Preston validates this statement. I saw Mischief and Spacecamp during there initial theatrical release, and don't recall finding her very alluring. Now, some fifteen years, she is remarkably beautiful and talented in this film. I will definitely review For the Love of the Game. -lucky Travolta- As far as Keaton, he was adequately charming. I wonder when he declined anymore Batman movies, if he had an inclination he would be undertaking a computer generated snowman. My Life is a better Keaton film addressing life and death issues. Also, I enjoyed the inclusion of a Lucinda Williams tune on the soundtrack. 2.5 out of 4 stars.

I know this film is sappy.  And the first 5 minutes are painfully slow.  But if you can handle some sap, this is a well-made movie that effectively explores the topic of what it's like to have to deal with loss in this case, the loss of one's father and to a lesser extent one's husband.Michael Keaton is Jack Frost, a loving husband and father who, one fateful Christmas day, loses control of his car and dies. He returns the next year in the form of a snowman to get another chance to be with his son.This is most definitely not a comedy, and to the filmmaker's credit they don't go for silliness with the snowman stuff. Yes there are moments of humor (some failed), but the movie's main strength is in its relationship between Frost and his son and also Frost and his wife (a luminous Kelly Preston).These movies walk a fine line for me if they are sappy and don't move me, I hate them.  But if they do strike an emotional chord, then I forgive all flaws and recommend the movie. So whether or not you will enjoy it is based strictly on your tolerance for sentimentality.

What kind of nit-pick bullshit is that? Could they not give him a name of more normal presentation? It just sounds like cruel parenting. The concept fails because the magic harmonica is never explained and just sounds like a dumb plot device. Instead it gets reduced to formula that becomes as much fun as a snow covered rock to the head. Michael Keaton plays Jack Frost, a musician who spends less time with his family. A nasty storm sends his car off the road and he is pronounced dead. His son plays the magic harmonica and the result is a talking snowman. We know that he will attempt to conceal him from his mother, and he will eventually melt giving an ending of all the quality of yellow snow. Director Troy Miller has fun with the visuals but that is pretty much all the film has going for it. Keaton is a likable comic actor but this is far beneath his talent. In flat supporting roles are Joseph Cross as his son. Kelly Preston is cardboard as his wife. Mark Addy has the thankless role as best friend who sticks around after the accident.

Yep, glorious white snow. To us there were few other activities as fun as playing in the snow. One major problem however; I grew up in a country in which we only get about 3-4 days a year of significant snowfall, in which it would actually settle on the ground. So when there was a significant level of snowfall, we would make the utmost use of it. Snowball fights, sledding, making snow angels, and of course making a snowman.Snowmen were a subject of my childhood fascination. Why? I'm not quite sure. They just have a certain magical appeal. Whenever I would see one in someone else's garden, I would always have to point it out, Look, a snowman!. So when myself and my friends heard about the movie Jack Frost, in which a snowman comes to life, we were psyched to see it. Although there already existed the 1982 animated short The Snowman which had a similar premise, I believe Jack Frost appealed to us more for several reasons-It was a movie more of our generation. -It was live action and the snowman looks just like a real snowman we could have created ourselves. -But most importantly, the movie was called Jack Frost. When I was younger, whenever there was a frosty night, we would always say that Jack Frost is out tonight.So one weekend myself and one of my friends rented Jack Frost on video, and we thought it was an absolute blast. However even at that age we thought there were some stupid moments, such as when Charlie is hanging over a wall of snow and he's supposed to be in danger, yet the drop itself is tiny; or during the sledge chase sequence when two kids just happen to have a snowball the size of a boulder on standby to stop Charlie and Jack. However the one aspect of the film we found to be the most unbelievable was in how Charlie had not got over his father's death one year on. The reason for this is that a friend of ours had recently lost his father to an illness, yet was back in school one week later, acting as he normally would. To us, Charlie isolating himself from his friends due to his father's death one year on seemed far fetched. Several years later, I saw Jack Frost again on TV one weekend, and the following Monday in school, it seems half the class also watched it, and were all raving about how much we loved it; discussing our favourite moments, talking about the scenes we found to be the funniest. Even my teacher had watched it over the weekend and called it, and I quote, a wonderful film. Of course when the advent of the internet age come upon us, I found out Jack Frost is considered a terrible film and the critics trashed it. One of the biggest criticisms I hear against the movie being that the snowman is creepy, which even to this day I've never thought so. I think he looks cute, and looks just like a snowman the average kid would make.I'm probably the only person in the world who will give this film a serious appraisal, but when I was younger it did strike a chord with us kids. I watched Jack Frost again several years ago with a more mature perspective, and I still enjoyed it, with a pool of happy nostalgic memories coming flooding back. Rock on Jack Frost! Snow dad is better than no dad!

One Christmas his car is run off the road, right at the point where the movie could still win us over. But then we zip forward to a year later, when Keaton is reincarnated as a talking snowman who learns to take the time to teach his kid how to deal with life's little problems, like school bullies, before he melts away.This could, I guess, have been heart-warming stuff (as a cartoon, possibly), but the snowman is brought to life using a combination of CGI and animatronics, with lip synching that's terrible either way - and it's an horrific freak, an abomination with Keaton's eyebrows that looks like it'd be more at home stalking holiday makers with a knife than bonding with a small boy. Nothing this thing does is entertaining in the slightest, and Keaton is utterly wasted in a movie that studiously avoids giving him anything to say that might be funny or of any interest at all.There's no poignancy on show here, just the writers' alarming lack of imagination. They've taken a talking, reincarnated snowman and welded it to a story so banal that they have to keep the damn thing talking and sledging and talking and throwing snowballs and talking and talking in the hope that we won't notice how clichéd the whole thing is. Which you may not, if you're occupied, as I was, trying to gouge your eyes out with your own shoe.Keaton just doesn't fit in this thing; I seem to remember that he refused to publicise it, so whether he had a major case of actor's remorse or the film went bizarrely wrong somewhere along the line, I don't know. But it's a film unworthy of his presence, a grotesque load of rubbish that's tacky and lumbering and genuinely off-putting whenever that snowman is on the screen.

Musician Jack Frost has repeatedly puts his career before his family, as the front man of his struggling band. Having cancelled a festive holiday in order to perform for a record company executive, Jack realises the error of his ways and races home to be with his family for Christmas. Losing control of his car, he perishes in the snow. His wife and son, Kelly and Charlie, are left to cope with their loss until a year later, when Jack manifests his spirit in a snowman that Charlie builds. Embracing this opportunity to atone for his misdeeds, Jack finally spends some valuable time with his son and together they help one another beat their demons.The film ticks all the right boxes for family fare, and touches well on its themes of redemption and loss. A young Joseph Cross performs well alongside Kelly Preston and Michael Keaton, engaging with the special effects and channelling his character's frustrations believably. The compatibility of the cast enhances the ability of the script to tug at the heartstrings, and at a time of year when families easily lose their temper with one another, it's emotion is suitable and the subject matter thought-provoking. While all the possibilities of having a snowman for a father aren't explored, this keeps the movie light-hearted by preventing the emergence of deeper concepts. 'Jack Frost' may stumble over stereotypes such as the school bully and the inadequate babysitter, but these are popular devices in children's entertainment that a younger audience is familiar with and can therefore respond to with ease. Set to a rousing soundtrack that quickens the pace, the movie is a pleasant hour and a half of fun that will leave you in the mood for Christmas.

However, I was not sure what the movie was trying to accomplish. What I mean by that is that it seemed as though it was striving to be a poignant father and son type film and a film full of slapstick comedy. Unfortunately due to the weak script, the film doesn't really succeed at either. The pace is also rather uneven, being slow at times, and the ending is rather schmaltzy.

I'm really surprised that this particular film made no headway in becoming a classic. Although people would say this film is nothing like it, why doesn't anyone see the correlation between this film and John Carpenter's Starman (1984)? The only main difference is really the setting (a snowy environment). A man is lost in a tragic accident and is incarnated once more to give hope to his family members. Is that not the same?One reason why people blame this film for being so bad is that it uses cheesy puns that are supposed to make you laugh out loud; this is false. This movie is not supposed to be a hardcore comedy. Its puns are made to create small chuckles and to appreciate the fact the man who was no more is back to set his problems right. Michael Keaton plays Jack Frost, a father who gets sidetracked from his real passion, watching his son (played by Joseph Cross) grow up because he is too focused on kick- starting his rock band. Sure so the name is cliché, but that's what makes it cute. Even Michael Keaton himself mocks the name. When he is in his snowman form, he says to himself, Why me,...why a SNOWMAN? I mean, could the universe really be that unoriginal? That made me laugh. If the main character recognizes that the name of this movie is silly then it shouldn't be as bad as everyone says. I feel that the movie's screenwriter, Mark Steven Johnson did a really nice job. Later on, he would direct Ghost Rider (2007), who I was not totally pleased with because a character as serious as Ghost Rider, should not have been so cartoonish. But here, the story of Jack Frost works well.Another thing people bash this movie for is that it has a sappy screenplay. Like there haven't been sad movies before? This isn't new people. And how often does someone get a second chance to make up his or her life mistakes. Besides, it's not like this movie ends badly; Jack Frost rights his wrongs. It's not like he shows up just to make the audience cry. The alien who plays in Starman (1984) made audiences cry too; so what's all the hoot and holler about? As for the director of this movie, Troy Miller, I assume his career hasn't been promising when it comes to big screen movies. It's a shame some good things go nowhere.As for the music, much of it is inserted when it comes to sequences of reflection. The only time the score of the film comes out when the camera is focused on Jack Frost (when he is a snowman). The score was created by Trevor Rabin who did a nice job but it disappoints me that I was not able to find the entire score digitally. One other thing I did not know was that the Jack Frost snowman was made by the Jim Henson company. I knew it looked like a Muppet somehow! It's a (pardon the pun) cool design and to make a movie look that good with a snowman must have been an interesting task.As one of the very few films that are universally known by director Troy Miller, Jack Frost is a part of his better work. With screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson at his side, this film will capture the imagination with its cute story line.

Exactly a year later and when the son plays a 'magic' harmonica that his dad gave him, back comes dad - given a second chance - but in the guise of a snowman. Remarkably dad and son bond in the few short days that a snowman has in a way they never achieved before. Fabulous special effects, bags of adventure and enough one-liners to ensure that all family members will be satisfied. It will amuse the kids while some teens and adults may just find the whole thing a little to American twee. Nevertheless on the entertainment scale, it almost drops off the top end.

A year later, Charlie is angry and depressed. Jack's best friend Mac MacArthur (Mark Addy) tries to help out. Charlie builds a snowman to resemble his father and plays Jack's harmonica. The magical harmonica brings the snowman to life with Jack Frost's spirit.It's probably wrong to kill the father in the movie. The movie could have started right after his death. It's not like a snowman Michael Keaton is particularly funny. The snowman slapstick doesn't work very well and Keaton isn't doing any funny voice work. The problem is that he started as a normal guy dad and can't go wild with the voice afterward as a snowman. The kid is limited. The jokes are lame. This snowman movie is lifeless. It's not good enough even for the kids.

It would have been turned into the dreaded kids film that so many parents hate going to.  Along with PAULIE and BABE PIG IN THE CITY, we have three non-Disney family films that surprise with intelligence, wit, and real human elements.  Of course, that doesn't mean there's not enough for kids either.Don't confuse this with the schlocky horror film Jack Frost, one of the worst films I've ever seen.  That went straight to video.  This Jack Frost stars Michael Keaton and a very talented cast in a very good family film. While I admit that children may be bored for the first thirty minutes, since Mr. Snowman doesn't appear until then, parents will find security with the intelligent and thought-provoking issues that are raised.  This is not a Disney film in which the father is cruel and uncaring, only to be given a second chance and have a change of heart.  Instead, Keaton is a wonderfully loving father who can't seem to balance his job and his family life.  It's got a dark side, but so does a lot of great family movies.  Frankly, these are the kinds of movies I would love to have my kids watch (if I had any). They present real-life issues (well, under the muse of fantasy of course) and allow kids to deal with them.  I was extremely surprised at how well this film was done.  Go see it.  Let Warner Brothers have at least one hit this year.

Well, that was during my second year of intermediate school. The year before, at the same school, I got to see this movie at an assembly just before Christmas. I also stated that if it wasn't for the assembly the second year, I would have never heard of Snow Day, though since I wrote that, I have seen it mentioned on another site, which may have gone over my head if I hadn't seen the movie. Right now, I've still yet to come across any reference to Jack Frost without searching, so I can say the same that I did about Snow Day. I certainly can't say I'm overly grateful for these two assemblies, since neither film really means much to me.Jack Frost is a member of a rock band and is determined to become successful in the music business. He has a wife named Gabby and a son named Charlie, and sadly, his music career tends to interfere with his family life. At Christmas, his band is scheduled to play a gig that could really get them somewhere, but on their way, Jack calls it off so he can spend Christmas with his family at their mountain cabin. So, he then heads for the cabin, but sadly, on his way there, he gets caught in a snow storm and dies in a car accident. A year later, as Christmas Day draws near once again, Charlie grieves over the tragic death in the family that took place a year ago. He builds a snowman, then plays the harmonica that his father gave him before he died, which magically brings Jack back, in the form of Charlie's snowman! Now that he is back, he can spend some quality time with his son, making up for the time he missed while human, but how is he going to stay when the weather changes and snow melts?!Now, comparing Jack Frost and Snow Day is probably not something done very often. I think I've made it clear why I'm comparing them, but they're not quite the same kind of film. Snow Day is really nothing other than a cheesy comedy adventure for kids, whereas this film is a combination of comedy, drama, and fantasy. However, cheesy is still a common term used to describe this flick. Personally, I certainly can't give it much credit as a comedy, as I did find some parts amusing, such as Charlie seeing his snowman alive for the first time, and a man seeing Jack as a snowman on the road, but I didn't laugh much at all, and there's some weak physical humour while Jack (as a snowman) and Charlie fight a bully (which reminds me, the whole bullying part of the story isn't very well written). Also, the butt dad joke early in the film is a tad inappropriate for the moment. I would be lying if I said I never felt any tension throughout the entire film, but I don't think I was enjoying it. The story is supposed to be moving, but it isn't usually. Unlike Snow Day, I'm a little confused as to what my exact thoughts are on this movie. I'm not sure about my 5/10 rating, and feel I could give it a slightly higher (meaning just slightly above average) or lower (meaning just slightly below average) rating. However, one thing I can say is that I was not in a good mood at the end the last time I watched it, so I guess it wasn't worth it. If I hadn't been shown the movie at that school assembly, I guess I wouldn't have ever heard of it to this day, which I don't think would have been a bad thing. I've definitely seen better Christmas movies. So, I definitely disagree with those who think this movie is terrible, and maybe it's popular with kids (if so, it deserves some credit for that), but I can pretty much see why it's widely considered to be another cheesy family movie.

One day when he got up, Charlie found a harmonica next to his bed. It looked just like the one his dad gave to him, which is out on the snowman, right? When the boy went out to check, mysteriously, it was missing.

It's just too bad, in fact, that it really isn't what Jack Frost, the new film starring Michael Keaton, is all about.

Promises are broken and son Charlie is hurt too often. It is Christmas when Jack is rushing home to his family and killed in a car accident. One year later and Charlie's pain seems like it will never go away and all aspects of his life is suffering. When the spirit of his father returns that next Christmas, Charlie is perhaps understandably freaked out to find that he has taken the form of a snowman. This situation naturally has its own challenges but it is fair to say that a snow dad is better than no dad.Aside from the wonderfully bad tag line that I have just alluded to, I must admit that I had never seen this film for myself and had just accepted that it was bad based on what others had said. So in a combination of OCD and fair-play, I decided to check it out for myself. What I found was not so much terrible (although it is bad) but more terribly misjudged. I have no problem with emotions being delivered within a fantasy film and in fairness at its heart, Jack Frost could have been a moving and touching story about the importance of love, life and making the most of what is important. However it totally undercuts what could have been moving by being horribly cute and superficial in every regard.Death is sanitised, the humour is knockabout, the emotional content is sentimental and the characters are not even good enough to fit into a soap opera. All of these things combine to form a film that is never more than easy corn that will probably only move those that find the mass produced sentiment of greeting cards to be genuinely touching. It is a real shame but such is the way with mass produced melodramas such as these &#150; plenty of superficial family weepies clutter the daytime schedules so why is Jack Frost picked on? Well again it comes down to the judgement of the film and the way it deals with death and loss in such a cavalier fashion. But then again, it also doesn't help that the snowman is such a deeply disturbing character who looks more like he would be a thing of nightmares than a loving figure to warm the hearts of the audience.Providing the voice for this monster, Keaton can do little more than take his money and buy something nice for himself. His voicework sounds like a man with no idea of what to do and remote from any emotional content. That said he is not much better in person and can only churn out an obvious wannabe rocker character. Preston fawns or worries as the scene requires while Cross is a good example of why any good child performance in a film these days gets a mention &#150; ie he is cute and annoying without a hint of realism to his performance. Addy might have figured this film as his break into the US but he can do nothing with what is handed to him.Overall then an obvious, sentimental, corny and annoying family film that, in this regard, is not any worse than many similar films that clutter the daytime TV schedules. However what makes it feel worse is how tacky, cheap and misjudged it all feels, with the nightmarish snowman effect just being the most obvious example.

The pacing is poor, the film barely held my interest for more than a few minutes in a row. The acting is uninspired. The dialog and writing in general is insipid. The whole film is just not very memorable. I recommend it only to huge fans of Michael Keaton, and even those should consider if it's really worth it. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Silly and strange frost","Date":"23 July 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" OK, this is the Keaton comedy-fantasy about a musician dad who gets killed in an automobile crash (that damn snow!) and comes back a year later (at Christmas time, don't you know) inside the snowman just built by his son in front of the house.

A silly, dopey film, almost made pointless except for Preston's nice turn as the mom. She is very attractive and can actually act the part. But she sure can't save this mess.

Jack Frost is among one of the most uninteresting holiday films I've ever seen, boasting a senseless premise about an overworked musician trying to juggle the possibility of breaking into the mainstream with songs equivalent to pre-programmed stock music and taking care of his ten year old son and long suffering wife. To start a kids film detailing how a father has neglect his homelife because of a demanding career is about as common as a holiday film opening with a Christmas song.Our title character and father is played by Michael Keaton of all people. If anyone could pull off the inherent but misplaced warmness of Jack Frost, I believe Keaton would be ideal, be he works best when handed a script baring sufficient ideas, which this film greatly lacks. His wife is Gabby (Kelly Preston) and their son is Charlie (Joseph Cross), who are left upset and vulnerable when Jack dies in a car accident on Christmas Day, returning home after he second-guesses his decision to try and meet guys from a record label in favor of family time.Even a year later, as Christmas approaches, young Charlie depressingly recalls his father's ways and longs for him to return. He erects a gigantic, perfectly proportioned snowman in his yard (I guess in memory and to try to keep spirits high) and witnesses the thing come to life after playing a harmonica his dad gave him. Charlie's snowman has now been embodied by his father's spirit, going to spend more time with him and be the father he never was.I've seen far too many movies to not be exposed to films that feature dialog that does nothing but assist in plot progression. But rarely have I seen a film with so much dull, witless, unimportant dialog that does nothing to service the plot or character development. It takes a good forty minutes before the snowman comes to life, and while in many other movies I'd commend it for taking time to develop characters, Jack Frost seems to stall for the sake of stalling, giving us long, tedious dialog between characters, mainly father and son, offering nothing more than tired clichés and draining, tiresome banter.And when we do get the snowman, my god if he's the most uncharismatic, hideous movie creature I've ever seen. For one, animating a snowman can not be an easy task on the special effects artists, and the job done here has proved sufficient. Shortly after coming to life, Jack Frost frequently stumbles, is dismembered by a snow-plow, and other unamusing, childish things that we as the unfortunate audience members are expected to laugh at.This is a loathsome holiday experience that shows nothing but how a third-rate script with a terribly unconvincing movie character can make an attempt to pass for schmaltzy children's fare. There's a wonderfully campy horror film that was released a year before this one with the same title of Jack Frost, centered around a mutant snowman that ran among in a sleepy Midwestern town and it was up to the town sheriff to take Jack down. I keenly remember the film for its unabashedly goofy premise, absurd humor, and persistent puns that always came from its snowman title character. It was fun stuff. Perhaps if Jack Frost took lessons from the killer Jack Frost on the studies of wit and silliness, we'd have a better film on our hands.Starring Michael Keaton (who also voices Jack Frost), Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross, and Mark Addy. Directed by Troy Miller.

First problem with this movie is that Michael Keaton could not sing, maybe he could, but the songs he tried to sing were awful. This comedy is one that falls very short of the lofty goal of a great holiday comedy. Michael Keaton plays a father long estranged from his son because his musical band is constantly on the road. He gets in a car accident and dies. He is reincarnated as a snowman. Well he uses the time to hang with his son in a way he never could before. The movie isn't horrible it just wasn't that good either. The movie is very sappy and really doesn't try to tell a joke really, kind of strange for a movie that claims to be a comedy. I guess that the whole novelty of a live snowman was supposed to be enough to make this movie entertaining but it really wasn't. Michael Keaton is an actor that has done a number of good parts, this is not one of them, I think this part was not good enough for an actor of his caliber. Mark Addy as a member of his band provides marginally good support but to no avail, and Keaton tries so hard to make this movie work, but he just can't. This is one overall to do without.

He's tragically killed one snowy winter night, and for inexplicable reasons is resurrected in the front yard a year later as his son's snowman. That's pretty much all the story there is in this odd, overblown fantasy as the rest of the film is padded with cheesy snow effects and lame comedy.

Michael Keaton is Jack Frost, a small-town blues sensation who, after having died in a car accident, is reincarnated as a snowman, and attempts to reunite with his son.Poorly acted, Frost's son is astonishingly sedate when first he sees the re-incarnation of his father thawing on the porch.  The sight of an animate snowman is not apocryphal to this lad, but he is sceptical that the snowman is his father.  The movie fluctuates so distressfully between some futile reality and utter fantasy, you might find yourself laughing out of sheer boredom.  Henry Rollins represents the only iota of plausibility in this film; when he sees the talking snowman, he goes insane (with comical results).  It is not a spectacular role but the only one founded in reality, because I too would be scared of this snowman.  (It does look pretty sinister.)  Rollins performance is brief and what little entertainment it provides is not enough to salvage this film as tolerable.  This movie is dripping with corny moments, an excruciating snowboard sequence, and tired snow clichés like better snowdad, than NO dad!  Truly awful.

And not only is Jack Frost a bad Christmas movie, it has also got Jack in the title.  I have a theory that, between this and that unbelievably wrong-headed, practically traumatic Robin Williams movie, any movie named Jack is going to hurt.  Lots.I knew this was going to be a long, hard time the minute I heard Landslide on the soundtrack.  It's during the scene where the kid builds a snowman in his front yard.  In memory of his father.  His father (brace yourselves for a violent heart-string yanking) died on Christmas Eve.Ha ha ha! I practically heard the movie scream at me, are you crying yet?  How about now???Ow.But, no worries!

I assume that SOMEONE must have read the script and STILL thought the movie was worth making. But how? The movie is a completely depressing and stupid mess. I can't think of a less appealing holiday movie except for the terrible Grinch (2000).So here's the heart-warming (?) plot. A neglectful father is in a rock/blues band. FYI--Michael Keaton's singing was surprisingly good (though this does NOT make up for the rest of the movie). Anyway, he wants to make it big and gets the chance to do an important gig on Christmas Eve. While traveling there, he's in an accident and is killed. I felt it served him right because he was behaving like a selfish jerk but I'm sure that many children were traumatized when this occurred.Later, for no discernible reason, his son's wish to have his dad return results in Keaton being reincarnated as a really creepy looking snowman. This is the second opportunity to traumatize the kids, as he wasn't particularly cute or endearing--just plain creepy.Keaton and his son SOMEHOW manage to renew their love for each other and then Keaton melts---providing a third opportunity to induce childhood trauma in our kids.That's it. Nothing fun, nothing cuddly, and nothing worth wasting your time seeing. It's just depressing and banal.

JACK FROST isn't really a terrible movie; it actually starts out as a good, touching family flick, right up to when the snowman comes to life.  That's when the film plunges downward, with weak special effects and a predictable story that does not allow the film to take off.

"},{"Title":"Absolutely Ridiculous","Date":"28 July 2000","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  The main problem with Jack Frost is that it is a movie that revels in its own stupidity. The movie's script loves to make jokes about the fact that the main character has become, of all things, a snowman. Nobody in the movie thinks. Everyone is an idiot, and the myriad of idiotic comments (more stupider) just bear that fact out. It's not even entertaining - Jack Frost gets extremely tedious and boring soon after the transformation takes place (which is supposed to be where the fun starts, apparently).What's even worse is that the snowman here, which occupies a disturbingly large chunk of screen time, is not cute, or funny, or loaded with personality. This animatronic monstrosity is actually pretty creepy to look at. The sight of the snowman snowboarding (he is, like all the other 12-year old kids here, are capable of going down the slopes with skill worthy of the Winter Olympics), or playing hockey is enough to make one laugh out loud - but it's not because the situation is funny, or because the dialog is sharp. It's because the entire movie is so ludicrous to look at and watch.Everything about this movie just reeks of the word dumb. It has every cliche known to film. In fact, it's strange - this is a movie with a mildly interesting premise, but its execution is so devoid of imagination that it's not even funny. This is even more incredible when you realize that there were no less than FOUR writers working on the script.For a kid's movie, Jack Frost also has a surprising amount of  low-brow jokes, all of which are completely tacky and devoid of taste. It's hard to fathom exactly why the filmmakers decided to leave this stuff in, as it's not even funny. If they were trying to make it appeal to adults with a different layer of humor (like what Chicken Run did so well), they did, in fact, accomplish something completely different - they managed to turn  a dumb movie into one that is insulting at times (they wanted me to laugh at this?).In short, Jack Frost is a movie that is cliched, boring, unfunny, and just plain ridiculous - suspension of disbelief has no place here in Jack Frost, because words cannot express how dumb this movie ended up turning out.
