Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the tale to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable a bird's.Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything being said. The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner. The movie continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a Russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding. A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more. And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. (Unlike in star wars, where Yoda resembles a Muppet) This film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently. Overall, I give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.

This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk. Instead, it is about a Parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on. Then the great journey begins. Paulie the Parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend, Marie.Along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people. He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her. He gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him.He recounts his tale to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie.Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes across.There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too. It is a witty, clever, epic animal-adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a Bird and his little girl. He search for Marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don;t know much about Parrots.Kids who have seen the wild Green Parrot Tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that Birds, especially Parrots are not disposable pets. All children everywhere, will see that Pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.so no BABE here, more of an incredible journey with a twist.Enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts.

There's the elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) whom he befriends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin), and others.All in all, it's a very well done movie.

I went to this movie expecting to view a typical family movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness. It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined wholesome. Most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.Oh yes, Paulie had a plot. It told the story of a young girl(Marie) and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her. Marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought Paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health, and quickly tore them apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yeah, Paulie really could (smart)talk and had a swift New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. No sleeping. I promise.

"}{"Title":"As talking animal films go, Paulie's on a par with Babe","Date":"10 May 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" I approach films about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. And not a few phrases either. Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story. Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. Of a cage that is!Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for those promises to be broken time and again.Paulie is admittedly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie. He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathises with Paulie's situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking There are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over.Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have a romance. Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well). That may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another.The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. I'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. And Paulie's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible. He's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since.The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they do find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film. The same laughs. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence.A minor gem.

The animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success, though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way.

All of whom, he shared tender and treacherous adventures with, before ending up behind bars.Swayed by his sad story, Misha helps Paulie escape.With great characters, a heartfelt story and the use of real animals, Paulie is a real kid pleaser.In fact, this movie is way more fun than actually owning a parakeet.

Actually,I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,Paulie. I had missed the opening credits,so I didn't know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it,so I naturally thought I had tuned into Born In East L.A. When I saw him talking to a talking parrot,I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.Happy to say,it was better than that. As you know,if you don't already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner. Seems it's taken years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways. People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves. While Cheech Marin's character is making money from him,he's not mean to him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute,I found them amusing.Paulie,who's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people. Especially the owner of an animal research lab. The man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research. Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability.Throughout the film Paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It's a touching reunion. 8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown. That part might bother younger children. Otherwise,it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart.

However, this movie is so all-around wonderful, it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and Paulie doesn't qualify for that.The only acting criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but asking a 6 year-old child to out-do Dustin Hoffman as the Rainman is asking for the impossible in film-making.Moving past that minor complaint, the movie has the best of many films buddy road-trip, con-games, hero as friendly party-animal (party-bird?), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What's not to like? Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. That's normal for him, it seems. (I'm Russian... I LIKE long stories.) I don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and that will make sense.Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the film. Roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them. I have always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slimy, and his on-screen role fits that as well. The only surprise to me was finding that Jay was also Paulie's voice. In the end, even that works well; put Parrot and anti-Parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own.If you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either, Paulie is a perfect candidate. I will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of Paulie. I was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave. The car's air-conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling (as did our hotel) and I said, let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning. So we did. So for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused, and given a heart-warming experience. When I saw it recently on VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized just how well this movie was made.It's a sleeper film you won't regret watching.

From the opening frame, the movie takes on a beautifully painted portrait of the life of a Conure named Paulie and all of his relationships with humans, from his early days with his beloved owner Maria, through his many adventures in search of her, after he is taken away. I know I am speaking vague but, I do not intend to give any link to spoilers here. This masterpiece should be watched with no pre-know idea's.

The daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film, but actually in most other departments the film is charming.In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from N.Y.C to L.A to be re-united with her.So, why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well? Firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving, often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline. Thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a wily crook, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, the dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) as a musical immigrant. It might not be a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.

It can get pretty lonely there at night, but one particular night, Misha happened to hear someone singing. That someone was a parrot named Paulie. The two of them soon become chummy with one another and Paulie tells the dramatic story of how he got there.        It all began 20 years earlier when a little girl, Marie Alweather received a baby bird as a gift (Paulie). Marie had trouble speaking, she'd often stutter, but when discovering Paulie was no ordinary parrot and could speak like a person, she overcame the trouble. But Marie's father was a real jerk! He was very impatient with Marie and got her a cat, which almost got Paulie. After that, Dad seriously wanted to get rid of Paulie, and he did!          Paulie lived in the pawn shop and had sarcastic chats with the proprietor (Buddy Hackett). One day, an elderly woman named Ivy came to the shop and purchased Paulie in an attempt to teach him manners. It wasn't easy but he soon asked nicely to be taken home. He finds the Alweathers had moved west to California. Ivy's house had wheels, so they set off. The trip comes to a traumatic halt when Ivy loses her eye sightand soon died. But Paulie continues on his own and finally makes it to L.A. He becomes friends with Ignacio (Cheech Marin) and his band of singing parrots; Paulie is kidnapped by Benny (Jay Mohr, who also does Paulie's voice). Benny teaches Paulie how to rob ATM machines and even tried to have him rob jewels.               After that, Paulie was moved to the university where Dr. Weingold discovered Paulie's ability to talk and tried to show him off, which didn't work, so from that day on, Paulie lived in the basement. After listening, Misha tried to help Paulie locate Marie and they find her-- all grown up! Our story has a happy ending.      This movie is pretty good. It's a good family picture. Saturday Night Live's Jay Mohr is the voice of Paulie. The little girl who plays Marie was the same little girl who starred in those Pepsi commercials. She was the little girl with celebrity voices (Joe Pesci, Marlon Brando, Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes).

So in the film, he is given as a gift to little Marie Alweather (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), but then he is taken away by her father Warren (Matt Craven) when she believes he can talk more just a couple of words.

Paulie is a parrot taken from his owner after she falls off a roof. Through a series of events he is locked up in a basement in an institute because he refused to be exploited. Interesting concept divided into various encounters and an ending that seems too conventional. Director John Roberts does his best and aided with beautiful photography. Tony Shalhoub brings a warm sincerity as a janitor whose life is perfectly ordinary until he encounters Paulie. He goes unbelieved when he attempts to inform others about the bird's voice but decides to listen to his story. His role will be to help Paulie's voice be heard as oppose to exploited. Gena Rowlands is pleasant as a woman who first purchases Paulie. She will assist him in finding his owner until she loses her sight and eventually her life. Jay Mohr is terrific as a thief with specific plans for Paulie but the role is abruptly cut off. Richard Cheech Marin plays a parrot owner who uses Paulie for an act before he is stolen by Mohr. Perhaps the one role that is disappointing is Bruce Davison's villain, a research scientist.

He plays an immigrant janitor who befriends a parrot who used to belong to a little girl. At first the parrot's lines are a little irritating, but the extended flashback is interesting, although inevitably without Shalhoub. The little girl's speech impediment ties in nicely with the janitor's troubles with English, and even the parrot's desire not to talk, even though he can. Overall it's a pretty decent film, especially if you need one with a language theme. And there's even a New Jersey joke. I suppose that the most disappointing thing is that Shalhoub ends up being a supporting character, but the succession of supporting characters that the parrot meets are some compensation, and Tony makes the moments that he does get, count.

Where else would you see a parrot cheering on the winged attackers while watching Hitchcock's The Birds, or even Bruce Davison wanting to steal the secret of Paulie's voice, Gena Rowlands trying to teach the cocky bird some manners and Cheech Marin introducing him to his singing circus? The film is lovely to look at, with beautiful cinematography and scenery, and the animiatronics are absolutely superb. I loved the soundtrack too, and the direction is good. And I was fine with the acting, Tony Shalhoub does what he can in the underwritten role as the Russian janitor, while Cheech Marin and Gena Rowlands are cute in their roles and Bruce Davison is fine too as Dr Reingold. However, two characters make the film. One is young Marie, the speech-impaired but simply adorable little girl who takes care of Paulie. She is played with precious innocence by Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The other is Paulie himself, he is very cocky but he is also very cute and superbly voiced by Jay Mohr.
