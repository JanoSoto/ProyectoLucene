I don't know if that would be true, but it would be nice to speculate about it.   Some proof that this might be possible comes from viewing actor/ first time writer director Billy Morrissette's (Pump up the volume) SCOTLAND, PA, a modern day reworking of MacBeth.Set in the mid seventies SCOTLAND, PA stars James LeGros (Psycho) as Joe MacBeth a cook at Duncan's café. He the kind of guy with lots of ideas, but absolutely no drive and so people walk all over him.  So when his boss Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn, Far From Heaven) uses some of them while promoting his useless son Malcolm, his wife Pat(Maura Tierney, Primary Colors), a beautiful and driven hatch's a plan.  She and &#145;Mac' are going to kill Duncan (who by the way made his fortune in Donuts (yes it's corny but I found it kind of funny)) and open up MacBeth's the first fast food drive-thru restaurant in Scotland, PA.SCOTLAND, PA plays fast and loose with it's source material and has some really great ideas jammed packed in it.  It's always fun to reinterpret Shakespeare, because his works are timeless.  You can set them in the 18th century or a hundred years in the future and the characters are still real and powerful. Maura Tierney's Lady MacBeth is phenomenal.  It is a performance full of subtle nuance; of course she hatches the plan and is able to manipulate MacBeth.  But there is also vulnerability about her.  I wonder if she were my wife would I not follow?  I'd probably do anything she said.  She kind of reminds me of my fiancé, in whom I would probably kill for.   That's the mark of a great femme fatale.  Her performance is engaging and wonderful, and one of the best I've seen in a long time.It's the other character's that seem understated and dull.  No other performance really sticks out until Christopher Walken show's up.  He portrays Lieutenant McDuff, the detective sent out to figure out just who killed Duncan. He plays the part with that certain gusto that only Walken could bring to the role.  He's plays parts like these so well,  he's always walking that thin line between quirky and bored and you can't help but be enchanted by him.  He's really amazing. I also enjoyed Amy Smart (Outside Providence), Andy Dick (Dude, Where's My Car?) and Timothy &#145;Speed' Levitch (The Crusie) as the three witches.  They offer the comic relief that some points of the movie desperately needed.  Sure they were a little corny and maybe a bit to zany for the film, but since the movie has a certain silly tone, it was okay with me.First time director and writer Billy Morrissette will always hold that special place in my heart at the tough guy in Pump up the Volume. He is defiantly a fun director who has a nice visual sense.  I liked how the film may have been set in the 70's and yet also felt like it could have been happening in present day.   Many lesser films would have felt like the characters were at a 70's party and not like real people living at the time.  I also liked the look of the press conference as they drove in the convertible.  It's was just a beautiful sequence right before the dam breaks.  It pretty powerful stuff.Scotland PA is not a brilliant reworking of the MacBeth story, but it's fun, vibrant, and Tierney and Walken are worth and hour and forty minutes.  I only wish the rest of of the cast were up to snuff.  All in all I recommend this movie.SCOTLAND PA is well worth a visit.

I took it as a blind recommendation and it has become one of my favorite comedies in years.Using Shakespeare's Macbeth as his source, former actor Billy Morrissette makes (I believe) his feature film debut as an actor with this brilliantly dark (I know, I'm oxymoronic) comedy. Set in the depressed town of Scotland, Pennsylvania circa 1973, Morrissette turns Shakespeare's original story about a power hungry wife pushing her too contemplative husband into a bloody post-regicide reign into a tale of an over ambitious wife pushing her dullard husband into murder to take over a fast food joint. Morrissette had obvious fun playing with the characters names and using them to even propel the story. There is of course our anti-hero/heroine Joe Mac and his wife Pat - the McBeth's, both of whom work for Duncan, the owner of (what else) a donut shop. Through shrewd manipulation Pat pushes. There's also Lt. McDuff (Christopher Walken seemingly having more fun than he has in anything I can recall him in); Banquo - becomes Banco, and Shakespeare's witches/weird sisters become an unholy trio of drugged out hippies (deliciously played by Andy Dick, Amy Smart and Tim Levitch. Acting honors go all the way around but James LeGros and Maura Tierney get special mention as the unholy couple. LeGros captures the perfect 70's dullard, small time dreams, clueless and nearly almost ruining everything. He's a delight to watch. Ms. Tierney - an actress who singlehandedly kept me from ever watching E.R. nearly shocked the life out of me by actually proving to be an amazing actress. If for no other reason (but thank God there are plenty of 'em) the movie would be worth watching for Tierney's most delicious, crazed performance of the film. Her transparent subtlety is almost menacing and her greedy ambition is mouthwateringly contagious - you want her to get away with everything. I can't recommend this movie enough! Hilarious and disturbing Scotland, Pa. is a joy!

This is a Black Comedy, and it is very good. The scenes are quick and engaging. The actors are well suited for their characters. The Duncan brothers could have their own sequel. Christopher Walken is very sly and humorous, shaking his castanetta's while trying to solve a murder. If it was not made aware to you, this is a 1980's version of Macbeth, with Maura Tierney and James LeGros playing the scheming murderous couple, the McBeths. A hamburger restaurant is at the center of the action, with the McBeths being willed the restaurant from their former boss, Mr. Duncan. The cinematography very much captures Pa., as well as the sets. Two final comments. The soundtrack was one of the best I have heard in years. Bad Company songs make up about half of it, with sprinklings of other ditties included as well. The second and most important is that Maura Tierney steals this film. Every scene she is in, you are transfixed to her. Her actions, her (in some cases) vulgarity and her great acting makes this her showcase. The scene with her and the pharmacist at the end is hysterical as she attempts to remove a burn from her hand which has long since healed. Bravo Maura and Bravo to this little movie that SHOULD have been a bigger success. Shakespeare adaptation not withstanding, you do not need to be familiar with the Bard to enjoy this film.

It may not go down in history, but it is hilariously funny--especially if you don't take it too seriously! People need to chill out a bit about it, and not try to analyze it too deeply. It's a funny 1970's version of Macbeth with fabulous actors and actresses, and while much of its comedy comes from its similarites to the play, much of the comedy stands on its own. It's a great update, and I don't think it should be compared to films like Shakespeare in Love because the idea is completely different. It's not too violent of a black comedy, either, though moments like the killing of Duncan are outright hilarious. Take smaller moments, too, like when the children play with the body of Banco as it's being taken away. The acting is excellent--Tierney, Le Gros, Walkin...what else do I have to say? It's a fun film that I think you should see.

So many of the films are dark, forbidding noir  that the channel comes with free coupons for Pfizer products.  However, I caught Scotland, PA, and I gotta tell ya, I LOVED this flick.The director asked himself, What would MacBeth be like if it was set in a fast-food restaurant?  No, really.  On paper it sounds like an insane idea, and I tuned in mostly out of curiosity.  I was quickly delighted by this turn of fancy, which turns one of the uglier Shakespeare plays into an offbeat comedy. James LeGros  plays Joe Mac McBeth, a downtrodden assistant manager of a hamburger joint, who can't get ahead because of the owner's vapid sons.  His long-suffering wife, played by the wonderful Maura Tierney (E.R.), presses him to plot to get ahead and then rob the owner, Mr. Duncan (get out your Cliff Notes, kids).  They wind up killing him by knocking him face-first into the frier, and Mrs. McBeth winds up getting a significant burn on her hand.  And so the intrigue begins.  Malcolm, the lead idiot son of Duncan, practically gives the stand to the McBeths, and they are a rousing success, living high off the hog (or the cow, in this case) until Christopher Walken appears as Detective McDuff, a vegetarian cop investigating the death of Duncan.  Walken does an hysterically funny parody of himself, as if he's the only character in the movie who's in Twin Peaks. The prophetic witches get a makeover that is both weird, funny and strangely appropriate.  I won't tell you any more, but trust me, for once I'm being serious when I say that you should tune in Sundance for this movie, or ask your video rental store to get it.  The direction, acting, locations and deadly earnest commitment to the lunacy make it an entertaining movie for anyone to watch.  Those who know the play will be rolling on the floor. And as much as I like Tom Stoppard and love Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, this movie is far more accessible.  I hope we see more work like this from Billy Morrissette, the director. "},{"Title":"Yet Another Spin On the Bard","Date":"23 November 2002","Score":"11 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Once again, Shakespeare is afforded a cinematic, contemporary rendering in `Scotland, Pa.,' written for the screen and directed by Billy Morrissette, an updated version of the tragedy, `Macbeth,' which here becomes a black comedy of tragic proportions.  Morrissette jumps on the bandwagon that began in 1996 with Baz Luhrmann's `William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,' which was followed by further spins on the bard's plays, including Julie Taymor's energetic and imaginative `Titus' in &#145;99 and Michael Almereyda's dreadful and dreary `Hamlet' in 2000.  Morrissette's offering-- which differs from the others in that it does not retain the Shakespearian language and verse-- falls somewhat beneath Luhrmann and Taymor's films, but far above Almereyda's dismal effort, which was a tragedy in ways that transcended the story.  Be advised, this one is a `black comedy' in every sense of the definition, and actually comes in on the absolute `darkest' end of the spectrum.  There's no getting around it, `Macbeth' is a depressing story to begin with, and this version decidedly captures the spirit of the play that inspired it.This story begins with a look at businessman Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn), who after selling his successful donut shops (`Duncan' Donuts, anyone?) has established a hamburger stand, which due in no small part to the innovative ideas of employee Joe McBeth (James LeGros) and the support of Joe's wife, Pat McBeth (Maura Tierney)-- also an employee of Duncan's-- has become a successful enterprise, as well as a harbinger of a chain of fairly well-known burger stands that start with `M' and today enjoy the lion's share of the fast-food market.  And now Norm has come up with his best idea yet, one that's going to take the simple burger stand into the future and put Duncan's at the top of the heap.It's a grand scheme alright, and Norm graciously shares his intentions with his best employees, Joe and Pat.  But there's a rub; the idea was originally Joe's, and Norm's taking the credit does not sit too well with the McBeth's, who envision a hamburger joint of their own, `McBeth's,' sitting beneath the huge arches formed by the big red `M' of the sign that stands above the entrance to the restaurant.  And the whole business goes south very quickly, as `Norm's' idea leads a seething Joe and Pat down a path that must necessarily end in murder and mayhem if their plan is, in fact, acted upon.  And is it?  For the answer to that, one must look no further than the source material, and keep in mind the term, `tragedy.'Billy Morrissette's is an interesting and fairly imaginative presentation, but in staying true to the essence of the play it takes you, finally, to a very dark place.  And even though he supplies a rather amusing ending infused with shrouded irony, be advised, this one's a downer; and it may seem something of a contradiction in terms, but it's going to make you laugh in spite of yourself.  And you'll hate yourself in the morning because of it.  Still, there's no denying that this is a clever, if just short of inspired, piece of filmmaking.  The single drawback is the casting of LeGros in the lead role; he does a decent job, even acceptable by most standards, but he lacks the screen presence and charisma to really sell it.  The part of Joe called for someone like Thomas Jay Ryan, who was so riveting in Hal Hartley's `Henry Fool' in 1998, a film which coincidentally featured another actor who could've pulled this part off successfully, and who happens to have a small, but pivotal role in this film, Kevin Corrigan.Corrigan, a terrific character actor and unsung veteran of a number of indy films, in this one plays Anthony `Banco' Banconi, a co-worker and friend of the McBeth's who significantly figures into the tragedy as it ultimately plays out.  Corrigan has the talent and just the kind of charismatic screen presence the role of Joe called for, and it's too bad that Morrissette and casting director Avy Kaufman didn't recognize the possibility that was right in front of them.They did strike gold, however, with the casting of Tierney as Pat McBeth.  She has a naturally endearing screen presence and expressive eyes that can speak volumes, which she uses to great effect here.  And, as she's demonstrated since becoming an integral member of the cast of TV's `ER,' she plays extremely well to her `dark' side, which is precisely what the role of Pat called for.  Needless to say, she does it quite well, turning in an altogether convincing and entirely believable performance.Another actor who plays so well to his dark side, Christopher Walken, does a solid turn here as Lt. Ernie McDuff, the investigator probing the shady goings-on at Duncan's hamburger stand.  In any role, Walken has a subtle, commanding presence, and this is no exception; here, though, he lends something of a light touch to the proceedings that is nevertheless in keeping with the seriousness of the story.  Suffice to say, he does black comedy well.  And, without question, it is Walken who `makes' the final shot of the film.The supporting cast includes Tom Guiry (Malcolm Duncan), Andy Dick (The Hippie Jesse), Amy Smart (The Hippie Stacy), Timothy `Speed' Levitch (The Hippie Hector), Geoff Dunsworth (Donald Duncan), John Cariani (doing a hilarious turn as Ed the Cop), Nate Crawford (Robert/Richard) and Timothy Durkin (Frank the Pharmacist).  It may not be especially memorable, but `Scotland, Pa.' is just quirky enough to be a worthwhile entry in the Put-A-Spin-On-Shakespeare festival, currently playing on a DVD or video near you.

The standouts here are Tierney and LeGros, who are fine in holding their ground throughout the time.  As for Walken, who handles his character like Peter Falk did as Columbo or Frances McDormand in Fargo very well, gives the viewer another reason to enjoy the movie.

It's that kind of movie, I guess it is smarter than you think, but in ways that aren't necessarily very illuminating to the core of the drama.This take on Shakespeare's MacBeth is both lightweight and light on its feet.  It doesn't take itself very seriously but it takes what it wants from the material and spins it into an unexpected and hard to categorize movie. Think Dazed and Confused meets the Bard and you're getting pretty close to the mark, but it's campier than that, not as heartfelt, more smart-alecky. There's a little Twin Peaks bound up in the recipe, as well.Though the material is not as well-crafted as, say, Shakespeare in Love, the sloppy, homemade quality almost becomes its central aesthetic.  It feels like something you'd dream up on a Friday night sitting around a hookah with your best friends, and by Saturday morning nobody could remember quite what you were talking about.Even though the film utterly lacks the air of serious drama that one normally expects in a rendition of a Shakespearian tragedy, one can't help but wonder if the slapdash charms of this production might not actually lie closer to what versions Shakespeare himself might have seen produced at the Globe...rowdy, loose, untamed entertainment that races from one side of the stage to the other without pausing to ask what its all about.

Scotland, PA is another, one of many in recent years, often done as teen flicks these days. This is totally logical given the power of the stories, the universality of the themes. Now, you might not have immediately thought the take over of a burger joint in the 1970s would be the most logical parallel to the regicide of Macbeth, but it's handled pretty well here.The movie is largely loyal to the original, so the co-story credit with William Shakespeare is quite appropriate. The main characters have names patterned after the originals, and the storyline goes basically the same. Maura Tierney (wife of the director) as Pat McBeth is great and seems to have a lot of fun cursing (she is usually in good girl roles). Christopher Walken (Lieutenant McDuff) has another self-parodying role that is a lot of fun. A couple other interesting tidbits ...

It also somewhat loses its way... now, it still is enjoyable, and parts of it are quite imaginative and good on some level, but something is missing.

There is wit & humor, esp. in the snappy deliveries of the wife, Pat McBeth. There is a well built up murder plot and a whodunit sequel, all of which might fit best under the category of Disorganized Crime (in Videohound's film guide). Then there is the fun of trying to compare everything in the film to Shakespeare's Macbeth. Best of all are the characterizations, a couple of good ones (Pat & Malcolm) and a couple of great ones (Mac and Donald, Malcolm's brother).  LeGros, as Mac, does the best job of portraying a slow-witted person that I have ever seen. Other portrayers of the slow-witted(e.g., Burt Lancaster in The Rose Tattoo and Atlantic City, Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Lon Chaney, Jr., in Of Mice and Men, and Steve McQueen in Nevada Smith) overdid it or could not make you forget the intelligence they had shown in previous roles. But with LeGros, one can't recognize him at all; I still can't believe it was he, that is, the same actor I saw in My New Gun and Guncrazy. Dunsworth, as Donald, presents homosexual character unlike any I've ever seen.  Dunsworth's Donald displays no gay mannerisms, expressing his gayness only indirectly through a thorough disinterest in what is not gay.  Then, when his leanings are exposed (as his partner comes out of a room), he (and his companion) exhibit an almost evil spitefulness about their activities that is surprising and chilling.

The genius of Scotland, PA is that it acknowledges this by using the rough plot outline for Shakespeare's Macbeth to create a black comedy that follows the independent film formula of lovable but stupid characters in a violent situation.  A situation that involves the development of the drive-thru as a motive for murder.The film features a fully realized Lady Macbeth who convinces her sweet but slow husband that he deserves to rise to the top of fast food world in rural Pennsylvania at any cost.  This is probably the first Lady Macbeth that plays the whole damned spot thing for comedy.  Since delusions and suicide are tricky comic subjects, I was particularly impressed by the use of sly comic touches, such as the fact that Pat hides her imagined spot with a plaid oven mitt which she wear nonchalantly with an evening dress.Without the Shakesperian dialogue, of course, much of what was interesting about the titular character is lost so the filmakers made up for it by introducing plenty of oddballs such as Banko (or Banquo from the original play) who is having a Yahtzee-themed birthday party the night of the murder. Sometimes I just visualize myself getting Yahtzee and it happens. MacDuff becomes Lt. MacDuff played by Christopher Walken who does an uncharacteristically understated performance that seems equal part Columbo and Marge from Fargo.  Comparisons to the Cohen brothers are almost inescapable with any black comedy of independent ilk, but Scotland, PA borrows more than most.  Although director Billy Morisette lacks the Cohens virtuosity behind the  camera (sometimes I find   all that distracting anyway), he certainly has appropriated their love of oddball characters, absurd situations, and comic detour.Scotland, PA is the best film adaptation of Macbeth since Kirasawa's Throne of Blood.  It captures the essence of characters, and uses the comic possibilities in Shakespeare's tragedies, which Tom Stoppard did with Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead.   Writer Billy Morisette is no Tom Stoppard, but for this style of movie, it's really not necessary. Language like Shakespeare's MacBeth would use are completely foreign to the film's Joe MacBeth and some of the Bard's great monologues turn up in a the form of a motivational book-on-tape that MacDuff is listening to in his car. Another aspect of the movie that I liked was that it wasn't slavishly devoted to Shakespeare's plot.  After Banko appears as a ghost, the movie goes it's own way plot wise.  This is probably for the best since it would have been hard to keep the comic tone while killing off MacDuff's whole family--a fact acknowledged by the hippy witches who tell MacBeth that such a plot device would have worked like a 1,000 years ago.

Taking place in a 70s fast food restaurant, writer/director Billy Morrissette manages to make some hilarious jabs at pop culture, while keeping true to the theme, however distant from the original setting. Maura Tierney and Christopher Walken are fantastic with their individual dry sense of humor and comic timing. Smaller roles by Amy Smart, Andy Dick, and Tom Speed Levitch are all memorable and fit well into the scheme of his very dark comedy. Although the moods of the film are variable from time to time, there is an underlying wink and nod to the audience, much like in a Shakespearean play. While sure to upset some Branagh-like purists, it's not as offensive to the original as modern re-imaginings like O and Romeo and Juliet.   With seven Bad Company songs in the soundtrack, a plethora of bad clothes, and the attention to detail of the set design a real mood is set. That with the low-budget filmmaking style makes it seem as if it was made at least 20 years ago at some points.   Although this is not a movie for everyone, Walken and Shakespeare fans should be delighted. I'd highly recommend this to any open-minded viewer up for something a little different.

Usually these markings indicate that they are some kind of 'special' movie. From my own experience, that marking signifies the movie is a 'dog.' I have rented one or two of these in my 25 years of video watching. Often, I found myself wondering whether I was culturally deficient, and on the other hand, amazed at what some people in the business get away with under the guise of being amateurs.Anyway, on a recent evening when I could not find anything to satiate my video yen, I took the advice of the video store clerk, who knows of my esoteric interests.

The only part I missed, and which I think should SOMEHOW have been included, was the untimely ripped part about Macduff.

Ordinary Levis had been marketed in their pristine stiff, dark-blue state. After a dozen or so launderings they faded naturally to a sort of powder blue and thinned out at the knees. It became chic to wear these worn-out jeans. Catching onto this fad, the manufacturers began to market brand new jeans that were already faded and beat-up looking, for which the consumer paid full price. It even became possible to buy brand new raggedy cut-offs that looked like rejects from a Goodwill Store. This movie reminds me of those brand-new old jeans. Because movies were undergoing a similar process, whose dynamics were unknown even to professional students of collective behavior. There were genuinely weird and honest cult movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and others, so ridiculous, so quirky, that they were attended not by audiences but by congregations. Then there appeared fake cult classics, designed from the outset to resemble the honest originals, the way those new faded jeans resembled the originals. Scotland, PA strikes me as one of those higher-order fakes, an attempt to market a cult movie by imitating cult movies. Oddball lines, characters who come and go without explanation, strange locutions, even stranger music, all very original. The Cohn brothers are an obvious influence here and not to good effect. Principally what has been borrowed is the tendency to underilluminate scenes (as in Blood Simple) so it's not always possible to see what's going on. There is a good deal of laconic dialgue with lots of pauses between lines that are either clever or semi-clever. Having read the play doesn't help much. Incidents are borrowed in some warped form (the grease burn on Lady MacBeth's hand) or left out entirely (the slaughter of MacDuff's family or the woods coming to Dunsinane). It all struck me as no more than mildly amusing at its best, and my mind wandered until I found I was actually pondering the self parody of those new old faded jeans. That's a pretty bad sign. The fault lies not with the performers. They're all pretty good, especially Maura Tierney and Chris Walken, who doesn't do an impression of Colombo so much as a suggestion of him.

"},{"Title":"A funny, worthwhile adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth.","Date":"5 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Billy Morrissette's first attempt at writing and directing is a successfully darkly-comedic adaptation of Shakespeare's classic fatalistic drama, Macbeth.  Set in Scotland, Pennsylvania (an actual town), in the 70s, it's the story of how Joe 'Mac' McBeth and his wife Pat fall victim to their own ambition.The viewer should keep in mind that there is also an element of 70s nostalgic mockery in the film all but just a very few cars (notably Duncan's car) are period Chevy Camaros, and the (excellent) soundtrack is laden with Bad Company.  This is  Morrissette's homage to his memories of 1970s American culture.The cast is excellent - especially Christopher Walken, whose famously-quirky way of speaking lends itself to being funny, and Maura Tierney.  Andy Dick and James LeGros are both great in their respective roles.A lot of the humor may be lost if the viewer has no knowledge of the original play - such as almost everyone's name starting with Mc, or the cleverness of the Kingdom of Scotland being adapted to a burger joint in a town named Scotland - but the script carries itself even so.  Considering that Morrissette has never written a screenplay before this one, it carries itself remarkably well.  This movie is well worth your while, especially if you enjoy Shakespeare.

The &#145;70's McBeths plan the murder of their boss Norman Duncan to take over his burger restaurant. The parody of 1970's culture, especially fast food, works well from bellbottoms to drive-through windows.The adaptation of Shakespeare's `Macbeth' is weak, however. As parody, it doesn't survive through the hippie witches opening. It's one thing to have Kenneth Branagh plan to adapt the play; it is quite another for almost anyone else to attempt even a serious version, much less this uneven Billie Morrissette comedy noir.What does work, however, is Christopher Walken as Lt. Ernie McDuff, a Columbo-like investigator flashing the Walken menacing but naughty grin. He has the film's best line when he says of the McBeth improvements to the burger joint, This place really looks great. Of course, the last time there was a dead body in the fryer. He, along with Maura Tierney as Pat McBeth, is worth seeing.If you know the original, there are enough amusements; if you don't, then you are limited to a low to medium level of laughter on the chili pepper scale. Shakespeare cared little for plot; it was in the words he caught the minds of the audience. `Scotland, PA' has a little style and very little memorable language, except for the other great line when Pat McBeth says, We're not bad people, Mac. We're just underachievers who have to make up for lost time.

As an independent film, it certainly has the right to its style and convictions, and while I found it a fascinating idea, I got lost in a haze of often indecipherable dialogue and Sophomoric meanderings. As he always does, Mr. Shakespeare will survive being utilized as a springboard, no matter how misguided the same play was used as a gangster film in the 1950s called Joe Macbeth, and that was rather a mess as well; a fascinating version of the play is the Orson Welles Indie version, made in 18 days on old Hollywood Western sets at Republic Studios, lit dark and made wet--it isn't all clear, but its a fascinating immersion in the genuinely dark world of the renegade Scot and his ambitious mate and its haunting images stick with the viewer. This not so much.

You could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I guess oldsters during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about movies made about the 1970s. The characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s. The only good period piece I liked was Freaks and Geeks. They cut that television show. It was exactly like things were in high school when I was there back circa 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like this. It was totally youth dominated. There were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and about the inner city of Philly. That was more the 70s that I remember as a kid. This movie was very dull and cheesy. At times, I was falling asleep. I don't know why an actor who was acting during the 70s, appeared in this one. He was probably trying to lend it some credibility. Walken didn't even show up until the second half. I guess the only true thing about the movie was the baby boomers were/are a spoiled lot. All the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. I don't know what they had against their father.

James LeGros and Maura Tierney were marvelous as the modern day rendition of the  'Macbeths'. They were more than fair. And what more could be said for Christopher Walken?The real crime here is the ridiculous attempt the weave the Shakespeare play with a plot that could have stood on its own. The soundtrack, the three witches, indeed, the title itself were great details and would have been more than enough to the allusion of Shakespeare's masterpiece. Everything else was like a cheap paint job on an old car.Had this screenplay been much, much, much, much ,much more subtle, it would have been a winner. Instead, it comes off like (oddly enough)  a 1950's era B type horror flick.Unless you're studying theater, and need to study that incredible Walken technique, skip this one and read the play instead.

However, LeGros fails utterly as the main character of the film, Walken and Tierny steal the show.   Tom Guiry makes very little impact as Duncan's eldest son.      This movie did have it's entertaining parts.  All of them center around McDuff and Pat McBeth. All the time that those two are not center stage are times when you will miss nothing.

I love how the plot and set up of the movie ties in nicely with the original Shakespeare play, MacBeth. The characters are wonderfully written and the actors are great. It's a dark comedy kinda sorta, and the movie doesn't exactly draw you into it. I've seen it a couple of times and I'm still not all clued into the plot line. I didn't read MacBeth in high school, I read Hamlet. But if you know the general plot line of MacBeth, then you know the general plot line of this movie. The movie starts out with Macbeth and his wife, Pat working in a restaurant. They're really good friends with the owner, Duncan. But Pat wants more, and so, with the gypsies, they twist MacBeth into eventually killing Mr. Duncan and his best friend, Dubencko. I love how they work in Pat's spot to plague her! It's so friggin' funny! Anyways, you'll get a good laugh out of it, if you're into laughing at dark situations. -) "},{"Title":"How do movies like this get made?","Date":"19 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  File this one in the `How do movies like this get made?' column.  A seventies-drag indie version of `Macbeth,' adapted fairly faithfully (but pointlessly) in a conventionally unconventional black-comic style.

The other actors are wasted, as is the audience's time.  Knee-jerk fans of this brand of quirk may like it, though.  4 out of 10.

Therefore,  you really have to know the source in order to appreciate what has been done. A fast  food idea (one which actually spawned a trillion dollar industry) instead of a monarchy? A  grease burn for a bloody hand? An accidental death (after ineptly planning murder) in  place of a careful plot? It all depends on what you see in the source.I don't consider `MacBeth' one of Shakespeare's better tragedies. The man had a  particular ax to grind a rude Scot had just become king, one with an unnatural fear of  the supernatural and a non-northern Catholic notion of fate. The play works at several  simultaneous levels, most barely subliminal.Yes, the trailer trash thing works. And the fast food thing works, at least for me. And they  can have their tone which mocks the original; this _is_ the age of irony after all and it  makes sense to side with the trash.But the dissonance is in the handling of the witches. MacBeth's witches were real, deeply  sexual, penetrating the blood of all the characters. They cause, not just see. The witches  in `Scotland' are something the credits call `hippies,' which I suppose is the gen-X  writer&#145;s term for stoners. These guys are comic, possessed, ordinary people. That takes  all the gas out of this for me.Want to see cool adaptations of Shakespeare? See the Ethan Hawke `Hamlet.' Absolutely  right on translation Hammy and his buddies as film students.
