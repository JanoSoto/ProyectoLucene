[{"Title":"excellent romantic drama","Date":"7 August 2001","Score":"41 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  `Bounce' is an utterly winning romantic drama, replete with an intriguing storyline, believable characters and honest emotions. Ben Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral, an arrogant hotshot advertising exec, who, in a rare moment of kindness, offers his seat on an airplane to a young writer desperate to get home to his wife and kids for the holidays.  When the man dies in a plane crash, Buddy is suddenly sent on a mission of soul-searching, trying to sort out the complex emotions he is now forced to deal with.  When drinking provides no solution, he feels himself compelled to seek out the man's widow, Abby, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and their two young boys.  Buddy keeps his connection with them a secret as he begins to fall in love with Abby and to become a part of their wounded family.In its bare-boned detailing, the plot may smack a bit of incredibility and contrivance.  But thanks to expert writing and directing by Don Ross, every detail in the film feels just right.  Take the opening scene, for instance.  Ross gives the chance encounter between the two strangers who will be forever tied together by fate the loose, casual, and offhanded quality one finds in real life.  Nothing in this film ever seems forced, least of all the romantic feelings these two hurt, vulnerable and attractive people feel for one another.  In fact, it is the complexity of the characters that helps `Bounce' to rise above the superficiality of most films in this genre.  In addition to Buddy's character-building, we see Abby trying desperately to overcome the bewildering tragedy that has befallen her, unsure of how to deal with her own feelings of loss, guilt and anger that inevitable arise from such a situation.Affleck and Paltrow bring such an air of thoughtfulness and maturity to their roles that we find ourselves genuinely caught up in their predicament and rooting them on all the way.  It's nice for a change to see a romantic film truly centered on a pair of likable grownups as opposed to the superannuated adolescents we usually find in films of this type.  Here are flawed, often weak, individuals who nevertheless contain cores of genuine goodness and innate warmheartedness.  The movie also achieves additional depth and weight in its exploration of the vagaries of fate as many of the characters examine the `what if' scenarios that haunt anyone caught up in a situation like this one.`Bounce' is well written, directed and acted.  Even those who don't normally go for love stories should definitely check it out.

In  Chicago on business, waiting at the airport for a flight back to L.A. just before Christmas, Advertising Exec/salesman Buddy Amaral (Affleck) gives his ticket to a man he's met that evening in the lounge, Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn), who's just been bumped from his flight.  A writer, in Chicago for the opening (and sadly, the closing) of one of his plays, Janello has a wife, Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), and two kids waiting for him at home, and is grateful for Buddy's apparent random act of kindness.  Far from being a benevolent gesture, however, Buddy's motives are purely self-serving, and have to do with another passenger, Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), who's also been bumped and who has been given accommodations for the night by the airline.  It seems that everything has worked out well for all concerned, until later that night, when the news breaks that the plane carrying Janello has crashed somewhere in Kansas, and that there are no survivors.  For Buddy, who should have been on that plane, it's an awakening; and for probably the first time in his life he is forced to look inward.  And he doesn't like what he finds.  His confrontation with the demons within ultimately leads him to Abby Janello, and another unexpected turn in his life.   	Director Roos has created a richly textured drama that is both captivating and credible; the story is well written (by Roos), developed with precision and expertly paced, which makes it all entirely believable.  Much more than a simple love story, it's about a man forced to confront what he sees in the mirror, and how he must cope with what he finds there; and about a young woman with two children, suddenly widowed, who must come to grips with an unsure future while dealing with such a devastating loss.  What follows is an examination of a relationship forged by fate and born of need; a fragile, precarious situation at best.  And what makes this film so good is the gradual way the relationship between Buddy and Abby is formed, neither hurried nor forced, with a couple of truly poignant moments along the way.  And it all rings true, courtesy of a great script, Roos directing and the engaging performances of the stars.  Affleck brings real depth to his character, and most importantly, a sense of true sincerity that makes him real; he illuminates Buddy's imperfections to perfection.  And Paltrow is absolutely disarming as Abby; gentle and vulnerable to a fault, winsomely charming, and beautifully played.  Also, there is a definite chemistry between Paltrow and Affleck that cannot be denied. 	The supporting cast includes Jennifer Grey (Mrs. Guererro), Joe Morton (Jim), David Paymer (Prosecution Lawyer), Alex D. Linz (Scott) and Johnny Galecki.  A touching, memorable movie, `Bounce' is a reflection on the journey of life we all must take; and it makes you realize that it's something you have to work at.  It's a film that makes you stop to reconsider choices made in the past, while recognizing that in the end, perhaps love and happiness is the bonus for doing it right.  I rate this one 9/10.

As written and directed by Don Roos, Bounce follows such a formulaic pattern that everything in it is fraudulent. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the bereaved with a certain amount of sophisticated grace, but her character is always on the verge of making a hasty exit and her dialogue smacks of too-smart little observations thick with script-writer's ink. Affleck is always on the verge of finding a character--and failing (even when he has tears welling up in his eyes, nothing Affleck says or does quite rings true). The picture doesn't exist in any kind of reality--nothing in it appears natural--with decorative city and beach settings that may very well be stock shots. The character conflicts don't balance out for us emotionally, and when Paltrow kicks Affleck out of her house in front of her two kids, she's suddenly so embittered and vindictive that we can't recover from it in time for the finale. There's also the proverbial gal-pal for Paltrow and gay assistant for Affleck who both dish out that kind of 'it-hurts-but-it's-good-for-you' advice prone to romance weepies.

However, once the basic premise happens (so-to-speak) the rest is very predictable and formulaic, including the soppy and mediocre ballads sung by current females-on-acoustic-guitar semi-poet semi-90s-philosopher pop-singer morons. It was obvious Affleck would 1) get in touch with Paltrow, 2) fall for her and vice versa, 3) not tell her immediately le big secret, 4) she'd find out, one way or another, and tell him to go away, and 5) at the end they'd continue where they originally started. So the first half is totally by-the-numbers. There is even a gay character who offers counsel, support and all that other gay stuff which all 90s gay movie characters are required to do. (If they aren't (un)funny sidekicks, then they at least have to be WISE AND GOOD.) Still, at least they let Affleck make a sarcastic comment about the gay guy's role; a bit of unexpected but ultimately insufficient irony. Paltrow is annoying, Affleck is blah &#150; so nothing new there. He is a weak actor because he is Ben in every movie he plays. Sure, Clint Eastwood is Clint in every movie he plays, and the same goes for Bronson and some others, but with a big difference those guys have charisma, i.e. we want to see Clint be Clint and so on but we don't ever want to see Ben be Ben because Ben isn't charismatic but simply a 90s Hollywood brat. (In fact, I don't want to see Ben Affleck AT ALL.) The thing I mentioned earlier, about male-female-star pairing-ups is getting downright tiresome. There is a list of male and a list of female actresses who are paired up every now and then (read far too often) for various romantic dramas or romantic comedies that are always based on clichéd scripts; movies that promise cash once the women and the girls in the audience start taking out those handkerchiefs out (usually towards the end of the movie) so that they can wet them with their tears of soap-operatic self-delusion.The men The women George Clooney Michelle Pfeiffer Bruce Willis Salma Hayek Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock Matthew MacConaughey Winona Ryder Richard Gere Gwyneth Paltrow Hugh Grant Meg Ryan Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Charlize TheronPair up any of these randomly, placing them in a movie about on-&-off love in which usually someone has a terminal illness or someone is from a different social class than the other, etc, and you can make your own 90s soap movie with very little entertainment or cinematic value. Try it. It's very, very easy. You might even get a feeling of deja-vu because some of these pairs already made films - with fascinating, brilliant results. Now you know how easy it can be to run a movie corporation.If you want to read my parody-biographies of Affleck, Paltrow, and other Hollywood dimwits, contact me by e-mail.

An adolescent in a man's body. This is his story of growth, catalyzed by one event which changes his whole idea of what is right and fair. Abby (Gweneth Paltrow) becomes his love-interest.Both Affleck and Paltrow are fine in this film. Especially Paltrow, who seems to widen her acting range with every role. Here she is totally believable as a single mother of two, trying to make it as a real estate agent. Buddy, after a year of grief and alcohol treatment, stemmimg from his guilt at putting Abby's husband on the fatal flight, performs his idea of restitution by giving her a deal and $20,000 commission on his company's new building. Fine, paid his debt, now walk away, be happy and guilt-free. No obstacles.Except -- Abby kinda likes this new guy. She comes up with ways to see him again, Dodgers tickets, delivery of keys, all of which bothers Buddy, but he cooperates. Then he meets the kids, starts to see the solidarity of this woman's existence, her bravery, all the things he doesn't have. He realizes the emptiness of his life. He starts to become attached. He has this terrible secret he thought he never would have to reveal, and now there just isn't any good time or way to do it.Enter the year-old videotape made that fateful evening at O'Hare airport, her deceased husband and her new boyfriend together, flights all delayed because of the snowstorm, his last words to her before he boarded the flight so Buddy could spend the night with the girl. Her grief, her joy, then her anger at Buddy for the deception.Although we sense very early in the movie that Buddy and Abby will end up together, this is far from a straight-line story. Both Abby and Buddy are guilty of some deceptions. There isn't one good guy and one bad guy. These sorts of things happen all the time in real-life relationships. Buddy resuses to lie in a lawsuit testimony, resigns right before he is fired, can no longer afford his beachfront house. Abby comes to realize that neither she nor Buddy are responsible for her husband's death, and regardless of how her life came to be what it is, she is a widow, and Buddy is there for her. The film ends with Buddy asking Abby to sell his house for him, as they walk towards the ocean and hold hands.The DVD extras are quite interesting. The several gags show the casual interactions of the actors. Of the deleted scenes, a particularly funny one was the picnic where the nosy neighbor insists on talking about Abby's settlement and how she should now feel free to spend more money. Abby's put-down at the end of that scene is refreshing.Two other scenes are of particular interest. The writer/director had a bit of a tough time figuring out how to end this story. Two different endings were shot at the airport, one during the day, the other at night, where Buddy looks up Abby and kids as they are flying to a new home in Portland. However, they just didn't work with test audiences, which resulted in the quickly added final scene, which to me works very well.  It leaves the future open, whether Buddy and Abby actually end up together is not important. Of importance is that they each were able to get past the crisis, and Buddy has discarded his boy-ish ways to become a man.Not for a second did my wife or I think this a sappy story. It is a very real story, very well presented in this movie. The title comes from a comment made to Abby by her friend, regarding her wisdom that after a tragedy, like loss of a spouse, you have to bounce, instead of crashing and dying. I rate this somewhere between a strong 7, or an 8, of 10.

The exceedingly predictable ending did not impair the film.Gwyneth Paltrow was stunningly good in her role as 'Abby Janelo'. She appeared as herself with natural brown hair and no makeup. Most actresses would be too vain for this. I still remember a closeup of Raquel Welch in 'One Million B.C.'. She was playing a cave woman with enough eyeliner and lip gloss to stock a cosmetics counter. Anyway, Gwyneth's look was entirely convincing for a harried single working mother.Ben Affleck did alright as the bad 'Buddy' of the film's beginning, but didn't sell me as the remorseful 'Buddy' trying to do better and hold on to 'Abby'. Ben and Gwyneth had decent chemistry together, so that aspect held up for the length of the film. Ben had slightly less chemistry with the two child actors playing 'Abby's' children. His attachment to them was never quite credible.The director deleted some great material from the film. The scene where 'Mimi' and 'Abby' view the video tape from the Chicago airport meeting of 'Greg', 'Buddy', and 'Mimi' was too powerful to lose. The scene made 'Abby's' rejection of 'Buddy' much more credible.The deleted scene where 'Buddy' meets 'Janice' in Chicago right before they both testify in the trial was profound. 'Buddy' has tried to redeem himself by helping 'Abby', but he has destroyed 'Janice' by convincing her to board 'Greg' in violation of airline rules. 'Janice' faces ruin of her whole life as a result of accommodating 'Buddy'. The scene was deleted to make 'Buddy' a more sympathetic character before the end of the movie. Jennifer Grey gave an outstanding performance here only to have it cut from the final version of the film.Still, the film gives a glimpse of the effect our choices can have on the lives of people we may well never meet. Despite the weak spots, the film held together. Perhaps a directors cut of the film with the choicest deleted scenes reinstated will be issued.

For a romantic comedy there seems to be one missing ingredient the romance of course. The chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck was sadly absent. It's too bad, really because they're two very wonderful performers and both have great experience starring in romantic comedies. It just wasn't present in Bounce. It feels forced and unnatural at times almost as though they're just reading lines off the script. But I can't hold the blame to both Paltrow and Affleck, or the screenwriters and the dialogue was executed immaculately, but the spark just never made its mark. The two setbacks for Bounce are what really hurt this movie very badly and it comes from both the characters and what the intentions of the plot. The characters tend to lack a certain panache towards its audience even though many of the characters are in perilous situations that makes them yearn for our sympathy. Affleck seems to have more of a guilty conscious over Paltrow's late husband looks diluted over sympathetic. The villainy of Affleck's character is one of the most clichéd description of how movie villains come across; manipulative, determined and ready to grab at any opportunity given to him. During his 16 years acting career, Affleck is nothing more than an thespian cliché, an evil advertising executive and a human being rotten to the core. Overall his character comes off stale a bad person that somehow manages to manipulate us into thing he's a pretty cool likable guy. His wallowing into self-pity never fully swallows you up and at times it feels very forced. Paltrow is no better either. At times you want to console with her, but it never fully catches on. Another badly drawn trait is the delivery of a fully functional plot twist. The savior of the story stems from the it could happen to anyone factor but that was already given out in the trailers making this movie virtually pointless. If they would've stuck to this intention instead of taking advantage of Paltrow's character than this movie could've made the difference. So instead they just shoved the plot device in cheaply.For those looking for a decent romantic comedy, well guess what? Keep looking! In the end it offers nothing special, heart warming or inspirational. It felt like watching one of the more mundane episodes of Maury Povich. Even the drama elements look too forced to have anything redeemable.

Writer/director Don Roos does his best screen writing with this film. He directs as if he had immense experience. Having outstanding actors, not only Gwyneth Palrow and Ben Affleck, but also supporting players, including Johnny Galecki and Natasha Henstridge cinches the film. The narrative develops slowly and naturally. The protagonists are fully round.Production values are consistently strong. I think cinematography by Robert Elswit and editing by David Codron are particularly understated and effective. Though a bit overstated for my taste, the score still sounded appropriate. It is almost an undertone. David Wasco's production design is intricate and self-effacing.Roger Ebert makes a sustainable and intelligent critique of the plot. I accept his argument to a point.

However, from the revelation of the secret to Paltrow, the movie slid - it became obvious and gooey and just strange. For example, the great sin was apparently not telling someone something (due to the fear it would hurt someone) - so after Affleck's supposedly reformed, he continues to lie to a child for the same purpose? The courtroom scene was very painful to watch - NO lawyer or judge in the world would permit a witness to simply give meandering testimony of his entirely irrelevant (to the trial) thoughts on a crash. This was just bizarre - the courtroom microphone used as a diary. (And would the trial of a suit brought at that point by a couple of families really be live on national television? In fact, if in Federal court - which was likely - it wouldn't be on television at all).The very end is trite and the characters far too referential. I do wish it were given a less Hollywood end.Paltrow really shines - I'm not generally a big fan (but don't know why). I almost always think what a wonderful actress she is when I have seen her in things. Affleck is fine, credible.

Somehow, the emotional range needed in this film to depict a man torn apart by guilt but also falling in love with the victim of his good intentions, is beyond his talent.  The chemistry between these actors is essential to a believable story but it is sorely absent.  The connection between the two characters does not happen.  Somehow, we are expected to swallow that the normally charming, go-getter Affleck is attracted to the dowdy, self-doubting Paltrow.A disappointing film, that could have been so much better with a different male lead actor.

Affleck's a handsome and competent actor, but really, has he ever had chemistry with anyone other than Matt Damon? (Okay, maybe a little with Joey Lauren Adams, but she's so fiery she'd combust with a fire hydrant.) In any case, the Affleck and Paltrow characters are both attractive, intelligent, and kind-hearted, and they make a wholly credible couple. Sure I wish they were Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, but they're not, and I can live with that.Given the big-secret plot hook, the story's fairly credible, with the exception of an extremely unlikely ad campaign and a mishandled televised-courtroom sequence. (Why is it that filmmakers, who are literally in bed with advertising and tv people -- who ARE ad and tv people -- can never seem to get those professions right?)From a technical angle, Bounce is generally competent (not that the story provides much of a challenge in that department), although it does have one odd continuity problem In a couple of unrelated beach-condo scenes (that were obviously filmed at the same time), Paltrow's hair and eyebrows are a different (and more glamourous) style and color than they are in surrounding scenes. This wouldn't matter so much if Paltrow's brown-and-bushy-browed mousiness weren't such a key aspect of her characterization, but it is, and on a film with this budget someone should have noticed.Still, there's infinitely worse garbage on cable these days (most of which feature muthaf**ker as a term of endearment).

Upon meeting Greg's wife Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), he falls in love with her, but keeps the switch a secret.  To no one's surprise, the secret comes out and Abby doesn't take it well.  This is standard romantic fare, boy meets girl; they fall madly in love and seem perfect for one another; a big blowup drives a wedge between them; he tries to win her back.The plot uses a variation on the device used in `Random Hearts' where Harrison Ford's wife dies in a plane crash and he seeks out the wife of the man she was sitting next to, ultimately falling in love with her.  Though somewhat contrived, it is an interesting device, however the two films arrived on the market too closely in time for it to be a coincidence.This film tries to do too much.  Writer/Director Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex) doesn't seem quite sure whether this is a serious drama or a lighthearted romantic comedy and he keeps flitting back and forth incongruously.  Buddy is an alcoholic with intimacy problems, a cavalier attitude and a gigantic guilt complex.  He is far too flawed to be believable in this relationship and Ben Affleck's devil-may-care demeanor on screen is a mismatch for the tortured soul he is portraying.  Roos has trouble keeping the film on course making unnecessary plot digressions that bog the film down in spots.Gwyneth Paltrow is terrific in the romantic scenes, but she is overly melodramatic in the serious scenes.  Oddly, although Affleck and Paltrow dated for a while, they don't seem to have very good chemistry onscreen (perhaps that's why they broke up).This is a fair story with good actors who are cast poorly, and a director who meanders too much.

I, too, was uncomfortable that maybe Affleck was dropping the ball in those emotion scenes, but for me, it bounced right back into his hands and I found that I really felt for Buddy, genuinely intrigued by his character.

His guilt is only compounded when he finds himself falling for the woman whom he believes he's caused such pain -- let alone the shame he feels for lying to her about the fact he ever met Greg in the first place.

Affleck, who won his Oscar for writing, gives the best performance yet in his young career.  His former flame Paltrow (the two had already broken-up by the time they made the movie -- or so they claim) did win her Oscar for acting but, ironically, she is less stellar as the suffering Abby.

He's a recovering alcoholic in no small part because of this connection.It's really no more than a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl kind of story but it's immensely entertaining. This is because Roos earns your confidence he unfolds the story. We like everyone who comes into the path of the camera. Roos isn't the most innovative director ever, but the man is one of the best writers working today. He earns your confidence by not writing stupid lines and by writing characters that are so real you never doubt their existence. Scenes don't seem designed to serve a certain function, to propel a story. They glide. They're just people talking. A movie can't be good without people an audience can care about.

It's OK really, he'll have a great career in Bay-style summer monsters. He's got the wise ass down, the smirk, the looks, but he better not try to scare any bad guys in those films - he is an incredible lightweight. Bounce works because Paltrow is fantastic. Again. Not because she's cute or hot but because she can act, she can play real. Affleck doesn't ruin the film because he's playing a wise ass, smirking, good looking guy - but watch out when the role calls for him to be real - didn't they have an onion anywhere on the lot to help him cry? Those scenes were painful. Acting is, apparently, not like tennis - when you act with someone better you don't get better. Bounce is a good little film - credit Roos and Paltrow for carrying this thing and making Affleck an irrelevance - the guy is an empty suit.

This movie is *not* about the love story.  It's not about the plane crash.  It's not about Affleck and Paltrow.  In large, this movie is about adjustment, guilt, and learning to live with one's decisions.I'll admit that initially I was let down that the makers of this film didn't produce a plane crash scene (for a really intense plane crash scene, see Final Destination) -- that is, until I realized that the point of this movie is *not* about physical realities (plane crash, problems drinking, losing a husband, none of these are spoilers), but rather what happens when a lifetime of selfish decisions (even when they may seem selfless) bears down upon you, and you realize you have to completely rethink the context of your life.This isn't one of the *best* films of the year, but it's certainly not one of the worst.  Johnny Galecki as Seth (Affleck's assistant) is played with a heavy hand but is still hysterical, maybe because it's played with a heavy hand.  Gwyneth Paltrow puts in her typical good but somewhat, well, typical Emma/Sliding Doors/insert-film-here performance.  Ben Affleck won't be winning any Oscars for this film (nobody will, I am betting), but he's a better actor than most people will give him credit for, and plays his character (along with some of its subtleties) quite nicely.2.5/5 stars.  A good matinee movie with a few very funny moments, a few decent tear-jerker scenes, but a bit predictable, if you're in it for the story.

I don't blame you, because I too think they make a great movie couple, but lets just hope that the next movie can be much, much better then this frail attempt.The story is not unlike that emotional turkey of a movie starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas which failed even worse. All of this leaves the viewer dealing with the emotional wreck of having to live on without a loved one that perished in a horrible plane crash.Do viewers go to these movies just to see the devastation of what a air-related crash could be like? If so, then that is very unfortunate when there are movies of much more praise that never can seem to get made because they lack shock factor.Roos handles this plane crash much better then the audience no doubt anticipated. A simple loud noise with Tony Goldwyn's eyes opening wide for a split second. Somehow I wish the movie could have sustained this same panache or handling.Paltrow starts of showing the dramatic flowing side of here that makes her the brilliant star that she is. Affleck seems to be playing the same character he does in all of his movies, but he, if any can get away with it. He is now of the star power that can simply walk on to a movie set and get into character with little problem.Paltrow even shows a knack for great humor with the I'm 10 days off the gum schtick and it leaves you hoping for more, unfortunately this movie sems to lose it's audience at the editors table.The movie is well connected to it's various facts that happen throughout the movie, but it jumps or bounces through it's story line. Could this have been Roos quest? If it was, he bounced the movie into an oblivious emotional mess which leaves the movie afficiando hoping for another run of Paltrow's humor and great looks.Sadly it doesn't come and in the end the real hero of the movie is Affleck's assistant who seems to be the only person who really has a clue to whatever anyone is feeling.

It's as if the writer and the director were made uncomfortable by the subject matter, and made a choice, early on, to lighten its impact on the viewer - throughout. To supplement the thin script, Paltrow's character bites her lip often in order to signal her suffering, and Affleck - a high-powered ad exec - is provided with little to say - or do.

Yet far from the usual Meg Ryan Hollywood romance, `Bounce' strives to be a darker challenging story of loss, characters with a secret that can destroy them at any moment and an ending that mercifully spares us from sap. Roos once again addresses the pressure society puts on people to be in a relationship &#150; this time against the backdrop of real tragedy. He doesn't quite know what to do visually as the movie is static and sometimes slow or awkwardly paced. But the flaws are made up by an investment in our two leads and a heart that the movie clearly wears on it&#145;s sleeve. And whatever he doesn't get out of his characters Roos gets from the effectively heart-tugging soundtrack. Ben Affleck and Gweneth Paltrow are miscast in a lazy, stock actors-of-the-moment sort of way. It seems like they did this movie just because it was swept up in a net at a time when they were doing just about every movie released. Like the days of the studio system where actors were loaned out to films based on popularity, regardless of how they fit in the rolls. Affleck and Paltrow find their way into solid performances, but it's their mere presence in this movie that makes it seem like the youth-oriented Hollywood romance that Roos looks to be avoiding here.

So Ben is handsome in that movie and Gwyneth not blonde. I would prefer to watch the characters in a movie, not the actors. In fact, I was already hooked by the credible and real-to-life (-and-death) performance until I realized it is Paltrow. This may be the film's problem all the actors, including the children, give shockingly real and believable performances. No indestructible super-heroes boringly dodge strings of bullets while outracing scores of patrol cars (or a nuclear blast) in a sluggish street vehicle. Apparently, this is not what makes the longest line at the box office.Those who have gone through comparable traumas will recognize the honesty of the acting. This points to sensible directing from Don Roos. Affleck plays Buddy Amaral, an extremely arrogant, vain and blunt guy who seems to believe that while it's generally bad to lie, it's OK for him because he's so great. His feeling of guilt for not having been on the plane that crashed (what appears to have puzzled the other reviewer but is nonetheless a well-known problem for disaster survivors) seems to confuse and annoy him.Amazingly, the film does not need explanations, it's through subtleties that you come to know the characters. You see reactions in their faces and you expect them to talk about it, because that's what you get in other movies. The thing is, you're not sure if the other character gets it and you wish they would communicate better.At one point there is expressis verbis, where most people (speaking for myself here) probably would not be able to feel the troubling dichotomy that is going on inside the widow until she tells her mother.This may not be the best romance and I would not have put it in that category. The tagline is prone to have you expect a lighter kind of film. It's a very touching, at times disturbing, at times consoling, drama with outstanding performances that prove to me that both Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow have not been required to give their best in some other movies.

In the way Ben looked at Gwyn alone could tell you where the feelings were coming from.  I am liking Affleck more and more.  From REINDEER GAMES and now in PEARL HARBOR, he maintains a continuous stream of good acting credits.  And, of course, Paltrow continues to put out good work in almost all that she does.

However, where `Return to Me' was sweet and frothy, `Bounce' is fairly cold and heavy, at least as released by Miramax.  This is unfortunate, because the deleted scenes are generally MUCH better than what made it into the final cut.  Certainly, `Bounce' is a much more REALISTIC film than `Return to Me'.  However, here `realistic' doesn't equate to `better'.   Much of the time the movie just lays there, despite exceptionally fine performances by Gwenyth Paltrow and Johnny Galecki (Buddy's gay assistant).

Wasted supporting work by Joe Morton and Natasha Henstridge. Jennifer Grey even becomes desperate enough to get sucked into this, and it is even worse than her overrated Dirty Dancing.

While the plot is not as refreshing or exciting as an action or a sci-fi flick, characterization and attentiveness to detail well made up for the somewhat mundane plot. Bounce is supposed to be a movie about an ordinary couple falling in love, it is supposed to be about everyday life, it is supposed to be an accurate portrayal of what the reality and possibilities are in our life. For those who found the movie boring and unoriginal, think about it! Isn't our everyday life somewhat predictable? Isn't our everyday life somewhat bland? Aren't we witnessing some of the shadows of our own lives at some point during the movie? While the movie is somewhat predictable, it also raises questions and thoughts about our own lives, about the choices we make, and most importantly about the role fate plays in our lives. Another important reason that has led me to enjoy Bounce was the great performances by its two leading actors, Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow. Through their dialogues, their gestures and their affectionate regards for each other, love between the two characters is easily conveyed. While I have always regarded Paltrow as a great talent, this is certainly one of Affleck's better performances (probably his best) I have seen. Finally, my final thought. Unlike the most romances or rather, romantic comedies we usually get nowadays, Bounce is a true romance. Although it has a few lighthearted, witty moments, it is also very moving and touching. It is a great romance, nothing else, just romance. Pure romance. "},{"Title":"Fate.

Instead, his relationship with Paltrow's character is the source of conflict (but during it all, you're left wondering just _when_ he'll turn to the bottle).This film is nothing if not subtle; the gay alcoholic, employed during Affleck's tenure in rehab, could have easily been overdone, but is presented in a restrained manner that's yet another refreshing change from the usual in your face style of the wisecracking, if minor, supporting role. Ignoring the boss's orders and putting through the forbidden phone call, an act that gels the character for the viewer and furthers the plot in an important fashion are a nice touch two mild rebels, lightly butting heads. These sorts of light touches abound in the latter part of the movie. The oldest boy's concerns over his father's death and his motivations for trading seats are well handled. (In fact, the child acting in this movie is a cut above. There's not a lot of it, but it's damn good.)Bounce is a traditional character study, I think.

There are directors who can get the best of performances even from mediocre actors and those examples can be found in films by, say, Scorsese (remember Sharon Stone in Casino)... but not so here. In Bounce the director gets the worst out of his actors.But what surprised me the most was that Roeper and Ebert gave this film two thumbs up! What were they watching (or smoking)?

Not the one where I live. Not the one where anybody I know lives.Some planet where people don't feel guilty for getting married and divorced five times, for abusing drags and cheating on their spouses, but they imagine feeling guilty and blaming others for something totally out of their control. A planet where the whole courtroom can be turned into an AAA meeting and the long repentance speech is broadcast on TV. A planet where a skirt-chaser, about as deep as a puddle in your backyard, demonstrates a very quick and profound understanding of a child's psychology (better than I, a mother of two, would do in his place). And lots of other equally improbable things happen.But this movie is not only absolutely unbelievable. The lack of chemistry in it is pretty amazing, considering Affleck and Paltrow's history. Some actor (can't remember who, sorry) said that creation of chemistry on screen is totally in the hands of the director. I would agree, plus I would hold the scriptwriter accountable as well. Here is what Ian McKellen said when asked how he achieves to portray the profound wisdom and humanity of his character' `I long ago learnt, particularly when acting Shakespeare, that sometimes it is enough to speak the lines without too much interference of interpretation. The innate qualities of the characters in a good script can be conveyed in the words themselves. Turn it around and you get this when the script is stupid, all the actors can do is deliver their stupid lines with the best skill they possess.And what is the actor's skill? In my humble opinion it's the ability to become someone else, plus some technicalities. OK, plenty of technicalities. In the end if you are not capable of becoming a person you are portraying, all that remains is the technicalities. I'd say Paltrow gets into her character's skin every time it's humanly possible. When her character starts behaving like an alien from planet Hollywood, she still demonstrates her technical abilities. Can't say the same about Affleck. Or may be I just don't like his face when he's crying. Or may be his character always behaves like an alien.And let me add in the end when there is no chemistry in the romance, kissing scenes are literally painful to watch.

Buddy feels guilty because the man who replaced him on the plane died and he didn't, and because he has fallen in love with the man's wife. The man's widow feels guilty because she wonders if a part of her wasn't glad that her husband died on the plane instead of Buddy.

The cold, lifeless reading of the script by it's main characters doesn't do anything to help it at all, and had it not been for some life out of members of the supporting cast, I likely would have walked out.The storyline consists of a self-centered, arrogant ad exec (Affleck) who becomes marooned at O'Hare Airport during a snowstorm.  While tossing a few back at the airport lounge, he meets Mimi (Natasha Henstridge) who's trying to get back to Dallas after a business trip, and a quiet television writer named Greg Janello (Tony Goldwin), who's on his way back to LA after bombing with his first play.In a sudden burst of kindness, (more centered on sleeping with Mimi than actual kindness) Buddy (Affleck) gives Greg his first class ticket on flight 82 so that Greg can get home to his family that much sooner.  The flight crashes and Buddy is faced with the feeling that he dodged a bullet but somehow contributed to Greg's death.  This spirals down into the predictable bout of alcoholism and rehab at a posh Palm Springs clinic.  Once out, Buddy decides to look up Greg's widow, Abby (Paltrow), to make amends for his guilt.From there, it only gets worse, as Buddy falls in love with Abby and he deals with her demons and her children (excellently played by Alex D. Linz and David Dorfman), but never telling her about the reason he's actually around.Ben Affleck looks like he's sleepwalking through the role of Buddy, never even attempting to add any feeling or heart to Buddy.  Maybe that was the point initally, but once he tracks down Abby at least a courtesy effort should have been made to show remorse or emotion at all.  Affleck has an annoying habit of playing to the level of his material, and since this script was junk, so was his performance.Gwenyth Paltrow is equally dull as Abby, as she clearly seems to be wishing some other leading man was Buddy, as opposed to ex-boyfriend Affleck.  This woman is easily the most overrated actress in Hollywood, neither glamourous or talented, and finally shows it here with the eternally frumpy hairstyles and cold complexion.  Her emotional breakdown over the loss of her husband is laughable.Johnny Galecki (Roseanne) plays Seth, Buddy's new assistant.  A recovering alcoholic himself, they truly get off on the wrong foot in the men's room, but eventually end up smoothing over their testy relationship towards the end.  An enjoyable character and should have been given more screen time, perhaps mentoring Buddy's AA progress.Another good secondary character was Natasha Henstridge's Mimi.  Not a lot of depth, but she seemed to believe in her role and gave the feeling of an old friend that you've known for years.  She figures in the way this one ends up, and you're actually surprised it doesn't happen sooner in this snore-fest.Bounce is neither romantic nor dramatic, just two of Hollywood's overhyped wunderkinds trying to show us how they think they can be the next legendary screen couple.  Do us all a favor, give it up.

His talent deserves better ... let's hope his judgement in roles is sound.  Advice to Ben play a villain real soon!  My tidbit on this one is that Tony Goldwyn (Greg Janello) and Alex Linz (Scott Janello) play father and son in Bounce and were the voices of the adult and young Tarzan in Disney's 1999 animated feature.  Best scenes in this one involve Johnny Galecki of Roseanne fame as the wise, wise-cracker.  Also, check out Natasha Henstridge from Species as Mimi, in a small, but critical role.

Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow make a good couple in this film. Affleck plays a guy who wants to console those he hurt (he is a recovering alcoholic who is troubled with a mistake he made a year or so earlier), and so, he finds Paltrow, and even thought he just has to do this one thing and walk away, the inevitable happens.  Cute film with your date.  Not a great Don Roos film though (like Opposite of Sex), but if you like the two stars, your in luck.

The airplane falls down, as airplanes are wont to do, and the man is killed. A dried-out Affleck feels compelled to look up the man's widow, Gwyneth Paltrow, and tell her the story. Instead, he falls for her and holds back his secret. It's understandable that he finds her desirable. She's Gwyneth Paltrow as a brunette. When the big reveal finally rolls around there is heartbreak to spare.I almost feel I ought to apologize for not liking the movie. It's like not liking a child's finger painting. See that dendritic structure? That's Junior's tree. The long part at the bottom is the trunk. You can tell because it's brown. And that green ball at the top? The leaves.What sex is to pornography, what blood is to action movies, emotional highs followed by crashes followed by highs are to this higher-budget afternoon domestic drama.Here's some dialog. You can either say good-bye and leave now, or you can leave without saying good-bye, sobs Paltrow through her tears.The fact that Affleck gave the other fellow his own ticket is treated as a shameful act. Affleck is made to keep it a secret as long as is consistent with a full-length feature movie. When he vomits out the terrible truth, he hems and haws and acts as if he, Affleck, had personally strangled the guy in order to get at the wife he hasn't yet met.It's not insulting in that it doesn't propagate some fantastic notion like wiping out everyone we dislike or having unprotected sex with a Nigerian prostitute. It's just ultimately boring, like pornography and action movies. However, it must be said that movies about sex or gore have their fans, and this one probably will find an audience too, but I wouldn't be among them. I have this tendency to drift off.

By some reasons, I could not escape lateral watching. Sweet (in fact, too sweet) drama. My wife got almost crying. But for me one question stands unanswered What happened to Janice Guerrero - long long sentence, number of millions claim .? Here is a real drama. As a lawyer, I would consider Buddy IS guilty (not for the crash, surely, but for breaking the regulations), at least in moral terms, since he put girl to do that. Better way for Bounce-2 is to show Buddy investigating Janice's fate.

I hopedthat movie was nothing more than a bad dream, a nightmare thatalthough excruciatingly painful, would be over in a short time and Iwould have no memory of it whatsoever.Unfortunately, it wasn't a bad dream. It was real, and I left themovie scarred for life. After seeing that movie, I was dumber as Ihad lost half of my brain cells from watching that senseless pieceof junk that they dare call a movie.I don't think I've ever seen a more predictable movie in my entirelifetime. You can always tell what's going to happen next, from thebeginning to the end. It's all so pre-fabricated and clichéd, it's noteven funny. The characters are shallow, the storyline boring, and itall drags on for what may have been just over 2 hours, but felt like2 days as I heard nothing but nonsense and saw nothing but whatI could only deem blatant superficiality in motion.I don't know what the makers were thinking when they made thismovie. A better question is why they waste their money makingtrash like this. I guess we'll never know.

I'm sorry, but I agree. I eagerly anticipated seeing Bounce for several months, and the final result was it was dull, talky, and schmaltzy, especially in the last 20 minutes or so.Not that there weren't good points. Gwyneth Paltrow adds another type of role onto her resume, and does a very fine job. Not only in downplaying her looks (brown hair, ratty jeans and well-worn shirts) but her acting, especially at the beginning, was right on the money. It's only after that she gets involved with Affleck that the character loses her credibility somewhat. Props to Tony Goldwyn, who is such an underrated actor. Goldwyn absolutely shines in his all-too-brief role as Paltrow's doomed husband. He really comes across beautifully as a true family man. This coming from a man I remember most as the creep who plotted Patrick Swayze's demise in Ghost.The bad points? The miscasting of Ben Affleck. He can play the smarmy jerk wonderfully, but the dramatic/romantic/fuzzy stuff seems out of his league. I think Jude Law (who played opposite Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley) would've been a much better choice for the role, but oh well. And Johnny Galecki put in a good show, but must we have another gay stereotype role? Please!In short, this movie was the biggest disappointment that I've seen this year, but not worst film (that honor would go to Hanging Up). I'll just have to hope that Paltrow's next film, Possession, will be a lot better.

Grief stricken Buddy hits the bottleAs you can guess Buddy is an intense role to play . It takes a certain type of moody , fervent actor to pull of this role so what idiot thought it'd be a good idea to give the role of Buddy to Ben Affleck ! That's right Ben Affleck an actor who has spent the last couple of years appearing in shampoo commercials which is probably Affleck's level . Someone who's an alcoholic should be at war with themselves , trying to get a grip on their demons but for some reason the leading man thinks an alkie is someone who's suffering from severe constipation while tripping over their feet , a sort of Norman Wisdom on speed . You'd think any actor who found this type of part beyond them ( yes Ben this is way beyond you ) would have done something obvious like drink a half bottle of vodka on set to give a convincing performance of a drunken waster but it obviously never occurred to Affleck Have I mentioned I didn't like Affleck's performance ? Good because in a film like this its success or failure rests entirely on the leading man's performance and no matter how interesting or involving or how well written the romantic aspects of the story are if there's not enough grief or self conflict shown by the male star then the film won't work and BOUNCE fails for this one reason "},{"Title":"Jerry McGuire meets Return to Me","Date":"30 May 2001","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Spoilers herein.What's interesting about this is Gwyneth. It is the only thing that's interesting, but it is. She's trying on acting styles. Here, she's quite different than in `Shakespeare,' different than in `Emma,' even than in `Doors.'This is the Emily Watson phase. Watch her act as if she was acting open. Watch her work her mouth like Emily's. Little eyebats.She's turning into something to watch. Not for how well she fills characters, but in what actress's manner she does. "}]
