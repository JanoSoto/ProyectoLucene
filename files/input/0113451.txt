[{"Title":"Underrated, but still not one of Friedkin's best...","Date":"22 November 2004","Score":"37 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" To say Friedkin's career has had its ups and downs is an understatement, his eighties filmography inarguably has enough bombs to sink a oil tanker. Yet eschewing their performances at the box office, many of his films yearn to be rediscovered, from Cruising to Deal of the Century to Rampage. Let's not kid ourselves, Jade is not a great film, and this is the fault of one man and one man alone - Joe Esterhas. If trash had a messiah, it would be him. For a fleeting moment in the nineties, Esterhas was paid by the bucketload to write formulaic movies for guys, and the erotic thriller has him to thank for its continuing lugubrious existence. Jade is interesting however, it is an erotic thriller without the erotic part. While Paul Verhoeven filled Basic Instinct chock full of the sleaze he had become renowned for, Friedkin's films are notable for primarily dealing with male characters, and are subsequently about as erotic as as a bowl of cereal. Jade is not about sex; it is about sexual jealousy. The talent of Linda Fiorentino cannot be underestimated here, giving depth to a part that amounts to no more than a typical male fantasy - part good girl, part whore - that's right, it's Crimes of Passion without Anthony Perkins and his bag of dildos. The leads are well cast and all give adequate performances, and Friedkin throws in all his usual directorial touches (subliminal images and, you guessed it, yet another bloody car chase). Jade is an enjoyable film, with delightfully silly twists and over-the-top violence (come on, you know you want to see Angie Everhart get run over again), and is given some class from it's cast and director, but, in the end, proves itself to be a guilty pleasure that makes one feel more guilt than pleasure.

It is really an entertaining movie and I am not sure why it is getting such poor ratings here.  It is not perfect and may have a few plot holes, but it is definitely worth seeing.  There must be an anti-Caruso IMDB splinter cell operating in cyberspace and conspiring to drop the IMDB user rating for all his movies about 2 to 3 points.  Check it out and see what you think.  Linda Fiorentino is truly hot and well cast as the steamy babe.  Caruso's performance is very believable.  Richard Crenna is underrated and good here too.  Angie Everhart and Donna Murphy are pleasing to look at and also give good performances in smaller roles.

It's not just another Basic Instinct, either. Chaz and Linda are the consummate couple. V-e-r-y classy. The set decorations are fantastic. I absolutely vote Linda the quintessential queen of soft porn (or was it hard--I haven't yet seen the uncut version). Was it Linda or was it Memorex? Whoever it was, her legs are fabulous!  Angie Everhart's sultry soliloquy describing her passion for LF (Trina) was like butter melting on a hot lobster. I found myself replaying that scene over and over just to capture the full essence of the moment. The hit-and-run scene was extremely graphic, (wow,what a stunt!) except to Friedkin fans who expect a certain amount of gratuitous violence.  The final scene with CP and LF was perfect. I could feel the sexual tension jump out from the screen. The beautifully haunting song, Mystic Dream, by Loreena McKennitt fit the dark mood perfectly.  I still don't know why I love this movie; to borrow a line from the film, it must be hysterical blindness. Go see this movie with a date, and have a great time together afterwards!

It never hurts to have low expectations, but I was quite pleasantly surprised and have watched it a few more times since then.No, the plot isn't especially tight nor the story original, and it can be hard to follow at some points, but it's still an exciting, kinky, disturbing ride nonetheless. I think the main reason I enjoyed it was the actors involved - Caruso and Palminteri were both very skilled (and surprisingly sexy - I hadn't found either to be that way in any roles I had seen them in previously, including NYPD Blue). And most of all Fiorentino smokes up the screen whenever she's on it. Sensual, damaged, brilliant. She's amazing when given a good script like the Last Seduction, but even with a flawed effort such as Jade, she still sets the house on fire. The cinematography and art direction were the other thing that made this film. I loved the lavish sets and especially the eerie lighting during the final scene. And as far as the comparisons to Basic Instinct, I see it as being about equal, suffering from the opposite problems as Jade; while the story was far more interesting the acting was pendantic at best. But maybe that's just my personal bias; I find Michael Douglas pompous and annoying and Sharon Stone shallow and vain.

This film is great, obviously written before Showgirls was released (when the screenwriter's ego was still intact.) Between Joe's deliriously entertaining B-movie dialogue and Friedkin's rock-solid direction, I find this movie fascinating and fun, the only downpoint being the lackluster ending. Jade has the greatest car chase I've seen in any film since the last time this director tackled one, and it's full of cute little references to the rest of his career. There is even a blatant homage to Cruising (Al Pacino) for those of you who were really paying attention. When David Caruso takes those cufflinks out of the drawer and looks in the mirror as we fade to the beach skyline...shot for shot and beat for beat it's the last two shots of Cruising, and it even conveys a similar meaning. This movie is clever, raunchy, sexy and fun. It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly deserves a lot more credit than it is receiving here. When did film lovers become such humorless prudes? (And why did Friedkin insist that the DVD be released only in a fullscreen version? Why, why, why???)

There is the appearance of some sex acts on the screen presented in a couple voyeuristic contexts, but I think the target was a much deeper appeal a whole world driven by insatiable, conventionally deviant female sex drive. The writer had previously cashed in with this idea and Hollywood chose to try again but with a real director. This formula isn't just about sex, its about turning the noir mechanics on its head. Noir depends on an outside fate that arbitrarily throws strangers together in situations that are designed for and controlled by the values of watching, outside the world of the action.Here, everyone knows each other beforehand. There are essentially no strangers. The driving force is supernatural as in noir, but it is rooted in and owned by the people we see. Its simple sexual desire, lust.The story is ordinary, the sex unconvincingly simulated. Even the automotive stunts are limp. There's some craft in how it is put together visually though, enough to keep me engaged.But there is one remarkable feature. The score is hypnotizing. It is bicameral, both halves based on prototypical themes. The male theme lustful, uncontrollable and apt to be violent is from (almost directly) Stravinski's Rite of Spring. Its wildly erotic, threatening, dangerous. The female side (until the end that is) is a Celtic anthem, soft, passive, receptive, drifting.I do not ever recall something so directly cast, so borrowed and yet so effective. I saw this close to a film (Duel at Diablo) where the score was literally canned bits from old movies and the dialog all dubbed). This part is fun, and much more tantalizingly erotic than what you will see.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

My impression is of a that'll do, let's get it in the can attitude towards the script, the direction and the lack luster air of some of the cast. The video cassette I have says on the packagingAn Erotic Thriller. There is quite a lot of what could be called sex in this movie, but the last thing it has is eroticism. I bought my copy from the special offers rack at a local store, reduced 70% from retail. There is a hung jury on whether or not I wasted my money!Two of the leading players, David Caruso David Corelli and Linda Fiorentino Trina Gavin look uncomfortable in every scene they do. When David Caruso left east coast cop TV to make movies in Hollywood I imagine this by the numbers effort wasn't the sort of thing he had in mind. Linda Fiorentino has made better appearances too. I prefer to remember her in The Last Seduction and Body Count. Body Count also provides an opportunity to see David Caruso doing much better work.Perhaps fortunately, Chazz Palminteri and Richard Crenna seem completely at home with their roles of Matt Gavin and  Lew Edwards respectively. The MG characterization is well done. Chazz Palminteri's interpretation, with its calculated cordiality and sinister edge, makes a decent job of unexceptional material. LE is Governor of California. Richard Crenna gives him just the right amount of ruthless deviousness to be entirely believable as a career politician.Other things about Jade are worth a mention - at least they interest me, anyway! The set dressing of the rich man's house has been done in impressive style by people who clearly know how to create visual atmosphere. Some of the soundtrack music is also better than routine. The closing credits are accompanied by an excellent, haunting vocal, The Mystic Dream, performed by Loreena McKennitt. At least I think that's the lady's name, the credit is fuzzy on my tape.Being few and far between, the good bits don't save the movie.

Jade opens with the camera moving through interior of a rich guy's opulent mansion. He's dead in an upstairs bedroom where his S&M equipment is located, along with his collection of exotic weapons, one of which has been used to kill him. Who could have done such a horrible deed? We know right away that the dead rich guy was a morally corrupt creep and probably got what he deserved, but the detective character, who is really an assistant district attorney (Caruso), has to investigate. Right away I didn't care much who did it. That's a bad sign in a mystery. Now there's this woman, who's not only a psychiatrist but a prostitute, and a major psychopath Jade (Fiorintino). She's married to the ADAs best friend, a rich defense attorney (Palminteri) and the ADA used to be in love with her. Neither knows that at night she goes out to a high-class whore house in Pacifica and sells her angular body to fulfill the twisted fantasies of rich, powerful, morally corrupt old men. The plot doesn't so much thicken as curdle. The governor of the State of California (Crenna) is involved, and he's the most morally corrupt of all. Little more than a meaty Mafia boss or tinpot dictator, he orders hits and hurls threats. He should have a cigar to chew. And of course he too is a patron of the notorious Jade. He's obviously responsible for several murders but, as others have pointed out, is never brought to justice.This plot doesn't make any sense. Jade, the psychopathic psychiatrist, is a cypher, we never get a sense of motive or emotion or even of emotional injury. She's as cold as dry ice. Caruso seems to want to save her, but really, didn't she bring it all on herself? And she is one of the most unlikable, and most un-sexy femme fatales ever to flounce on the silver screen. She obviously hates having sex with her husband, but he wants her even more when he finds out she's rotten. This stylish thriller is just too stylish for its own good. It's all surface. The characters are shallow and unlikable, the plot makes no sense, the chase scenes are well done but contribute nothing to the story. If you like a glitzy surface you might like Jade but otherwise, forget it.

Why I can't get a widescreen DVD of this, I don't know, but all that seems to be available is full screen.William Friedkin directed this which usually means (1) a riveting story; (2) stylish cinematography. That's the case here. I rate this movie so high mainly because it's so entertaining. And it doesn't overstay it's welcome at a short hour-and-a- half.There are some stunning action scenes with cars hitting people, cars hitting cars and a long, wild car chase through a parade in San Francisco's Chinatown.My only complaint is the normal Liberal in-your-face bias that Hollywood always seems to show. They just can't help giving you their pro-Democrat, anti- Catholic, anti-authority bias. Early scenes provide some cheap shots on Nixon and Reagan and later we see the film's two male starts talking irreverently in church. The governor is a sleaze in the story and the cops are corrupt. I've just come to except these modern-day film clichés and not let it interfere with my enjoyment of the film.Speaking of actors and characters, David Caruso and Chazz Palminteri are the two male leads I referred to in the previous paragraph. They are both good. Why Caruso didn't make it in the movies must have been due to the roles he took, not his acting. Linda Fiorentino does what she does best - plays a whore. There isn't a moral person in here, at least with the lead actors. That's no surprise since sleaze king Joe Eszterhas wrote the script. Nonetheless, those three actors are very good with Caruso, as the cop, the best. It's a crude story at times (there was a NC-version available of this, as well), but it's very interesting start-to-finish, has some memorable scenes, nice San Francisco scenery and a nice soundtrack from Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt.

It's also starkly realist, because what can be more real than a failed Hollywood flop on sex, money and power. You don't see people doing realistic actions, but you see people acting, directing badly, writing scripts badly. The epitome of decadence.

The difference is here the punch line is a combination of visuals, spoken words, and emotions packaged with a dark tragic twist, while in The Usual Suspects the final punch line was a combination of visuals and black comedy that provided the viewer entertainment. It is definitely not the usual Hollywood script.While most critics seemed to throw brickbats at Friedkin and Eszterhas, a superior supporting performance by Donna Murphy as the investigating policewoman Karen Heller seem to have escaped attention of most viewers. She stood out in a film where performances were not exactly remarkable. Ms Murphy has immense talent and I hope some good director notices her potential.Director Friedkin delivers what he is good at--car chases (French Connection) and outdoor shots. Nothing more. Screenplay writer Eszterhas, more sinned against than sinning, actually develops an interesting script with a steady stream of visual clues and interesting statements on psychology that unfortunately does not build up sufficient tempo to take off thanks to poor editing, direction, and last but not least uninspired acting by the lead characters. The script looks untidy and disjointed because of the lackluster editing and direction. Eszterhas' script may not be topnotch but definitely was not the reason for the end product--I blame the director for not being able to lift up the film to a higher plane. Friedkin has extracted great performances from Gene Hackman in the past, but in this film save for Donna Murphy he seems to have inspired none else in the cast. The cinematography of Andrzej Bartkowiak always impresses and the murder sequence in the crowded streets with the car was worthy of note of his talent.The film can provide you enjoyment, if you attentively view the film.

It was in these scenes, recovered from an almost destroyed video tape, that showed Tria's real connection to Medford and it wasn't ,like she said, a casual one. In fact Trina was hooking for Medford in getting him people high up in government, and business, to be blackmailed by him.***SPOILERS*** In the end it was no surprise to anyone watching, except Corelli and the SFPD, who in fact did old man Medford in since the evidence was there before his body turned room temperature.

However, when you watch both and ponder upon the true messages behind each film, then you start to realize they really aren't too similar outside the obvious similarities.The performances in Jade do indeed make it worth watching. I think people were expecting a little more from the movie, because David Caruso was one of the hottest stars on TV at the time of the movie. When he said he was leaving NYPD Blue to pursue a film career, I believe some were disappointed that this wasn't a movie that would just blow you away.Not that Jade doesn't have its moments. One of the more surprising aspects of the movie, were the car scenes. Being set in San Francisco, it is of course obligatory for a film to have at least one scene which involves a car chase in some context. This film has two car scenes. One scene involves the brakes going out in Caruso's car. The one that is an actual car chase, is a very exciting scene - with some very good filmmaking showing quick decision making by the character.If there is one place that Jade doesn't deliver the goods it is in the ending (and that's not a good place to not deliver the goods).

The film does have an impressive pedigree, having been directed by William Friedkin, and starring Chazz Palminteri, Linda Fiorentino as well as a pre-CSI Miami David Caruso. All of the actors do a serviceable job, but they have to deliver some of the hammiest dialogue I've ever heard. The script is devoid of any real surprises or thrills, and so it relies on an over-insistent score. It's like it's shouting Look at me! Take me seriously!, except it's impossible to take anything in this movie seriously. The most impressive part of the movie is the intro (before the score has become overbearing), which features some creepy music and surrealistic camera-work. It's too bad that they overuse the style throughout the film, though. Another bright spot was a well-filmed (but ridiculous) car chase through San Francisco, but it wears out its welcome once they hit Chinatown and the movie almost literally comes to a halt. So, there's also some issues with pacing, particularly in that sequence. However, the biggest problem with this movie is the script, penned by Joe Eszterhaz (who also wrote BASIC INSTINCT and SHOWGIRLS). Not only is the story relatively unengaging, but it's rather misogynistic towards its female characters, and the voyeuristic camera-work doesn't help in that regard either. At best, it's a rather bland erotic thriller with some decent performances, but it could be worth a late-night watch if you're into this sort of thing.

He shows the usual skill with car chase scenes, but doesn't make this story coherent.***** Jade (10/13/95) William Friedkin ~ David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna "},{"Title":"Derivative, but gorgeous and entertaining","Date":"24 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Ignoring a plot line that is recycled, a climax that is a bit shaky with a twist that is strangely predictable, I'd say Jade could pass for an entertaining neo-noir. Starting with a delicious title sequence, the movie is stepped mostly in style. Something about it recalls Brian de Palma. Within the frame, it is staged quite theatrically, and it works. Jade maintains enough coherency to keep us involved, and director William Friedkin avoids overselling the sex factor (which was the mistake Paul Verhoeven made when adapting Joe Eszterhas' previous script, Basic Instinct, and also Showgirls). It is definitely worth noting that Jade is exceptionally well shot. Everything looks rich and elaborate, including a car chase sequence that feels like a roller coaster ride. Based on the appropriate lens choice and camera angles, cars appear to leap into mid air when driving over San Franscso's many street bumps. The film is also well scored, even though it borrows a bit much from Igor Stravinski's Rite of Spring. The only thing I wasn't too comfortable with was the story. It is derivative and cheesy, but even at that, it could've been worse. When all is said and done, Jade (even with its problems) has enough to sell to make it worth a ninety minute time investment for noir fans.

It's packed with a lot of interesting things, and it never sets off. It's not boring at all, yet it just sits there, neutral to me.David Caruso doesn't stand out at all, but the absolutely stunningly beautiful Linda Fiorentino, who gave the performance of a lifetime in The Last Seduction, gives a different but still very secretive and naturally elusive character. I like her character because she's seen objectively by the writer, the way her type of personality is always seen. Rarely does anyone truly come to know someone like her. Fiorentino very deeply projects her very inward character. Chazz Palminteri matches her as a very extroverted fireball of cockiness. This is all well and good, but they are carrying a movie smaller than them.One of Friedkin's car chases is a panicky ride down the hill of a San Francisco street in a car with a severed brake line. This falls short of any action sequence Friedkin has ever done in the twenty years he'd been working before this film. It's filmed wrong. It's not exciting the way it should be. The second car chase of the film, wherein Caruso is desperately tailing a mysterious and murderous black car, is a very stressful little set piece, and keeps the audience's attention better than it was before.You see, I think where the problem lies is in the writing. Joe Eszterhas's Jade is a mystery about a brutal murder, blackmail of a threatening senator, a circle of long-time friendship between the cop, a lawyer, and the lawyer's wife, a Japanese symbol, and how everyone has more to hide. Where does everything really tie in? Yes, the story leaves no real loose ends, but why doesn't it feel like it's come together tightly? Jade has no true focus on any of the themes just listed.

I bought this movie because it features Linda Fiorentino's infamous sex scenes. I watched it and to my surprise, I truly enjoyed it. Not only for the sex scenes but for the plot and great acting. Fiorentino demonstrates once again that she's a good actress that does not need to appear nude in order to get movie roles. She's a fine actress. On the other hand, the sex scenes are great just because of her. So it may be a difficult dilemma for her whether still making nude scenes or being taking seriously. Anyways, it seems that she has retired from the business.The movie is a tale of betrayal, passion, and corruption. This may be the kind of B-movie featuring detectives, and a seductress. But Jade is more of a Thriller with brains and lots of action.The car chase scene is truly great and is one of the most memorable moments of the movie.

That friend, Trina(the sexy Linda Fiorentino), is married to his old buddy, Matt(Chazz Palminteri)..a high powered attorney everyone fears. What makes matters worse are that things begin piling up against here..the most damning evidence being a videotape , nearly destroyed in a fire, containing her doing the nasty with another man. The pot is stirred as always because Eszerthas can not resist implicating high-society types and their varying degrees of immorality. The governor of California(Richard Crenna)finds his hands muddied when the investigators find photographs of him in bed with a hooker, Patrice(Angie Everhart). David finds he has a difficult path to tread as the governor threatens him, his important witnesses who can identify this particular woman named Jade as a woman sleeping with various men at a beach-house owned by the deceased Medford are being murdered, and the thought of his friend's wife(..a woman he had a relationship with before and still secretly loves)being a vicious killer..they all stockpile against him as he gets closer to the truth. This film, as directed by workman-like Friedkin, is very beautiful to look at, but like many films by the screenplay writer it is sordid and cold. There's a marvelous car chase as David tries to catch this black thunderbird that has killed Patrice. In an epic moment, both cars drive through a Chinatown Buddhist celebration. You have several shady characters who might be possible suspects, but if you have seen the work of one actor in particular, the twist at the end can be seen much earlier on. I feel Friedkin should've used a different actor to play the real killer, but can see why this person was cast..there's an animal in him that is often showcased in other films that needs to be driven home in this movie. I, for one, like the casting of Caruso as the hero of the film for he brings this intensity and intelligence to the character. He has that kind of trustworthy and likable face that makes us root for him as he races against many elements to find a killer. The film is layered with sex and deprivation as one should expect, and I didn't feel the ending holds up to the solid establishing scenes early on. Perhaps the film is too heavy on plot devices and not strong enough on plausibility. So many people are shown as corrupt lowlifes, that the only one we can trust is David(..well most of his team of investigators). Perhaps that is what the filmmakers wished to accomplish..that typicality of noirish film. I believe the film runs out of steam and I just couldn't buy how the killer does his deed and get away with it. Though the car chase is amazing, it's hard to believe anyone could survive such a maddening ordeal.   <div class=yn id=ynd_1457315>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_1457315_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_1457315_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div> <small>2 out of 4 people found the following review useful</small> <a href=/user/ur0418846/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NDEyMjYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3MDk0OQ@@._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>An erotic thriller using Hysterical Blindness as its supposition.</h2>  Author <a href=/user/ur0418846/>roller-7</a> <small>from USA</small> <small>18 August 1999</small>  "},{"Title":"An erotic thriller using Hysterical Blindness as its supposition.","Date":"18 August 1999","Score":"13 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":""},{"Title":"Didn't Joe Eszterhas Write A Similar Script ?","Date":"4 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":""},{"Title":"Guilty-pleasure time!","Date":"30 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":""}{"Title":"Extreme sexual politics at play","Date":"15 March 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Jade is a self-mocking film, insofar as it references its sister film, Basic Instinct the dangerous female protagonist, the setting of San Francisco, the glib pseudo psychology, even the dialogue. Yet even if you never saw Basic Instinct, it still stands as a tense, radical and erotic thriller.It builds the world of the characters with such power and confidence that you believe everything, despite the implausible, overblown and familiar plot. There is also a lot of self-deprecating humour in the use of stereotypes &#x96; the corrupt governor, the voyeur-next-door, the cheating husband &#x96; that you start enjoying the game rather than judging it.The film has one of the best car chase sequences ever, through the vertiginous streets of San Francisco, via a fiercely colourful Chinese parade &#x96; complete with rippling dragons and laughing buddhas &#x96; to the seedy docks. The black Ford Thunderbird takes on a malevolent persona of its own &#x96; with a blood-soaked eye, opaque windows and a shark-black body, it becomes a chilling assassin.Controversial writer Joe Estherhaz created a new cinematic anti-heroine in the 90s, with Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) in Basic Instinct and Trina Gavin (Linda Fiorentino) in Jade powerful and beautiful women exploring the extremes of their sexuality, to the sharpest point of violence, brutality and even death.It says more about the power dynamics between men and women than the sex itself, which is what many critics missed. They are played against craven, weak and ineffectual male characters. While the sex scenes titillate with S&M themes and lesbian fantasies, there are also squirmy and subconscious castration fears behind every frame.

Caruso is so cool as the D.A., and watch him when he gets behind the wheel, when seeing him in two riveting scenes. A powerful political figure, who has a lot of dirt on people, is murdered quite gruesomely in this Basic instinctish, no surprise penned by the same guy, who must be the envy of budding or established screen writers. One of the suspects, is a old flame of Caruso's (Fiorentino-sexy as hell in lingerie) who unfortunately ended up marrying his more successful lawyer friend, (Chazz, can't spell his last name) and Caruso shows his hidden envy well. So we got a love triangle, to complicate matters. More suspects surface, mostly political ones, as the more obsessed Caruso, delves deeper into this investigation, thus, more killings ensue, linked to the illustrious faceless hottie, nicknamed Jade. He so wants to clear Fiorentino, it may kill him. Jade rides high on style, that I so much appreciated, with powerful performances by all, and a tight script, a puzzle if you will, you'd like to dissect, again open ended like Instinct, followed by a shock admittance, but may'be it's the sleazy elements, over the top/sick if stylish violence, and some unsavoury characters that bring it down. It is great too, to see warring D.A., Biehn and Caruso, go at each other, plus have a veteran kinky cop, as Caruso's sidekick. I can't find myself to rate it higher than the score I've given it, although deep down, as a fan of Eszterhas's writing, (I love every movie I've seen, that he's written) Jade is a guilty pleasure. I write my reviews on quality. Big difference me liking them, as I like this one a lot. I mean, it even makes pussy hair look stylish. A cut scene, prior to it's last, in another version I saw, kind of put a rain on my parade, as far as Caruso's intentions were concerned.

In this kind of movie, sometimes he turns out to be the real killer, whilst in other times, it is someone we'd never expect. Trina had everything to be the murderer out there; I strongly thought so when she said ask that girl if I'm jade, since I believed she already knew that girl was dead and was playing fool. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have tension scenes to develop a remarkable movie, being too light most of the time. In the last scenes we have a distinct reference to 1980's The Shining, whether William Friedkin admits it or not.

Both have scripts by Joe Eszterhas &#x96; and it's much the same script. That is to say the basic formula is much the same. Both Basic Instinct and Jade feature women who have a dark side, which they can barely control. Much pseudo psychological claptrap is woven through both films. The telling difference is in the direction. Paul Veerhoven's Basic Instinct had a fluid style, which combined with a seductive Jerry Goldsmith score gave it surprising depth. Friedkin was less successful in disguising the thinness of the material. The movie begins with the murder of a well-known art collector, Kyle Medford. District attorney, David Corelli, played by David Caruso, is called to the crime scene. Kyle Medford has been hacked to death with an antique hatchet and crucified to a wall. This is rage, says Corelli as he inspects the corpse.David Caruso incorporates a great deal of body language into his roles. In fact, he often contorts his posture to the point where he almost seems to be trying out for the part of Richard III. The mannerisms he brought to full flower as Horatio Caine in CSI Miami, can be seen in the developmental stage in Jade including the loose stance with hands on the hips, the head slightly cocked or turned to the side indicating deep thought, and the Caruso specialty &#x96; the slow boil with his words delivered in measured tones as he struggles to control his emotions.As the story unfolds, it appears that Kyle Medford filmed prominent citizens in compromising situations and kept the pictures. Corelli discovers that these men, including the governor, all wanted a woman called Jade. As far as the governor is concerned, Jade really rocked his world.Pictures found at Medford's beach house show Trina Gavin, played by Linda Fiorentino, having sex with a man. Trina Gavin is a leading clinical psychologist. In her free time, instead of occupying herself with golf or yoga, Trina engages in acrobatic, sexual encounters with middle-aged men &#x96; she is the mysterious Jade. Corelli is troubled by these revelations as he has had a previous relationship with Trina before she married his friend, Matt Gavin played by Chazz Palmintiri.Like currents in a pudding, car chases and sex scenes are studded throughout the story. Unfortunately these take the place of a more considered plot, adding to the feeling of predictability. William Friedkin, famous for the car chase in The French Connection, tries hard to elevate the various chase scenes in Jade but there is little novelty left in shattered windscreens, rolling hubcaps and cars bouncing down familiar San Francisco streets.After a couple more murders, a couple more car chases and a couple more couplings, the reason for the crimes are revealed &#x96; although much else is left unexplained. James Horner's score incorporates passages from Stavinksy's Rites of Spring, and although it does not reach the brilliance of Goldsmith's work, the music does give the film a certain moodiness.The modern Noir style is not easy to pull off. When it does, it probes deep into human vanity and failings. Unfortunately, Jade merely skates over the surface of such intentions and disappears out of sight.

Actually a far better comparison is EYES WIDE SHUT -- this is sort of an early, very very pulpy version of that classic.The movie suffers greatly from narrative incoherence. The blame has to fall on Eszterhas. The ultimate bad guy is obvious from the beginning, which means that after the end you'll be wondering If Caruso knows what he obviously knew, why did he do x, y, and z? All of the ethnic trappings look cool but seem to have no other purpose. The car chase was great -- I kind of liked the fact that it slows down halfway through, it's at least different -- but it feels like it was inserted in. Nobody talks about it much afterwords, in plot terms it's like it never happened.Also the script has Eszterhas's typical crudities. They clang like an out of tune church bell; Eszterhas never had a good ear for dialog. Plus they're just embarrassing, pitched at about the level of a 12 year old.Still, there's a lot of interesting things going on here. This is an anti-erotic thriller I saw the unrated version and I assure you, there's nothing especially sexy here. Again, comparisons with EYES WIDE SHUT seem apt this is more about objectification of women, about sex as not-so-sublimated expressions of power relationships, about misogyny, about the perversions of the rich, about the ways the wealthy can get away with just about anything. The acting is reasonably good throughout Palminterri is a good bully, Richard Crenna is another good bully (there's an implication that Palminterri is on the path to becoming Crenna), Caruso is alternately righteous, sympathetically vulnerable, and (interestingly) passive-aggressive. Fiorentino is especially fine -- it's quite clear here voyage of sexual liberation has ended only in making her more miserable, more lacking in choices, more victimized.I would call it an interesting failure. It's worth a look, especially if you're interested in these sorts of themes.doug "},{"Title":"It begins with Mystics Dream haunting theme","Date":"14 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  As I see it Jade with her Hysterical Blindness to her other self, was to her a way to get to be like her husband, but not in the course of Events that take place.

Even the best ones have several minutes of anti-climax when the audience has figured out the solution but the filmmakers haven't revealed it yet. Eszterhas avoided this pitfall creatively, by1. Having the explanation to the original murder be completely illogical. (If it was done by a guy, how did he get the other guy - his wife's lover - to voluntarily get in that S&M contraption). So did he offer a false confession for some reason?2. Offering no explanation for some of the other murders. No potential murderer knew where Angie Everhart would be. How could they be there to run her over? Was Caruso in on the whole thing? He knew where she would be? Did Caruso chase himself by driving both cars? Obviously not, but what?3. Confusing everyone with unrelated and irrelevant scenes with minor characters. Chazz Palmentieri has a meeting with some anonymous client. Why do we see this? Near the end, Fiorentino has a fairly long sex scene with an uncredited extra.

Joe Esztherhas may have been well paid during his time in the limelight of the early-mid 90's and had some successes as a writer, but for all of his erotically-charged bizarre flourishes, there was always the air of hackwork in his script, but here the hack comes to roost. This has scintillating plot details and twists - especially, and ludicrously, in the final fifteen minutes where it piles up to ludicrous heights - and not really much soul at all.Oh sure, there are characters, and they want things and feel betrayals and go about the motions of the script, and there's some dirty sex here and there (mostly caught on grainy voyeuristic radio), but I don't know if I really gave a dam about most of the main characters. The actors are probably trying to, especially David Caruso as he mostly tries to underplay what could have been scenery-chewing times for another actor. But they also are kind of prisoners of a screenplay that is just... I don't know, except that while some of the dialog isn't terrible, some of it is. Some of it made me cringe, and some of it had me laughing.So why the high rating? Why recommend it even partially? Because Friedkin is still at the helm, and he has fun here. And in ways I wasn't quite expecting. Sometimes he'll just mess with the actors on set - there's a cat that appears in the hallway of where the cops walk around, and I can be pretty sure that wasn't a detail outlined in the script (and it's a fine detail to throw in there). And there is a car chase - roll eyes, again, from Friedkin, can't he do that in his sleep - and it's STILL unique to his world. This time he has some kind of perverse enjoyment with a) having just over-the-top car stunts as cars fly through the air practically on San Fransisco streets, and then going 2 miles an hour in a Chinatown parade where the citizens attack both the predator and prey!

This was the nineties, a decade of excess, style and of course, trying to be as controversial as possible. So why shouldn't Friedkin jump on the boat.Watching it sixteen years on, and the film is still pretty stylish and has very good production values, it's a shame that the film was crucified by the critics and public alike in initial release, because it has some really good set pieces, and probably one of the best car chases ever committed to film.There are a few plot holes here and there, and yes, the directors cut, ties up a few loose ends, but with the performances alone, and the grand scale of it all, Jade is a film worth watching, even if you know the killer at the end is going to be someone silly and rich.

One example is when Caruso's character shows the governor a group of pictures and never asks for the name of the woman in the pictures. Another is the unrealistic and unbelievably slow motion car chase scene to, through and beyond Chinatown. Another example is the idea of multiple murderers each killing for different reasons. Ultimately no one is punished for any of the deaths. In fairness to Caruso his performance is CSI Miami 7 years early. Regardless, this is a very poorly thought out and presented movie.

She's still one of the prettiest women in Hollywood and I sure would like to see her a little more often. But if you ask me if there are any other reasons why you certainly shouldn't miss this movie, than I'm afraid that I'll not be able to give you a decent answer...The movie's story is about a brutal murder on an important millionaire in San Francisco. When the assistant district attorney investigates the mysterious death, he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his, who is married to an important lawyer. While he has to suppress his personal feelings in order not to lose sight on the reality, he will have to entangle a close knitted web of blackmail, prostitution and intrigue...I can easily understand why so many people are disappointed by this movie. It uses about every possible cliché that you can come up with bizarre murder weapons, blackmail, adultery, criminals in high places, kinky sex, hidden cameras, a chase scene, nudity, knives, guns... And normally I would have a lot of problems with that as well, but in this case I already knew what to expect. I'm not saying that this means that it all a sudden became a good movie, but knowing what to expect certainly made it a bit easier for me not to be too annoyed by it.But even when I try to forget about these flaws, I can never forget about the fact that the acting isn't exactly, to put it nicely, spectacular. But than again, what else can you expect from a cast that has only two more or less known names in it. Most of the actors have played some minor roles in other productions, but they have never been able to make name in Hollywood and there is a good reason for they aren't worth much... David Caruso didn't do a bad job and Linda Fiorentino was nice to watch, but that isn't enough to save this movie. I give it a 6/10, probably only because of Fiorentino.

Friedkin had a marvelous time in the 1970s, coming up with some original genre pieces like The Exorcist and The French Connection. All of his work is commercial but Exorcist was gripping because it was so successfully manipulative, and French Connection gave us a cop who was unexpectedly mean and embedded his character in a fascinating mystery story.Here, though, there's not much originality on display. There's nothing wrong with the direction or the performances. (I think this is the second movie in which Linda Fiorentino makes a phone call in the nude. Rather a nice touch.) Friedman makes good use of San Francisco locations but some of the scenes do come through as derivative. The first chase through one of the city's Oriental theaters that I can remember is in Orson Welles' Lady From Shanghai. There is also a car chase up and down the city's streets. It will never match the car chase in Bullett but in order to make the scene look new the director has these two cars not only racing downhill and being jolted at the intersections on the way down. They actually leave the pavement entirely and rocket into the air. And the chase extends through a parade in Chinatown, a scene in which a couple of pedestrians get flattened. Something similar appeared in a movie directed about 20 years ago by Peter Bogdanovich. Friedkin does open his film with an excellent exploration of a well-appointed house in the city. The camera takes its time examining the tribal masks, the Degas on the wall, while the less outrageous excerpts from Stravinksy's Rites of Spring serve as background. (We gradually become aware that someone is being murdered off screen.) It's well done.There's a good deal of realistic gore too, and about the same amount of sex involving Fiorentino. Evidently she likes to dominate the man, tying his hands behind his back and making him do things that only rabid subordinates would do. Her expression during ordinary love making suggests it's more of a nuisance than a pleasure. And we see one murder that has produced about a bathtub's worth of blood and another in which the victim's brains are exposed. I'd better quit now. Old memories are being redintegrated and I can't tell whether they're from a traffic accident, my marriage, or both. But basically the problem is with the script. Instead of a murderer, there turn out to be several murderers, none closely related to the others. A lot of surprises pop out at us in the last few minutes, complicated and with little in the way of groundwork. Some questions are left unanswered. I still don't know who Caruso was chasing through Chinatown. Nobody involved in the film seems to have cared enough to polish this into a more acceptable shape. Too bad.

His digs at Paul Verhoeven about various aspects of the way in which Basic Instinct was made are just an absolute joke, and it is no wonder that Verhoeven has vowed never to work with Eszterhas again. Given that this film came out around the same time as Showgirls, I still wonder why people are so surprised that it more or less killed David Caruso's career. The only reasons why Basic Instinct is as tolerable as it is are because Eszterhas kept his ego and his misogyny somewhat under wraps, and the direction of Paul Verhoeven, who had already done a much better version of that story in the form of De Vierde Man. Without the first of these elements, Showgirls was unsalvageable (you have to wonder how can a writer this obsessed with sex hate women that much). But without both elements, Sliver and Jade somehow managed to make most X-rated porn films look like works of art.I thought the point of a sex thriller was to entertain by teasing the sexual appetite of the audience. The poorly simulated and blatantly phobic sex scenes of Jade just made me yawn and pity Eszterhas for having to go through life with such an obvious fear of a beautiful, healthy part of life. It makes me wonder if he was molested or otherwise mistreated by a member of the Catholic clergy as a child.Then there's the rest of the so-called mystery of this film. I don't know about you, but one of the criteria I have for a good mystery thriller is that I wind up caring about the mystery and the person trying to unravel it. David Caruso's character seemed more suited to a career as a pimp or porn film director, because he certainly didn't seem to give a damn about the case he was working on or who was affected by it. And even the Mad Max films had better-simulated car chase scenes than that! Did they make a special effort to make this part of the film as boring as possible?I really feel sorry for David Caruso after having seen him in this film. I really thought he had potential after seeing him in NYPD Blue, especially considering his ability to not be overshadowed completely by Dennis Franz. Were I in Caruso's shoes, I'd be bringing a lawsuit against my agent and Eszterhas.

I think Joe Eszetheras got out his first draft of Basic Instinct and gave this to the producers and they loved it.  They probably did what all execs do that think they have taken a proven formula and try to use it again.  They laugh and think that they can use it again and people will eat it up.  The only problem is, William Friedkin is not Paul Verhoeven, Linda Fiorentino is not Sharon Stone, David Caruso is not Michael Douglas and Jade is a very bad clone of Basic Instinct.  But there are so many familiar similarities in these two films that it makes you cringe watching them.  Fiorantino is a psychiatrist, so was Stone.  Caruso is a cop, so was Douglas.  Caruso drove a Mustang, so did Douglas.  They both take place in San Francisco so that they can have a car chase over lots of hills and almost destroy both cars in the process.  There are lots of underground sexual practises in both films.  And they both try to be sexy.  And both open with a violent murder of a very improtant figure.  I honestly can't believe that the producers would buy this and then spend 50 million on it with a B cast.  I'm not one of those people that thinks that Caruso is a bad actor, but I certainly don't think that he is big enough from a TV show to open a film, and if I, as a casual film fan can figure that out for myself, then why can't powerful movie executives?  It just makes no sense to me.  Caruso has charisma and he is quite good in this role, but he should be happy sticking to supporting roles.  He just doesn't have a name to kickstart a film.  As for the director, when was was the last time that he made anything that was good?  I honestly believe that he got lucky when he made The Exorcist although I do think that The French Connection was pretty good.  But that was 20 years ago.  Maybe he has lost his touch. Jade is boring, uninteresting, slow and laughable.  You want to figure out who the killer is?  You should really have two guesses.  Find out who has the biggest names in the film and consider how much screen time they have.  One has two scenes and the other is in it quite a bit but just hangs around in the background.  Of course there is the surprise ending that will just shock you as much as Sixth Sense ( yeah right!!!!!!!!)  Jade is a really bad film and it is not worth your time.  It is laughable and silly and the only thing that I kinda of enjoyed was when I realized that Caruso and Crenna were once in a film together 13 years before this one.  That was First Blood.  It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.  Back then Crenna had more of a name, after all he was Trautman.  Caruso was just Mitch.  Now Caruso is trying to make a name for himself with this film again.  I don't think it will work.  Other than that small piece of trivia, there is nothing to like abou this film.

With Basic Instinct, the writing was refreshingly provocative and powerful, it was the film that became the guilty pleasure of the 90s. Jade, however, feels regurgitated and does not excite the audience as often as it was designed to. The script is laughable and makes it very hard to believe anything that's going on.Jade does however, have good aspects. William Friedkin is a great director and makes up for Eszterhas's poor writing with the stylish direction which made him famous with The Exorcist and French Connection. Friedkin excels at building up suspense and whilst Jade is not the best film in the world, it certainly has the audience biting their nails at some points throughout.Linda Fiorentino also puts in a tremendous effort to raise the standard of the film. She comes across as sexy, yet vulnerable and is the only character in the film worth caring about. She makes up for the poor script with her facial expressions and her great on screen presence. David Caruso, on the other hand, is not so good. His acting is wooden and completely lacking in any form of charisma. His movie career was almost over after this film and it only takes a few observations of this performance to see why. Chazz Palminteri, who is a good actor, is disappointing in Jade. He reads his lines without much conviction and simply, does not perform to his usual standard. Michael Biehn's character is not developed enough and not on screen enough to affect the film but, once again, Biehn puts on a great performance as a thoroughly dislikeable police detective. Like Fiorentino, Biehn makes up for bad dialogue with his physical acting and upstages Caruso every time they share the screen.The car chase scene starts off fantastically in pure Friedkin style but is then halted to an almost standstill by a Mardi Gras festival. It is frustrating for the audience to get geared up for an adrenaline rush, only to have to sit through five minutes of glorified following. At least the furore of colour attracts slight attention.The final fight scene where everything is revealed is an exceptional scene by any standards. The tension build up is fantastic and the low lighting level ensures everything is a mystery until Friedkin says so. The fight is also very well done. The actors involved are all at their most intense during this scene and the sense of desperation is overwhelming.William Friedkin and the cast could not save this film from mediocrity. Whilst better than Sliver and Showgirls (not too difficult!), Joe Eszterhas produced a poor screen play which provided an uphill struggle for everyone else involved.

The script is the usual Eszterhaus nonsense about a woman with kinky sex habits and possible homicidal tendencies, but for once Eszterhaus, having had a lot of practice at this sort of thing, finally pulls it off with a modicum of skill.  Had the public not overdosed on his formula in its infancy, and had Jade not followed Eszterhaus's even more reviled Showgirls into theaters by a mere month, David Caruso's big screen career might have had a future. More importantly, Fiorentino might now be the movies' reigning sex symbol instead of a rarely seen Sharon Stone also-ran.
