[{"Title":"Charming little film with Sidney Poitier as an itinerant handyman in rural Arizona.","Date":"26 November 1999","Score":"45 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This charming, black and white film testifies to the power of faith.  Five nuns who escaped over the Wall from East Germany are trying to start a new life in rural Arizona.  Mother Superior (played by Lilia Skala) believes that Homer Smith (played by Sidney Poitier) has been sent by God to build a chapel.  Smith demurs.  He is a Baptist who isn't really religious.  He would rather eat a big breakfast at Juan's (played by Stanley Adams) cafe than go to church behind the makeshift altar on Father Murphy's (played by Dan Frazer) pickup truck.  The father describes religion graphically for Smith.  Welcome to the Poor Man's Vatican, he says as he ushers Smith into his small trailer home.  You take confession, provide absolution, bless the babies, hook up the trailer, kick the tires and pray. . .pray that the old car holds together to the next stop.Faith permeates this film and it is catching.  Mother Superior shows her faith in Smith as she introduces him to Mr. Ashton, a big local contractor. Ashton was played by Director Ralph Nelson and is one of the more engaging characters in the film.  Interestingly, it is Ashton's skepticism about Smith's ability to the job that persuades Smith to stay.  Mother Superior's faith ultimately is transmitted to the local Hispanic community and even Mr. Ashton.  Cafe owner Juan puts the issue very much in perspective when he says that his work on the chapel is about insurance.  He doesn't really believe in God, he says, but just in case there is a hereafter he wants to be prepared.The characterizations in this film are wonderful and deep.  There is a strain of stubbornness in both Mother Superior and Homer Smith.  It is a miracle they are able to work together.  Indeed, Smith leaves the unfinished chapel behind for several weeks at one point.  Why don't you say thank you to me, he asks the Mother Superior.  You couldn't help yourself, she says.Homer Smith isn't quite sure of himself.  He is very uncomfortable in the role that Mother Superior sees for him.  Later, when he returns to work on the chapel he stubbornly refuses the help of the locals.  He sees himself as the one chosen to build the chapel.  Mother Superior chides him as does Juan.  Where would you like us to bury you?, he asks.  Ultimately, the locals take over the project with disastrous results.  Homer steps in and directs the work to its completion.Homer's disappearance in the middle of the film is a mystery.  He has a problem with being the chosen one and drives away in his station wagon. When he returns the door on the passenger side is now wired shut.  He is also dressed in an obviously loud Hawaiian shirt.  His unusual dress is topped off by dark glasses.  It is like he has returned from a two-week drunk.  When he goes to have his big breakfast in the cafe, he wants very little to eat.Juan is one of my favorite characters in this film.  I liked Juan's homespun philosophy.  The scene in which Homer eats the big breakfast at the beginning of the film is very good.  The two characters are very much alike. Both came from religious families, but neither are religious. Ultimately, they are both empowered by faith.Like Juan, Mr. Ashton is also a businessman.  He too is enriched by the building of the chapel.  He delivers a load of bricks for the chapel. When the Mother Superior calls out to him, he remarks that he should have sent them anonymously.  On the way out he complains to Homer Smith that she won't let him alone now.  Such is the price of faith.Although it doesn't really go anywhere, this film has the look and feel of a road movie.  The film begins with Homer Smith's car on a lonely road. Also, there are the images of the nuns trekking down the miles of empty gravel road to Sunday morning services.  Father Murphy uses the road to go from one country club to another on his circuit.  The blessing of the chapel is that it will be a focal point for the community.  Father Murphy's church won't be on the road any longer.  But Homer Smith must go.  Mr. Ashton offers him a good job as a foreman, but he declines.  He is a modern day tumbleweed going where the wind blows or, more accurately, where the road goes.There is a racial edge to this film.  Smith is black, and the nuns are white.  Juan and the members of the community are Hispanic.  Father Murphy is white.  Ultimately, all of these people come together to build the chapel.  One point in the film where race becomes overt is when Homer Smith meets Mr. Ashton.  Hey boy, he says to Smith.  Smith quickly turns the tables on Ashton and calls him boy.  That seems to bridge the divide between them.  In the end it is Ashton who offers Smith a position of foreman.  In another scene Smith compares Mother Superior to Hitler. Later, Mother Superior returns the compliment.  Ultimately, both are able to go beyond their stubbornness and work together.This movie captures for me the special spirit of rural communities.  I never grow tired of watching it.

Not 'greatest', not 'best', but something better... an utterly flawless film.  It's lean and spare, set in the desert and filmed in B&W.  Both the humor and the drama are low-key, but are all the more moving for that, presented without clutter.  It uses a small cast to create a rich diversity of characters from different religions, races, and cultures.  But these differences aren't what creates the drama, they are simply a wonderful part of the background texture.  The conflict lies purely in the clash of personalities between two good people, Homer Smith (Sidney Poitier) and Mother Maria (Lilia Skala), both with their own personal flaws and virtues.I really can't begin to describe how much I like Lilies of the Field.  It could have been one of those awful preachy 'message' films, but it isn't.  It is purely fine story telling.  Which isn't to say you can't find meaning in it.  Far from it.  For me, I've always been taken by how the common human goodness of all the characters is brought out without being dependent on, or sacrificing, their many differences of religion or culture.  They remain the same people at the end of the movie as at the beginning, except they're all a bit better, a bit less flawed.  And that's pretty close to perfection.

It's simply a nice story nothing super, but a feel-good film to use the clich√©. This reminded of the kind of movie you would more likely see in the 1940s with the emphasis on human interest with a religious theme to it. I expected Father Flanagan to show up any minute.Instead, we got a good Baptist man played by Sidney Poitier, who won an Oscar for this performance. Since he's just about the whole movie, and does a great job start-to-finish, who can argue with his award? This certainly doesn't have the feel of a 1960s film. It must have been one of the last of its kind, giving credence to Christianity and having a nice tone throughout. There have been very few like this since then.Poitier is really the only name member of this cast and he's in every scene. If you enjoy his acting, and a good performance in general with a story that will bring some smiles to your face for an hour-and-a-half, this is recommended.

Poitier's portrayal of itinerant builder Homer Smith rings true throughout, a man living life on his own terms...yet still a humane and involved individual.This film has everything that brings good humor to a movie. The classic fish out of water premise, amicable cross-cultural confusion, joyous music...but it is much, much more than a mere comedy; much more than a simple drama.This film was made in the thick of the civil rights movement. A black man in close juxtaposition to a group of white nuns was an eyebrow raiser in the 60's, as was the overall multicultural setting. White, black, Mexican, Anglo, German, Hispanic - all are tossed together with such a deft hand that the occasional nod to the prevailing racist attitudes of the time is almost brushed aside as the film skillfully makes its point. The emphasis here is on people doing as people should do...working and living together, helping one another and learning and growing from the experience.Perhaps this is the time for any of us who has seen this film to see it again, and ask ourselves how the lessons of Lilies of the Field can be applied to the recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, and the relief of all the human misery that has resulted.

Sidney Poitier (in an excellent Oscar-winning performance) stars as an unemployed handyman whose car breaks down in New Mexico. He is greeted by a group of German nuns led by Lilia Skala (Oscar-nominated). The nuns are in desperate need of a church and it just seems that Poitier is not going to be able to shake Skala and the various duties she imposes on him. A really great film that works due to Poitier more than anything else. He carried what could have been a disappointing production into cinematic history.

He intends to stay only briefly, but ends up building most of the chapel for them. Naturally, both sides are a bit unfamiliar with the other side Homer has to explain to the nuns his life as a black man in America, and the nuns have to explain to Homer their mission in life.As always, Sidney Poitier does a splendid job as a man forcing people to look into their own prejudices. In fact, his character is someone still looking for his path in life. Maybe some people might say that Poitier was essentially playing the same character that he always played, but we have to remember that this was a total break from the Stepin Fetchit mold that had dominated the image of black people for so long, so movies like Lilies of the Field were pretty important. Poitier's Oscar win for this movie was well-deserved.

A perfect 10.Lilies of the Field was written as a short novel by William E. Barrett. Others have described the story well, so I will concentrate on the author. His works, small in number, were masterfully crafted inspirational tales of faith.  Lilies of the Field seems to be timeless because its simple message of faith is timeless, and the story is simply told.  That is why it works so well -- Barrett is a brilliant author and a master of the telling of belief in God.  He manages this without being preachy.(potential spoiler)  By contrast, Barrett's other work, The Left Hand of God, is infinitely more complex in its story line -- crammed with tension and suspense, the very title gives a glimpse of its irony contained within. Its premise is based on a blasphemous assumption of someone else's identity by the main character.  And yet, in the end -- as with Lilies of the Field -- it is simple faith that wins out.When these works are translated to the screen, Lilies of the Field remains largely true to Barrett's book.  This is unfortunately NOT the case with Left Hand of God.  Forget that the great Bogart is the male lead.  Forget that it also contains the worthy Gene Tierney, Agnes Moorehead, Lee J Cobb, E G Marshall.  These stars cannot overcome the heavy-handed hatchet job that was done to the script.  After all, Lilies of the Field had only Sidney Poiter with any real name recognition, and him not a whole lot yet. Rather, it was the story that the superb if largely unknown cast was able to pull off.If you are a fan of Lilies of the Field, I suggest that you do NOT see the movie Left Hand of God.  Instead, track down a copy of William E. Barrett's book (search well -- it is out of print) and READ the story as the author intended it.

Yes, there was reason for the Church to like the way in which the Sisters were portrayed, but it was for their courage overall and not the strength of their faith that they were admirable.Second, it is primarily a voice for tolerance that speaks here. Sidney Poitier's character is a competent, confident, well-assimilated American, comfortable in his own country in spite of the prevailing prejudices against Negroes. He is portrayed - as in the novel - as a capable man with a true sense of honor and genuine noblesse oblige (see Luke 1248 to understand what the nuns used to pound into us in school) toward a flock of poor, isolated, and unacculturated foreign refugees in a bewildering land of size and desolation utterly alien to everything they had ever known.Third, that the tolerance is extended by a member of a racial minority group for whom tolerance was being demanded at that time, with all the Civil Rights movement baggage that makes a mockery of civil rights as a concept.... Well, that was remarkable.Sidney Poitier's characterization of Homer Smith served not only as a model of how my generation of mainstream White kids grew up to look upon what a Black man could be - strong and shrewd, practical and yet considerate of people in need - but also of what *we* should be as men. It gave us cause to think seriously about what would be demanded of us in our lives, and how we would respond to those demands, not for the good of other people, but for the sake of our own sense of honor and manhood.And I suppose that the lesson of this film is that the mark of manhood is not in crazed bravery or blind faith or passion or outrage, but in the strength of your promises and the commitment required to see them through.

A film shot in only two weeks with a big star working way below his usual salary and a bunch of no-name players in the rest of the cast and it winds up contending for Best Picture with blockbusters like Cleopatra, How the West Was Won, and Tom Jones. Lillies of the Field might have won a few more Oscars if it wasn't for Tom Jones in the race.Sidney Poitier plays Homer Smith, ex-GI whose truck breaks down at a convent in the Arizona desert. It's populated with a small group of German speaking nuns to whose order was left this property. The group is headed by Lilia Skala who's not going to let the fact she doesn't speak English deter her from building up the place. Starting with a chapel.It seems like the Almighty has answered her prayers when she finds out Poitier has a construction background. The sister is convinced God is on her side and even without the Deity, she's pretty formidable all by herself. The rest of the story is their effort to make it happen.I guess the closest example to this film I can come up with is Marty, another story without any real stars in it, shot on a shoestring budget that got to be Best Picture and win for Ernest Borgnine an Oscar for Best Actor and stardom. Lillies of the Field was up for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Lilla Skala and a few other categories. But it came home with one winner, Best Actor for Sidney Poitier the first black person to win in that category.I don't think it would detract one bit from Poitier's achievement to say that the Civil Rights Revolution at its crest in 1964 might have just put Poitier over the top. His competition that year was Rex Harrison for Cleopatra, Paul Newman for Hud, Richard Harris for This Sporting Life and Albert Finney for Tom Jones. Tom Jones won a host of Oscars that year including Best Picture, but in 1964 in the wake of the Kennedy assassination and the news of the atrocities done to civil rights workers and the mounting pressure to pass the Civil Rights Act, Hollywood was casting its own voice of support in naming Sidney Poitier as Best Actor. As you can see Sidney Poitier faced some stiff competition in the category, I certainly wouldn't want to say he was better than Albert Finney or Paul Newman who got rave reviews for their performances.Sidney Poitier was something special in Lillies of the Field. As his character Homer Smith says he's a camp meeting Baptist from the south. And the highlight of the film is him teaching the nuns to sing that Baptist camp meeting song, Amen. That was about brother and sisterhood and peoples of all kinds working together and respecting each other in their differences.And for that reason, because that message is so vital today, the Academy voters gave Sidney Poitier a well deserved Oscar for delivering that message in an under-financed, but very beautiful film.

When Homer ran up the stairs into the light (sunlight) of the Nun's roof I felt myself as uplifted as Homer Smith. The technique of the camera moving away from the actors in the early scene of the Sisters following after Homer's car as he went to leave was extremely powerful. I wondered if this technique would be used again or possibly overdone. It was only used one more time, very briefly, so as to not trivialize its initial use...

Potentially interesting subjects and characterizations are left in the lurch, due to filmmakers' insistence on giving top priority to the twists, turns and layers of the story.  In a good movie the characters should drive the action; not the other way around.  Those who disagree with this assessment are referred to Lilies of the Field.Here is a film which gets by cheerfully on a wisp of a plot.  It's a simple tale about Homer Smith (Sidney Poitier), an amiable drifter who stops to get water for his car and is eventually conned into building a chapel for a band of European nuns.  There is no great conflict in the film; only the constant threat of running out of materials.  In the midst of this, Poitier manages to teach the nuns a bit of English, as well as a `goin' to meetin' song' called `Amen,' which serves as the film's theme and is played throughout.The real joy of the film is in the personalities and interactions of the characters, and in the individual scenes.  Poitier is dynamic and jovial in his Oscar winning role.  It may not have been his top performance, or indeed the year's best acting, but it has a special low-key charm that few other actors could have mustered. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Lilia Skala as the wily Mother Superior.  There are several touching sequences, and also a richness of humor.

There have been better movies; there have been funnier comedies; there have been more dramatic dramas; there have been deeper explorations of spiritual issues. But this is a very pleasant movie to watch - and even fun at times.This is Sidney Poitier's movie. He plays Homer Smith - a mysterious drifter whose past we never do learn very much about who appears at a farm needing water for the radiator in his car. The farm turns out to be occupied by a group of nuns who've recently come to the United States from Germany and who basically draft Homer to build them a chapel. The movie basically portrays the growing relationship between the nuns and Homer. Homer resents the work he's being asked to do but somehow is unable to pull away. The nuns see Homer as an answer to their prayers for someone who could help them in this task. It's good fun watching Homer teach the nuns how to speak English and how to sing some of the gospel songs he learned in his Baptist upbringing. As I said, this is Poitier's movie and he was superb in it. The supporting cast was fine, but not high profile. The only one I recognized was Stanley Adams from a Star Trek episode a few years later.

Rinse and repeat for 90 minutes. By the end, the overarching conflict also ends with a summarizing schmaltzy resolution. Depending upon your point of view this is either wholesomely feelgood or nauseatingly sweet.It's this formula which Ralph Nelson puts to work in Lilies in the Field. Immigrant nuns seeking to build a chapel in impoverished desert country pray for help. It arrives in the form of unemployed itinerant worker Sidney Poitier.What separates this from Disney fare is the story's touchy social themes. In 1963 Disney didn't do films that dealt with themes like racism, faith, poverty and immigration. This was pretty aggressive subject matter for a time when Lyndon Johnson was still a year away from proposing the Great Society.So it's possible that Nelson decided that he needed a generous spoonful of sugar to make his social medicine palatable. Judging by the box office, he was right.In Sidney Poitier he has a star who conveniently combines a palatable personality with social relevance -- the color of his skin. Poitier delivers a friendly and mostly believable Oscar-winning counterpoint to the flinty-with-a-heart-of-gold Mother Superior who leads her little band of nuns on their seemingly impossible quest to build a chapel with no money or resources.Speaking of no money and no resources, perhaps the most remarkable thing about this film isn't the story on the screen. It's the story of the making of the film. Ralph Nelson, who produced as well as directed, was compelled by United Artists to hock his house in order to guarantee the film's paltry $240,000 production budget.Even more amazing -- and I'm still having a hard time believing this -- Nelson et al shot the entire film in precisely two weeks in Tuscon. With no money, Poitier and cast broke union rules to rehearse in secret at Nelson's Los Angeles home before heading to their Tuscon location. And the chapel at the center of the story was actually built as the film was being shot, then destroyed after.Lilies of the Field is a sweet and generally agreeable examination of social issues just coming to the fore in 1963. That Nelson did a good job gauging his audience's tolerance for his sensitive themes is testified to by the movie's strong box office and its star's Best Actor award.But those with a taste for stronger medicine (or those seeking an indication of how much social attitudes changed in just four years) might prefer some of the same themes in 1964's Poitier masterpiece, In the Heat of the Night.

See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? &#151;Matthew 628-30This was a wonderful movie that portrays the beauty, goodness and strength of the human spirit. I found Lilies of the Field entertaining as a comedy and drama while uplifting at the same time.Sidney Poitier won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Homer Smith and deservedly so. He is riveting as an ex-GI, itinerant handyman and personable country boy who stops at a remote farm in the Arizona desert because his car has overheated. There he meets a group of five German nuns who is lead by their Mother Superior (Lilia Skala). The Mother Superior believes Smith or Schmidt as she calls him is a Godsend to help them build a chapel the nuns have cherished and have been praying for. She, in her forceful and forthright manner, persuades Smith to do some repairs on the roof and so Smith stays overnight.Smith believes he is going to be paid, but the nuns have very little money and subsist by living off the land. Thus, the movie is set and Smith soon realizes that he isn't going to be paid for his labor and wants to leave to continue his journey, but he gradually is hooked by the five nuns with their faith and determination. The five nuns are like the lilies in the field. Poitier is very convincing as someone who feels like he's being duped, but cannot remain angry and frustrated long at the Mother Superior and the nuns despite their language and cultural differences.Your spirit will soak up the joy of what true faith and prayer brings to the human condition as you watch this movie. Homer Smith never does get paid for his labor, but in return he gains much more than he ever anticipated. It's not the story in the book, but after wards, I envisioned Homer Smith returning once again to complete what Mother Superior had dreamed and prayed about in building a school and hospital to go along with her Shapel.

Sidney Poitier's Homer (is the name an Odyssey reference?) needs a steady job, though he may not want to admit it. The English lessons he gives the nuns, and the Baptist hymn he teaches them, are the film's highlights, and these both come within the first twenty minutes. The narrative loses momentum as the chapel slowly takes shape, but at a mere 94 minutes it is not too long a movie. "},{"Title":"The Milagro Chapel.","Date":"16 February 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" When I first watched this film years ago I was moved by it, by the growing solidarity of an isolated desert community, bereft of everything but their faith, and some members without even that to rely on. Now that I'm more, well, experienced -- I'm trying to avoid the word debauched -- it's a little more difficult to warm my heart but not yet impossible.Poitier is a happy-go-lucky handyman who bumps into half a dozen German nuns in the Sonoran desert. They more or less force him to begin building them a chapel, so that the Catholic circuit rider doesn't have to say mass from the back of his trailer. There are all sorts of travails. Obstacles must be overcome. There is neither enough labor nor materials. Does the entire Hispanic community show up to provide the missing labor? Does the local construction company provide the bricks and mortar as a result of a sort of desert-parched Pascal's choice? Does Poitier build the nuns their chapel? Are you kidding? Now, having seen it for the second time, it's still uplifting, and somewhat comic as well, with occasional dramatic elements. Lilia Skala, as the mother superior, has the truly thankless role of the authoritarian who believes that if you trust in God you needn't worry about anything else, but she delivers. You might not think so when you see her in action because the character is so stern and lacking in humor. Poitier is to Skala as fire hydrant is to dog. But it takes skill to play such an unpleasant role.And this must be ranked among Sidney Poitier's better performances. (He won an Oscar for it but that means nothing.) Poitier's forte was similar to Gregory Peck's. He could project sincerity and moral fury almost flawlessly. But this role gives him a chance to lighten up. There's hardly a moment when he's on screen that you can take your eyes from him. He invests the smallest moments with something unique. Nobody else could have done it quite the same way. And there are some keenly observed moments Poitier and the men have finished the chapel and are playing music, dancing, and getting drunk, while the nuns and the wives sit on benches and glare at them. Women don't like seeing men have a good time and getting drunk with other men. I enjoyed watching it again.Having said that, I'm forced to admit that a second viewing, after years of marination in movie conventions, means hauling one's aesthetic sensibilities stark naked through some exceedingly prickly beavertail patches.Are you familiar with the scene in which some worldly outsider teaches a couple of uptight nuns how to sing a raucous spiritual con mucho gusto? Clapping their hands and swaying from side to side? No? How about the scene in which somebody teaches some non-English speakers how to speak English -- in a REGIONAL DIALECT? As in, Sit yo' self down, y'all? Would you believe an Irishman who drinks too much? An Irish priest? There were times when I winced, when I turned my face aside, as I tend to do when a large animal is slaughtered on screen.Yet, for all that, it's still an uplifting and, in its own limited way, a satisfying fable. Have the kids watch it too. The more innocent among us will get more out of it.

A lot of things were getting under way, Viet Nam, the British Invasion and of course the Civil Rights movement. What's remarkable to me in this picture is that Sidney Poitier's color never seems to become an issue with the people that matter in the story. Granted, the supply store owner Ashton (Ralph Nelson) called Homer Smith (Poitier) 'boy' at one point, but Homer gave it right back to him and they were both on equal terms again. I thought that was handled quite professionally.Overall however, I wasn't really grabbed by the picture the way other reviewers were from reading their comments here. It's not a bad picture mind you, but it's not particularly memorable either. While competent in his portrayal, Poitier didn't seem to be offering an Oscar caliber performance by demonstrating the the type of range Paul Newman displayed as Hud Bannon, another Best Actor contender the same year. I liked Poitier a whole lot better in In the Heat of the Night; I liked that movie a lot better too. Interestingly, 'Heat' also tackled the racial angle quite strongly as well and by virtue of his performance there, Poitier helped the cause of black actors in film quite admirably.There was one scene I got a kick out of though. Comparing Bible passages, Mother Maria (Lilia Skala) had that tremendous volume that almost swamped the table, and Poitier's character matched her verse for verse with his little pocket edition. That was really quite comical.Probably the best takeaway one gets from the story is how folks of diverse backgrounds and personalities can put their differences aside to come together in a spirit of harmony and community to pursue a goal. In this case, the mission was the mission, and Homer Smith was a pretty good man with a bulldozer.

Homer accepts the task, reluctantly and with constant arguments with Sister Mary, who seems to don't have any kind of money and she keeps these subject to the other day (quoting a Bible versicle), almost forcing this man to do the job but he was just passing through the city. With the help of Juan (Stanley Adams) and the local residents Homer's gonna built the chapel and teach some valuable lessons to the nuns and to the town's people.Lillies in the Field deals with themes of solidarity, comprehension, faith yet it is a funny and moving film that doesn't seem to preach anything more than love and respect among people. However, I found that the story could work more on the nuns in the sense of teaching something good to Homer and not only backwards, because it worked as if these nuns were only exploiting this man, who built a chapel for them, teach them English and some songs, and bought material and different kinds of food for all them, and in return they only gave him a place to stay, thousands of work to do and lot of complaints. The film's intentions are good, plausible, commendable but to some might look as a advantage situation explored by the Church and that denies everything it was trying to present. The small supporting cast is great, but the outstanding performances of Poitier and Skala and all of the scenes between the two are excellent. Surprising as it might be this film haven't portrayed any situation of prejudice themes which was something recurring in Poitier's films during the 1950's and 1960's. The characters here are presented as human beings that help each other without caring about the skin color; it had one or two undertones about this issue (the guy in the construction shop who couldn't believe in Homer being a contractor), but it wasn't nothing so sad or uncomfortable.It goes for 10 stars because it's a small film that achieves great levels, great things and as long as I live and watch films I want to remember of films like this that are simple, has fantastic moments and a positive message. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Schmidt!!!

But every few moments, as a particular truth is uttered, or a connection made, or a kindness offered, or a smile bigger than the sun spreads across Homer's face--the film sometimes just takes your breath away. It looks so sympathetically at all these people--it embraces them, makes us understand them, respects them, feels for them. We should all be so lucky to encounter a Homer Smith in our lives--filled with the joy of life, realistic, pragmatic, but also a dreamer with the soul of a great and generous man, who makes us laugh out loud and feel protected and safe. But all the people, with their faults and foibles become just as cherished in their own ways as Homer. The nuns with their spiritual purpose and sacrifice, Strong Sister Mary with her unshakable (and often annoying) faith, the parishioners with their jealousies, but also their generosities....they are a microcosm of all of us. They are every race and creed. They are generous and stingy, happy and sad. But they survive--they go on and work and struggle....and sometimes a bright, shining, inspirational light like Homer enters their lives, but, even when he will disappear, as inevitably happens (all good things come to an end!)...they still go on...with love and work and toil and ultimate optimism in life and all its glorious, radiant possibilities.

That would be Homer Smith, an independent contractor who reluctantly gets roped by some German nuns into building a chapel for them having stopped near their convent initially to just get some water for his car. While he seems to get along fine with the others, Homer often has some choice words to say to Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala) especially concerning money and her ordering, comparing her at one point to Hitler. When the sisters stop at the outdoor mass, Smith stops at the nearby diner where he strikes up a friendly conversation with the proprietor, Juan (Stanley Adams), as they humorously discuss the sisters. Eventually, he leaves and then comes back, having gotten into trouble in between. He also offers his services to construction foreman Mr. Ashton (Ralph Nelson, this movie's producer/director). There's more to the plot than what I just described but now I'll just say that while Poitier is quite funny and charming, his character's motives are not always clear especially in the beginning when he seems condescending to the nuns especially when teaching English and singing Amen to them (I put quotations on the word singing because the voice you hear when that is performed is actually that of Jester Hairston, the song's writer). Still, Sidney does give his usual good performance though I do not think it's one of his best, certainly not compared to No Way Out or A Raisin in the Sun. But, on the other hand, Lilies of the Field isn't too overly sentimental as I'd feared these last 30 years of just hearing and reading about it. So on that note, it's highly recommended. P.S. That initial conversation between Aston and Smith when they call each other boy was one of the most edgy things I've heard from an early '60s movie!

I even bought the Jerry Goldsmith score on LP (which I still have, although it's well scratched up now...wish it was on CD!). Sadly, the film hardly ever aired on TV. Finally, it came out on DVD and I bought it right away and watch it regularly. It is, as many have commented, the rare perfect film. There are no wasted or superfluous shots. Every performance, even the smallest ones, are heartfelt and nuanced. The two leads, as many have mentioned, are outstanding, but the actors/actresses who played the other nuns, and also Juan, Mr. Ashton, and the priest (who, if you look closely, you will see he eventually went on to costar in Kojak with Telly Savalas), are all GREAT! I will disagree with those who say the movie is not about race relations. It is, but as it does with the issue of faith, the writing and direction is so subtle that you don't even realize it. In fact, the film grapples with many issues, but underlying them all is the tolerance for those who are unlike ourselves. All the characters come to see other people for who they are, not their preconceived notions. Ashton comes to respect Homer as a hard working man, not as a colored boy. Homer realizes the nuns have sacrificed much for their faith and he admires that. And, most pointedly, the Mother Superior finally realizes that even though Homer Smith is not a man of faith he still did (what to her was) God's work albeit without the window dressing of the Catholic faith. And I could go on and on.The score for this film is one of Goldsmith's best, highlighted by poignant refrains such as when the nuns are walking down the dusty road all alone after Homer leaves them. The sweet soft music played when Homer inscribes his name on the steeple cement is another nice moment.The way comedy is interwoven into the drama is another hallmark of the film's genius. None of the humor is cheap or insensitive but is based on people being simply human whether it's the scene where Mother Superios splashes cold water on a still sleeping Homer, the confusion that arises when all the villagers try to take over the chapel construction without Homer helping, the banter between Homer and Mother Superior, or Ashton's exasperation at the end when he tells Smith that the Mother Superior now wants his help with a school and hospital.Sadly, many younger people raised on ADD-influenced/VH1-inspired non-stop action films will probably not embrace a low-key thoughtful and sincere drama (in Black and White) like this, but I understand why they don't see what there is to like about this. However, despite it being more than 40 years old, Lilies of the Field has stood the test of time and is every bit as relevant, charming and insightful now as it was when it premiered.

I'm not suggesting that Poitier is any less of an actor; far from it, in fact. I'm merely commenting on the quality of the competition for that year.The story is interesting, for a number of reasons. First, it's a no-frills narrative about an itinerant worker, who happens to be black, and who stops to get water for his overheated auto at a farm operated by five German nuns. He's enticed to stay to help build a chapel. Eventually, the local community &#150; mostly Hispanic -- assists with the construction until it is completed. Then, his job done, the worker leaves. (That sort of story has been done many times, notably in Shane (1953), who was enticed to do a very, very different kind of job, did it, and then left) As stories go then, there's not much going for it &#150; on the surface, anyway.Where it makes a difference, however, is in those time-honoured maxims espoused by many religions (but not only religions, and not only Catholic) faith, hope and charity. The nuns, especially the Mother, have absolute faith that they will receive help; they have hope eternal that help will come to pass (and it does); and Homer (Sidney Poitier) shows the Mother (Lilia Skala) a bit more about charity than she shows to him. So, the story wraps all those themes up very nicely, and presents them in the appropriate manner. And, rightly so...What's more interesting, however, is when the movie was made &#150; at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in USA &#150; and the very obvious lengths to which the story went to show how people can get along with each other. So, I think there is a very real political message here, and a very deliberate one for the times. My criticism, however, is that almost everybody is just too, too nice to each other, even Mother Superior when she rants at Homer. The only note of real discord is when the white, almost-redneck boss of Ashton Construction Company (played by Ralph Nelson, who just happens to be the director), calls to Homer, Hey, boy!. Very grandly, Homer stands there, confident, assured and answers something like, What's that you say, boy? That sort of exchange probably would not have occurred if the movie had been made in the 1950s. Hmmm, come to think of it, the whole movie couldn't have been made in the 1950s, I reckon...So, there's no doubt that Poitier carried the movie and was deservedly awarded the Oscar, although I thought Newman was very good in Hud (1963). Lilia Skala is almost too severe as the Mother Superior and it was a nice surprise to see Dan Frazer, as the local priest, an actor I came to like a lot on the Kojak TV series.The overall production was obviously sparse, but functional; however, that suited the whole setting of the story, anyway. And, the black and white photography was just right there's nothing quite like stark desert hills, and almost treeless plains, against a mutli-grey sundown &#150; and a line of five nuns in black habit against the bright white of a desert dirt road. That, you gotta see&#133; "}{"Title":"A nice feel good movie with great acting","Date":"25 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Sidney Poitier deserved his Oscar for this lovely movie.

We built it of concrete block, 45 feet wide by 70 feet long. We had to break through a stone wall, made of blocks of solid stone over 1 meter thick, to connect it to the existing chapel. The addition was almost 50% bigger than the original chapel for the convent. It was built so the local people could come to Mass inside, where it was warm in the winter and dry on rainy days.We worked hard, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week on this.

However, why does Poitier leave the night before the dedication? This is not some slight oversight by the director. A perfect ending is deliberately avoided.I'm convinced this is because the writer wanted to emphasize that Poitier's character, just like him as a person, was as an individualist, and he'd already gotten past being subservient to a religion or any group. He built the chapel for his own reasons, as he stated many times. He specifically says at the table some things never change before he tricks Skana into thanking him, after which she points to the sky and says HE (god) built the chapel He also denies her the chance to put him in the front row on opening day, which she offers to him.I'd love to hear other interpretations, but I'm convinced the message is about modernity and pride in living beyond religion, and its constraints. He wasn't going to be her puppet, no matter what. Maybe he knew he would react poorly to her treatment the next day.Anyway, I cant imagine a movie in Hollywood being this masterful with subtlety anymore, nor could I imagine Hollywood making a movie with this complex a message on religion (in which religion comes up short to the individual) since 1980. Poitier's talent is incredible, and it reminds me, though I was born in 1964, of a bright hope for the future of individual rights and modernity that existed in the early sixties, and was promptly squashed by the machine.A generation that looks to mindless rappers could do well to reset their sights on Mr Poitier's cool strength, class, and intelligence. He has all these qualities and still retains his integrity. Of course, his get-along attitude is interpreted by some as collusion, but ignorant confrontation hasn't produced better results.

They are also where we work out more accessible problems, like who we are in our romance, our nation and world. We select our film personalities in large measure because of how they reflect where we are. I strongly believe that in the industry, we have artists, real artists that drive these adventures, and celebrities that we select because they follow us.This film is not from any of the artists. It follows society of the time. But it is a superb example of film being where we give ourselves permission as a society to go beyond where we think we are. This isn't quite the dynamic most people believe that the film industry directs public opinion for better or worse, depending on whether your ox is gored. But whether you think this is a driver or a follower, its interesting.For those who don't know (shame!) the US was in the midst of perhaps its greatest period of moral re-evaluation. It was a great, great time to be an American because great shifts began, instigated by questions at the root of the social contract. The appearance of this was after the big non-violent push of Martin King and before Congress passed extremely big laws protecting minorities.There's a profoundly ordinary set of stereotypes here the Mexicans who are witless followers of an imperial religion; the Nazi woman. (This still resonated then; it meant something negative to just be German, especially in the context of minorities and intolerance, and this woman played the stereotype to a T.)And you had the cracker, the white guy, who calls the black man boy, and later says he's shiftless, you know the type.Everyone here is rigidly a stereotype except for the black man. He's deliberately outside that snap to type, and it is why the thing was so profound in its time. Hard to believe now, but it WAS shocking to see a beautiful man, moving easily through the spaces these stereotypical characters created. He has no space himself, he's a wanderer and the space he does create (a chapel) is for others, to transform theirs.This was after Mockingbird a dreary morality tale in the old mold and to my mind was much more influential. This allowed us to build a world with Richard Prior, Flip Wilson and Bill Cosby.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

He's a drifter who happens on a small group of German nuns trying to establish a religious community in the desert. The desert of the US.The other superior is stern and unyielding but of course we love her. And of course he grows to love her. (That happens early. There's not much to give away in terms of plot.) I have to wonder how well it would work without the song to which Poitier introduces the nuns Amen! It's gentle, stirring, simple -- everything the movie sets itself up as being. And, really, is.I had avoided this movie for decades. Now I've seen it and it's a nice movie. Not a great one. But well acted and sweet.

Every movie has to face the competition, and there is no rebate for older participants. The story begins interesting with Poitier and the nuns, but it fails to invent some new jokes or more aspects. A black guy is building some nuns a church. It is enough for the first steps or the general direction. Delicious food doesn't become better if you are chewing one piece for 90 minutes. The same rule can be applied here. To skip some 30 minutes in the middle of it, has no negative consequences. You will not loose any clues. No tension,no action,no colour,no jokes only a story that becomes more boring with every minute and a comical situation that looses it's stance after ten minutes.

Characters are not convincing, story is almost nil and message is very hazy. Mother Superior looks more of a mime artist as she keep making faces through out the film. Outdoor shoot is good. Sydney Poitier is good as always and gives an Oscar performance. He sings 'Amen' perfectly. Rest of the film mostly drags. Lots of things are unexplained like why Poitier wanted to build it alone and most of all why did he stop back. Its very unconvincing. Comedy also is very childish. Once he start building the church nothing really happens. If possible just refrain. Its a boring film.5/10 "}]
