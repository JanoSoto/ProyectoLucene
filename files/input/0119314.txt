Even the affair is positive. It helps Tom Booker get over his wife when he puts that record back in it's sleeve, and it helps Annie get off her so called high horse attitude. It's a movie of changes for the better all around. Enjoyable, real, well done.The scenes interacting with the horse are wonderful. Sitting in that field waiting for the horse to feel comfortable enough to deal with Mr. Booker was an enormous hurdle. The best scene is after two and a half hours when Tom brings the horse down to Grace's level, so that they both rise together. That scene,is to joyfully cry for, and laugh yes.

On one level, it is a celebration of man's great capacity for and heritage of attunement to nature and the limitless beauty that he chooses to return to, having tired of the unsatisfying world that he had created in its place on his path of discovery. It is also a testimony to the process of healing, of how it is an opportunity to delve deep into the recesses of the traumatised soul, and how it can only be undertaken with a simultaneous caring for everyone involved in the circle of influence. It is also an examination of relationships, of the relationship between the parent and the child, between man and woman, between human and animal, and ultimately between body and soul. Ultimately the film is a triumph of spirit, a paean to a long forgotten wholeness and harmony that is celebrated in the film as though it just were, and had never ceased to be, without the wrangling and flailing that one has come to expect of a piece of art that attempts to recapture the glory of the soul.One of the very many great moments of the film are where the mother tries to understand the Horse Whisperer's failed relationship with his love in the past, as a love that was 'wrong' because they were not 'right' for each other. He says 'I loved her not because it was right, I just loved her'. This clear differentiation between love on the one hand and the rightness of the relationship on the other elevates both to a respectability that is incomprehensible when love is understood only as a manifestation of the rightness of a relationship. This kind of 'simple wisdom', so to speak, is the fabric of the entire film, it is the tongue in which the story is told. In fact much of the film eschews dialogue completely in favour of the vast visuals of American ranch-land, always with humans embedded as part of the landscape in a harmony that seems so obvious as to be almost unremarkable. Among the most poignant of these are the moments between Tom, the Horse Whisperer and Pilgrim, the horse, moments where they communicate wordlessly, often soundlessly, slowly going through the stages of distrust, caution, diffidence, examination, trust and sharing that are necessary on the path of friendship, here shown between man and animal.The story of the Horse Whisperer is simple enough and I shall neither describe it, nor analyse the components of the film. Doing this would reduce its stature to that of a product.The Horse Whisperer is a gift, accept it.

The Montana scenery is just awesome.After a dramatic opening scene in which we see the horse and daughter hurt, the mother (Kristin Scott-Thonas) takes the girl and the horse out West to see if the horse can be salvaged. Unfortunately, the mother - who is married - falls for the horseman Tom Booker (Redford) and an adulterous relationship almost comes to fruition. That romance is the soap opera part of the film but it's nice to see everyone, including Redford's character, healed of emotional as well as physical wounds.Some of the teen's bad attitudes are not fun to watch, but otherwise the people in here are very nice. Ranchers Redford and Chris Cooper and Cooper's sons are all nice people, especially of one Cooper's little kids. This film is a bit too much of a melodrama at times which makes it a long in spots, but it's a long movie to begin with (169 minutes). It's so beautifully filmed, however, that for that alone the movie is worth seeing.

A River Runs Through It. Quiz Show. With this track record, Robert Redford has proven himself not only to be one of the great modern American movie-makers, but one of the only actors to ever make a smooth -- not to mention impressive -- transition to the director's chair. And considering his success, one might worry that he'd make a misstep somewhere and back a sub par picture. Well, skeptics beware, because with The Horse Whisperer, Redford has secured his spot as an A-list director, and as a man who knows how to please his audience. Adapted from Nick Evan's best-selling novel, The Horse Whisperer depicts a New York family that is struck by tragedy when their daughter is involved in a horrific accident while riding her horse in the woods with a friend. Her friend is killed, and she is required to have her leg amputated; as for the horse, he is so severely traumatized that putting him down appears to be the only option. But the mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) refuses to watch another part of her life fall apart before her eyes, and demands that the horse be kept alive. She examines every source on horse healing, and learns of a strange treatment known as horse whispering, which deals with the spiritual healing of the animal. By this point, you should be able to figure out where the plot goes she contacts the horse whisperer, drags the horse (and her daughter) to a ranch in Montana, and through the experience they all find emotional healing. And while this might seem like a recipe destined for sappy Lifetime melodrama, Redford somehow makes it work. Not because the story is particularly unique, but simply because his characters actually feel real to us -- which is where so many other similar movies have failed. Thomas is superb as the controlling (yet confused) mother; instead of being portrayed as some manipulative matriarch, we actually sympathize with her situation. In fact, we sympathize with everyone's situation. Thomas eventually falls in love with the horse whisperer himself (played by Redford), and when she ultimately has to choose between him and her husband (played by Sam Neill), the dilemma is not boiled down to mere preference. Neill is a loving, caring father, and in the most moving scene of the picture, he declares his love for his wife yet allows her -- and even encourages her -- to follow her own heart. As the daughter, new-comer Scarlett Johannson gives a terrific performance, and with a supporting cast that includes Chris Cooper and Dianne Wiest, the ensemble is flawless. The film is deliberately paced, yet it never drags; instead, it uses its length (which runs close to three hours) to its own advantage, conveying the rare grace and tenderness that we saw in A River Runs Through It and Ordinary People. Each and every character is filled with an emotional depth rarely seen in mainstream romance epics, and the scenes that involve the horse being healed manage to be both compelling and powerful in spite of their contrived nature (which is really an accurate description of the entire picture). And even though it might not hit every emotional chord it tries to strike, The Horse Whisperer does so much right that it puts all the other wanna-be epics to shame. Here's to a future classic.Grade A- "},{"Title":"good movie, book is even better","Date":"8 March 2001","Score":"15 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":"  I read the book before seeing the movie and was thus, not expecting it to be as good ( I thought the book was extremely well-written) HOwever, I did enjoy the movie.

He would have had to explain all the nuances to the actors because so much is accomplished without words. Tom, the Horse Whisperer, gifted in the art of re-bonding, has to decide whether he can bring healing to only the horse (all that he is asked to do) or extend his therapeutic touch to the three humans as well. How does he achieve emotional mending for each member? By careful listening and observation, he gleans the signals until he knows the interlinking dynamics between all the wounded members. You can do the same if you practice the skill to understand the internal driving forces.Tom knows the pain of lost love and is magnetically drawn to the mother. But not until the father arrived could he know how his daughter loved him or that he cared for his girls. I believe Tom made a conscious decision to stop his bonding with the mother. The moment of decision was watching the bedroom light go out in his creek house across the meadow when the dad came to visit. He early achieved healing for the horse but he knew he could never achieve wholeness for the daughter if he wounded her again by replacing her father.He faced the excruciating challenge of healing the mother by opening her up to new bonding with her husband. After several touching moments, he did that finally at the dance by drawing her into his love then leaving her a soft place to fall into her husband's love again. He executed a delicate, deliberate maneuver so she didn't stay bonded to him marvelously done without rejecting her). He did that by leaving the dance (when he could have driven a wedge between her and her husband right then.) A man of few words, he had kept her back to her husband drinking at the dance, covertly expressed his love, then left before he damaged their bonding. The sacrifice of true love! He had always spoken so honestly and clearly to each one. In the barn, he didn't soften the reality of how she would hurt her husband and daughter if she chose him. He signaled to her what she should do by saying your love&#151;that I will always have with me. And by saying I wanted to be here when you left. He taught her the value of relationships above careers. He was refreshingly grounded in knowing who he was. He also understood that you could deeply love someone and it not be right to marry them.

Clearly some love vanilla ice cream and some love chocolate and there is no acceptable argument that one is better than another. However, I expect the negative reviews come from people who think Snatch and Grindhouse are great movies. (Not a surprise, IMDb people rated these two pieces of crap amazingly high.)The Horse Whisperer has great acting, from the supporting cast to the stars and, by the way, it is the best thing Johansson has ever done, great cinematography, and four excellent story lines, the love interest between Thomas and Redford, and the strained relationship between the career mother and her daughter, the nobility and courage of the horse (as great as the equines in Hidalgo and the Black Stallion) and lastly, the pain and trauma of a young teenager losing a limb.I also don't understand those why one compares a film with a book. Who cares? I read more fiction than most and enjoy it immensely , however, they are different media and I see no value in comparing the two. This movie stands on its own merits, whether the book was better (or worse) should be irrelevant.Although Redford is 24 years older in reality and probably 10 years older in the story, the chemistry is clearly there. Those used to the naked buttocks, the groaning and the spit swapping that passes for romance in the films of the last 30 years may not be able to see the romance, but only the comatose would not feel the heat in the scene where Redford and Thomas are dancing close.The dynamics of Thomas and Scarlet are also extremely well done. It may sometimes appear a bit formula, but I know it is quite real.Lastly, I think this is one of the greatest romances of its era. I can't think of one better. "},{"Title":"One of the best.

It is a beautiful state, full of opposites, contrasts, and subtle colors. Everyone who has ever been there knows that Montana has windstorms that are like hurricanes that last for three days. There are snowstorms that isolate rural families for what seems an eternity. Then there is summer sunshine that lasts for hours and hours with heat that would make sidewalks feel like walking on coals even with shoes on, which says nothing about rainstorms that can bring down trees.Living on such land produces flexible, self reliant, open-minded, leather hard sunburned, understanding people. Such a man was Tom Brooker and the rest of the Brooker family. The seasons brought each of them whatever rewards and challenges only a place like Montana could bring.Other reviewers have not given the complete descriptions of the wonderful choice of possible settings. Nor should they. Redford's great direction picked an ideal time of the year to tell an idealized love story. Spring with all its glorious almost iridescent greens and promise of so much growth was what he choose.Kristin Scott-Thomas (who played Annie) and her daughter (Grace played by the always touching and sensitive Scarlett Johannson) travel from New York after an accident which cost Grace her leg and Pilgrim (her horse) his sanity. It was a miracle that either survived. From sophistication to a practical simple reality was what this film was about.People who watch this film fall for the most part into two categories those who like the unlikely love story, those who do not. There are those who like the scenery to speak for itself, and others who wish things would move on, that Redford would actually DO something.Personally I liked the Horse Whisperer. I'm willing to accept all the criticisms as just that. They do not shake my basic belief that this was a well-crafted artistic endeavor telling a beautifully complex story where three living beings (two people and a horse) were cured of ills both obvious and hidden. They were rehabilitated not by medications, or health spas, or special diets, or leisure or anything else that was out of the ordinary.They were cured by fresh air, hard work, good fellowship, and kindness and understanding, the virtues offered by the people of Montana. It is a great film to watch devoid of either obvious sex or violence. My vote is 10/10.At the risk of adding a spoiler, many people on the board despised the ending. I did not. Annie merely found it difficult to say goodbye. She wanted to stay, but she could not leave Grace yet. She simply sent him away so that she herself could leave. Hers was an act of great and touching sacrifice. What she wanted could never replace her responsibility to her family. Unlike his first wife, who could not stand the open dullness of Montana and would never return, Annie did not want to leave. She had to meet higher obligations than her own needs. The door was always open for her return, and Tom knew this and so like the vast prairie of Montana, he could be enduring and patient.

Since she keeps mentioning it from time to time, I slapped on the DVD today to let her watch it again while I intended to take care of other business. The darn thing is so mesmerizing, however, I couldn't stop watching.The first time I saw this, I might have given it an 8, or maybe even a 9. It was simply a very good movie. Once seen, its story becomes known, however, and a second viewing allows one to focus more acutely on the details. Few directors are so adept at getting his actors to portray the subtleties of human emotions, sans dialog, as Robert Redford (cf. Ordinary People, etc.). The interplay and facial expressions are so good and appropriate, it makes you want to cry. No fake emotions here.Before beginning the DVD, I showed Mother Kate Bosworth's photo on the cover of the current (July, 2006) issue of W magazine, the one with her fashion spread and interview inside, saying, Remember the girl who dies at the beginning of the movie? This is what she's grown up into. She just opened as Lois Lane a couple weeks ago in 'Superman Returns'. After the movie started, I immediately recognized the girl at the heart of the story and exclaimed, That's Scarlett Johansson!...Both girls are big stars now. Having forgotten these unknown child actors had appeared in this movie, I immediately wondered about the relative casting, how the decision was made on which actress got which part, until research revealed that this was Bosworth's first film, while Johansson was a four-year veteran at the time.Having already extolled Redford's skills as a director, let me go on just a bit about his acting herein. Superb, simply superb. No more or less, however, than that of his co-star, Kristen Scott Thomas, and the rest of the cast. A fine job all around.At 169 minutes, this is a relatively long movie, but there are no fillers, and no scene is wasted. Redford's scenes with the horse, and the people surrounding the horse (i.e., the child and the mother) are simply amazing. One can but wonder about his life journey from a wild child speeding down the streets of New York City in the middle of the night to catch the green lights, to his retreat to the wilds of Utah which allowed him to portray a taciturn Montanan with a talent for taming horses.The way I've prattled on here, you'd think I was trying to use up some cell phone minutes.

An Important note I'm really tired of the two words functional and dysfunctional, but they are the politically and apparently medically correct terms that apply to the description below.  Not to mention the word family, which is over used, but for which there is simply no substitute.The surface story is about a thirteen year old girl, Grace Scarlette Johansson, who was thirteen when the movie was made  and her horse, Pilgrim, who are in an awful, tragic accident, leaving both the girl and the horse severely injured and traumatized.  The girl's mother finds a horse whisperer, Tom Booker Robert Redford, a man who knows instinctively how to help horses with people problems.  That's the up front and surface story.Mixed into this story is a sort of on and off and on again love story between the married and very successful mother, Annie MacLean Kristin Scott Thomas, and Tom Booker Redford, and how they try and relate and resolve a relationship as the movie progresses.The underlying and real theme of the movie is a truly beautifully told story about two families, the MacLeans and the Bookers; one a very functional, close knit, caring and loving family and the other, a dysfunctional divided and out of balance family who barely exist in the confines of an apparently very successful, by New York City standards, family, but who under the facade only exist together and don't really know how to be a family.  Gradually, as the two families mix, the dysfunctional family, so trapped in their careers and unsuccessful relationships, begin the long journey toward being a caring and decisionally loving family.  It's in this almost hidden story of the two families that the true purpose of the motion picture, the real point of the movie comes through.I saw the horse, girl, horse whisperer story the first time I watched the movie.  The second and third time I watched it, I saw the wavering love story, but it was the fourth time I watched it that I finally saw the true story that the producer and director, and star, Robert Redford, wanted to tell about the journeys people are given a chance to make.This is both an important and rare gym of a motion picture that truly has something to say to our culture.

Ever since his debut in 1980 with the highly successful Ordinary People, Redford has demonstrated a natural talent at directing actors, as well as a good eye when choosing collaborators for his projects; two important skills that have earned him awards and recognition through the years. In his fifth film as a director, 1998's The Horse Whisperer, Redford not only directs, but for the first time in his directorial career, he also plays one of the main characters in his movie. In The Horse Whisperer Redford is once again back in his element, as this is also the story of a troubled family, however, small problems arise that sadly diminish the power of the film.Loosely based on Nick Evans's novel of the same name, The Horse Whisperer is the story of Annie MacLean (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her daughter Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson), who travel to Montana looking for the famous horse healer Tom Booker (Robert Redford), in order to ask him to cure their horse Pilgrim. The problem is that on a cold winter day, Grace and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) were riding their horses when a terrible accident happened a truck hit them, instantly killing Judith, and tragically hurting Grace and Pilgrim. Both horribly injured, horse and rider are taken to the Horse Whisperer hoping to recover not only their health, but also the will to live. Not only Grace and Pilgrim will try to find peace in the West, but Annie too will discover a new way of seeing life under the care of the Horse Whisperer.Written by Eric Roth and Richard LaGravenese, The Horse Whisperer looks at first sight as another typical movie about a person's recovery after a traumatic event (in this case Grace's losing a leg and her best friend), however, more than dealing with the physical and psychological healing of the horse and it's rider, the movie deals with the emotional problems of a group of souls. The screenplay is not exactly faithful to the source novel, although it keeps the main story lines intact and despite the changes done the essence of the story is still well translated to screen. Some may disagree with me, but I think that the way Roth and LaGravenese build up the plot was considerably superior to Evan's book, and the toning down of the melodrama (although it's still a passionate story of romance) was for the most part beneficial for the story.An excellent director of actors, Redford lets his cast to completely domain this character driven melodrama, creating a very natural and real portrait of human emotions. As in the book, Redford makes a nice analogy between the healing of horses and the healing of emotions (of course, with the advantage of a visual medium), although in a subtler, less melodramatic tone. This is very notorious in the way he lets his actors to use body language to express themselves, using silences, stares and face expressions as ways to communicate emotions. Still, even when the movie is certainly focused on the actors and their characters, Redford allows himself to give the film an extraordinary good look with Robert Richardson's brilliant cinematography, which captures the majestic landscapes of Montana in a very impressive and beautiful way.Being a character driven story, the performances of the cast are essential for the success of the film, and in this case one could say that overall the cast did a good job in the movie. As Annie, Kristin Scott Thomas truly transmit the confusion of her character, torn between her life and the one represented by Tom Booker. As Tom, Redford is excellent, very effective in his role and completely becoming a character who expresses more with silence than with words. A young Scarlett Johansson appears as Grace, delivering a remarkable performance considering her young age. It's not a surprise that she went on to become a major actress as she grew up. In small but important roles, we find Sam Neill, Dianne Wiest and Chris Cooper as the main supporting cast of the movie, all giving an excellent performance despite their limited screen time.If a movie is really well directed, has good performances and a nice script, what could be wrong about it? The answer this time is sadly so simple that it hurts it's unnecessarily long. Pointing out this as a problem may sound like nitpicking, but it's long runtime truly damages the movie as it makes the film to drag a while, becoming tedious and boring at some point. I'm not saying that movies should not be long, what I'm saying is that in this particular case the long runtime feels unnecessary and out of place. I find the way Redford slowly develops his characters a notable feature of the movie, given that he allows us to really known them; however, I think that a better job of edition would have improved the final results a lot.Overall, The Horse Whisperer is a very good movie on its own right, and while not being exactly faithful to the source novel, it keeps the whole spirit of the book intact. While the long runtime truly damages an otherwise good film, it's still a very good recommendation to those looking for a character driven love story without exaggerated melodrama. It seems to me that once again, Redford has made a classy film. 6/10 "},{"Title":"A gifted horse trainer transforms a mother and daughter, helping them to re-discover what they value most.","Date":"1 January 2005","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":" The Horse Whisperer is a film of contrasts the driven career wife and mother whose husband and daughter don't quite meet her standard; the traditional ranch wife and mother who subordinates herself, with grace, to her family while wistfully wishing for just a bit more; the gifted horse trainer and cattle rancher who chose the rustic life over his city roots, at peace with his re-discovered values despite a painful divorce from the woman he loved; the loving husband who can never live up to his wife's expectations, though he spends his life trying to please her; the wounded teenage daughter who, unlike her father, rebels against her mother's attempts to mold her in her own image. The catalyst that brings all these contrasts together is a beautiful horse that is horribly injured, both physically and mentally, in an accident that also maims his young rider. Both are so traumatized that they have lost their will to battle their fear and despair. The mother finds a trainer known for his success in gentling troubled horses and drives horse and daughter from New York to Montana to meet him. His quiet strength, patience and ability to sense what is wrong has a profound effect, not only on the horse, but on the young daughter and her mother as well. The movie is long, but the healing process requires time. The pace of the film is appropriate to the unfolding of the story, the lush and majestic scenery and the serenity that seems to emanate from the vastness of the open spaces. The romance that develops between the mother and the trainer is poignant and compelling. The scene between them at the dance is worth the price of admission. Ultimately, the mother must make a choice between resuming her former life returning to (the city, her career and her family) and the seductive stability and tranquility she has come to cherish at the ranch with the man she truly loves and who loves her.

She obviously loves her daughter and her family.  She takes a trip from the city, leaving a loving husband back at home to wait for her.  Then she finds The Horse Whisperer  a wrinkled, stoop shoulder old man living in the middle of no where.  He looked like he could have been in his 70's.  So, what happens when a mother in her 30's takes a trip from the city, leaving her loving husband behind, to find help in the country... Obviously she will fall in love with a wrinkled up 80 year old toad who walks around in cowboy boots and hats while grunting through his meals prepared by the women folk, and eaten off of checkerboard table cloths.

Although a little bit long and moralist film, it has a perfect timing, the viewer does not get bored and the situation is credible. The plot is based on a teenager girl who suffers an awful accident with her horse and her best girlfriend. After this accident, the girl loses one leg and her spirit, and her horse becomes wild and violent. Her well prepared and career devoted mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), an editor of a magazine, decides not to sacrifice her daughter's horse, and tries to heal it, using the expertise of Tom (Robert Redford), a horse trainer. She leaves her husband (Sam Neil) in New York for a period, and moves to Montana with her daughter, towing a trailer with the injured horse. There, in Tom's ranch, not only the horse, but other wounds in the breast of her family will be healed. However, Tom and Annie will fall in love for each other, but the end of the romance will be too much moralist for the present days. Looks like the moral principles in those movies in the 40's and 50's. But perfectly credible! The movie has a great and long continuity mistake. Tom and Annie are riding horses and from the upper shots, Annie is wearing hat. In the closes, inserted between the upper shots, she does not have any hat . In the end of their ride, the hat appears on her shoulder. The accident scene, in the beginning of the movie, has too much cuts. Maybe an induced accident (like in Mary Lambert's 'Pet Sematary' ) would be more appropriate. But these last comments and remarks do not affect the quality of this enjoyable movie.

The other troubling thing I kept seeing over and over in the film is Scarlet Johansson's character kept trying to do things with her prosthetic instead of her good leg. I myself had a slow healing broken ankle and spent 9 months on a cast. You learn to use your good leg quickly, like when trying to climb a corral fence and mounting a horse from the side of your good leg, not your bad.

That film watched as two wealthy parents feebly attempt to rehabilitate their suicidal son. Assisting them is a psychologist, with whom the son bonds.Based on a novel by Nicholas Evans, The Horse Whisperer finds Redford telling a similar tale. It stars Kristin Thomas as a mother whose daughter (Scarlett Johanasson) becomes suicidally depressed after losing a leg during a horse riding accident. The horse was similarly scarred. Both horse and child are rehabilitated by Tom Brooker (Robret Redford), a horse whisperer with remarkable gifts for understanding people and horses.The Horse Whisperer's first act works well as a domestic drama. Young Scarlett Johansson conveys a powerful mixture of self-hate, depression and sadness, all of which she hides behind a facade of bitter sarcasm. Kristin Thomas is also fine as a mother who vows to preserve her daughter's will to live.By its second act, The Horse Whisperer has morphed into an idiosyncratic western. Tom Brooker is your traditional cinematic cowboy, stoic, tall, wise and wordless. But he's also something new a healer, a nurturer, a cowboy who solves problems with compassion rather than six-shooters.During its final act, The Horse Whisperer then become a full-blown romance. Stuck in a love-triangle, the film watches as Kirstin Thomas falls madly in love for Brooker. Here the film resembles trashy erotic fiction &#x96; she's a big city British girl, he's a fantasy cowboy, complete with tight jeans, manly aromas and buttocks of steel &#x96; but Redford's direction is restrained and he keeps the duo's love powerfully unrequited.8/10 &#x96; Overlong for its subject matter, and filled with too many fades, montages and musical swells, The Horse Whisperer is nevertheless interesting and at times handsomely shot.

Grace and her horse are also seriously injured as doctors must amputate Grace's right leg and the frightening incident leaves a lasting trauma not only on Grace but also on her horse, Pilgrim. Grace's mother and magazine editor, Annie MacLean is seeking Grace's recovery.She feels there's a link between her crippled, embittered daughter and Pilgrim's behavior. Learning about a horse trainer with a special gift, she takes Grace and Pilgrim to Montana where horse whisperer Tom Booker lives on a ranch with his younger brother Frank, Frank's wife Diane and their children. Tom's work with the horse also has a rejuvenating effect on the guilt-ridden Grace. Annie loses her magazine job, and the low-key romantic involvement between Annie and Tom develops during the summer, stifled by the unexpected arrival of Annie's husband, Robert MacLean.Directing himself for the first time, Redford has lavished his usual meticulous care on popular material that comes alive on the screen in ways that it never could on the page.The viewer may find this to be have similarities with The Bridges of Madison County but his directorial approach offers the kind of graceful stature, tenderness, and intelligence required to elevate the simple story. The film takes all the time it needs to let its characters heal and make their important decisions, and that alone makes it a refreshing alternative to the frantic pace of most big-studio movies.Also,it maintains a spiritual atmosphere and decent hold on personal problems, keeping the long journey to the cure compelling.And most of all,the movie improves in its source material despite of being old-fashioned and somewhat melodramatic.

Set primarily in the vastlands of Montana, the cinematography, editing, and direction create an unparallelled aesthetic, which is colored by a warm, bonded family whose members intend meaning in making their cattle ranch a working home. Verdant meadows, glistening streams, and the chiarascuro of sunrise and sunset luxuriate in the eye of the beholder.Onto to this serene landscape ride the mother, Annie; the daughter, Grace; and the horse, Pilgrim; all three are deeply wounded. The healer wears a denim shirt, a weathered face, and a history that has taught him to give No for an answer. His name is Tom Booker and he treats not people with horse problems but horses with people problems. Annie, Grace, and Pilgrim learn that this horse whisperer means for all creatures to fulfill their purpose. He includes himself in this stricture and will not brook interference even from the self-important New York editor who has driven two-thousand miles to urge him to heal his equine client.A well-structured script adapted by the brilliant screenwriter Richard LaGravenese and directed by star Robert Redford give the film a luxuriant pace in which to linger at a roundup barbecue or on a mountain ridge. Kristin Scott Thomas embues her character with a wide emotional range, and Scarlett Johansson as her disspirited daughter actualizes her role movingly. Robert Redford, Sam Neill, and Chris Cooper admirably portray decent men with examined lives. Diane Wiest and Ty Hillman are delightful as family members whose generous spirits shine on their loving faces.

What the creators have done for us is to give us a visual sense of place with beautiful pictures and a long list of conflicts to help mitigate the merciless demands of the movie medium to clip at a pace in physical form compared to the more psychic realm of writing.For those emotionally mature, the film presents many metaphors for the unfairness and draconian sensibilities of the emotions. On the other hand, the philistine-loving high-action dramas with sensationalized artificialities will find this film to be quite boring and too long.When presented with such astute observations and warnings of the human heart, we must somehow suspend our natural criticism when we see the Rockwellian choice of costume and iconic cotton-top naturalists, for the clich√© must have a purpose. The clich√© provides the visual effect of communicating what probably was so easy to write in the book, that of the mind looking back through the lenses of its feelings; for, when we experience emotional pain and longing, when we recall lost loves, we see the time and place through that love. When we see the two twin boys in the back of the truck, throwing out hay, it is from the angle of an angel looking down upon the two blonde headed, happy, boys wearing matching bright red and clean cowboy shirts. When we see the horse whisperer's buckskin gloves, they are none the worse for wear after working hard on the ranch. Gloves, hands, rope, and fences are among some of the visuals reverberating the thematic elements of the film.There is plenty to watch, and every moment we get to see more of the beautiful landscape.The most surprising non-event is that many feminists did not deride the film for its implications that strong-willed women subdue to the strong and gentle, manipulative touch of a man whose own understanding of how to direct the emotions of a horse translates well enough to a woman, teetering on the edge of filial impiety.Thanks go to those who created this movie for giving us a film of maturity, compassion, and beauty.

Redford plays the Perfect Man--a cowboy who understands women and horses, listens to classical music, is a source of wisdom and good counsel for all who come his way, and is ruggedly handsome to boot. Even Kristen Scott Thomas, a tough New York magazine editor, is a pushover for him. He fixes her broken daughter and her broken daughter's horse and then proves so irresistible to Kristen Scott Thomas that she is ready to abandon husband and career to live out her days on a Montana ranch.There is one really nasty scene whose nastiness seems to have escaped the film-makers. It takes place at a barn dance. Kristen Scott Thomas's husband has arrived from New York. Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas have a steamy dance in which they explore each other while her husband sits nearby, fortunately not looking their way.

In the film rendition, the relationship between Annie and Robert is just plain on the rocks, there is no love there, and they have cut out all scenes of lovemaking between this husband and wife. In my opinion this makes Robert much less likable, and it undermines the huge step that an affair with Tom really was. One even wonders what was the point of Annie's going back, since there was clearly no love there. Furthermore, I do not believe the budding romance between Annie and Tom was well expressed. The one exception is the dance scene - it was one of the most erotic, heart-breaking movie scenes I have ever scene, possibly the best scene in the movie.

I can't say if Robert Redford as Tom Booker is giving us the genuine and accurate technique of a rancher who deals mainly with the psychological problems of horses. Io me it's not that impressive staring a horse in the face for hours on end or fettering a foreleg so that it cannot leap. It's a kind of mental telepathy between man and beast I suppose, if you can believe that, and as for the horse without the use of one leg, well it puts the horse in a similar category to young Grace MacLean who has lost hers in a tragic accident in the snow.The casting is excellent and I particularly like Annie MacLean (Kristin Scott Thomas) who discovers the true meaning of happiness far from home in the sweeping vistas of Montana. The photography is so wonderful you can almost smell the freshness of the air in those wide open spaces.I like the home-spun philosophy and the little bits of wisdom that leap out of the script as we assess each saying in turn and think Yes...Life's like that or How true...when you put it like that! The message seems to be that you can still be happy even if your dreams are never likely to be realized.This is a film about human relationships falling apart at a dreadful pace. And then gradually, with all minds directed towards saving Pilgrim a beautiful horse shockingly injured in an accident, animosity towards others is temporarily forgotten and the healing process begins...both with the horse and all those concerned.The film is bound to inspire, make you think and perhaps urge you to reassess your own attitudes. Not everyone will agree with the ending to this story about a horse whisperer, but as I mentioned, Life's like that.By the way, I watched the sub-titles and learned a new word nickering.

Yes I am a guy but one who realizes that a movie  doesnt necessarily have to be violent to be good.  This movie has what action movies  dont have . . . heart.  The story of a horse and a girl who's injuries cause them pain  because the other's injuries cause them pain.  Their souls and love for each other  intertwine which is what gives this movie heart.  Kudos to Scarlett Johanson who should  have been nominated for an oscar.  She makes this movie believable by wearing her  characters pain on her sleeve.  You feel for her and wince everytime she falls or cries.   The love story is more of just a subplot.  The soul of the movie is the horse and the girl.   This movie deserves a definate 10!!!!

It could have been cut down by at least 20-40 minutes for a tighter, more intimate movie. The romance between Robert Redford and Kristin Scott Thomas' characters was unconvincing and a major waste of time and almost ruined the main story of the tragic accident and recovery of Scarlett Johansson's character and her horse which I thought was very well done part of the film.Sam Neill almost got lost in the shuffle until his final scenes when he admitted that the relationship between him and his wife was not as good now as it was in their earlier years. It was from the character's heart and mind and it was not a wasted moment. It was nice to see Chris Cooper as Redford's brother. He always puts me on notice every time he appears in a movie. Also, Scarlett Johansson in her first major role. Visually it was a beautiful-looking movie thanks to Oliver Stone's regular cinematographer Robert Richardson. I only saw the movie after buying Thomas Newman's musical score. His music cuts appear on many movie trailers in the past few years.Bottom line, I have very mixed feelings. It did not deserve the epic-size scope for an intimate, simple storyline. In this movie, Redford the director is better than Redford the actor. Compared to his other movies, this ranks much lower than Ordinary People, Quiz Show and even The Milagro Beanfield War. As of now, I have not seen A River Runs Through It or The Legend of Bagger Vance. At the same time, because of some very good performances, I did not feel it was a total waste of time.

The title suggests encouragement or good will. It opens with two girls horseback riding when an accident renders one dead, one legless and a horse turned wildly savage. Kirsten Scott Thomas plays an editor who doesn't want the horse to be put down so she convinces a rancher, played by Robert Redford to tame it. Beautiful photography throughout with director Redford applying his usual theme of loss and recuperation that worked well in Ordinary People. Redford's challenge is not the horse but the rider. Thomas is persistent and torn between feelings of confusion. We know that potential romance blooms but what really excels is Redford's view of Sam Neill who plays her workaholic husband seen as an honest man. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as the emotionally wounded daughter who must face her fear. Dianne Wiest is also good casting playing Redford's mother who observes but comes off as offering advice only when needed. It is not everyday that we are met with a film that respects the act of marriage and goes low for forbidden fruit. Redford's film captures that with a strong theme regarding healing and returning to where one's passion began.

Can Montanan horse expert Tom Booker (Robert Redford) help them? Sam Neill is on hand as Annie's husband in an aloof marriage.This is an outstanding drama that proves that ordinary life conveyed effectively is more engaging than the most overblown CGI-laden blockbuster with constant exciting things going on. Those types of movies have their place, of course, but they're usually only good when they include elements of ordinary life in which the viewer can relate (2009's Star Trek and 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness are good examples). As my title blurb points out, The Horse Whisperer is so potent it's a veritable spiritual experience (which I'll explain momentarily); you just have to be in the right mode for a long drama.One critic said Annie (Scott Thomans) and Tom (Redford) lack chemistry. Poppycock. Do you think director Redford would even do the film without the right actress in the starring role, an actress he had great chemistry with? Besides, the film itself proves this criticism wrong There's a barn dance sequence late in the film that builds-up to a dance scene. Tom and Annie look deeply at each other from across the room until they ultimately come together, while still looking into each other's eyes. This is EXACTLY how a man and woman look at one another when they love each other. The film expertly captures this intangible element.Despite the above scene, The Horse Whisperer doesn't play like a steamy romance novel at all (not that I've ever read one, lol). Redford was 61 during filming and looks it, even though he definitely looked good for his age (Scott Thomas was 36-37, by the way). As such, the love elements are decidedly low-key &#x96; a look, a touch, a word &#x96; elements that slowly build over the course of the story. I'm not going to say any more or give away the ending, but it concludes the way it had to &#x96; excellent job on this front.Johansson does a great job, particularly considering she was only 12 during filming. It goes without saying, don't expect the voluptuous young woman she would soon blossom into for 2002's Eight Legged Freaks or 2003's awesome Lost in Translation. Why do I call The Horse Whisperer a veritable spiritual experience? Because everything about it works to produce this effect &#x96; the story, the music, the cinematography, the locations &#x96; and maybe especially because it's a film about healing. Both Grace (Scarlett) and the horse desperately need healing, but so do Annie and her marriage; and I think maybe even Tom Booker.I don't know how else to describe The Horse Whisperer except to say that it's just a beautiful film and easily one of the greatest dramas ever made. If you love great films like Grand Canyon (1991), The Green Mile (1999), Whale Rider (2002) and Dances With Wolves (1990) you will also love this one. The Horse Whisperer shares qualities of these excellent movies, but is unique.To close, I'd like to share a powerful scene from late in the film (you might not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie, but it's only a mild spoiler at best) Booker tells Grace about this Blackfoot boy whom he was friends with and who became a paraplegic after an accident. Tom would visit him now and then, but the spirited boy he once knew was gone. It was as if he just went somewhere else. Grace responds, I know where he goes.

Scarlett J and her horse are involved in horrific accident which leaves both of them physically and psychologically scarred. Her mom Kristen Scott Thomas (always fine) tracks down horse whisperer Redford in Montana or thereabouts, and when he refuses to see them in NY she travels to his turf, Scarlett, damaged horse and all. Redford's family are nicely played, and there are tons of beautiful scenery where Robert calls home. What I liked best about this movie was the slow but persistent pace, along with the scenery and beautiful music.

There are great moments in the film such as where Grace has again ridden a horse (sort of in secret for the first time since the accident). And Grace later tells her mother 'nobody's ever gonna love me like this' - never fails to tear me up. It's because she referring to ALL her injuries inclusive of her physical, mental, and emotional state - which may be finally beginning to heal with the help of 'life' on this wonderfully beautiful cattle ranch. Another one is where a few minutes later Grace tells Redford the story of exactly how the accident happened (what an amazing, heart- wrenching scene she gives us). And Redford gives her some great fatherly advice and emotional 'relief' - we can feel her healing. Another is in the barn where Grace's mother / Redford finally talk about their feelings... an emotionally vulnerable woman, and a complete gentleman with enough character to know what is right for all of them.Finally, the emotional climax is where Grace enters the corral and confronts her fears about the horse. It's her chance, and all the supporting characters are there for her, standing up for her. In the end both her, the horse, and all 'the comebacks' come to total fruition and complete triumph. There are so many parallels between the injured horse and the flawed people that are emotionally involved in the story...All in all, this is really a 'comeback' movie - for Grace, the horse, for Redford's character, Grace's mother - all of them are in movie magic 'reality' learning to love again. THIS narrative is the real focus of the film... if you watch it again from this perspective, you'll see a very young and an incredibly gorgeous (quite visible even at such a young age) Scarlett to shine - better than in just the few glimpses of good acting that we manage to otherwise catch.

Beautifully filmed with the wide-open vistas of Montana contrasting against the big-city enclosed feeling of New York, this film brings deep contrasts across so many levels of landscapes, emotions, and characters.The plot involves a well-to-do family in the New York area composed of mother Annie (Kristen S. Thomas) who is a bossy editor of Cover fashion magazine, father Sam Neill (subdued lawyerly type), and their young teenage daughter Grace, wonderfully played by a burgeoning actress named Scarlett Johannson &#x96; ever hear of her? Grace loves to ride her favorite horse, Pilgrim, which forms one of the central themes.Emotions run deep and strong in undercurrents of relations. Does mom love her husband? Does mom love her job? Does mom love her daughter, or want to control her life. Does dad protect their daughter too much? It's clear that Grace loves dad, but less clear is how she feels about mom. These themes are prevalent undercurrents throughout the film. You can really see the ability in Scarlett Johannson who was only 14 when she made this film. You really feel her mental and physical pain struggling with teenage angst, while fighting a new battle against mental and physical angst. Powerful performance for someone so young.Cut to Montana, where Robert Redford delivers a spectacular performance as Tom Booker, horse whisperer whose special gift with horses is sought out by Annie. Or is Annie seeking more? You decide. In some ways, this reminds me of Crocodile Dundee in reverse, where Annie goes to the wilds of Montana seeking help with a suffering Pilgrim whom everyone wanted to put down, but maybe she also seeks help with healing her daughter, and even deeper, perhaps she seeks help with her own life choices. Redford skillfully directs, produces, and acts in this flick, and no one has ever done it better. He slowly reveals small bits of his life to Annie, and other layers get peeled back like an onion, with the same sad effect. Yet, he seems to be totally at peace with where he is, and Annie starts to seek that peace.Kristen S. Thomas is superb, but sometimes a bit unbelievably nervous. She has trouble adjusting from the New York minute lifestyle to the slow-down-pardner lifestyle of Montana. Sam Neill plays his typical role of a quiet, fatherly type who knows something is going on, and knows there's not much he can do except help pick up the pieces wherever they may fall. Excellent supporting roles add flavor as needed from Tom's family, in the form of young kids, his brother, and sister-in-law.You may laugh a little, but you will certainly have your heart strings pulled in multiple directions in this complex, moving film. The dance scene choreography between Annie and Tom is electric, stunning, and moving in its simple complexity of subtleties. I don't think I've seen a better dance scene ever.My only critique is that, at almost 3 hours, the film gets a little long. There were many scenes of running the cows in, and all involved with that, and other farm activities that really, after one or two, you get the point. There's no electronics here, so people do other things. I think 20 to 30 minutes could have been shaved off to bring this closer to 2 ¬Ω hours.Excellent plot, terrific acting, breathtaking cinematography, fine editing, and skillfully detailed directing. This is a film you will remember for a long time. Do yourself a favor and watch The Horse Whisperer. Enjoy.

The perfect place and way to portray this was through a lifestyle intimately connected with the earth (ranching) and a family steeped in traditional manners of simple honesty and courtesy.One scene which exemplified this focus-on-manners was when young Joe Booker (played by Ty Hillman) was talking with Grace. He asked her what it was like riding Pilgrim. She wasn't able to answer. He excused himself, politely.Joe Booker's manners and persona are always respectful, and this aspect of the movie, alone, tells us that we are in a far-different place, ethically, than modern-day U.S.A. Chris Cooper (as Frank Booker) does a magical job of showing this deep but practical respect for people and the land, as well. This deeply traditional and reverent family ranch was adeptly juxtaposed to the frenetic, distraught and disconnected life lived by the horse's owner's family.The sparse, direct and vital dialogue between Redford (as Tom) and Johanssen (as Grace) was the interface between those two worlds, and Tom's silence was just as significant as his succinct words. One lesson I got from this movie is the (sometimes graceful) acceptance of reality, including the changes that it brings.The scenes with Tom and Pilgrim are particularly insightful and intuitive, especially for Hollywood. We are compelled to wonder whether Tom had learned some kind of Native American energy (aura) assessment of the horse and had learned to communicate by controlled vibration or projected visualization. In The Horse Whisperer, Tom Booker healed two hearts, those of Grace and Pilgrim, while exposing his own to injury.The end result for the relationship between Annie and Tom, though, is not a formulaic tragedy or victory The wounds must be realistically and gracefully accepted along with the pleasures enjoyed A state of mind and soul that leads to an even disposition.One critical and beautiful part of the movie made me cry Cherry Cooper (as veterinarian Liz Hammond) asked Annie for permission to put down Pilgrim. Hard-bitten executive Annie looked in Pilgrim's eyes.., and replied, No.From this one word alone, we can see what Tom saw in her.I could have done without the branding/roping scenes, but that is perhaps my own denial of reality, and will not give this movie any fewer than ten stars.

A large part of the story involves the mother's lust for another man. The husband was not shown as insensitive, uncaring, unsupportive or uncommunicative, so evidently we were not supposed to sympathize with this woman.It didn't sit well with me the way they seemed to be pushing the girl to get better before she was ready, treating her as though there were something wrong with her and she should just snap out of it. To me it didn't seem like it had been very long, and rushing her doesn't seem like a good idea when everyone does things at a different pace.The movie overall seemed to drag; I think they could have taken out the whole affair part because it didn't really seem to have any purpose anyway, and that would have gotten it down to a normal length. The recovery of the horse was painfully slow, with many failures, just like in life. Trouble is though, this is a movie, so we need things to move along a little faster to maintain our interest. Not only was there not much whispering, but the man didn't even seem to have any special technique. It just didn't seem to make sense why this woman would want to spend so much money to fix this particular horse, when the process was so iffy, and the safety of her daughter was at stake.The accident scene was very well done. The trip to the ranch was a little ridiculous, driving cross-country with an unmanageable horse. (How did they feed it all this time, when they couldn't even get near it?) The scene at the hoedown was pretty intense. The final scene with the horse is kind of disturbing since he really didn't seem ready, though it's awesome when that horse gets up.Nobody really wowed me here with their performances. Scarlett was pretty good, as long as she didn't have to cry.Was it inspiring? I'm not sure. I want to give it a higher score since I feel like it is some kind of classic, but I just did not have that feeling of being charged up for the next day or so like I do when I see a good movie, or thinking about it all the next day. The affair and the rushing of the girl's progress left a bad aftertaste, if anything. It was a kind of low-key movie.

He was beautiful but spoke his own language, one I could not understand. The alliance was too fragile to know the wealth of secrets he had in his heart. There was too much fear to get past. The emotional highs and lows of the movie equalled the depth that I did not know I was capable of. It's a movie about coming to the realization that there are some things we can never understand. Ultimately, there are events that happen when we least expect that will forever change our perspective in life. I disagree with Tom Booker's philosophy when he says, I never ask why it happens. When the mind does not have an answer, it will always look to fill the void. If there is no answer provided, something needs to be put into that void. Who was it that said, Hope is greater than fear? Out of the ashes, there is always a hope for healing and transformation. I have been moving to discover my own empowerment and ability to transform what has felt like devastation.

There's a scene in The Horse Whisperer that takes place at the Booker home where a montage of old family photos is shown. One includes a couple of young boys with Santa Claus; they are Buck and Smokie Brannaman as kids. Buck is the one on the left.Regarding this film, I was stunned when I pulled it up on the IMDb and saw that it's user rating is 6.4 as I write this. I usually don't comment on such things, but in this case I have to urge potential viewers to disregard that score. I can't think of a more compelling film to watch that deals with the trauma of personal loss, injury and failed family relationships. Though the story may be built around a horse called Pilgrim, it has more to do with the way Tom Booker (Robert Redford) uses his own unique ability with horses to role model such personal attributes as patience, honor and integrity when dealing with family and the circle of friends and neighbors that show up in the story.The one thing I would caution potential viewers about is the way the picture initially unfolds. The accident that sets up the story is one of the most horrifying scenes you'll ever witness in what's nominally a family movie. I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I winced more than once while watching Grace (Scarlet Johansson) and her friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) get in trouble on the icy hillside with their horses. For me, that scene stayed with me the entire story, casting it's shadow over young Grace's rehabilitation and recovery, even as she comes to a personal reconciliation with herself and her mom (Kristin Scott Thomas) at the Booker ranch.Otherwise, the movie gets my welcome recommendation. Actor and director Redford does a fine job on both sides of the camera, along with co-stars Thomas and Johansson. The story moves slowly at times, primarily in those scenes used to demonstrate Booker's technique in getting to know and understand his patient. The picture's defining moment is realized when he completely wins over both Pilgrim and Grace in the scene when she gets to ride him for the first time since the accident. With the same calm self assurance that he exhibits throughout the picture, Tom Booker says to Grace - Trust me just one more time.

At first, I really didn't like Grace's (Scarlett Johnansson) attitude after the accident. However, as the film went on, I got to like her more. Also, I felt really sad when Judith (Kate Bosworth) didn't survive the accident. Everything else about the film was good. That especially includes the production design and performances. Now, in conclusion, if you enjoyed the title novel of the same name, I strongly recommend very heartfelt and poignant drama with a good cast and strong performances.

To advise a whip was used is very misleading, it takes great love, patience and dedication to train these horses so well. My sister is a horse whisperer of the Perelli method and I have watched her and there is no hint of violence. I am concerned that a person who does not know this would think the horse was rearing in fear rather than as a trained response to the trainers coaxing to rear. It is an awesome thing to stand near a horse who is carefully waving his hoofs in the air. I'm sure the film makers did not intend the tool be visible, so it is a gaff, but viewers should be aware that it may be called a whip, but it is not used as one.

Everything happens in beautiful Montana seems so romantic that allows you to forget anything else. It's the ending that brings you back to the reality that everyone living in the world has to face for. I'm glad to see, between reason and passion, both Tom and Annie choose the reason because that's what life is about.

That was far before the movie was made and far before I had to enjoy a film that was so different from the book I so loved.  That said, I didn't enjoy the movie the first time I watched it.  I was disgusted, disappointed, and very upset with Redford for destroying the heart of the book.The premise is the same  Girl gets in gory accident on horse.  Friend dies. Girl loses leg.  Horse loses spirit.  Mom calls a loner in Montana (home of the big-sky country).  So in these respect, Redford allowed we readers to get sucked back into the book all over again.  He did an excellent job with the huge expanses and the scenes with the horses and him are very peaceful. He encompasses and inner-strength that comes across on the screen immediately.Then come the differences  Tom should be a youger man!  Redford wouldn't do a sex scene (which would give this story justice) because of his aging body. There should be a baby in the movie, but since there is no sex because of aforementioned body issues, there is no baby.  There is no death at the end (I won't mention whose, but you readers will know).  The climax of the movie is, frankly, anti-climactic.  Instead of focusing on the love between two very strong, and very hurt characters, Redford focused on the horse.  He missed that the horse was just a metaphor for all of them.  There was no redemption!Overall, the movie should be viewed without having read the book.  As I continue to watch it, it becomes better and better.  The furter I get from reading the beloved novel, the more I can respect this film as a completely independent piece of work.  But if you love the book and are looking for the Tom and Annie that Evans wrote, read it again - don't rent Redford's version of them.

Surprisingly the ending is a tad more believable than that in the book, although I do wonder  whether anyone these days has the degree of self sacrifice in their makeup that we were led to believe that Annie had. If you have read the book and were dissatisfied with the outcome - then see the movie - all this has been changed.The action shots with the horse are marvellous and I must admit that Redford held his own in these - it was only when it got gooey that he looked uncomfortable and out of place.

Unlike the aforementioned film, however, the plot is dull and the characters dumb. Bob Richardson saves this film from itself. The director of photography, better known for his Oliver Stone films  than any others, scores what may be his best yet as DP. The visuals are simply stunning and, for me, left me yearning for more nature shots and less horse listening and child whining. This may be the the most apathetic Redford character since Three Days Of The Condor and audience apathy certainly doesn't  help out Redford in any role other than like the one he had in the thrilling Condor. He needs to direct, i.e. River and Ordinary People or act. Not both at the same time. He has lost  his appeal with women under the age of 50, and should not consider himself the playboy that he once was, i.e. no more roles like the one he had in Indecent Proposal. I respect Redford and believe that he can be one of the more influential directors during the next 20 years, but I think he needs to envision himself behind the monitors instead of in front of the camera.

But the actual plot is very similar to Redford's first film, Ordinary People, both about a young person who has been traumatized with a perfectionist mother and a warm, giving father.  Also, there is the similarity between the impact of the down-to-earth psychologist in Ordinary with that of the down-to-earth horse whisperer.  In addition, Horse Whisperer is beautifully photographed, from start to finish.  Redford is at his peak in capturing the small beauty of simple scenes alongside the breathtaking wonder of the high Rockies.  My teenage son, who is not given to being maudlin, left the film fairly choked up.  He could not get over the eye to eye contact between the girl and the horse, and the unspoken feelings therein.

The movie (as all Robert Redford movies) is about the life of normal people, in a dramatic predicament that changes them forever. The situation in which these characters are involved, is so shocking, that I couldn¬¥t ignore them. I felt pain and sorrow for them, because this is something that could happen to any of us and we should be aware or at least prepared for it.I think that Redford, as always, makes us observe and analyze, what we sometimes possess and don¬¥t want to see, only because we see it every day. We have to, sometimes, suffer to realize that there are wonderful things in our lives...When I saw Robert Redford¬¥s directorial debut Ordinary People, I thought, this could happen to my family, to me... I felt terrified. Redford, has achieved making me feel that way every time I watch his films.In this movie, his directorial task is at its best. The cinematography is the one thing I truly admired through all the movie. I really feel he knew how to give the audience a moment of calm and relaxation after those excessively emotional scenes, in which I couldn¬¥t do anything, but weep and feel sorry for the characters¬¥ pain.All the actors are excellently (and I could say perfect) cast. Even the horse¬¥s work was as realistic as I could expect. That scene in which the rescue team finds Pilgrim after the accident, was so shocking to me that I started crying because the only thing I could think of, was the animal¬¥s confusion and sorrow.The images are as vivid as in the book. In fact, this is the second time in which the cinematographic language resembles the literary language in a strict way. Robert Redford managed to recreate Nicholas Evans¬¥ world as Barbra Streisand did with Pat Conroy¬¥s The Prince of Tides. And these two works even have the same structure, but each director made it their own by including the personal touch.I read that Redford edited his picture from 3 1/2 hours to 2 hours and 50 minutes. I have never criticized any film because of its length or pace, but I think this film¬¥s length was unnecessary.

They were just telling the story, sitting around the fire. That reminded me Out of Africa stuff, in a way. And thanks to this unhurried pace you gain some time to think and to feel together with the characters. Unfortunately, vast majority of films never give you such a chance for they are either full with too much action turns rushing one after another in a lightning mode or are completely deprived of any thought to engage your head with.Redford is an I've-seen-it-all kind of guy as in most of his movies of late. One can rarely argue the truths his mouth is uttering but I do disagree with his I never ask why it happens philosophy.  Unless you do it you are doomed to suffer the same pains all life long which is understandably hardly welcomed by a human being with reason.And one thing more It's good to see two people require more than 15 minutes to fall in love but of no less admiration is also the way-out the producers let them find in the maze of their feelings, passions and obligations.

After seeing the movie, I would have to say that the only negative comments I agree with is regarding some of the not-so-gentle horse-healing techniques(specifically towards the end, Tom's last-ditch effort involving a rope -- very disturbing!).However, I loved most of the rest of his interactions with the horse, especially when he was gentle and let the horse come to him when it was ready -- very moving.I found the chemistry between Redford and Thomas to be very charged and romantic.  Instead of the in-your-face passion I am used to seeing in movies it was more subtle and under-played.  You could tell the feelings were there but that they were both reluctant to express or act on them because of the consequences. They said it all with glances and subtle body language -- much more realistic under the circumstances.I agree it was longer than most movies I usually like to watch, but it was so engaging that I didn't notice how long it was until after it was over. The pace was slow, but I never found it boring and I never got restless (I was probably too busy blowing my nose! ~smile~).If you are looking for a fast-paced action thriller or a steamy romance, look elsewhere.  But if you want a well-acted, beautifully filmed, emotionally realistic character study of a family (and a horse) on the road to physical, spiritual and emotional healing -- as well as drop-dead gorgeous scenery! -- then this is the movie for you.

Yes, I agree the book was well written and the opening scene is one of the most powerful I have ever read. BUT-- one of the marks of a great book is that the author creates believable characters and then lets them create the story.  (A great author NEVER imposes a plot development or, especially, an ending, on his or her characters.)  The ending of the book version is powerful, but contrived. There are many other ways out of the dilemma than the one Booker consciously or unconsciously takes.  The ending of the MOVIE on the other hand grows directly out of the characters and is not imposed at all.  And changing the ending allows the writers to take out the other contrived scene-- the one at the outbuilding during the dance. The ONLY criticism I have of the movie is that the events in the first third or so are too rushed-- more like a summary than a story.  Of course I realize that nobody is going to go see a four hour movie, but that's how long it needed to be. The acting is great-- ALL of it, even Redford, who usually plays the same character over and over again, but not this time. Newman did a fabulous job on the music.

I was surrounded by a huge crowd of giggling, middle-aged women who had gathered in swarms in selected parts of the theater. Probably the exact same crowd who collectively sobbed away during Bridges of Madison County and Legends of the Fall a couple of years back.Robert Redford is a competent director, no doubt about it. He's got a great cast here, a beautiful countryside to show off and some potentially interesting psychological territory to exploit. There is a dysfunctioning family, a tragic accident and some moral dos and don'ts, but not much more. The film is well made, but never interesting. I found myself waiting for some sort of climax that never happened. There's no chemistry between the characters and it's simply too long and slow-paced for my taste. I fail to get emotionally involved in a film about the mental recovery-process of a horse and a bunch of depressed people who constantly cry, scream or ride around in slow-motion in search of themselves and a better life.A few questions came to mind during the course of the film Who in their right mind would travel thousands of miles across the american continent with an injured horse, when the most simple and affordable thing would be to shoot it and simply buy a new one? And if you take away the beautiful scenery, the romantic dinners and sentimental background-music, isn't a married woman who fools around with another man still a hussy?If you're not a fanatic horse-lover or someone who enjoys a good summer -flirt, you might as well pass on this film. My girlfriend is happy she didn't, and judging from the tears in the eyes of most of the other female members of the audience, so are they.

By the way, the gift of the character Tom Booker (played by Robert Redford) towards horses is amazing.My major criticism goes to the very long runtime of the movie (more than 2 hours and a half, which is too much) and to the brief romance between Tom Booker and Annie MacLean. Not that I'm against romance, but because these characters's romance is a romance without a future. Besides, this movie is slow and tends to be a bit boring, becoming literally tiring.

I realize this is film, the truck is nowhere near the horse, but it is impossible to watch an animal become injured by the stupid thoughtless actions of a silly spoiled little girl. That she looses her leg, her best friend, and ruins her valuable horse as a consequence is supposed to cause sympathy for her character, but it does not. Enter Annie (Kirstin Scott Thomas), Grace's power-suited, NYC magazine editor mother who realizes that the injury to her daughter is more than just a physical problem, and to the severely traumatized horse, the decision to put the animal down would be the most humane. Annie understands that she must take the initiative with her depressed and petulant daughter to keep the girl from becoming like the angry animal that Pilgrim has become. In desperation, she contacts a Montana rancher who specializes in the rehabilitation of problem people through their misunderstood horses. Tom Booker (Redford) is a laconic character of few words but great patience when it comes to healing animals and their human caretakers. In the process, he comes to heal both Pilgrim and Grace, but also, he and Annie begin to fall in love.Robert Redford directs films which are visual love affairs with the great western landscape as in A River Runs Through It. This film is equal to the cinematic beauty of that film and in some cases, surpasses it. Although horses are flight or fright creatures, the film tries to sell the notion of the animal protecting the young rider at the risk to its own life. This is simply stupid. Horses will run over a human without a second thought if given the opportunity much less rear against an 18 wheel Peterbilt truck, so this aspect of the film is fantasy. However, as Pilgrim comes to trust the human touch again through the alternative techniques of Booker, so too do Grace and Annie heal their relationship as mother-daughter and later between Annie and her husband (Sam Neill).Teaching that healing the spirit of broken creatures whether animal or human come through acts of kindness and patience, the Horse Whisperer is a slowly evolving story of love in its several forms, e.g., love of man for animals, human love, love of the land, and love of those whose injuries are slow to heal. It is an almost zen-like meditation deftly painted on film. Redford directs a secondary cast of dream character actors led by Diane Wiest and Chris Cooper, and wonderful youngsters who portray the rambunctious sons of Cooper and Wiest. All actors are thoroughly credible and true to their characters, esp. the very young Scarlett Johansson. Once away from the ineffectual setting of urban savagery, the Montana ranch life heals everyone although loss is inevitable.

The Horse Whisperer is a favourite book which I have read many times, so I was excited about seeing the film. I read the reviews on IMDb first and was surprised to see many people saying that the love affair between Tom and Annie was irrelevant, but having now seen the film I can see what they mean. In the book their affair is beautiful and passionate, a true meeting of souls that they just couldn't help, and it was intrinsic to the plot and the healing of the whole family - if this seems unlikely read the book for yourself! The ending of the book (I won't spoil it for you here) has been called melodramatic by some but brings the whole thing to an end and a new beginning. However in the film their affair did appear irrelevant, a kind of add-on which did nothing for the story. I'm not usually a fan of Kristen Scott Thomas who is about as passionate as an iceberg (see The English Patient), but although I thought she was very good here the way the Annie's character grows and develops in the book was not shown in the film. The ending (of the film) was frankly bizarre - to just drive away without a glance seemed to show that Annie too thought the affair was not that important and betrayed the passion they felt for each other. Shame.

I loved all the characters actually, but I do agree that there is no chemistry between Kristin and Redford.One of my favorite characters was the grumpy old man outside the hotel where Annie and Grace were staying. Redford's character is on his way to see the horse for the first time and the grumpy guy says goin to see that horse I hope you got insurance.Chris Cooper was great as Tom's brother too. Sam Neill was perfect as Robert MacLean. I found myself wondering which man I would select if I had to choose between Redford and Neill. They are both such handsome men. But there is no choice. If I were already married to one of them, I'd remain faithful to my husband. If I were single, I'd have a tough time choosing. The deciding factor would be which man treated me best. Which one made me feel most comfortable. Since I would also want to make him happy, I'd select the one who felt that I was a good partner for him.

The acting and story are very well done, and the gorgeous Montana vistas are really something to see.

The best part of the movie tell us how Grace (Scarlet Johannson) gets rid of at least part of he anger and finds the strength to overcome the consequences of an accident that cost her a mutilation and her best friend life. All this takes places in the natural beauty of Montana, that certainly doesn't need corn-dripping additions such as handsome cow-boys singing songs of love under the starry sky. Things get dicey when Tom (Robert Redford), the handsome but long-in-the-tooth cow-boy who is treating Grace's horse and Annie, the strong-willed but way too uptight mother fall in love. With all due respect for Robert Redford, I think he's a little over the hill to play rolls in the hay with Kristin Scott-Thomas, who does a great job in portraying an icy career woman who slowly warms up to the apparently uncomplicated fellow.

The romance of the book is indeed both beautiful and touching, but it is also in some parts (the ending, in particular) melodramatic and somewhat shallow. Redford didn't make a mistake when choosing to focus a little more on the other aspects of the story. In his hands, the film has become a beautiful drama, with a subtle but perfectly heart-gripping romance to it. If the adaption had been more faithful to the novel, it might very well have turned out to be nothing more than another Hollywood turkey!All in all, the film is an overwhelming experience, highly recommended.

It had a good story line in the beginning and you got emotionally into it during and after the tragic accident with Grace and Judith. Being a horse person, I knew the behavior of the horse afterwords was a little far fetched, but thats what happens with most movies. From the get go, I noticed the training methods of The Horse Whisperer were based on fear. This is definitely never the way to go while training horses, so I was skeptical. But I continued t watch, assuming I was mistaken. And for a bit, I believed I was! But the thing that really set me off was in the scene near the end where Tom got Pilgrim saddled. He tied the horse's leg to the saddle horn and made him run around and buck! This is extremely dangerous and could've resulted in a broken leg, snapped neck, even death for the horse. And I know what you're saying, its just a movie. But they had to get the shot somehow, didn't they? This training method could be considered abuse, using fear and force to get the horse to lay down. On top of this, the wife is cheating on her husband with Tom! This is downright unnecessary to the story and wrong. Her husband isn't a bad guy or anything, she just wants to be in the country. Overall, the 3 stars I gave the movie were for the beginning. I consider it animal abuse what he did to the horse. I have been riding for most of my life, I know what I'm talking about. Also, it is just wrong how they had the wife cheating. I, personally as a horse lover, do NOT recommend this movie.

The uptight business woman has never done much for me, especially after reading Susan Faludi's book Backlash in which she convincingly portrays these characters as veiled attacks on intelligent, independent women (the character arc of Annie follows pretty exactly the pattern of these characters, becoming warmer as she is moved away from her job).The best thing in the movie is the part involving the horse.  It is fascinating to see this poor injured beast go through a transformation, and to see the girl go through a similar one.  Toss out the romance and focus this movie entirely on that (which wouldn't be hard, just cut an hour out and you could have that very movie) and you would have had something really special.  As is, the movie is well done and I quite enjoyed it, but compared to Redford's best films, Ordinary People and the Milagro Beanfield War (Whisperer kind of aims for a middle ground between these two very different movies) it's really pretty dumb.

The romance was unbelievable and gave me the creeps  because there was no reason for it to develop in the plot except because two  good looking people were near each other. The horse whisperer's moves seemed contrived, especially after seeing a documentary about a real horse  whisperer. The scenery was pretty, but also contrived. In one shot two kids are positioned just right so that you can see a rainbow in between them. By the  way, it hasn't been raining. In another scene a character just gawks at the  scenery... no other content to this scene. And the plot holes. 1) HW claims in phone conversation that he is too busy with clinics and that he doesn't work one on one. Then he gives months of his seemingly uninterrupted  ranching life now up to work with her horse. 2) The kids are out of school the whole time. One claims he is let out early to work the ranch and then we have a scene where it is supposed to be Spring.That's mighty early. 3) There is no motivation for marital tensions, yet the husband seldom calls while his beloved daughter is away. Who is the one that is too busy with work? 4) Usually when there is a scene involving the recollection and retelling of a tragic event its purpose is to fill in the mysterious blanks that the viewer is wondering about. But when the little girl finally breaks down and tells her story, there are no surprises. We have seen already in detail what happens. The only purpose of the scene then is to aggrandize the HW and his wise ways. Well, if he is so wise, why does he make the mistake that juvenile mistake he makes  in the movie?All in all, I hated this film. The main characters came off as morally sleezy instead of romantic. The scenery was pretty, but not movie-making. The  characters were questionably inauthentic, except for the HWs family. My  recommendation is that you save your time.

If The US is still that beautiful, then I guess the folk in Montana have been doing something right to keep it so pristine, or the land is so valuable, condominium-builders just can't afford to gobble it up. Flying and driving to get there (as shown in the film), today, is almost out of the question. There is no time-frame to give viewers how long all this action took. Besides,You'd have to live on the land and provide everything life requires, as the Bookers did.....not many people are willing to do that, today. All that tranquility is the fruit of life, if we use it.I was not familiar with the plot directed by Robert Redford. I was imagining some Indian character to do the whispering; I suppose the purpose was to show that ordinary people don't have that capability. Although I thought Redford (Tom Booker) was excellent in his role, I was waiting for something to happen. That's not usual for me - I like long movies. However, I thought the coolest of directors and actors took just a trifle too long in that department. I wasn't convinced he was saying healing things to the horse (Pilgrim). I thought the horse was better than the whisperer.In other words, I thought it took too long for Booker to tell his client he was trying to protect you, at the scene of the accident. It was apparent to me.I liked Booker's family much better - down-to-earth people. Annie MacLean (Krist Scott Thomas) was very appropriate for the overly-sophisticated editor-role - Robert MacLean (Tom Neil) was excellent in his role.I suppose I must watch this again, as advised by some other users. Now that I'm informed I'm not going to see magical things between horse and Indian, I may view it in a completely different light.

The cinematography is often breathtaking, and the horses are also great actors in this as well. Watch when the problematic horse gets a saddle put on him since the accident. The eyes dart, the ears twitch, the feet pace nervously. I mean, does this horse have a mind or what?

Appropriately slow, with good character development, it features what, in retrospect, was an all-star cast of young talent. It is a movie I could watch every month and never get tired of it.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Robert Redford plays Tom Booker, living on a ranch in Montana, and who we come to know as the horse whisperer, one who can calm horses by what he says to them in a low voice. Rising star Scarlett Johansson plays Grace who, while on a morning ride in rural New York in the snow, has an accident which kills her friend Judith (rising star Kate Bosworth), cases Grace to lose a leg, and severely injures her horse. Grace's mother is Annie (Kristen Scott Thomas), a very busy New York executive who takes time off to hunt up Tom Booker, and convince him to work with the horse, and more importantly, with Grace.Most of the movie is filmed on the ranch in Montana, the healing process is gradual and difficult, but eventually succeeds. Annie and Grace's dad, Robert (Sam Neill), have become 'cool' to each other, and Annie develops a romance with Tom. In a nice bit of writing, in the end Annie and Robert appear to be making strides to improve their relationship, instead of Annie ending up with Tom.Other notables in this movie are Dianne Wiest, Chris Cooper (one of our better actors working today), and Cherry Jones (another fine but under-appreciated actress).The movie has special meaning to me because I first saw it in the theater in 1998 in Kalispell, Montana, during my month-long vacation there.

For about three hours he whispers to them, which really isn't so much whispering as it is looking them in the eye like he's trying to seduce and bed them down. It's a silly plot about a horse healer or some such thing and a mother and a child who moved from New York to Montana to see him. The child (Scarlett Johansson) and the mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) are facing a difficult time. Johansson was in an accident during a horse riding adventure and hit by a semitruck. Johansson ends up losing her leg, while the horse losses its sanity and has an apparent mental breakdown. Yeah that's right. It's a movie about a horse with mental problems. About that and the deeper meaning of a mother reconciling with her daughter. Yay! Luckily Robert Redford who plays the down home, living the simple life on a ranch guro comes to their rescue after they seek him out. The movie has some great scenery and photography but so do all them commercials that advertise that you should go to Montana on vacation. Lots of mountains, grass, and cloudy sky seen time and time again with panoramic shots let us know what a great place Montana truly is. As I write this now, I'm tempted to say to hell with all this technology rubbish, toss out the computer and head out to Montana to find myself by working on a ranch, talking to disturbed horses, riding in slow motion on the prairie, and shoveling horse s**t, not worry about getting too smelly cause I can always go bathe in the crystal clear steam which conveniently runs through the backyard which happens to consist of about 1,000,000 acres. Yes the city and even the rural areas are great. But living in a town you can't shovel horse s**t or talk to them. The Horse Whisperer is 3 hours long but it really should only be about 80 minutes. Since much of the movie is landscape shots, horses running around in slow motion, and just about everything else in slow motion... I figure there's only about a little more than an hours worth of actual movie. It reminded me of another Redford film, A River Runs Through It, but unlike that movie this one really doesn't have a set course. And naturally we have a love story. Robert Redford is in this thing ya know. Kristen Scott Thomas falls in love with him even though she's married to Sam Neill's character. You remember Sam Neill right? He's that actor doomed to the Jurassic Park franchise, three equally as boring films. The Horse Whisperer manages to be about the most melodramatic and soap operaish thing you've ever seen and does so without any Quite frankly my dear scenes. Instead it follows the pathetic formula of the worst lifetime movie falling in love story. We get the looks across the room, we get the slow dance set to a sad country music song, just about anything that applies to the word sappy. So I don't know what's worse the horse story, the little girl/mother story or the married woman falling in love with Robert Redford story. Pick any of em' and they're equally clich√©d to hell. This is one movie that just goes on, and on, and on and nothing really moves forward. Just lots of uninteresting sentimentality, slow motion, closeups, and mountains. I'd rather shovel horse s**t. That'd be less boring.

After that scene, the story of caring parents trying to find a way to guide their daughter and her horse to healing is nothing short of redemptive, because as each heals, they each help the other to heal.  And Redford's role as the titular Horse Whisperer provides the key link to the process.The subplot of a love story is, IMO, unnecessary and detracts from the plot.  But in all other respects, this is a fine film, one that gives hope to those who have experienced trauma, and helps those who haven't understand it a bit better.

It's about a young girl, Grace, who survives a terrible accident with her horse and looses part of her leg.  Her mother, Annie, is determined to get them healed again.  She turns to a horse whisperer named Tom Booker who is known with his great work with horses.  She puts her total faith in him in hopes that Grace, her horse, and her own broken heart will be mended.The differences between the film and the book are big.  In the book, Tom dies when a wild horse rears up and crushes his skull.  Here, his goodbye to Annie is uncerimoniously ended when she sends him to saddle up the horses and she just drives away.  I have to say I was really dissapointed with some of the changes.   The movie is beautifully shot and I really enjoyed the film but the film was crawling along at a very slow pace.  I recommend this film but because of the pace, I have to take some points away.6.5/10      "},{"Title":"A bit too long...","Date":"26 May 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":"  The perceived length of a movie has little to do with its length as measured by the clock.  Most of us have seen 1 1/2 hour films that dragged on interminably, and 3 hour movies that seem to fly by.  I think it has to do with pace and timing, as well as our level of involvement in the film.  In that regard, I'd say that The Horse Whisperer is definitely a bit too long, although I tend to enjoy longer movies that take time to tell their story (like The Green Mile for instance).  This one doesn't seem to use the time as wisely as it could.  Yet it's thoroughly enjoyable, and quite a good watch if you like films with this sort of plot.  It definitely has an Out of Africa sort of scope and feel to it, but a chick flick it is not (for a consummate example of a chick flick, see You've Got Mail).  This one is for anybody who can enjoy a romance (nope, didn't think it was too melodramatic) and a story about healing in general -- not for those who need a constant undercurrent of tension driving the plot, however -- and of course, it's not for someone looking for a special-effects extravaganza.  The cinematography is glorious however, and it should be seen on DVD, preferably on a big wide-screen TV for best effect.Overall, a worthwhile way to spend a slow Monday (Memorial Day) afternoon -- 7.5/10.

My people are ranchers from Northern Idaho, near Montana where this film was shot.  Redford managed to capture the true essence of a lifestyle almost wiped by progress.  All of the details of the family could have been lifted from my family photo album. The premise of a neurotic New Yorker bringing her injured horse and equally injured daughter out west to find the renowned horse whisperer to save her world is completely believable.  Redford plays the character of Tom Booker perfectly, his technical aptitude with the horses was just right.  Dianne Weist provides a stellar performance as the matriarch of the ranching family.The book was a bit brutal for my taste, I favored the gentler ending of the movie. Otherwise, the film was true to the book.  I would recommend this move as a must see, must buy.

It is, in my opinion, a superior movie about relationships.  Some want to compare it to Redford's A River Runs Through It because it is set in Montana and features breathtaking scenery.  But the actual plot is very similar to Redford's first film, Ordinary People, both about a young person who has been traumatized with a perfectionist mother and a warm, giving father.  Also, there is the similarity between the impact of the down-to-earth psychologist in Ordinary with that of the down-to-earth horse whisperer.  In addition, Horse Whisperer is beautifully photographed, from start to finish.  Redford is at his peak in capturing the small beauty of simple scenes alongside the breathtaking wonder of the high Rockies.  My teenage son, who is not given to being maudlin, left the film fairly choked up.  He could not get over the eye to eye contact between the girl and the horse, and the unspoken feelings therein.

However, beneath the glamorous carapace, her life is riddled with the modern malaise.  Unable to spend time with her 13-year-old daughter Grace, Annie 'bribes' the girl with material goods, lazily assuming that these will replace emotional commitment.        One of Grace's material possessions is her fine stallion, Pilgrim.  She and her friend Judith go riding in the early morning, the gorgeous snowy dawn and the carefree laughter of the two friends contrasting markedly with Annie's high-stress urban environment.       Then a terrible accident happens.  Pilgrim is so badly hurt that the vet recommends putting him down.  Equally tragically, the horse's trust in humans is destroyed.  In the aftermath, Annie does not manage at all well to care for Grace.  The emotional chasm is symbolised by the hospital blinds, separating mother and daughter like a barrier.       Annie decides to heal Pilgrim, and to heal the rift with Grace at the same time.  This is Annie at her best, being resolute and resourceful, employing her research skills to learn about equine psychology.  She finds a 'horse whisperer' in Montana, one of those rare gifted humans who can win the trust of unhappy horses.       Enter Tom Hooker.  Everything that Annie is not (patient, wise, sure of his place in life), Tom is at peace with himself.  I help horses with people problems, he explains as he sets to work on the rehabilitation of Pilgrim - and of Annie and Grace, too.  It is painful for Annie to relinquish the false values which have formed her world for so long, but she slowly learns that an important talk with her daughter does NOT have to be interrupted by the arrival of a fax, and that NO cellphone call is so vital that it can disturb Tom's nurturing of Pilgrim.    At times, the horse cure seems to have been a mistake.  Annie is often beset by self-doubt, wondering why she is putting herself, her daughter and the horse through this ordeal.  Is she motivated by her own guilt at not having been a better mother?  Or is it as Grace thinks, that Annie simply can't resist organising other people and issuing orders?     Annie, Grace and Pilgrim journey westwards together into America's wilderness on a voyage of self-discovery.  It's an unhappy time for both mother and daughter.  Grace is sullen and resentful, and by the time they reach the Little Bighorn, Annie knows that, literally and figuratively, she has lost her way.  The passing trucks make an ugly, intrusive sound, just as the truck accident keeps keeps irrupting into the lives of horse and humans.  Annie's car is shot aerially as it progresses across America, the terrain lovingly photographed state by state, through the flat farmland of Illinois and up into the northern Rockies, the transition chronicled by the different FM stations playing on the car radio.       Where do you call home? somebody asks Annie at a community gathering, and the question is an apposite one.  What Grace and Annie lack, and what these people have in abundance, is a sense of belonging, a living relationship with the soil, a sense of their place in a tradition.  Here, there are folk songs and games of pitching horseshoes.  The instincts of the Montana folks are inclusive, and Annie's aggressive question-answer style of dialogue doesn't fit in here.  She has to 'unlearn'it.  She is all jittery edginess because she has no inner peace.  Do you ever sit still for just a minute? Tom asks her as he enjoys a mellow evening on the porch.       It is an education for Grace and Annie to sit at a family table for a meal preceded by prayers.  These good people live in the old way, and ask God to bless folks less fortunate than themselves.  This is not Annie's world of instant gratification, but a natural way of life which has wisely fitted its rhythms to those of the land.  Children are valued here.  They contribute to the work, and are rewarded with respect, not fobbed off with money.  Grace is taught to drive by being encouraged to show what she can do - and gradually, this method also teaches her how to live.      The two eastern visitors learn to relax into the place as the healing power of nature gets to work on Pilgrim, and on them.  Until now, Annie has known beef only as disembodied restaurant dishes, rather than as the living, breathing wealth of rural society.  At the cattle-branding, mother and daughter are drawn into the life of the ranch, and they derive very pleasure from having made their contribution.      Robert Redford is an intelligent film-maker who gathers talented people around him.  Attention to detail is apparent throughout.  Watch for the excellent swivel-and-zoom on Tom in the corral.  The scenes of the angry horse are convincingly done, and the incidental music is nicely evocative of America's rural art forms, with discordant fiddle and bottleneck guitar.  The child actors are marvellous - Scarlett Johansson as Grace is the equal of any adult, and Ty Hillman as Joe bubbles over with charm and intelligence.  Even the country song to which Tom and Annie have their slow dance is carefully chosen as a comment on Annie's emotional condition - 'Looking Fot A Soft Place To Fall'.  The aerial photography is delicious, and the rugged scenery of Redford's beloved Rockies a sheer delight ... and a river runs through it!

Three of Redford's previous movies as director(ORDINARY PEOPLE, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, QUIZ SHOW) dealt with father/son relationships. This is his first mother/daughter one, and I found it better handled than the love story.  Redford and writers Richard LaGravanese(who rescued BRIDGES) and Eric Roth were smart enough to infer, rather than state, that Johanson's getting better was tied in with the horse getting better.The other thing I liked is, like in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, Redford evokes the West and at the same time demystifies it.

Anyone who knows anything about horses will be driven out of her skull by the little bloopers and inaccuracies related to horse-handling and horse management that crop up throughout. Most of the mistakes, however, need to be there for the story to work and for the mood and the atmosphere to be maintained, which just says to me that this story could never have happened in real life.Otherwise, there are a lot of good things about this film. There really are horse trainers who use methods similar to Tom Booker's; one such person is Monty Roberts, who was seen in a TV documentary catching, gentling, and riding a wild mustang in the space of three days.The cinematography is fabulous-- huge wide panoramic (and sometimes aerial) shots of plains and mountains, and eerie dark shadowy horse scenes. I almost wish I'd seen this on the big screen.As for the plot, inaccuracies aside, it held my interest. I was relieved to see that the romance aspect did not take priority over the rest of the plot. The characters were generally believable, although Booker was a stereotypical cowboy hero-- stoic, standoffish, and chivalrous-- and altogether godlike. From this standpoint, the film was a bit of an ego trip for Redford-- much the same as Kevin Costner in Waterworld and Dances With Wolves, he created his own fantasy world which he directed and in which he was the ultimate hero.This film had its share of shining moments, but all in all, I found The Horse Whisperer to be more annoying and infuriating than enjoyable.

Then my Better Half strolls into my life and has all three in her DVD collection which is why I've been forced to eat my words, much to her delight. I still maintain that this movie would definitely appeal more to those with a womb than those without but even without the cheesy love story, this is a film that is magnificent to watch and especially on a brand new widescreen TV like the one I've just received.Kristin Scott Thomas stars as fashion magazine editor Annie, wife of hot-shot lawyer Robert (Sam Neill) and mother of riding-obsessed daughter Grace (a young Scarlett Johansson). After a tragic riding accident in which Grace and her horse Pilgrim are seriously injured, Annie takes the pair of them off to Montana in search of a legendary cowboy known as the horse whisperer. Despite his initial reluctance to get involved, Tom Booker (director Robert Redford) begins to give Pilgrim his full attention and before long, Tom's gifts begin to affect Grace and Annie in ways neither of them expected.Feeling like a cowboy version of Phenomenom, this is a much better film than John Travolta's nauseating whimsy. While the story feels as predictable and interesting as the current race for the Republican nomination for President, the films plods along so slowly that you'll begin to wonder if it ever ends. This is one film that feels like it does go on for too long, despite the heavyweight gravitas all the actors bring. Redford offers us a reminder of his glory days, as you'd expect seeing as he's director as well, but credit must also go to Chris Cooper as his brother and Johansson's performance as the moody teen struggling with the loss of her dreams. Neill is underused, however, and I personally felt that both Johansson and Thomas were just too unlikeable as characters to evoke any sympathy for. The film's real strength is the cinematography - it's full of sweeping landscapes, towering snow-capped mountains and skies bursting with colour. Basically, it looks the business. But the real stars are the horses themselves, looking every inch like the awe-inspiring creatures they actually are.It may be painfully slow and not my cup of tea at all but The Horse Whisperer is still one film I just about could recommend. It's a joy to watch - not because the story is anything different or unusual but because in spite of its flaws, you still stick with it despite its over-long running time. Redford is having the time of his life as the ageing but still ruggedly handsome cow-poke and the rest of the cast try to match him and the horses. And in case you still haven't got the message, this is definitely one for the ladies as most guys I know will be asleep within minutes. But if they stay awake long enough, they'll be treated to a glimpse of a lifestyle that is fast disappearing in the American West, a lifestyle that surely appeals to those city-slickers desperate for a change - where you commute by horse instead of train and where the only planes they'll see are the ones where their cattle are grazing. Like homemade apple pie, there's something warm and comforting about this film even though it may be far too sickly and sweet for some.

This film, however, is the first that has ever earned the distinction of having me sit through the first two-and-a-half hours and not wait for the ending before turning it off. UGGGHHH! Watching this movie was like having the worst constipation of my life. It took forever to develop what was a pretty simple story. On top of that, the story was very contrived and the plot was tired. (Yeah, like it's possible he's NOT going to rehabilitate the horse. I didn't even see the ending and I KNEW that was coming.) The characters were not at all believable. E.g., very hard to believe the girl would have gone from being so nice to being such an incredible twerp - not to mention how unbelievable it was that her mother would have tolerated her behavior. And is it any surprise that Redford has cast himself in the role of Romantic Savior of Everyone - horse, daughter, and mother - a la The Natural and The Electric Horseman?

It sets up expectations of something moving, grand, and thrilling. While The Horse Whisperer was at times moving, the only thing grand about it was the Montana scenery. The love story itself was quite banal at times, and on the whole the film was a disappointment.The story starts one snowy, winter morning, when Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend, Judith (Kate Bosworth) decide to go horseback riding. The horses slip in the snow, and slide down a hillside, landing with their riders in the path of an oncoming truck. Judith and her horse are killed, Grace loses her leg below the knee, and her horse, Pilgrim, regresses to a savage state. Grace's parents, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Robert (Sam Neill) refuse to have Pilgrim put down. Once Grace comes home from the hospital, it is clear that she is retreating, and Annie decides that the only thing to do is to retrain Pilgrim in the hopes that Grace will ride him again. She learns of a Horse Whisperer, by the name of Tom Booker, who is known for being able to tame the most difficult of horses. Despite his unwillingness to take on Pilgrim, Annie loads Pilgrim into a trailer, and heads cross country with Grace to see Tom Booker, who is understandably less than thrilled to see them. Annie is persistent to the point of peskiness, and eventually Booker relents. As the healing process begins for both Grace and Pilgrim, Annie finds herself drawn to Booker and to the simpler life in Montana, becoming less and less interested in returning to her job as an editor in New York. And then Robert arrives to escort his wife and daughter home...It's a promising setup, but the execution is disappointing. The story telling is very heavy handed. The pacing is slow to the point of being dull, and there is little suspense due to those two factors. The viewer has more than enough time to figure out what is going to happen, and is given a shove rather than a nudge in that direction. The ending is surprising, but only because it makes absolutely no sense.The acting is a mixed bag. Thomas generates all the warmth of a glacier, and leaves me wondering, yet again, why any director would cast her in any role that is supposed to be likable. Redford is surprisingly stiff, and understated enough that the viewer is left wondering exactly what attracts Annie to Tom Booker, especially given Sam Neill's excellent performance as her husband. Together, Redford and Thomas generate no chemistry at all. Dianne Wiest is wonderful as always as Booker's sister-in-law Diane. And Scarlett Johansson gives a beautiful performance of a girl too young to cope with the tragedy that has befallen her. Her eventual healing is one of the few truly satisfying moments of this film.While this is a beautifully filmed, and ultimately enjoyable movie, it certainly didn't deserve the fuss made over it. Watch it. Enjoy it. Just don't expect too much from it.

I watched the movie yesterday expecting to see the horse, Pilgrim, as he recovered slowly with the aid of the horse whisperer, Tom Booker.  I thought the movie was going to be centered around the horse.  I thought the people would not play as big a role as Booker and Pilgrim would.I was completely wrong.First off, the movie starts out like it should.  Nice introduction to the characters, very realistic (and quite frightening) accident scene.  The horse, Pilgrim, and his rider Grace are shown riding within the first five minutes.  What you'd expect, right?Spoilers are coming.Everything slowly goes downhill after that.  Grace's mother, after the accident, tries to get Mr. Booker to come up to New York and, after failing, takes a road trip with Grace and Pilgrim to Montana.  The road trip sucks up a lot of time in the movie, where we hardly see the horse.  The introduction of Booker is even longer, and when he finally began helping Pilgrim, I breathed a sigh of relief.  Maybe the movie would take a turn for the better.Wrong again!  It goes even slower after that, with scene after scene involving only the ranchers and Grace and her mother.  Soon we can see something evolving between Grace's mother and Booker.  I began to realize that I was cheated, that The Horse Whisperer was nothing but a romance with some horses thrown in.It takes even longer to finally get to the final training session of Pilgrim, which by that time the movie has gone on for two and a half hours.  I sit and watch and wait and find that the climax does not really involve Pilgrim and Grace, but Grace's mother who must make a final decision about her family.  Although I applaud her final decision, I cannot applaud the charming, misleading appearance of this movie.It may have been a good romance, it may have not.  I'm not much into that genre, so I really couldn't tell you.Sam Neill greatly lifts up the movie.  Although he is hardly in it, he is probably the best actor that was casted for this movie, and puts on an excellent performance.  We could expect no less from Neill.The music, by Thomas Newman, is not disappointing, but I wouldn't go out and get a soundtrack to The Horse Whisperer.  The music fits perfectly, with a nice, calm, sometimes mysterious atmosphere, that seems to blend in perfectly with the mood, setting, and characters.But the movie is so utterly boring and misleading that I would not recommend it to even the greatest of horse lovers.

However he has shown he can be a good director, perhaps the best example of this being `Ordinary People' which at least puts to shame that farce called `American Beauty' (qv) and can be ranked up alongside such excellent dramatical pieces such as `Peter's Friends'. In `The Horse Whisperer' a sleaked out Robert Redford is supposedly a rancher; I am afraid that does not come off too well. Nor practically anything else in respect to the actors, including Kristin Scott Thomas. Perhaps the little girl was not so bad, Dianne Wiest was more authentic, and it was sad to see Sam Neill in such a role.What certainly pays off is the excellent photography; indeed it is thanks largely to Robert Redford that my appetite is whetted for making a trip to Montana, Nevada, etc, to see the Rockies. But above all, the best of the film are the horse-trainers or `wranglers' who did an excellent job. Brilliant expertise, which helped more than anybody else to keep this film on its feet superb work; such that the best moments of the film are precisely the opening scenes with the accident.

Not once do you see Redford whispering to the horse. And you have to look hard and long to discover there are further subplots in this story, and they don't come out all that easily.Annie's husband Robert disappears for almost the entire movie and you begin to wonder if he isn't trying to contact her or she him. He's just gone. And there are several scenes which just don't hang together. At least one segue will stand out like a sore thumb. And Newman's music sticks out like a sore thumb as well, overpowering as it is with typical themes evoking the glory of the pastoral. Too much and not again, thank you very much.This is an excellent opportunity to witness the unearthly talent of a then fourteen year old Scarlett Johansson who is simply brilliant. Prior to this the outstanding performance for someone in her age bracket was the first choice for this role, Natalie Portman, but Scarlett matches and possibly surpasses the promise Portman showed in Leon.There's a lot of drama here and kudos have rained over the cinematographer but it all comes off as a bit pale and the drama is more melodrama than drama. And yes there is a resolution, but in the last ten minutes you the viewer start to panic, wondering if the writers were in a panic too trying to figure out how to end the thing. And yes they end it, but is it a resolution? Does it all come full circle? It seems more like you wait for your cue, for the fade-out, and then turn to whomever is sitting next to you and say 'oh well I guess that's the ending'.Was it poor writing? Or was it an impossible task to transfer this theme to celluloid? Whatever they could have put in a bit more horse whispering.

People sit around the campfire under the stars and sing Western songs in beautiful voices. Redford does a pretty good job. The part doesn't call for high drama, just a laid-back generosity. Scott-Thomas does a good job of looking and acting uptight. And Scarlett Johannson is great as an angry kid (maybe the script makes her too obvious at the beginning) who is like a boil waiting to pop. By Bog, she's a good little actress. She's not quite beautiful, not like, say Brooke Shields or Phoebe Cates, but she's already an accomplished performer. And her nose, which looks like Ingrid Bergman's in profile, is delightful, swooping upward and outward and ending in two oversize nostrils. Any normal human being would want to leap on her and bite it. How could the movie have gone wrong? Easily. Turn Redford and his family into PETA people, make them vegetarians, and don't show them branding cattle. Phew. When cattle are branded it is no fun for the cattle. I spent a summer in Montana cattle country and, although no PETA person, I felt sorry for the muddled creatures stumbling across the field with some brands burned through several layers of skin down to the muscular membranes beneath. It's treated as a rite of intensification here. Second, it could have gone wrong if it had endowed Redford with more than just an ability to quiet a traumatized horse over time. We could have seen him -- sihouetted on a hill communing with a hawk, growing tiny chickens for pets, standing silently in the garden with birds perched on his arms like St. Francis. Pardonnez mois pendant que je vomis. The Hallmark Hall of Fame. Third, the ending is what it should be. It would have been insulting to make Sam Neill, playing his usual well-meant but practically helpless role, into, say, an alcoholic wife abuser, although the temptation must have been there. That would have made it a cheap story instead of one aimed at grownups. Choosing between good and evil is not dramatic at all. It's choosing between things of almost equal value that challenges us. If it were otherwise we wouldn't be always in such trouble.

Instead, he gave himself yet another chance to play romantic lead. It absolutely didn't work this time, though. And it's really too bad, given that he had such terrific material if he'd shifted the focus to the girl and the horse and their recoveries. That's the interesting story here, not some hackneyed love story with a woman 20 years younger. And as somebody else here pointed out, absolutely no chemistry between those two. Zero. It was completely implausible that those two would be in love. Redford should just settle into Grandpa roles. As he proved in Horse Whisperer, he's very good at those.

The injured horse suddenly becomes a passing thought in the movie. Very little interaction is shown between the injured and the Horse Whisperer.Other than some very beautiful scenes of Montana, this film is a waste of time. Don't rent it or waste your time watching it on cable.

Who was trying to save whom and who was going to find redemption was beyond me. Like the kid who snapped his neck after the accident (lucky or not) at least had an easy demise where the rest of us had to merrily chew on our film programmes and watch the fun and frolics of 'old folk n'joyin a bit of country life at the expense of us old ignorant city folk.

Competing against high-tech and costly visual effects movies during this period showed that a movie with a great story line can create a more pleasurable viewing experience for all. This movie, based on a true story, was a refreshing change from the high special effects movies created during the period. Further, with myself in my 30's it was nice to see a movie that could captivate me for the entirety of the film that implemented no real so-called special effects. Finally, this movie was also a GREAT change from those made for teenager movies cropping up and out by the hundreds. I felt not only did Robert Redford act well within this movie but his credibility as a director is under no scrutiny these days.This is the only movie i will comment on in reference to movies created during the 90's. I have rated this movie a ten out of ten only because that rating was the maximum for me to vote within. I am hoping Robert Redford continues this trend of full entertainment by creating movies that are less costly and yet provide maximum entertainment value.

This poses a challenge that some movies employing finale-first cant quite get over - keeping a movie interesting with the fireworks scenes up front in the runtime. I thought the romance between Redford and Thomas characters was kind of far-fetched as was both the daughter and mother just uprooting and leaving the husband for months at a time with not much contact. There were numerous beautiful skies and mountainous backdrops with puffy expansive clouds and a lot of panoramic views, but the meandering shot my attention span. Acting is fair with Redford doling out his usual boyish charm. Horse Whisperer is worth a look especially if you like horses; it's well shot, maybe about average considering the length and pace.

And of course we all knew, right from the start of the ten hour epic (well, it seemed that long) that they would all live happily ever after, including the stupid horse who should have been shot at the outset, sparing both him and the movie's audience the ordeal.

If you haven't seen it, you may want to save the 170 precious minutes of you life for doing something more entertaining - like picking ticks off of a dead horse's corpse.Robert Redford's character - Looser (with his finger and thumb in the shape of an `L' on his forehead).  Nobody buys the deep soulful cowboy routine anymore.  Give it a freakin' rest.Kristin Scott Thomas's Character - Should have been shot and put out of everyone's misery withing the first few scenes.  Sam Neill's character should have kicked her to the curb with extreme prejudice.Sam Neill's character - Pitiful!  Use two hands when making the `L'.  This is the only character in the movie that was deserving of any degree of sympathy (but don't give it to him because of his double-looser status)Don't get me wrong - I don't have to have a `likable' character in a film in order to enjoy it.  Hell, I hated everyone in `Internal Affairs' (but they were believable, and I felt sorry for some of them as well - even the a**holes).  This movie just doesn't provide a single character that is even worth watching (let alone developing any sort of emotion over other than disgust).I gave it a `1' (but only because `0' wasn't offered).  I feel that I have been cheated out of 170 minutes of my life).

After the first 15 minutes, I was doze off. If I were going alone, I'd been out and ask for refund! The director was trying to tell some story, but avoid telling it, or afraid of telling with 'romantic way'?!The only good part is the scene of Montana.What I'd remember is the green mountain and the cloud while the trailer was driving inside those. After that, the director (while, he is also the actor) did something magic to make me sleep. When I woke up sometime later, the big horse is still wounded, and the two are still not close to bed at all!Come on! If you were aftering the Bridge movie, just follow it. No, the director avoid going that route, though it surely says like that in the whole 2 hours. "}]
