Emma Peel was a hero of my childhood. I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought, Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee, oh, how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke. The Avengers is cheeky, campy, fun, and never without some form of the double entendre somewhere. Apparently, the script writes never actually saw the series and didn't get the joke. I beg, some British filmmaker somewhere give it a chance. Make your own version. Give some dignity back.

Thus, I was happy that the movie did poorly and closed quickly. (I also took a trip to London just as the movie was released, and if you think it was ill-received here, the British took it times TEN.)Ironically, though, it isn't that bad a movie. Not great, but certainly not the despicable mess that most others seem to think.It's been called ridiculous, slow, talky, surreal. Well, what a shock, so was the original series. I've recently viewed the entire 1967 season (bought all four boxed sets), and the show is all those things at times. It is slow, generally, at a very langorous pace throughout most stories. It is talky, since most of the charm of the original was in the dialogue between characters. It was surreal, even ridiculous (The Winged Avenger, anyone? Eeee-urp.)Uma Thurman does a passable job as Emma--she's no Diana Rigg, but who is? She plays the character smart enough, although she doesn't quite capture Rigg's regal command of situation. Ralph Fiennes, however, misses the character of Steed quite a bit, playing him as reserved, without any of Steed's charisma. Steed always had a quality about him that made you feel as if he woke up every morning feeling absolutely smashing--Fiennes seems to miss that.The problem the film faces is twofold Those of us who have seen the original will always compare the two, and a copy can't hope to compare. Those who haven't seen the series have no grounds to assess it on--(see some of the above user comments which begin 'I never saw the original series...')and since I think this series is not exactly vividly-remembered by the majority of the population (particularly the 18 and under movie-goers, who don't have much grasp of the nuances The Avengers operated on). Frankly, The Avengers was probably just a bad choice to try to remake(--LIKE ALL OLD TV SHOWS.

It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.Considering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.The best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.Ironically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of Mother, IS included in the film. Go figure.Connery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.Quirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.On a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.At any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for Return to Gilligan's Island. Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of The Avengers is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint.

A pathetic effort from a formerly stellar actor.Eileen Atkins was rather fun as Alice, Steed's minder, and the guest appearance by Patrick Macnee was somewhat amusing.As for the writing, well.... I think (despite the credits) they actually gave the job to a couple of public school lads who rather thought that they were being clever.

No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says how now brown cow? down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.

Dating back to films like Superman and Blade Runner, a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. The  Avengers would have been that next big thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.The Avengers, which, at best, is a second rate version of the original Batman has all the features of your top blockbuster A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put Godzilla to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, The Avengers is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.Out Of Four - **     "},{"Title":"Falling for the old edit out what the test audience didn't like trick","Date":"13 August 2001","Score":"28 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Oh, wait, that's from Get Smart, not The Avengers.No matter.  As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood), I will say, right off the bat, that this movie did not fail on all levels.  If nothing else, the makers of this film understood, at least, what The Avengers was about.  This puts them head and shoulders above, say, the makers of The Wild Wild West movie, who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.They might not have been successful in the execution, but they did understand what made The Avengers tick, and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing, we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.Two scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding  When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase, and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles.  Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.Whatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old edit out what the test audience didn't like trick, and put a botched film on the screen.

When a research laboratory into a weather-based defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel, although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb, the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery &#150; well, after tea anyway.At the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics &#150; sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as day-glow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy; however tongue-in-cheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing.And so it was with The Avengers, a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is, this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun, exciting and enjoyable as well, not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable (it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me) but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once.The cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery, it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried, but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English, it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent, Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality.Overall this is not a laughingly terrible film, it is just lacking in any real, consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor, thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this.

But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. )I think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy.  This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad, but that's their problem.  The comedy style is not a popular one, it's a particular style of generally British humour, best described as complete and utter nonsense.  If you have no appreciation for absurdity, then you will NOT like this film.Nothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value, it's all a load of s***.  Steed and Peel are full of s***, that's the point.  No one acts the way they do, they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other.  The world of The Avengers is a place where small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all.The Avengers purposely doesn't explain things, it's not supposed to make sense, that would ruin it.  It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine.  Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.Fiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg, but I'm not sure they're much worse.  Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare, but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel.  Connery going nuts was fun to see too.  BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there, get it.  Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.It's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy, why a film like The Avengers is so funny.

(Not that the professionals have an exaggerated sense off their own worth, unlike us enthusiastic amateurs hem, hem.). Even so this is not a good film, but it really ain't as bad as all that. Sure Uma Thurman is capable of greater things. Yes Ralph Fiennes looks like a little lad playing at grownups in his dad's clothes. Yep it is all a bit heavy handed and lacks a lot of the charm of the television series, and the entire team makes the mistake of confusing archness with campness . Certainly they fell into the trap of overdoing the pyrotechnics, which the original TV series pointedly eschewed. And yet and yet.......... I was about 11 when the TV series first hit the small screen, and about 14 in its Swinging London heyday. I loved it. And to be fair they have captured quite a lot of the spirit of the original. Uma smoulders a bit too obviously, and the tension 'twixt her and Steed is overdone. But the Emma Peel on television did indeed make the leather catsuit a hot fashion item, even if it was not accessorised with a belt that looked quite as much like an unwise purchase from The Batman Shop. And let us not forget that the original Steed and partner (Kathy Gale aka Honor Blackman before her role in Goldfinger) did get into the UK Top 20 with a song called Kinky Boots (I did not make that up!) so the footwear obsession goes back to its roots.. The character of Mother is a great deal grubbier than, but still largely faithful to, the original, and there is a sterling performance here from Jim Broadbent, last seen in The Borrowers. The Routemaster buses, Steed's Bentley, the red phone boxes, the mazes, and the surreal deserted and barely recognisable London streets are faithful reminders of the original (although Emma Peel's E-type Jag - archetypal 60s motor that it is - was actually a Lotus Elan in the series). And at least one sequence is lifted wholesale from the series, when Mrs Peel is lost in the villain's stately home and keeps returning to the same place no matter which way she turns. This is a direct crib from an episode called The House That Jack Built, which at least shows the film makers did some homework. (The original lacked the truly inspired inclusion of the Escher staircase, and I bet the then production designers are kicking themselves for missing that trick.) . Stuff like the baddies' choice of a hot air balloon (with a blind pilot) as a getaway vehicle was exactly the sort of thing that did happen in the series, as were the attacks by the village milkman and postman (and the smoking nuns in the next scene!), the gun toting octogenarian, the swordplay in the gentlemen's outfitters, the bizarrely magnified plants in the villain's hothouse, and The Ministry HQ set under the banks of the Thames. Plus it was a nice touch using Patrick MacNee as the voice for Colonel I Jones, the invisible archivist ('All going fine in Camouflage until the accident, then I ended up here' Hahahahaha). I quite liked it despite its many faults, though I'm not so stupid that I don't recognise this is due at least in part to the fact that The House That Jack Built was my favourite episode on television. Don't fret too much if you miss this, but likewise don't panic if someone gives you tickets to see it.

Of course, as Oscar Wilde may not have said, Satire revisited is only a lukewarm cup of tea. But then nostalgia - especially when the satire was so gentle anyway - has its own charms. And there was, anyway, a hefty dose of nostalgia amidst the cool insouciance of the original. Its very modernity was made to seem almost an expression of polite insistence on whatever surreal manifestation of tradition was encountered. It was the utterly unruffled mien of the original which prevailed over all lapses from reason and good taste. So, at its best, in the new cinema version.This is indeed a brave try by Hollywood to draw us back into that black-and-white psychedelia of swinging sixties British commercial television. The sheer madness of the enterprise almost works - if the money-men hadn't had cold feet at the last minute, we might have been enjoying a really remarkable fantasy film. As it is, we must content ourselves with a merely very amusing piece of whimsy.

But even allowing for taste, it is a sad reflection on public taste that 'The Avengers' overwhelmingly offends filmgoers who are probably quite prepared to accept the ever more overblown superheroes of a more violent tradition, such as 'Batman' or 'The Hulk'. Of course, these two are clearly representative of that particularly adolescent taste for the extreme and crude for which the contemporary Hollywood production-line largely exists.

That the two of these films star Uma Thurman is unfortunate. However, I would argue that The Avengers isn't all that bad. Having recently viewed some of the original television series I have come to appreciate what was attempted with the movie.This movie's tag-line is 'Saving the world in style' and that's precisely what it does. The Avengers is not a rough-and-tumble James Bond or Mission Impossible type action-adventure but a retro-stylish tongue-in-cheek jaunt through the marvelously preposterous diabolical schemes of an over-the-top madman. The tongue-in-cheek humour grates on most viewers but it is essential to this particular film in that it honours the source material wonderfully.The casting of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is spot on, the overt double entendres between them is light and playful and they handle it with aplomb. The supporting cast is filled with wonderful character actors from Britan and Ireland including the likable Jim Broadbent and the delicious Fiona Shaw. Original TV series star Patrick Macnee makes an inventive cameo appearance.If the film falls short in any way it is with Sean Connery. He is never presented with enough material to chew upon, and my only guess is that (seeing as it is a relatively short film) some of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.That said, I think the film delivers precisely what it set out to do. That audiences stayed away and fans balked is a shame as it is a gloriously retro, stylish yet restrained romp. The opening title sequence is superb, the music fits perfectly and scenes such as the climactic inflatable ball river-walkers could have been iconic.Worth a look, in the right mood. I suggest watching some of the original episodes first. This is no action movie clone... Makes you wish it had been a success to see where they would have gone with a sequel.

Still, despite its well-documented flaws, this movie doesn't quite deserve the peasants-with-pitchforks-and-torches reception that it got from fans of the 1960s British TV series.  For those who come to it with no expectations, well, your expectations won't necessarily be exceeded, but there are some fun bits. The movie version is as mindless as typical Hollywood summer action fare, but no worse.  First, the good news screenwriter Don MacPherson does draw on a wealth of wacky plot points from the series; like that show, the movie does have stylish fashions and sets; it doesn't take itself too seriously.  But the heart of the show was the rapport between Patrick Macnee, playing suave agent John Steed, and his various leading ladies. In Cathy Gale, the brisk, buxom Honor Blackman created a leather-clad woman warrior who was still a feeling person. With her fashion-model figure and classical theater background, Diana Rigg made Emma Peel the ultimate in intelligence and charm. Voluptuous Linda Thorson was perhaps too young, but she brought a combination of physicality and bubbliness to Tara King.  Macnee provided graceful support to these three very different actresses, and the show arguably reached its height during the black-and-white Diana Rigg season. While Rigg made an arch, androgynous Emma Peel, her chemistry with Macnee produced role models for female-male relations.  It's a difficult formula to emulate, and there may have been worse choices that Ralph Fiennes as the movie Steed. The Rock comes to mind. But while Fiennes is attractive and seems kindly off-screen, on-screen he generates all the warmth and charm of week-old bath water.  And while Macnee did as few stunts as possible _ as even a cursory glance at a TV episode clearly shows _ he at least looked formidable. Fiennes looks like a gust of wind would blow him away _ unfortunate, considering the film's weather-related plot.  In contrast, the athletic Uma Thurman creates her own special effect as Emma Peel. Her dangerous curves seem to defy the laws of physics, filling catsuits in ways that the underendowed Diana Rigg couldn't imagine, much less match.  And Thurman's Emma starts out well, with her early scenes providing much of Rigg's breezy playfulness. Alas, the more time she spends with Fiennes, the more she mimics his mumbling, diffident performance. As the scenes jump around almost at random, Thurman's version of Emma becomes equally fractured.  Sean Connery gives a one-note performance, and one wishes that only dogs could hear him. Of course, the choppy editing doesn't give him a chance at grace notes. The megalomaniacs on TV episodes were often eccentrics in a script filled with eccentrics, with highly personal grievances and plots.  The movie lacks those charming supporting characters, and in this underpopulated movie, Connery is the obvious bad guy right from the start.        Still, even if the cast is adrift, there is some genuine feeling between the Steed and Peel characters. It's a pale copy of the Macnee-Rigg pairing, but one suspects there was a better movie here that got derailed on the Hollywood assembly line.

Uma Thurman as sexy TV icon Emma Peel? Ralph Fiennes as suave John Steed? Sean Connery as a James Bond-inspired villain? What more could one ask.Well, a better grasp of what made The Avengers such as success on television, for starters. Not that the 1998 film version doesn't attempt here and there to replicate the feel of the original series. Connery's weather-controlling madman is right out of the TV show's playbook, as is a segment virtually lifted whole from the classic Emma Peel episode The House That Jack Built -- and while I think Elizabeth Hurley or Catherine Zeta Jones would have been much more suitable choices for Emma Peel, Uma Thurman does hit most of the right notes. Elsewhere, though, it falls short.Fiennes just doesn't feel right as Steed. Except for his opening scene prancing through a Ministry test-fighting range -- considered by some to be the best and most Avengers-like moment in the film (perhaps due to a welcome cameo appearance by the original Avengers TV theme music) -- he comes off as rather wimpy for lack of a better word. Patrick Macnee's Steed had charisma and was revealed in the TV series to be capable of being quite thuggish when the situation demanded. Fiennes displays none of Macnee's qualities. You know you're in trouble when Macnee, who has an amusing voice-only cameo in the film, displays more personality and charisma with his voice alone than Fiennes does in the entire film. Also a disappointment is Sean Connery, who clearly seems off his game here (thankfully he bounced back in his next film, Entrapment, ironically co-starring one of my dream Mrs. Peels, Catherine Zeta Jones; that film suggests the type of chemistry that is totally lacking between Connery and Thurman in this film). His voice doesn't sound right for some reason, almost as if he played the role with a cold.The biggest problem with the film was the decision to cut its length considerably, strangely enough in the process deleting many of the scenes in the trailer. Without these scenes, much of the film makes little sense, especially the rather unexplained presence of Peel's evil double, whose existence is better explained in the cut scenes. (I highly recommend tracking down the novelization of this film, which includes the cut scenes and makes a lot more sense than the movie).As a longtime Avengers fan I was also disappointed by some of the character decisions. Once again modern filmmakers appear unable to take platonic characters from TV and let them keep their lips apart in the movies. The introduction of a romantic subplot between Steed and Peel really feels out of place and goes back to what I said earlier -- that you need an understanding of how the source material works in order to do a good remake.All this said, The Avengers as a movie isn't the worst thing ever made. And it's entertaining in its own way. At the very least watching Uma Thurman parade through in a series of sexy outfits is not an unpleasant waste of 90 minutes. But as a remake of a classic TV series, this was yet another failed attempt at recapturing the magic, something that is extremely hard to do at the best of times and has only been accomplished by a handful of projects, such as the recent revivals of Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who.

I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'.

Fiennes was a fairly convincing Steed, and sounded reasonably authentic, but not so Thurman. There was no way an American could sound like Diana Rigg.

And when all of London (which, by the way, is completely EMPTY from the get-go) is threatened with complete destruction, they put two lackadaisical special agents (Thurman and Fiennes) on the case, both of whom are too wrapped up in what passes in England for pillow talk to make much of an impact on the whole thing. The villian, Sean Connery, runs an operation assisted by ONE henchmen (that's Eddie Izzard, by the way, who in any other respect is really cool. Check out Velvet Goldmine or some of his stand-up, trust me) and a bunch of guys in giant TEDDY BEAR OUTFITS (for the love of humanity what was up with THAT?) Our heroes spend almost the entire film quietly gabbing and stopping for tea at nine-minute intervals until the last five minutes when they out of nowhere haul off and start kicking some ass. The whole thing is poorly drawn out and just really surreal and I for one won't stand for it! BAN movie remakes of old TV shows!!All things considered, though, I think the Avengers (who, incidently, weren't even really AVENGING anything) could have benefited from a little something known as WEAPONS.

The movie , however, seems to hail the Bond films by referencing the best scenes of  Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever, but not as well done as the originals.   Sean Connery, even with a short on-screen time, has a well-rounded plot  figured out.  Unlike SPECTRE's well-thought out intents, however, Sir  August deWinter lacks a motive!  The writers, seemingly aware of the  eventual demise of the script, apparently decided to perform a literary  euthanasia - adding random physics jargon to explain a natural impossibility , introducing an invisible man who relates to the plot in no way whatsoever,  and also keeping the dialogue uninteresting, dry, and pointless.  In fact,  the movie might have had a G rating if it had not been for one use of a  disagreeable word edited in during post production.  If one ever rents this  movie, it would be a much more agreeable experience if one turns the volume  down and the screen off.  Even Roger Moore makes a better British agent  than Ralph (Ray?) Finnes, who is an excellent but poorly cast actor.  The  Ministry could never stand up to Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is  probably why the actors in the original Avenger's series (much better than  the movie) eventually turned to the Bond camp.

I would argue that Ralph Fiennes is incapable of giving a bad performance, and Uma Thurman is rather wonderful too. Their dialogue is very well written with quips a-plenty. Sean Connery is hilarious, and obviously relished his role as the baddie, and Jim Broadbent is equally amusing. The plot is wafer thin and zips along splendidly. I wasn't aware until I read other comments here that the film was butchered by studio executives. If that is indeed the case, I add my vote for a Director's Cut. 90 minutes was definitely too short.The initial failure of this film at the box office was undoubtedly due to its subtlety. Understatement and tongue-in-cheek humour have never been a premium on the other side of the pond, and I imagine that in Blighty the TV series is seen through such thick lensed rose-coloured spectacles that any movie version was bound to be heretical.Which is funny - granted that Diana Rigg played the sexiest TV character in history and that Patrick McNee was perfect as John Steed, but anyone who actually watches these old episodes will be aware of their surrealness and complete inability to take themselves seriously (hats off to the writers). These are exactly the elements that the movie version captures so well. Hats off to Mr Chechik, the director (and Canadian - significant?)

Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.You know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.Packed with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic storm within a building scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.Ralph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).The major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how.

Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman play John Steed and Emma Peel and they must stop a world domination scheme involving bad weather. That has got to be the dumbest idea ever conjured up. The climax is so stupid that cable stations would be wise to substitute it for the real weather channel.

The difference is that one film is genuinely funny while this one is laughable from the lowest end of stupidity. Fiennes and Thurman sound less intelligent with every line. After the idiotic Batman and Robin, one would think that Thurman would be more reluctant to repeat herself. Jim Broadbent is completely wasted, but it is Sean Connery that goes over the top with lines like, The weather is no longer in God's hands but in mine. Is he kidding?

As a child I liked the idea of there being a film with a primarily British setting, seeing an obvious cultural association, but now I realise that it's doing the exact opposite and straight up making fun of what British people aren't like any more!So what's the ketchup? John Steed is a British Agent working for the secret Ministry. After a weather control project named Prospero is destroyed, the chief suspect and project designer, Emma Peel, is brought in, claiming her innocence. Together, both Steed and Peel are led to the home of August De Wynter, a former agent obsessed with the weather and believe that this fixation may be related to the sabotage of Prospero.Now, the most jarring problem with this film is that it is very, very dated. The way the characters act and their traits are very much based on those of the original 1960's show, where plummy accents and established gentry ruled the waves, etc, etc. The only problem is, most people in the 1990's didn't really know about a show that stopped airing the best part of 30 years earlier, and couldn't really take seriously the fact that the last time British people spoke in such a stereotypical way was when Winston Churchill led Britain against the armies of Germany! Either way, it comes off as terribly out of place, and doesn't make the characters the least bit interesting.Another very jarring point, for some reason London is empty! No cars, no people, no planes landing at Heathrow, nothing!

His line delivery, his mood changes, his general air and presence kept me gripped.The story is pretty bog standard, stop the obvious villain baddie, the end! The effects are pretty bog standard. For some reason an invisible man and killer mechanical Bees are thrown into the mix and come off looking totally out of place, it doesn't really hold a consistent tone.Overall, I can't really recommend it, even as a film you can just shut your brain off to. The story's bland, the characters are bland, the effects are bland, the only good thing to my mind is Sean Connery as the villain. Apart from that, give it a miss!

(a bit out of the original order, but I can't help when I was born)And the Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes version is nothing if not true to those characters, the characterisations, and the story lines from those TV series.Those were every bit as far fetched, over the top, silly, bizarre, illogical, strange, weird and farcical as parts of this film version.Except no-one appears to have watched this film version with the same affection as they would watch the original TV series(s).I like it, and I think if you approach it like you would a re-run of one of the earlier TV series, and divorce yourself from reality, put yourself into the idiom of The Avengers, then I think you can enjoy this film, too. Distance yourself from nostalgia, Since Sean Connery was also in this film - which brings the 1960s James Bond films to mind, think of this film more like the original Casino Royale (with David Niven as James Bond, and Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond) rather than the gritty modern Casino Royale with Daniel Craig. It's not a 1998 film - it's just another episode in a weird 1960s TV series.

This film promises a hip, new, action-packed rendition of the classic British spy show a slick hybrid of explosive action, thrills, and quirky humor.The film definitely tries its best to be quirky, to the point where nearly every scene is weird and off-the-wall. Such eccentricities include a council of villains who dress up as giant teddy bears. There are at least a couple of scenes where old ladies whip out throwing knives or machine guns. The heroes are chased by robot bees at one point. One of the characters has an evil clone, with no explanation as to how or why. There are oodles of other odd things going on here, but the film pushes its quirkiness over the top with its script, in which every single line is a pun. Seriously, nobody ever talks normally in this film every line is a funny remark, and it can get old really fast. The spaces in between these odd parts are filled up with fighting, explosions, chases, fighting, explosions, fighting, and more fighting! My personal experience with this film has always been mixed; it's something I always wanted to like, but never could. The standard tropes of outlandish spy thrillers are there, and the action can be okay to watch at times. Unfortunately, the storytelling makes this a far duller experience, because there is no real story here to tell. With a whopping 28 minutes cut from the film in post-production, the plot is reduced to a constant string of action scenes, one after another, with zero character development, and zero reasoning given for why things happen on screen. In the end, it's hard to really latch onto this film beyond the aesthetics.And the aesthetics get the job done. Photography isn't too bad. Editing is pretty stupid. Everybody in this film hams up their performances to match the quirky nature of the film. Ralph Fiennes bears a crud-eating grin the whole time, but still manages to channel enough charm and wit to make the most out of what he's given. Uma Thurman is pretty much reprising her role as Poison Ivy from B&R. Sean Connery doesn't seem to give a flying rip about anything, and in spite of that he seems to be the only one here taking his role seriously, even when he struts around in a kilt. I have no idea what Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are doing here. Writing is horrible. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects have not aged well. Joel McNealy's score is annoyingly repetitive and loud (which is a shame, because the movie's theme is not bad per se, and the CD soundtrack has been a favorite of mine since high school).There may have been potential in this film somewhere, but so much of the story has been carved out in post-production that it leaves only a threadbare semblance of a plot, and a ton of frivolous action and ridiculous scenes. It's an interesting oddity at times, and a glorious guilty pleasure in its own right, but overall, it is the ultimate example of how a film with all style and no substance can fall flat on its face.2/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Awful | Film Marginal) "},{"Title":"To paraphrase Mike Rowe","Date":"2 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day.

Of course the Englishness was as OTT a you'd expect of Hollywood. Why not make Steed and Peel a little more up to date but still quaintly British? Much like Bond, who manages to keep up with the times but still has those good old British tea-sipping qualitites!The second aspect was the complete betrayal and lack of understanding of the relationship between Peel and Steed. They would have never kissed on screen any more that the lovers in a Bollywood film! Shock horror!!! -O What jerk allowed that to happen. Obviously not anyone who's actually saw the TV series. I got my Chinese wife - who'd never seen the TV series before - to watch it after seeing the film. She got it! What's so difficult?I heard an interview with Patrick Macnee (TV series John Steed) in which he claimed that kissing on the TV would have been scandalous. They only wanted to hint at the fact they slept together. That was another shock to me! It just goes to show that you can't even trust the actors to understand the full picture!My interpretation has always been that their relationship was a platonic, professional one and that they never admitted they liked one another. Steed was always a bit old for her. I saw him more as a father figure to Peel. It shows how apparently wrong you can be! But I still stand by my interpretation as a valid one. Which is all the more why I was shocked when they kissed!After that, the film turns into a Bond movie with gargantuan (thanks Kill Bill) special effects that seem out of place when compared to those in the low-budget TV series! The final scenes just underlined how far this was from any concept I had of the TV series.I was upset that I had wasted my time and money on watching my notion of the Avengers being crucified at the altar of money grabbing, insensitive and ultimately cowardly Studio Executives and Producers, and a spiritless director and actors who hadn't the nerve to quit the production when they saw what a travesty they were creating.

Don't get me wrong, relative to the series this film is an outrage not so much failing to capture the magic of the original as dancing on its grave. What could have been a whole series of campy-surreal Avengers flicks produces instead only this choppy mess. There are some fun moments - none involving Sean Connery - the sets look fabulous, the soundtrack is excellent and it's always lovely to see Fiona Shaw and Eileen Atkins whatever they are doing. That this movie is such an appalling mish-mash with only a very few scenes indicating the original intention to make a decent movie is I believe entirely down to the terrifyingly bad judgement shown by the film's director Jeremiah Chechik, perhaps (indeed for his sake hopefully) under duress from Warner Bros.The selection of Chechik himself to handle such a big project given his relatively undistinguished career seems eccentric, perhaps it was felt that as a Canadian he might have an inside track on a series whose distinctive British quality might have made the suits uneasy. However like Lee Tamahori he shows very little understanding of the way the series actually works and his directing of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is hamfisted enough to ruin the film on its own. Steed, supposed to be witty, urbane, charming and warm is reduced to a man who emotes less than the furniture in his chic London pad. Mrs. Peel is simply a mess - with no real explanation given for her behaviour in the script Uma Thurman's performance lurches to different extremes from scene to scene like a drunk playing hopscotch.The real villain here, however, is Sean Connery. Not, I'm afraid to say in the film, in which he delivers one the worst performances of his already one-note career but in the effect that his casting had on the script. In early drafts the character of Sir August Merryweather (as he is called) was a harmless old buffer, the real villain being someone else entirely and the plot hingeing on the death of Mrs Peel's husband thus giving her some sort of motivation and explaining why at the start of the film she is no longer running the Prospero Weather Programme.The studio executives, salivating at the fact that Connery was interested in the script ripped it to shreds to find a role to accommodate him. When the film was screened before test audiences they reacted badly to its eccentricity, the lousy direction of the two leads, the fact that Connery was terrible and the new plot involving him incoherent. The studio's solution was another celluloid massacre performing big cuts making the already messy film a total disaster.What I find most disappointing in this movie is that there are just enough moments in it to realise that what you are actually watching is the corpse of a good film and that a splendid opportunity to revive a bit of British telly history has been comprehensively ruined. The cut footage may have made things better but really, aside from a good early draft of a script, there is nothing here for anyone involved to be proud of. What a shame.

His characters is one of those henchmen types- the kind that just stands around, glaring.  The problem with this is that his look at me, I'm an evil henchman stare came across as more of a look at me, I'm a moron stare.  Granted, in this film, there probably isn't much of a difference between an evil henchman and a moron, but it still showed.Still, the film does have a couple of (minor) saving graces- although I don't think it was a particularly good scene (even compared with the rest of the film), Sean Connery does look rather funny dressed as a giant teddy bear.Also, as with Batman & Robin, Uma Thurman proved that she does indeed look rather fetching in a cat suit.Over all, this film is only really worth watching if you happen to enjoy really bad films.It's one of those films which are useful when you're tired, but you don't want to go to sleep just yet, and so pop in a video of something which you won't mind falling asleep through.

Ralph Fiennes DOES look uncomfortable, but Thurman is perfect as Mrs Peel; and if only the stars hadn't got cold feet in the same way the studio did, this could have been one of the most triumphant casting successes ever!   The production design is cool, harking back to a 60's era of far-out psychedelia, and some of the set-pieces are inspired and downright hilarious.  The film's many flaws (make no mistake - they are here in droves) actually made the film a much more enjoyable experience for me, because unbelievably, they meshed with the 'trippy' feeling the film wallows in.  No chemistry between the two stars?  True enough, but the characters are so weird anyway that's it's almost like they're designed to have their own orbit.  Although there are cavernous chunks missing from the plot, it DOES mean that you can never be totally sure what will happen next.  As this should never be misconstrued as a drama, that's no bad thing.   As escapism it's thoroughly enjoyable and none too taxing on the patience, looking positively trim these days at just under an hour and a half.  I'm one of its lone defenders, so its obvious that the film is not for all tastes; but for those with an appetite for the kooky, kitsch and often BAD, it's fun.  Far more enjoyable than watching countless other far worse films trying to make a sober point.   I'm even so kindly disposed to this film that if I saw it for about £4, I'd buy it!

Once the movie picks up Ralph Fiennes is again in a commendable role for him (John Steed) while turning up his class and charm to pull off the character better than I could have imagined.  Uma is Uma... although talented and made the character work, not a good casting job.  And finally, Sean Connery plays a villain almost as classy and likeable as John Steed.  The only thing left to knock is the editing that, while awkward, could have been alot worse and most likely kept the story from dragging on too far.

After reading some reviews on other web sites, I was surprised to see that so many people (mostly Americans) actually liked the film.  And that they liked what Ralph and Uma did with the characters.  I am an American, and although I have only seen seasons 4 through 6 (peel and king), I consider myself to be one of the more dedicated fans of the show. I went and saw it on the day it was released, and was thoroughly disappointed.  Almost to the point of believing that there may have been a conspiracy to make this such a bad film.  I must admit that I was expecting to be disappointed - I was sure that the actors would not do well by the characters, judging especially from the utterly unsubtle publicity photos of Uma Peel.  I had hoped, however, that the overall production would have made it semi-enjoyable.  It was not.  Not only did the characters have no chemistry, but the whole flow of the movie was awkward and somewhat boring.The main fault for that, I would say, lies with the extreme over-editing of the film.  I had read the book that was written from the original script, so I could see what was cut.  In the movie, they trimmed parts of important scenes that made them incongruous or just fall flat.  I think one of the best examples of this is in one of the opening scenes when Steed is walking down a street fending off various surprise attackers, which is actually a test of his abilities, and is given a score of 9 (supposedly out of 10).  Nothing is further said or explained.  So why even show the score?  What they cut was additional attackers on the street with chains and Steed fought them off skillfully with his sword umbrella.  He didn't dispose of them instantly like the other attackers, however.  When Steed sees his score, he protests and is told that he took too long with the chain gang.  That extra little bit would have made that scene much better, but instead viewers are left to wonder why Steed got a score of 9.  There are many instances of this throughout the film.  The film was trimmed to a paltry 90 minutes.  I know they filmed a scene with the evil duplicate destroying the Prospero lab (there were publicity photos from those scenes), but it was cut in its entirety.  This would have been a much better setup and introduction to the whole plot.  If only they had not cut so much throughout, the plot would have flowed better and been a much more enjoyable film.As far as the characterizations, I will say that I was less disappointed with Uma Thurman as Mrs. Peel than I was with Ralph Fiennes as John Steed.  Sir August was okay, but his development was limited.  Nothing is explained about his obsession with Mrs. Peel.  John Steed was not presented as the perfect English gentleman in this picture.  A gentleman would NOT request that a strange woman whom he has never met to meet him in a gentleman's club where he is completely naked!  There are a few other examples of his absolutely rude behavior which I will decline to mention.  Uma peel was not too bad, but her portrayal was not as strong or as focused as Diana Rigg.  The fact that they were not paired up as partners and friends, but rather as a makeshift team trying to prove her innocence, did not do much for the pairs chemistry.  Steed even told her once that he was under orders to kill her if she was indeed a traitor.  Where he got those orders was edited out of the film, of course.  Also, it seems to me that the producers idea of how to make the two seem sophisticated was to have them drink gallons of tea.Because they cut it from the opening scene, we never see Steed's sword umbrella until the final fight scene with Sir August.  In the movie, Emma Peel fights much less than Steed, who is actually presented as a very skilled and trained fighter.  In the original series, it was Emma who had all the cool fight scenes and steed usually got by with clever and dirty tricks (like the steel plated bowler)  It seemed wrong not to see Emma delivering her trademark Karate chops.I will say that the amount of explosive action and special effects were adequate. The Avengers has never been about that kind of thing, anyway.  The Avengers is supposed to appeal to the brain as much as the eyes, so I'm glad it wasn't over done.One last production note the opening and closing credits, for which the original series was greatly loved, were absolutely abominable in the movie.  They looked like the opening of a James Bond film with a bad hangover!  They were a series of creepy and ugly visual distortions set to even creepier music.  The traditional music didn't appear until later in the film, and then only briefly.Don't let this film spoil your appreciation for one of the best TV shows  of all time.  Go watch the original series on video.

I'd never read any comments or critiques of this film before (and even if I did, I don't remember), and thus had no idea what the general opinion of this film was. From the trailer, it did seem to promise action and a bit of excitement, and thus I was rather eager to watch this movie.Well, after watching it, it might be fair to say that it was somewhat of a letdown. Firstly, the progression of the plot didn't flow quite well. After reading the many user comments, it seems that parts of the film have been cut out. No wonder it was quite confusing and difficult to follow what was going on. Also, the plot was quite stale and mundane, with a lack of twists. I had the impression that the director or writer took us all for little kids with minds so simple that the bad guys had to be pointed out right from the start. The script certainly does disservice to the cast of the movie. Also, I'm sure that British wit and humour is much funnier than it is made out to be in the movie. It was as if I knew that that particular line was meant to be funny, but somehow I found that I couldn't laugh at it at all. Pity.However, the special effects were quite good, and living in the tropics, I loved the snow scenes and those of London and the river Thames. On the whole, an ok movie which can be watched when shown on TV, but not exactly worth going to the cinemas to watch. I give it a 6.5/10.

I think they made a fair stab at recreating the outright weirdness (especially in the clipped dialogue) of the 'golden age' original series, but none of it comes off because of Ralph. He's too young for a start. The whole Steed/Peel dynamic was the sexual tension between an older man and a 60's type emancipated woman - the unspoken suggestion that however emancipated Mrs. Peel was, Steed still had the answer to all her problems(! - and yes, she could come to his rescue too). The script acknowledges this, but Ralph Fiennes comes over as a sexually repressed nerd who's just come from spending five grand in Savile Row, not an old-fashioned 'man of the world', like Patrick Macnee's Steed. Diana Rigg and Macnee managed to make some absolute tripe amusing and watchable, because the relationship between them as characters was sexually charged - there was so much unspoken. If Uma Thurman had had somebody to strike sparks off, the humour in the script might have worked, and people would have seen it for the outrageous sendup it was attempting to be but Ralph plays it even straighter than Schindler's List, and the relationship between Steed and Peel is just a badly-scripted double-act. As it is, the funniest thing about Ralph is the size of his hat - yes, Stan Laurel in Ollie's bowler comes to mind.

Why? Because the trailer was pretty cool (it contained the way groovy song Get Duffy by Primal Scream!), I owned every single (Emma Peel) Avengers episode (way before A&E made it easy for everyone) on video and Uma looked pretty neat-o in a weird outfit. Did I have my doubts? Sure! This was being made by the director who brought us Benny And Joon! (God, how I hate that film!) Well, on the day of the release I began to really sweat. First there were no reviews to speak of (that being always a very bad sign) and while waiting in line people were coming out of the theatre grumbling lame, don't waste your money!, and where did I park my car, again? So maybe in a way, I wanted to like it, because everyone hated it. Oh, and I was hoping to hear that Primal Scream song in the movie again. Well, unfortunately the song was only in the trailer, so that was a let down, but the film did manage to put me in some kind of hypnotic dream state that neither fully enthralled or fully entertained me. It just sort of existed like a weird pot haze state. Did I appreciate the liberties it took on one of my favourite tv shows? Not really. Emma Peel's character was reduced to a neurotic victim, versus the ass-kicking woman that the show had depicted. Mr. Steed was a little too foppish and suffered terribly from an over abundance of blush (they should have fired the make-up department)? A friend of mine met Patrick (the original Mr. Steed) and he'd mentioned that there were some great moments in the film that were edited out at the last moment? Also, I can recall reading that they did some last minute special effects tweaking? Maybe a director's cut is in order? Was it the best film I ever saw? Nope! What I have found with a lot of films though, is that everyone has such strong opinions of a film that really doesn't warrant much of a reaction. I mean if people really want to explore BAD films, then surly there is definitely worthier candidates then this one. It has a lot of cool (though I'm not a big fan of digital, but..) effects, and the color is bright enough to keep most viewers awake. The acting is a little shakey, but at least the cast was attractive. The characters remind me more of the last season episodes with Tara King, more then the Emma Peel ones. It does have some great surreal imagery though. The colorful bear outfits are like some opium induced (or Grateful Dead inspired) dream. If I was a child I could have had nightmares for days. Also, I thought the landscape of the new England was pretty inspired. It had a cold almost isolated feel of another planet. An alien environment like the isolated villages I use to view in the TV show. I spend (unfortunately) a lot of time at jobs that just allow me to surf the net for a living (life of a receptionist), and I spend many of the hours reading a lot of reviews from people who should not be reviewing films, but hey, it's freedom of speech. And then I spend the latter part of my day watching films that no one could be bothered to watch. Why is it that a film relatively harmless as this one gets such outrages and attention, when a film director like John Cassavetes gets barely 4 reviews a film? But I find it interesting that (for the most part) all reviews as whole put together all the thoughts on a film. I've read reviews of films I love and can't get enough of, and found myself giggling at someones bad review of it. Why? Because film in general takes people places that they don't necessarily ask to be taken to, or change the way a person usually predicts it should be. Depends on the mood. One film is just one interpetation of an idea. A film does not  have to be the last word on a topic, but rather an opinion. At least it tried a little harder to hit the mark then the Mod Squad remake. In a way I highly recommend everyone see this film, because it's different from the typical Hollywood turn out, and someone at a studio decided to drop millions of dollars on it with people spending hundreds of hours making it. Will there be a sequel? I should predict not. So hey, it's a one off deal. For all the people that hate it...you're eyes will bleed no longer. I predict that this will be Sean Connery's second Zardoz (and I love Zardoz). In 50 years, people will look to this film and think...hella weird (due, no doubt to the failed sense of British humour.

I can just see how an opening scene with even a little more subtlety (there could hardly have been less) would've paid-off handsomely.  I was quickly engaged by Steed's and Peel's flirty dialog full of double entendre's and remembered why as a grade school girl, it was the only show that my father and I happily watched together.

Taking this movie on its own (ahem) merits, one can see how weak and poor it really is.Don't try to figure out motivation. Too much of the film ended up on the cutting room floor to leave coherent explanations for DeWynter's reasons for doing what he does. The clone of Emma Peel is a loose end we never really understand. (It's simply another contrivance, like so much of the plot of this movie.) And the chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman is difficult to believe. Sadly, the cast is a very talented assortment displaying no talent to speak of. Fiennes and Connery deliver their lines with the strength of a TV movie. And while Uma Thurman makes an attempt at actually acting (with a passable British accent), her performance is underutilized by the laughable direction.And I haven't even compared this to the original TV series. When that is made, you can see this piece of trash for what it really is.Emma Peel is not a weak or easily intimidated character. The director of this movie thought otherwise. John Steed is not a flat, joyless robot. Apparently, Ralph Fiennes had to interpret Steed in this way as to make him less likeable. The sets did not emphasize the loopy eccentricities made famous in the series. Instead, the feel of the story is incongruous and annoying. And it's revolting if you loved the original series.I was astonished to see this film being sold in stores for $8 (pre-viewed). Word of mouth made certain it was one to avoid. And to save your time and minimize your revulsion, don't even rent it. Watch the original series and rejoice in that original atmosphere and clever campiness.

Par for the course, since I'm somewhat eclectic in my tastes. Anyway, I thought this film was excellent.  It shows, for once and for all, that one does not need a 40-billion-dollar mega-blaster and trillions of rounds of ammunition.  Sometimes, the movie points out, the simplest things work the best; I liked the fact that there was a sword-fighting scene, the fact that Uma Thurman's character took out the baddie without using a fancy wristwatch or wristband-laser-gadget.  (I want to say, for the record, I love Bond movies, but sometimes the simpler ways are just as good.)  The simple humor of tea time and such is a good reminder that, in the grand scheme of things, it's not only important to fight for something, but to occasionally take time out to appreciate-truly appreciate-what one is defending.  Tea time, crumpets, and such, to a non-Britisher like me, is showing that you can have a good time without the typical American idea of let's get drunk and screw.  The humor was ideal; cat and mouse, understated with a delicious sense of wanting more, yet being strangely satisfied with the status quo.  I absolutely fell down laughing when I saw Alice bring a tommy gun out of her handbasket on the bike.  It was a gentle spy story, which is a refreshing change of pace with, as I said before, simplicity beating out an agent with a machine gun.I actually will be so bold as to hope for a sequel.Long live the Avengers.

There is a good deal of English sense of humor, with its amiable apparatus of bowler-hats, umbrellas, cups of tea, etc. For instance, I liked the perfectly good-mannered talking between people killing each other. There are also some subtleties. A remarkable one when Thurman tries to escape from Connery's palace, she gets trapped into a sort of mathematical paradox, a homage to Escher's paintings (I fear most audience missed to notice it, though).  In my opinion, a fault of the movie is the excess of special effects, which fail to blend with English humor. On the whole, to view The Avengers is a moderately funny but relaxing way of spending 90 minutes. Possibly, the absence of ultra-violence, sexualities and all that has affected its success, but I will be the very last to blame the director and the producers for this.

It mixed spy intrigue with weird, surreal plots & settings, putting two eccentric heroes against even more eccentric villains. So it was with high expectations fans waited for this movie.But something terrible happened. Test screenings Warners Bros. did for their stylish adaptation of The Avengers (based on the color episodes with Patrick John Steed MacNee and Diana Mrs. Peel Rigg) were disastrous; for whatever reason, the audience - many of which had probably never seen episodes of the series and had likely expected something different - just didn't get it. Audience response was reportedly pretty negative, to say the least.The people at WB panicked and in an effort to somehow make the movie more accessible (or whatever) and speed it up somewhat, some 30 minutes(!) of footage (maybe more, I don't have exact figures) were cut. Which, unsurprisingly, shows in the final version. Plot elements - like the mysterious evil twin of Emma Peel, and the real Mrs. Peel's knowledge of the password that gained them entrance to Sir August DeWynter's lair - are suddenly left unexplained. What we got was basically an incomplete movie.Which is a shame, of course, especially since there are so many good things about it. The movie is actually very faithful to the series.The surreal settings, like the strangely empty streets of London, for example, or the delightfully deranged teddy bear meeting; the scene with the stairs in DeWynter's castle, the rural English village that's actually a training ground for secret agents...While it is impossible to replace the on-screen charisma & presence of the original actors, in my opinion Ralph Fiennes was decent as John Steed, albeit probably a bit too young for the part. Uma Thurman was good as Mrs. Peel; the movie version was maybe too perfect, being better at everything than Steed, which was overdoing it a bit. But in some scenes another side of her was revealed, showing feelings of insecurity on her part which nicely balanced out the otherwise flawless character. A nice psychological touch, I think (she might be trying to excel at things to make up for that insecurity, etc.)...Casting Sean Connery - the original spy, James Bond - as the villain, was an interesting idea. Some more insight in the character would have been nice, but that may be because of the unfortunate editing... Apart from that, he looked great in that teddybear suit. )For the rest the movie had a nice Bond-style intro (and a nice Bond-style song by Grace Jones at the end), music was very nice, production design was great, a 60's meets the nineties look which was a nice touch; SFX were good. There were cameos by stand up comedian Eddie Izzard, and the lead singer (can't remember his name) I believe, of that pop group the Happy Mondays(?) as henchmen of DeWynter. Speaking of cameos, Patrick MacNee, the original John Steed, makes an unseen appearance as Invisible Jones.Final word, part 1 entertaining, not bad at all, but could have been so much better (it is incomplete; we need a director's cut!); if you are a fan of the TV series, or even if you're not, check this movie out, you might find you like it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Final word, part 2 test screenings are, in my opinion, a Bad Idea. (Thanks to the wonder of test screenings we got the infamous happy ending and voice-over tacked on to Blade Runner, to name a good example...)

Although I've never seen the television show, I have the distinct impression that this movie was trying very hard to use the same humor as the series(s), yet also couldn't resist it's Hollywood heritage. That of the action flick. Now, as the rather loud people behind me in the theater kept reminding the rest of us, it wasn't believable in the least. Of course that in and of itself isn't a problem. After all, a big joy of movies is removing yourself from reality. However, you shouldn't necessarily be aware of it. With The Avengers, I was almost painfully aware of discrepancies. I say almost because I'm able to remember more excruciating experiences with Batman and Robin (also with Uma. Hmmm...) and more recently with Armageddon.The major flaw seemed to be one of continuity within the story. And a sort of unenthusiasm among the actors. To her credit, Uma Thurman looked like she put more into her part than the rest of the cast. Whereas Ralph Fiennes and Sean Connery especially seemed like they weren't having all that much fun.

Like Batman and Robin, The Avengers, through sheer will of its poor critical reception, compels one to see it. An unseen force taunts the innocent rental video store customer with a come on, you know you want to, you're dying to know if it's as bad as they say.Of course, the Avengers, like Batman and Robin, IS every inch as bad as they say. 86 minutes (the anaemic plot can't even stretch to an hour and a half) of sheer, unerring tedium that beggars belief. Thurman is the most obvious target. Her English accent is about 90% successful to my ears, (she's certainly no Keanu or Dick Van Dyke in the fake Brit stakes), but this notably draws on her acting. But the main flaw is her innate lack of irony. She just doesn't appear to comprehend such an old style of wit (not that such a misinterpretation is hard, as limply presented as it is here), and whereas in the delightful Pulp Fiction she amuses with her tales of Tony Rocky Horror and being the humour element of Fox Force Five, as Mrs. Peel she's a washout.Many people cite the film's failure as a direct comparison to the television series. Whereas I understand enough of the show to know the real Mrs. Peel was too much of a lady to kick Eddie Izzard where it hurts, I've never really been acquainted with the 60s exploits of Patrick Macnee and co for it to really matter. To this end, I believe this gives me a fresh advantage in viewing the movie. I came to The Avengers without having to compare Fiennes' charm to that of Patrick's, or compare Thurman's curves to the incomparable cheekbones of Diana Rigg. It matters not. As good as the tv show, better, worse, the end result is the same the movie stinks.Never on celluloid has there been such a resounding lack of chemistry between two leads. Even Thurman's scripted interruptions and witty rejoinders come too late, with Fiennes, sparkling in Strange Days, excruciatingly self-conscious in Steed's shoes. Wilfully eccentric and forcefully quaint, their mannerisms are more poseur than debonair. These are two people that wouldn't even pass the time of day in real life, much less conduct a sexual relationship with chaste closed lips. Half the time it's almost impossible to believe they were in the same room during their scenes together, so weak is their connection.A slight upturn in the film is Sean Connery, who must have owed his agent a favour to have accepted this appallingly scripted farrago. As with his James Bond (to which the Bassey-soundalike Grace Jones end song owes a tip of the hat), Connery has an air of physical menace. And, as with the quote of this review, given half a chance Sean can make even the most innocent of lines sound dirty. He was actually talking about rain. Most of the time, though, he spouts about wanting a ransom in exchange for decent weather in England (like English people are so used to decent weather rain and snow would bother them - has the writer ever set foot in this country???) and tries to drug-rape Mrs. Peel in a distasteful scene. The rest of his lines are as inept as John Steed... what a horse's a**e of a name, yet he manages to hold some modicum of dignity dressed as a giant teddy bear.In all honesty I can see no way, no level on which this film works. Direction in terms of shots and angles is reasonable, but in terms of actors it's lousy. The script is trite and thin. I really can't bring myself to describe the storyline as a collection of set pieces, as the term set piece generally implies something good. Whereas even the execrable Batman and Robin had some good bits threaded together, none of the painfully set-up segments that make up this inanity carry any form of tension, drama or wit. Believe me, this film truly is as bad as they say. I saw this film so you don't have to. Thank me for it, hate me for it, reward me for it. Just do me a favour and don't bother to see it.

Sure, if Al Pacino had tried to rob a bank dressed as a big pink teddy in Dog Day Afternoon, it wouldn't work.  But it works wonderfully in this film.  In fact, it's absolutely perfect.  And it's indicative of the fact that this film is not realistic.  It's surreal, and fantastical, and a little whimsical.  The dialogue fits with this perfectly.  The relentless repartee between Peel and Steed is wonderful (just imagine a competent actor delivering Peel's lines with an authentic sounding accent, and it will help).  It's a bit of a stretch that Peel is better than Steed at *everything*, and takes the PC thing a bit too far, but this is a minor quibble, as Peel wins and Steed loses with such wonderful grace and aplomb that it's hard to mind.  Besides, Steed holds his end up well enough, so it's ok.  Anyway, you'll probably hate it if you're like most people, but I thought it was very enjoyable.  I smiled through the whole thing.

While both actors should be commended for developing their own interpretation of the characters (and in Thurman's case, not losing her British accent) neither one is able to capture the charisma displayed by the original duo, played on TV in the late 1960's by Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg.

I wasn't as shocked to learn that the studio refused to screen it for critics (which probably caused movie reviewers to cry foul and needlessly harp on the film) as I was to find out that the film clocked in at a scant 89-minute running length.  That's appropriate for a Disney animated feature or an Adam Sandler comedy, but it doesn't do justice to a big-budget, kick-ass, summertime adventure film starring three Oscar winning performers. Based upon the film's original trailer, several promotional stills, and a paperback novel based on the original screenplay, it was obvious that the majority of the film wound up on the cutting room floor.  One can only hope Warner Brothers will one day release a director's cut with the restored footage on home video. The filmmakers do deserve some credit though.  Steed and Peel's introductions and characterizations are nicely handled.  The costumes and sets are terrific (although one never knew London was so densely populated.) The special effects and score are serviceable, yet not really dynamic.  All in all, the filmmakers deserve credit for making the effort, but should be scolded for execution.

Uma Thurman is more wooden than a 2X4.  Sean Connery puts in his usual charm-the-legs-off-a-mule performance, but it is completely destroyed by the editing, the framing, and pretty much everything else in the movie.  In fact, he once said that if there were a license to kill, he would've used it to kill the producers and directors of this movie.  He liked the script, but was horrified by the result.There is one kind of neat scene where Emma Peel (Thurman) is trapped in a black-and-white room (which has just the right starkness to remind one of the TV show) which she can't leave because of a Escher-style staircase that puts her right back where she started.  But that's the only neat scene. The rest is pure tripe.The worst part is the disgrace this film heaps upon the series.  The Avengers was a great show, with charm, wit, and an inability to take itself too seriously.  This movie has none of those.  It shames the entire franchise, shames the performance of Diana Rigg as Emma Peel, shames the career of Sean Connery, and then shames anybody unfortunate enough to watch it.One wonders which great institution of British television will be destroyed next.  The Prisoner perhaps?  Doctor Who?  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?  Blake's Seven?  Only time will tell.  When the time comes, I'll be hiding in the broom closet.

Other times it sucks! The sexual tension between Thurman and Fiennes is the most pathetic display I have seen in a LONG time. The interaction between Fiennes and Connery, however, is good, but that is not enough to save it from being an almost total disaster.Uma Thurman is, as always, beautiful but she is so much better than what she shows here. Fiennes showed that he is a very accomplished actor, e.g. in The English Patient, but he is dragged down by poor direction and a terrible plot. The same goes for Mr. Connery who is the one I pity the most. He is, normally, incredible. Here he is, at best, good. He deserves so much more than this.

As great as Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are as actors (in my opinion), they could not pull off their characters of Emma Peel and John Steed. They played them so cool, up to the point where they showed no emotion what so ever and everything was in monotone. But I must make it clear that I'm not blaming the actors, I am blaming the fact that these characters were terribly written.The film itself, ugh, bleh, eck, and argh is about all I can mention. The film dragged on for an eternity. An hour and a fifteen minutes into the movie, the plot is finally revealed. Next, the movie tries to resolve everything in its remaining ten minutes. Then, everything about the movie was too confusing because none of it was explained adequately. The entire movie is too painfully boring to view.The only thing I could say remotely good about this film is Sean Connery. He played his character, though his character is ill conceived as well, to the best of his ability and was able to pull it off. But then again, he pulled it off just barely.Simply put, avoid this movie in any way possible. You'll be saving yourself from a painful experience.

Critics tend to jump on the (negative) bandwagon, the public gets an image stamped on its consciousness and the bomb label is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happened with the movie version of 'The Avengers.' It turns out the label is deserved, but maybe for different reasons than one might think.'The Avengers' doesn't suffer from a stupid script or embarrassing bad acting. Whoever put this movie together bent over backward to make sure that every shot in the film and every line of dialog spoken was something that could have come from the British TV series of the '60's on which it is based. And much of it could get a seal of approval as far as authenticity goes. Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie, but rather money. Things may look and sound like the old TV show, but this coldly calculated production totally fails to capture its spirit.Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we  viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay. Consequently, fifteen minutes into the movie, one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film. Also, one never gets involved in the convoluted plot and never develops any affinity for the characters. Plus, the film is given an obligatory 'Thunderball'-style ending done 1998 style. The old TV show never relied much on things blowing up and this addition here is no improvement.In this context it's absolutely impossible for new actors to succeed in the roles of Steed and Mrs. Peel. Whether Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are doing a good job or not is not easy to tell and irrelevant anyway in this by-the-numbers production. They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit? The one positive thing I can say is that Uma Thurman looks absolutely gorgeous as Mrs. Peel.

It seemed like an experiment in which they wanted to see if they could make a film with no plot whatsoever.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman simply show up in costume and say their lines. No attempt at personality or character is made at all. Sean Connery is mildly interesting as the villain, but we have no idea what the hell he's doing (or even in the movie for that matter) until the last twenty minutes or so. Eddie Izzard stars as one of his henchmen, but he doesn't say a word the whole film until his predictable demise. Normally  this wouldn't really be a problem, but here it just seems like they never got around to writing him any lines. He lacks the charm of other silent sidekicks such as Silent Bob (Clerks, Chasing Amy) and Teller (Penn&Teller).Speaking of silence, why does Emma Peel's clone remind me so much of Frankenstein's monster? She gets around with robotic movements  that remind me of the droids in Phantom Menace. Even when she's fighting it doesn't look natural.  Why is it that the cyborgs in Blade Runner have interesting personalities and the agility of a cheetah, yet Emma's clone (a living creature, mind you) is a mechanical mute? The worst part is she is no real importance to the film. No reason for being there in the first place.From what I've seen of the original series, Emma and John always had a subtle sexual innuendo between them. It sometimes seemed like their relationship went beyond that of partner agents, but you were never really sure. Comparable to Mulder and Scully on The X-Files. That whole aspect is totally screwed up here. Ralph and Uma take it beyond the mild flirting Im talking about . The scene where they screwed up was in Steed's apartment. They start to kiss, but somebody walks in on them. NO! That scene never should have taken place! Oh well.This whole movie's a mess. But most movie's based on old TV shows usually are.

Uma Thurman was about as sexy as watching a documentary on bacteria reproduction and displays the emotional range of a department store mannequin. Ralph Fiennes is humorless, inept and unendurable.After about two and a half minutes into this film, my facial muscles were involuntarily twisting into a cringing grimace and for the life of me, I couldn't remove said cringing grimace until this stench finished - and at about the midway point of this movie, I really wished I was blind, if not deaf, mercifully both.I have the inside word that this film is going to become the latest Special Air Services' endurance and torture training video. If you can survive this, then international terrorists are a push over.I've just been through my Thesaurus and I can't find any more words to say how loathsome this film is.

Silliness in moderation, of course, was one of the hallmarks of the Avengers TV series, and everyone loved it.  The movie goes off the deep-end with it, alas, offering up a cadre of criminal scientists dressed in teddy-bear costumes, radio-controlled helicopters shaped like giant insects, a retail establishment that sells weather, and an invisible man.  A story that taxes our belief a little less would have been better; there is enough humor in the script without it having to resort to Romper-Room-style science-fiction.  (One could argue that the original TV show did the same sorts of things, but what plays in one decade as tongue-in-cheek risks being embarrassing for audiences thirty years later.  The film's silliness wasn't properly upgraded for the nineties.)Sean Connery's part could have been played by anyone.  That's not a criticism of Connery; it's of the part.  It calls for a man who can look arrogant and speak assertively.  It doesn't call for anything that Connery has to offer, not for his fine-tuned blend of suaveness and ruthlessness, not for his confidence or good looks, not for his size or strength, not for his screen presence, nothing.  It doesn't even particularly call for being British.  The writers created a generic character and then picked Sean Connery to play it for box-office draw.  It didn't work.The only other thing that irks is that the film tries to force-feed us feminism.  That just isn't necessary any more.  In fact, it was barely necessary on the old TV show.  The old Steed and Peele operated in an almost Scully-and-Mulder fashion, in which gender-equality is assumed and doesn't have to be shoved down our throats.  They supported the feminist ideal by practicing it rather than preaching it.  The movie, on the other hand, feels compelled to have Mrs. Peele demonstrate her superiority to Steed in every scene, at swordsmanship, at chess, at science, you name it.  At times, Steed even comes across as a bit of a jerk - not the Avengers that I knew and loved.  Hey, film writers we all know that women can do anything men can do.  How about relaxing with that fact and enjoying it . . . instead of constantly proselytizing it?Some good points Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes realize the roles wonderfully.  There is much subtle humor in the dialogue, and just the right amount of sexual tension in their interaction.  Thurman exudes the same matter-of-fact confidence that Diana Rigg gave Emma Peel.  Fiennes is the perfect gentleman warrior, able to defeat whole armies of villains with his umbrella.  Thurman was never more beautiful.  Also, I was delighted by the musical score's tribute to Laurie Johnson's original music from the TV show, still as lush and sophisticated as it was in the sixties.And yes, that was Patrick Macnee's voice as the invisible Colonel Jones.

Hopefully this movie picks up where an episode of the show left off, because of the glaring number of unexplained plot devices. Stupid dialogue, plot holes, and bad acting almost across the board make this a below average movie. Saving points Uma Thurman's outfits, one or two above-average explosions, above average weather effects and Sean Connery's performance (not as good as his older movies, but better than the rest of the cast). If you are really desperate for a movie, or want to hold a MST3K session with your friends, this one would do nicely.

What is up with everybody hating this movie?  It was pretty good, not great, not a classic, but not bad by a long shot.  It was very funny and very deadpan, lots of good eye candy, clever dialogue and, unlike so many other movies, it KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.  So what if the film was basically a 90 minute TV episode with an enormous budget?  It was a great 90 minute TV episode with an enormous budget, and it had no pretensions to be anything else.  The plot was stupid. - come on!   Evil villain tries to take over the world by controlling the weather - it has a wonderful comic book appeal which fits right in with the other surreal touches in the movie like giant flying robot bees, invisible bureaucrats relegated to crappy basement filing jobs, and protagonists so unflappable as to border on absurd.  So much more creative and interesting than the average shlock Hollywood puts out - as if there's any realistic plots to take over the world.Perusing the onslaught of negative reviews filed here at the database makes pretty clear the effect a critical wave can have.  The oft cited complaint about the wasted cinematic firepower makes me wonder if the filmmakers didn't do themselves an injustice by giving the film such a high profile with stars and money, thus leading to totally false expectations of what this movie SHOULD look like.  I imagine if this film had been made without so much starpower people would have liked it much better, maybe even raved about it.Worst movie of the year?

Indeed, the scriptwriters must have been under the influence to give the highly talented Eddie Izzard a part as a mute. The performances from Fiennes and Thurman are also to be considered dodgy. Fiennes almost looks close to tears in places and the legendary Mr. Connery wouldn't look out of place in a pantomime. The whole charade is a perfect example of what can be made of a talented cast under the direction of Jerimeah Chechick (Sharon Stone in Diabolique.?).The plus points are that the whole film looks really nice and some of the effects and set pieces are good, but the wafer thinness of it all soon dashes all hopes of your enjoyment of even this aspect of it all.All in all the makers of this film made a total hash of what was a respectable British classic, but now just a laughing stock.Will Mr. Chechick ever work again..?

Sadly, all you end up with is weak dialogue, poor direction and a lack of any real plot.The plot is a particular problem with this film. While the original used devices such as doubles, weird devices, mad scientists and so on, it never did it *seriously*. This film takes itself too seriously and, in what appears to be the director suddenly realising this, he sticks the band of villains into teddy bear suits. Oh dear.Sean Connery, surely one of most acclaimed of late twentieth century actors, is wasted in this ridiculous farce of a film. Most of the time he seems to have been told to imitate Windsor Davies in the British sit-com It Ain't Half Hot Mum. In several scenes I was convinced it actually *was* Mr Davies, until a close-up dispelled the illusion. Maybe they could have saved money by hiring Davies instead of Connery, and getting the script rewritten again.The director, it must be said, tried in places to pay homage to the original series - obvious references to such episodes as The House that Jack Built, Small Game for Big Hunters, The Town of No Return, The See-Through Man and  The Forget-Me-Knot and, I suppose, a couple Tara King episodes, may have vaguely entertained die-hard fans, but not this one. To have viewed so many episodes of the series and then still not *get* it smacks of gross ineptitude.At no time did he get a real grasp on the characters - Fiennes characterisation of Steed was insipid, more in keeping with Roger Moore's smarmy, two-dimensional Bond than Macnee's superlative Steed. Blatant sexual innuendo was never part of the Avengers ethos, there we had greater subtlety.Uma's Mrs Peel? First of all, while she is still a scientist, she's not the same kind. Physics, not chemistry is her forte, yet she seems oddly distant from a project she was supposed to be the driving force of. While she does display the occasional swash-buckling excellence, her characterisation is not strong enough, only the device of an evil clone of Mrs Peel allows Thurman to act as the original Mrs Peel did.Connery's villain I have already discussed. the less said the better.The redeeming feature? Macnee's 'shining' cameo appearance.Not, perhaps, as bad a film as I had been lead to expect, certainly no worse than Starship Troopers, but nowhere near the excellence of the original production.

It was completely different from anything else available on TV, streets ahead of any other offering.It is better to remember the various series than re-watch them, however. At first, I was excited when they were shown on TV recently. But I soon stopped watching them. They didn't age well.When the movie came out, it didn't work on any level. It wasn't like the original series, so it didn't please those who expected it to be. It didn't have a good enough plot, and the actors seemed to have no idea who they were supposed to be playing.Ralph Fiennes' performance was flat. Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel was the most spectacular piece of miscasting since Nastassja Kinski as Tess (of the D'Urbervilles)! Why not use British actresses for British roles?One change I really didn't like. In the original series, there is no sexual relationship between Steed and Mrs Peel. Steed is a partner, a mentor, not a lover. In one of the final episodes, we even see Mr Peel, Emma's husband (he looks suspiciously like Patrick Macnee, of course). Steed is a gentleman, he would never presume on a married woman.The relationship was very interesting, nonetheless. Making them lovers in the movie was a loss rather than a gain. All in all, a poor movie with few redeeming features.

The opening credits are stunning, Ralph Fiennes is great as John Steed and Uma Thurman shocks with an actually believeable performance (unlike Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin) as Mrs. Peel.What brings the film down overall are some rather silly action sequences (the killer bees, for one), the convoluted cloning sub-plot and a lack of chemistry between the two leads. Also, I'm still wondering what they are avenging exactly, because the true nature of the weather tyrant (Sir August) does not really come through until the last quarter or so, and I found it hard to keep up. Perhaps this is a problem with a dialogue or unnecessary sequences (I'm not sure about those dress-up bears).Sean Connery is a highlight, as is the sassy Sixties spy/thriller music. Also, in the middle of a crisis it's good to know that one can stop for tea (in several instances this was hilariously great). The visuals and direction is good, playing like a giant TV episode.

I never really expected anything to come of it, I mean the magical ponies vs. star wars is much too deep a concept than the american public could ever withstand, I mean that's almost as good as if the carebears took on james bond! I mean that could never happen.... right?Wrong. Enter The Avengers. This movie sold me immediately because I'm a sucker for Uma Thurman, though it did bother me a bit to think that throughout the movie she was preggo with some other man's child. How could she do this to me? I thought we had something special. Shut up Tal, and get to the mashed potatos. Okay, okay, don't yell. Going to this movie, I didn't know what to expect, I've seen the classic TV show, and first of all it's not such a classic. I haven't seen it anywhere in like forever. The truth is that is basically was supposed to be like another James Bond type thing.The movie begins with Ralph Finnes (playing John Steed) and Uma Thurman (playing Emma Peel) being called on some top secret confidential code red really hush hush type meeting with this nicotine stained version of... of... well, some old fat guy in a wheelchair. So there's this chick impersonating Uma and killing people and doing all kinds of mean things, so, who do they suspect? hm. Uma.In preparation, Uma dons her tights and prepares for battle. You never see her naked in the movie which is a negative quality about any movie whatever (I am a firm believer that any movie could be made better with a nude Uma Thurman, even grumpy old men could have used a bit of ThurmanBreast). John Steed is almost naked in this one scene, this should excite you ladies. Not. He's such a dork, whatever, not worth the time.So Sean Connery is this scotsman Sir August de Wynter who wants to control the weather, and decides the best way to go about it would be to dress up as a carebear (I kid you not). So then all the bears run around shooting each other, Sean gets ****ed, calls up a mighty storm, the avengers step in, Uma kills her clone (I almost cried. Who in their right mind would kill a perfectly good Uma?), there's this great action seqeucne where Sean and Ralph fight for a bit. Ralph kindof wins (he is a sissy afterall), Sean loses and we learn that metereology should be left in the safe (albeit plump) hands of Al Roker.If my commentary made no sense, neither will the movie, but it makes no sense consistantly, and makes no attempt to convince you that it is making sense and you're just missing it, kindof like when the carebears had a moral which didn't make any sense at the end of their show, like never paint your neighbors lawn green because it already is and then they'd cackle on insanely with glee as if they've just revealed one of the secrets of life, and we used to laugh along with them. Now, if you're like me and have waited for the bad bears to come out and play, this is your flick. Either way, it's a good way to pass the time and is a perfect makeout movie for you datebuffs because if you miss any chunk of the movie, it'll be just as if you missed nothing at all.

So, what went wrong? Well, when the running time of a film goes from 120 minutes to 90 minutes, it's not hard to guess. Added to that, Warner Brothers went further in showing that they did not rate the film by not having a critics showing. Come on guys, why not just have posters saying It's a dog - don't watch it!? Having said all of this, I enjoyed the 90 minutes of the film I was allowed to see. Ralph Fiennes was excellent, opting to take the role seriously rather than send it up, while Sean Connery showed that he'd make a damned good Bond villain. The fights and stunts were well arranged, and the set design truly startling - especially the snowbound Trafalgar Square. Against all this, Uma Thurman seemed to be paying more attention to her accent than to anything else.

What makes the movie work is not its over-the-top acting or its lazy plotting but its tongue-in -cheek humor which evokes laughter from the audiences who dare to see a high risk film such as this.Many popular television shows, including the X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, get away with some of the same campy issues and stiff acting that is present in the Avengers movie but they are critically lauded.  Why should promising shows such as these not be compared directly to a film with an over-acting Sean Connery, one of his funniest roles, or a brilliantly proper corp of secret agents.No one should care whether giant mechanized bees or people dressed in psychedelic fur bear suits are believable because they aren't, they aren't supposed to be.

The only anguish I felt watching the Avengers was over the total lack of character development.  Both Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were trapped into reciting lines that left them no opportunity to flesh out actual characters.  That is not to say that a movie has to be serious for the audience to believe in the hero, James Bond films being a perfect example.  The Avengers fell terribly short.Perhaps Sean Connery got involved in this project, wanting to play the diabolical genius madman, bent on conquering the earth.  What great fun that could be for an actor of his caliber.  The same can be said for the motivations behind Thurman and Fiennes' roles as well-known heroes.  Too bad the script was written so badly, the story so disjointed, to derail even the most devoted fans.  The musical score was just as uninspiring.And tell me, please, what's going on with the greasy guy in the wheelchair sucking down cigarettes?  And the blind chick that is just too weird?

If you're past the pimple stage in your life, however, these characters are as flat as the screen on which they're projected.Overall, leave this film to rent when it comes out on video (maybe, next week) when you are looking for something mindless to do for 90 minutes.

Both Thurman and Fiennes appear to be just going through the motions.  In fact, Fiennes' (who I consider an excellent actor) John Steed is so understated and stiff that he might as well have been replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a pair of moving lips.  Sean Connery can't even save this turkey, seeming confused and bored on screen.The only thing that might have saved the film was the cinematography.  The Avengers is filled with eye candy and stirring images, but not even the camera work and set decoration in the film can save it.  The opening theme was well done, but then disappears, leaving us with the rest of the score, which was simply disappointing.Debates have raged between those of us who weren't lucky enough to avoid this film over what the worst aspect of it was.  Some say script, some say direction.  Yet others insist it was the actors.  For myself, I can sum the film up with a quote from my wifeIt was a movie I was sorry I didn't wait to see on cable - someone else's cable.

There are lots of scenes that remained in the movie, but with all the important dialogue omitted. Why would they have cut out so much of the dialogue when it actually explains what's happening??? I don't understand it. Instead we get a movie that jumps around and leaves much...try ALL, to be assumed. Emma's connection w/ August, August's relationship w/ Father...all that could have been explored without dampening the action.

Not great, but good.  It is fast, glossy, stylish and funny, managing to keep the best aspects of the series while successfully updating it to '90s production values.  Fiennes and Thurman are excellent as Steed and Peel, with great chemistry between them, while Connery makes an appropriately diabolical madman (although the Connery twinkle is ever-present).  The supporting cast do a fine job too - watching Eddie Izzard keep his mouth shut for that long is a strange experienceI am not familiar with much of Jeremiah Chechik's work but he makes a pretty good fist of the action sequences, particularly the car chase, and the weather special effects are superb.  The script is filled with bizarre touches which mostly work well, although the dialogue takes a bit of getting used to.   Problems?  A couple - some of the dialogue in Steed and Peel's earlier scenes is rather stilted and overwrought, and goes on for too long.  The whole film feels too short, as if it has been cut heavily, meaning that one or two scenes don't make much sense.  But the whole film takes place in a kind of parallel reality anyway so this isn't as much of a problem as it might have been. Overall?  It's great fun, and well worth seeing whether or not you're an Avengers fan.  I had barely watched the series before, but I might start now...

The transitions between scenes were often abrupt and illogical, the characters' courses of action seemed like non sequiturs, and quite a few plot elements just plain made no sense.  The number of huh? why did that happen? or  why did they do that? moments piled up as the movie went on.  In fact, the plot made =less sense= than B&R, if such a thing can be believed.So why did I like it more?  For one thing, I wasn't familiar with the source material, so if it was distorted or badly represented as B&R, it didn't enrage me.  In fact, I assumed (probably wrongly) that the TV show operated on the same bizarre logic.  But more importantly, I enjoyed the characters. It was a nice change of pace to see Steed as a more genteel British secret agent than Bond, one who doesn't blow up two hundred bad guys in the first ten minutes.  The Mrs. Peel character was an interesting enigma, the slightly-unhinged chaotic counterpoint to Steed's orderliness.  It's possible that these characterizations are far off-base from the TV versions , and I'd be very unhappy with them if I knew any better.  But hey.  In contrast, I detested virtually every character in B&R.I also enjoyed the low-key British humor, especially in the banter between the two main characters.  And there was enough of a surreal aspect to keep me at least mildly entertained throughout.Overall, it's not a movie that holds up well to examination, and one that could (and should) have been a lot better.  Aside from a smattering of surreal imagery here and there and some droll wit, it's not likely to make any sort of lasting impression.  See it at a matinee but leave your brain at home.

Sometimes it works out, (The Addams Family), but it usually  signals distributor anxiousness that negative Stateside word of mouth will  destroy the film's chance of success. In this case, Warner Brothers were  probably hoping that sympathetic English fans of the original TV series  would deliver some positive words which could be used to publicise the film , given that they omitted the press from preview screenings.The Avengers, in the final event, is just as terrible as the portents  suggested. Substituting noise and spectacle for the narrative cleverness  often displayed by its predecessor and totally unconvincing on the level of  cool unflappability to which it aspires, the film is a cold, irritating  fantasy film for ten year old boys which fails even to use the charisma of  its stars effectively.Though one could argue that the weak storyline is a homage to the rather  obscure nature of the original series, there is a sense that it runs deeper  than that. The dialogue is weak and obvious at every turn and with Fiennes  and Thurman struggling against no end of supposedly ironic one-liners,  there is no time for the fabled MacNee/Rigg chemistry to develop.Meanwhile the film revels in explosions and Michael Kamen's over the top and  inappropriate action movie score, hoping that perhaps the distraction will  prevent people noticing that nothing whatsoever of interest is going on on  screen.The final straw is the waste of Sean Connery as a completely non threatening  villain whose plans to manipulate the weather are vaguely motivated and at  best another poor in-joke about British culture along with the constant  forced references to good manners and tea drinking. Clad in kilt and toting  lines from Shakespeare, Connery is curiously flat. Despite a supporting  cast of familiar British comedians, so is everyone else, including Fiennes,  who struggles with a character weakened by rewriting and Thurman who  continues her performance from last year's number one turkey Batman and  Robin.The film will probably outrage you if it doesn't just bore you, because with  the evident talent involved and even the one or two moments which work (the  giant teddy bears), this is a vapid and empty spectacle has been made with  more concern for style than anything remotely resembling entertainment  value and seems a positively malevolent waste of everyone's time.

They're clearly  embittered at their own exclusion until &#145;the proles' get a look, and with  hostile reviews only just starting to trickle across the media from the  night before, it was curiously refreshing to see a major film without  reading any advance opinions, and one that turned out to be so enjoyable.Sean Connery is terrific as villain Sir August de Wynter, with a splendid  performance and the movie's best outfits &#150; not to mention much of its best  innuendo.  I've never really seen him as all that sexy before, but there's  something about him as an evil villain in a nice suit&#133;!  The shot of him  all in white in the maze, positively glowing in the sunlight, is gorgeous,  as is his pale underlighting in the dark weather control suite.  In fact,  both lighting and direction for the film are outstanding.  Patrick Macnee &#145;appears' as Colonel Invisible Jones, a charming and  thoroughly un-Steedlike performance.  It's just after him that I found  myself thinking of the hero as &#145;Steed', rather than &#145;Ralph Fiennes'. After  all, if Patrick Macnee calls him Steed&#133;  Against all my expectations,  Fiennes is actually rather good.  His pinstriped suit is very dull, in  contrast to the original Steed; who can look at Macnee's gorgeous velvet  collars without wanting to dress like he does (and wanting other people to  dress like Emma)?  At least he gets to wear some rather nice other  ensembles later on &#150; and his best scene is probably the one where he's nude  but for a copy of the Financial Times.  I have to say, Ralph Fiennes does  score over Patrick Macnee in at the &#145;decorativeness' stakes!  As to the bit -part players, most villains are made quite stylish by being stripped of all  lines, and violent old lady Alice is a real scene-stealer.The special effects are quite impressive.  Expecting cartoony CGI for the  &#145;killer bees', I was quite won over by their strange realism, and all the  weather looks quite, quite fantastic.  As this was &#150; rather scarily &#150; the  film I was looking forward to more than any since Return of the Jedi, it's  perhaps appropriate that the climax to the superb duels should feature such  a similar effect, and that the people in bear outfits should be infinitely  more satisfying than the Ewoks.  In fact, the giant teddy bears are an  undoubted highlight, with their swivelling heads hilarious, their dead  furry forms incongruous and the &#145;pointing bear' in the lift getting the  biggest laugh from our screen's audience (who all seemed to enjoy the film,  by the way).Of course, several Avengers episodes are instantly recognisable in the mix.   The New Avengers episode Target! features a mock-up &#145;village' in which  agents test out their prowess, as does the opening scene of the film.  The  first Mrs Peel episode, The Town of No Return, has recently been re -released on video.  It opens with three of the best Avengers scenes ever a  man walking out of the sea in a huge plastic bag with an impeccable suit  inside; Steed and Emma flirting and fencing, Steed advising she should have  &#145;more flexibility in the wrist'; Steed serving tea and confectionery while  travelling, apologising to Emma for the inadequate selection &#150; all are  borrowed somehow.  Next month sees another video release for The House That  Jack Built, in which Emma is trapped in a big house that seems to defy all  the laws of physics &#150; Hallucinogen Hall, anyone?  But as the series was  constantly remaking itself too, what's wrong with that?It isn't just The Avengers that's being referenced here, with at least two  big nods to The Prisoner, several cheeky winks to James Bond (can it be a  coincidence that the &#145;Bond girl' from Patrick Macnee's A View to a Kill,  Grace Jones, belts out the Bond theme-style closing song?) and a tip of the  hat to Doctor Who in the gorgeous opening title sequence.So is it flawless?  No, of course not.  Too little is made of the Trafalgar  Square set, Mother might as well have a neon sign above her head saying  &#145;baddie', de Wynter's obsession with Emma really needs some explanation and  the scene where Steed announces he plays by the rules and Emma doesn't is  quite topsy-turvy.  The only rule that the upstanding &#145;Avengers women'  break is &#145;be male'; Steed, on the other hand, is endlessly mischievous and  rarely fights fair.There are two more central problems.  Uma Thurman isn't really bad, but she 's nowhere near good enough as Emma.  She's not interesting or assured  enough, and on several occasions gets panicky and flustered in a way that  Cathy, Emma, Tara or Purdey would never do.  It's not that she's American &#150;  I'm half-American, and the marvellous Linda Thorson, Tara King, was  Canadian &#150; but she's not Emma.  Why not just have a new name for a new  Avengers woman?  And am I alone in thinking she's rather plain?The other big hitch is the editing.  Possibly through unnecessary nerves on  the part of the studio, it's odd that in this age of bloated blockbusters  the film has actually been cut too short. Perhaps another 20 minutes or so  in the director's cut make it seems less rushed and restore several missing  links to later scenes, not to mention scenes from the trailers that simply don't appear.However, it grossly misrepresents the film to say this makes it incoherent,  or that Thurman is unwatchable.  Overall, it is highly enjoyable, with a  stylish atmosphere and exuberant wit.  It looks fabulous, and remains true  to the spirit of the original series without being slaved to it.  Ignore  the critics, go and see it, and make your own mind up &#150; you may be  pleasantly surprised.

'Cup of tea' often making an appearance in the script, hopefully not making this too English for the American audience. There is a likeness to the original series and the era eg the teddy bears, the villains and the wardrobe. Sean Connery doesn't disappoint, perhaps not used enough in the film. He kind of reminded me of a tamed version of Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman.This film is by no means brilliant, but a lot better than the crtics make out (I think they are just upset because they have to watch the film with the rest of the paying public).

Although I've never seen the television show, I have the distinct impression that this movie was trying very hard to use the same humor as the series(s), yet also couldn't resist it's Hollywood heritage.  That of the action flick.  Now, as the rather loud people behind me in the theater kept reminding the rest of us, it wasn't believable in the least.  Of course that in and of itself isn't a problem.  After all, a big joy of movies is removing yourself from reality. However, you shouldn't necessarilly be aware of it.  With The Avengers, I was almost painfully aware of discrepancies. I say almost because I'm able to remember more excruciating experiences with Batman and Robin (also with Uma. Hmmm...) and more recently with Armageddon.  The major flaw seemed to be one of continuity within the story. And a sort of unenthusiasm among the actors.  To her credit, Uma Thurman looked like she put more into her part than the rest of the cast.  Whereas Ralph Fiennes and Sean Connery especially seemed like they weren't having all that much fun.What really disappoints me, though, is that at certain parts of the film, I actually drifted off to sleep.  The only other time I've done that was during The Last of the Mohicans.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, well, at least I can be consoled in the fact that I didn't pay full price for admission.

There is dialogue aplenty here, but it's never bright. There is wordplay in spades with a screenplay that is overwritten by half -- wait for the novelization. When delivered under the sluggish direction of Jeremiah Chechik, the banter is lifeless, as dead as a mechanical wasp from the film's most throwaway special effects sequence. Patrick MacNee provides a guest voice, and Ralph Fiennes does admirably well in MacNee's old role of Steed. The glamorous Dame Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel the first time around. Here we have Uma Thurman. She has rarely been sexy or provocative in the past. She can't seem to find it here in her bone-dry, too clever repartee with Steed.

The show had a uniquely offbeat, playful  quality about it.  Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg were always suave and  never labored as the leads.    Unfortunately the new movie is overblown and labored, and misses the quirky  tone of the original.  The fault is not with the stars, who try mightily --  maybe too mightily -- to seem suave and offhand.  One big problem is that the movie has Steed and Peel meet early in the  movie.  In the TV series it seemed like they had been together for years  and knew each other intimately -- but not in the physical sense.  In the  movie Steed spends about half the time wondering if Mrs. Peel is really an  evil assassin.  The teasing dynamic that was so important in the serie is   totally destroyed here.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman certainly look their parts.  Sean Connery is  mostly wasted as the evil genius bent on controlling the world's weather.   The only character who strikes the right note of deadly nonchalance is  Eileen Atkins' middle-aged, machine gun wielding Alice, who should have  been in the movie more.There's a nice chase involving giant robot wasps, and a few amusing moments.

Given the somewhat comic -book-nature of the story, suspension of disbelief is easier to come by here  than it is in some other films; clearly this is not set in our real world,  but rather in a comic-book world with different possibilities and  plausibilities.Fiennes' Steed is quite the debonaire agent in a way that Bond could never  be, and this is well-demonstrated by the openning sequence where he emerges  from several tussles with his suit unscathed.Peel and Steed's chemistry works well, exemplified by the scene where they  play chess (without looking at the board), further themselves on the path  to romantic involvement, and analyze weather photographs--all simultaneously --without skipping a beat.If you're expecting a regular Action or Adventure film, this isn't it, but  if you're looking for a slightly off-beat comic Secret Agent Heros Battle  Arch-Villains and Still Have Time For Tea -film, this one hits it dead -on.

If you hated the weird, 60s hallucinogenic oddness of the  programmes, then this is definitely not the film to watch!Personally, I'm still not sure whether the film was seriously flawed, or  just `bizarre yet strangely appealing'.  I think on the whole though I'm  heading towards the latter.First the actors Uma Thurman (the only American) offered a more than  passable English accent as Mrs Peel; however, it was at times just too  laboured which gave rise to pacing problems.  The rest of the cast are all  much liked British actors (ok..Fiona Shaw is Irish) and therefore tended  not to suffer so much from the required stylish presentation of their  lines.  And stylish the film is!  This will either annoy, or delight you  as will the special effects which range from computerised blockbusting  spectacles to superimposed cardboard cut-outs.  Again, all in the spirit of  the original programme.And speaking of special effects, I was intrigued with some of the location  shots.  Particularly the one of them driving down the Holborn underpass,  which now appears to overlook the Thames to the Greenwich Naval College!   If you've visited London, you'll know what I mean!  (Someone's nicked the  BBC!!!)There are many, many one-liner jokes, not all of which may have been  intentional!  Maybe those of us with...risque...minds simply read too much  into the slightly stilted script??Overall though, pacing is the big problem.  I don't know whether this is  because of bad scripting, bad direction or bad editing (the film is rather  short less than 90 minutes, perchance some things were left on the cutting -room floor??).  However, if you can overlook this and take the film on its  constituent parts rather than as a whole, then you're in for an  entertaining hour and a half.For me though, the biggest disappointment was the absence of the Laurie  Johnson Avengers theme.  Or rather, to be more accurate, you get the big  opening chords, and then just when you're about to jig along to the boppy  bit it went all quiet!  Sad!I wanted to see the film because of its trailer, which is fabulous.  However,  said trailer does not give an accurate picture of what the film is like.

The scenes are beautifully shot, they are well structured and compliment the various characters as they are introduced. Ralph Fiennes is more than capable as Steed, as is Connery as Sir August, although I felt Connery lacked a little depth in some scenes perhaps due to the thinness of the script at these points, but I would have expected Connery's talents to have compensated. Uma Thurman was a great surprise for me. My reservations about her abilities to fill the role of Emma Peel soon disappeared. She was able to master an English accent as well as the poise and witty elegance of expression, giving all the charm and sassiness of Mrs. Peel with ease. Throughout there are some marvelous absurdities introduced into the plot, the 'Teddy Bears' being most notable. Again remember the original series.

The Avengers movie, unfortunately, fits this second description.Fiennes was the most successful major player in this film, if only because he managed to convey the impression that his terrible lines were somehow beneath him. The other actors, with the notable exception of Eileen Atkins, actually managed to act well below their dialogue, a feat I would have thought impossible before witnessing it. The confusion of Uma Thurman and Sean Connery attempting to cough out words like proton and simultaneously nod comprehension must have been somewhat akin to that of the writer, Don MacPherson, while copying words at random from the old middle school science book he'd never read. I came to the conclusion later on that Mr. MacPherson had never played chess, either, so he typed in the only word from the game he knew. Checkmate.Chess is one of those games that film writers use to make the actors seem, you know, smart.What kind of blackmail, I wonder, did he hold over the producers that they allowed him to make this expensive proof that the stars don't make the movie?Watching The Avengers is like watching ten-year-old girls play dress-up, have a tea party, and try to talk like adults.

And Eddie Izzard is his chief flunky, Bailey, who has very few lines and is wasted here. All of these actors have next to nothing to do, and their presence does nothing to redeem this horrid mess. The attempt at clever banter between Steed and Peel seems forced, and the feeble attempt to inject some small bit of romance between them is totally false. Fans of the original show, of which I'm one, will be hugely insulted by this perversion of the old series.But, if you ignore the source material, it's almost worth seeing just for the set pieces and Uma's fine form in a skintight leather catsuit.

Connery was, of course, the first and foremost James Bond. The Avengers was the anti-Bond; everything that was typical of the Bond films was cheerfully contradicted by the adventures of John Steed and Emma Peel. The Bond films were globe trotting affairs; The Avengers were stubbornly British. Bond, for all of his style, was something of a thug; John Steed was the epitome of English gentility. The so-called Bond girls were plentiful and colorfully oversexed; while Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel rarely wore anything more revealing than a mini-skirt, but was brilliant, brave and funny, as well as being incredibly sexy. The Bond films were Playboy fantasies; The Avengers were progressively feminist friendly. As such, the Bond films were mass market creations, always seeking to be bigger and gaudier and more explosive. The more modestly budgeted Avengers was just as incredibly far-fetched as far as plot and villains were concerned, but its tone was always self-amused and tongue in cheek. Though The Avengers had and has its loyal fans (me included), the series just couldn't compete with the world-wide phenomenon of the Bond films. This was especially true after Rigg left the series. The Avengers at its peak was a class act, but it never escaped the shadow of the Bond films.Almost like rubbing salt in the wounds, the producers of the Bond films stole Honor Blackman away from The Avengers and made her a Bond babe in GOLDFINGER. Worse, Rigg became a Bond girl as well (and was killed off) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Steed himself, Patrick Macnee, also ended up playing a supporting role (and was killed off) in A VIEW TO A KILL. It was almost like a conspiracy to destroy The Avengers little by little. Thus, when the idea arose to give The Avengers one last mega-push as a multi-million dollar, big screen adventure, it was both ironic and appropriately just to sign Connery to play exactly the sort of villain he confronted in his Bond heyday -- and to allow The Avengers to subdue him in kind. Unfortunately, the resulting film is less a vindication of The Avengers' superiority than a suicide pact. Instead of embracing the cheerful quirkiness that made The Avengers an enduring light, THE AVENGERS totally sells itself out in an effort to be a cheesy, clumsy carbon copy of James Bond. One gets the undeniable feeling that the makers of the film never actually saw a single episode of the TV series. For all of its outlandishly silliness, The Avengers was basically a warm-hearted satire of British eccentricity. The show used its dry, understated British sense of humor to mock that very same dry, understated British sense of humor. It was a little bit of Agatha Christie, a touch of James Bond and a gentle sprinkling of Monty Python, all played out at the intersection of Saville Row and Carnaby Street. The traditional and the trendy coexisting and mutually benefiting.THE AVENGERS, the movie, is,...well, it's hard to figure out just what it is, especially since forty percent of its running time was hacked off between preview and premiere. The plot, as much as one can comprehend it, involves the standard industrialist-out-to-destroy-the-world plot. It has something of the chilly demeanor of Stanley Kubrick and the garish look of bad sci-fi. It's big and overbearing, but not impressive. Cold and lifeless, Ralph Fiennes brings absolutely no charm whatsoever to his interpretation of John Steed. Indeed, he was more likable as the death camp commander in SCHINDLER'S LIST. It would be hard to find anyone capable of matching Diana Rigg's crooked-smile mix of smug sexiness and blase brilliance, but Uma Thurman's confused performance is further sabotaged by her slutty attitude and creepy appearance. And finally, as if he were a suicide bomber, Connery gives what has to be the worst performance of his career. One could logically accuse him of purposely being awful in an apparent attempt to destroy the Avengers cult for once and always were it not for the obvious fact that the script and the direction are so bad, that it might not be all his fault. The only shred of evidence that this has anything whatsoever to do with the great TV series, is a voice-only cameo by the real John Steed, Patrick Macnee. In a clever aside that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of this ignorant mess, Macnee's tiny little guest shot neatly captures all the whimsy that made the TV show a perennial delight. It is too little and too late to save this film, but it is the sole reason the film should be seen.THE AVENGERS is like WILD WILD WEST, LOST IN SPACE and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE; they all take the name of and hope to capitalize on the built-in audience of great old cult TV shows, but they totally misunderstand their source material. The filmmakers never stop and ask Why was this show loved? They want the audience of the TV shows, but they don't actually want to be associated with the TV shows. Television is beneath them; motion pictures are where it's at. Making a bad big-budget movie has more cachet than making a superior episode of a great TV show.

To warn you in advance I am a huge fan of the television series so that bias my factor in. If you have never seen the show then it would only be an awful film and not a betrayal.It really has done the impossible--it took one of the greatest shows of the 1960s and turned it into an instrument of torture. If you ever want to inflict agonising pain on your enemies then sit them in a theatre with this movie and a revolver next to them.First of all, Uma Thurman does not fill out a catsuit half as well as the REAL Emma Peel, Diana Rigg, did. Her character has so little emotion that you could care less what happens to her.The real tragedy is Ralph Fiennes playing some guy named John Steed. In the television series, Patrick Macnee made him a dapper and thoroughly heterosexual English gentlemen. The only problem is that Fiennes plays him the same way 30 years later and, well, he's gay. And I do not just mean homosexual, this guy is as queer as a three dollar bill. To imagine any subtextual sexuality between him and Emma Peel (the real appeal of the television series) is ridiculous.When I first walked out of the movie theatre, I was like, wait a minute, there has to be like an hour of the film missing. With all of the plotlines that come out of nowhere and make absolutely no sense in any way shape or form, something was wrong. One of the hallmarks of the series was that no matter how strange it seemed at the start (and the beginnings were often strange), by the end everything would come together in the last five to ten minutes and it would all make perfect sense. Of course later I learned that there was indeed half an hour of the film missing and, well, even if those 30 minutes were the best 30 minutes ever put in a film, it still probably would stink.Skip this and watch the television series to see the real John Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel.

There!  I don't freaking care about all the negative criticism this film gets because most of the time it's from people who have never seen the series in the first place.  The original Avengers was done with a very very small budget.

The stories were always extravagant and brilliant.  The wit and the humor very British.'The Avengers', the movie, captured that oh so typical Avengers style and feel.  Mrs Peel drives through a deserted British capital, the villain is extravagant, the sets colorful and original, etc....Although the story has big holes (huge scenes were just edited out) I still enjoyed it.

Luckily it didn't disappoint.  Lying somewhere between Bond and Austin Powers, The Avengers, for mine, captures the best elements from both.Stylish to the extreme, The Avengers never lets trivial things like plot and reality get in the way of having a good time.  Steed and Peel seem more interested in where the next cup of tea is coming from, than saving the world from a diabolical baddy.The protagonists  are provided wonderfully by Fiennes and Thurman.  Not so much like the originals, but rather exaggerated versions of them.  With their arch delivery and restrained manner, it isn't so much about what they say, but how they say it.   Both cut stunning figures in (and out) of various costumes.  Their roving eyes are subtle but unmistakable.Connery turns up for over-the-top bad guy duties and relishes the chance to act like a complete loon.  When uttering such priceless gems as; one should never fear, being wet, Connery is as strangely disturbing as he is funny.As previously mentioned, The Avengers is on style overload.  This is provided across the board from the polished cinematography to the snazzy music.  Check out the marvellous credit sequence, for just a taster.Trouble only strikes the film, when as Hollywood necessitates, the climatic fight between Fiennes and Connery comes around.  In reaching for big spectacle, the result is unfortunately sluggish.  The charming closing scenes recover what was lost however, and left me thirsty for more.The Avengers has certainly proven to be a film that doesn't please everyone. The public and critics alike, unsure how to take it's quirky, low-key nature, have reacted with vitriol.  But as the many wise and thoughtful comments on this message board (in amongst the inane) prove, there is an audience for this film.  An intelligent audience, that will be enjoying this film long after the majority of vacant, big budget, Hollywood nonsense has been forgotten.

Fiennes and Thurman take on the roles for this long awaited big-budget revamp.The year is 1999, and the sixties have never ended. When the Prospero Project, which aimed to control the country's weather, is destroyed, all evidence points to the culprit being Dr. Emma Peel, a leading physicist at the institute. The Ministry's top agent, John Steed, is assigned to investigate. Accompanied by Mrs. Peel, they discover a terrible plan concocted by a diabolical mastermind&#133;Firstly, this film is nowhere near as bad as most critics have said it is. It is fairly disjointed, but that is only because Warners' executives ordered frantic last-minute editing to `pace it up'. They obviously didn't understand the basis of the film, as the utter Englishness and strangeness is part and parcel of the whole concept. Fiennes and Thurman are superb as the leads, although the former is a little too young. The script by Don MacPherson (who like the director and producer is a long time fan) is first class, and the direction is outstanding with Checick capturing to perfection the surreal weirdness that the series is famous for. But it is Sean Connery, as loopy meteorologist Sir August DeWynter, who steals the show. He bounds through the film in overdrive, nutty as squirrel droppings, running off with every scene. Connery is obviously having a ball.The movie is a perfect addition to the series, with all of its strengths and only one small concession to Hollywood (I'm not saying what). It is definitely the best film of the year so far exciting, funny, suspenseful and highly enjoyable. Just one thing though- don't take it too seriously. When you see our two heroes being chased along country lanes by giant robot wasps, you'll know it's all just a bit of fun.P.S. I don't care what you send in e-mails, or if you firebomb my house, because this film is brilliant and I'll take you all on, in a group or one by one, to prove it!

So, to me, the movie was worth the $6 I paid (you could rent something for $4 these days, so buying it for $6 is a bargain in my book.). Heck, seeing him in the sauna with only a newspaper covering his incidentals *alone* was worth $6! And to some, I suppose Thurman in her cat suits were worth that much. I did not go into it to see Sean Connery, who is not the be all and end all for me, so when he came across as a caricature of evil domination it did not bother me at all that he might look back on this movie and cringe.

He lacks Patrick McNees' droll humor and charm and has absolutely no chemistry with Thurman. Rupert Everett or Hugh Grant would have been much better choices.It is nearly impossible to judge the script, as it is clear miles of film were left on the cutting room floor. However, several scenes that were clearly meant as homages to the original simply come across as obvious clichés. Clearly overlooked by the writers and producers was that original AVENGERS scripts were great MYSTERIES. Even if the script weren't so obvious, hiring a superstar like Sean Connery as prime suspect is pretty lame. I mean, who else could the villain be? Whatever mystery was not squandered in the obvious script was erased in the preview trailers.

He was a farce with nervous performance and ugly lines, being so tasteless character. Certainly I saw better, more interesting, evil masterminds in cartoons ! (Ralph Fiennes) is so cool in Action or else but there was no chemistry with (Uma Thurman). They both looked like talking statues of wax. Do I need to repeat every time how (Uma Thurman) is not nice, not comic, and most of all  not sexy?! I'm sorry that this movie could be the reason why (Fiennes)'s career as an action star got terminated, with him being nominated as the Worst Actor among more 8 Razzie nominations this movie got ! In fact it won the Worst Remake or Sequel tied with (Godzilla) and (Psycho), so imagine the condition of fine actor as (Fiennes) in front of THAT ! (Jeremiah S. Chechik) is a director who can make you savor a dazzling images and clever action (the intro of John Steed, the electronic giant bees' chase, the swordplay between Steed and Sir August de Winter,..etc). But as a whole he made such a luxurious idiocy and not even fun. Damn. Nobody pays attention to an important invention named the script anymore ! I'm really sad that the reputation of (The Avengers) as a flop deprived him to dazzle us afterwards specifically at the era of the comic book movies and Marvell's cinematic adaptations that was about to begin back then. He could've delighted us with better work than a lot of what some contemporary directors are doing. However Hollywood has no mercy.Since I have heard (Joel McNeely) at (Radioland Murders &#x96; 1994) I said here is a new great composer. (McNeely) as usual made an enjoyable job; his music was quite superb and as awesome as what this movie should've been in the first place. The orchestra was assimilating all the legacy of Bond's distinguished jazz, its influence on the TV's shows at the 1960s, and the smart sense of reverencing the human mind's achievements (so all the too advanced inventions of the secret service), expressing the colorful adventure of saving the whole world as well. Moreover, the song at the closing credits (STORM), performed by (Grace Jones), was something maybe more special and highly regarded than the movie itself.Despite all of that (The Avengers) could have been &#x96; as it is &#x96; a mass success, and not to end the career of its scriptwriter (Don MacPherson) the way it did. In fact after couple of years (Spiderman) had super silly powers but it managed to be a hit with sequels !!? And there are so many examples for idiot movies presented what the audience needed at one moment but this time it was that bad and that unlucky too ! I think this is one of the cases where Hollywood said  rain or shine NOT always mine.

It returned again in the 1970s as The New Avengers, which was semi-successful. The series is very much based around characters who are nonchalant in the face of adversity. The chief character is John Steed, played by Patrick MacNee. In fact, one could say that The Avengers is John Steed played by Patrick MacNee.There was a certain amount of silliness attached to the original TV series, which was its charm. The characters of John Steed, accompanied by Cathy Gayle (played by Honor Blackman) had started life in an all-but-forgotten series called Police Surgeon. (Not the American series of the same name.) Honor Blackman's catsuit coupled with high-heeled Russian boots, became an icon of the sixties. (How many people know that Blackman and MacNee actually recorded a song called Kinky Boots, which was released as a single?) The catsuit and boots were taken over by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel. Emma's husband is missing believed dead in some remote corner of the world. This allows a certain amount of harmless flirting between her and Steed. This contributes to the charm of the original series. In the series it is done by dialogue. In this film it is more physical, and is charmless.We got a sniff of what the original series was about with the scene of all those teddy bears sitting around the conference table. Sadly when Sean Connery bumps two of them off, that kills the mystery, and the teddy bears are (apart from one scene soon afterwards) never seen again. In the TV series, those teddy bears would be a source of mystery and menace until the very last scene.The problem that Steed and Peel have to solve is weather control. Now, how many films have featured that? Offhand I can think of Flash Gordon, Our Man Flint, and wasn't there a Matt Helm film that featured that, too? So we are talking about a plot that is unoriginal. At the end we get the booms and bangs and flooding that has become the norm for Hollywood thrillers in recent years, all filmed through the usual blue filter.Actingwise, Sean Connery starts off well, as an eccentric in the style of the old TV series, but becomes a stereotyped villain as the film progresses. Uma Thurman I thought was surprisingly good, although the script did not allow her to develop her character much.But The Avengers is not The Avengers without John Steed. Here Ralph Fiennes was an absolute disaster. The Steed character is built around Patrick MacNee. The MacNee Steed is phlegmatic, effortless, never raises his voice, is graceful in his movements. If the ground opened up beneath him, he would simply step over the chasm giving the impression that he didn't even notice it. MacNee also has the face of an older man, and that gives him an air of authority. Ralph Fiennes's face is too young. His voice is just not right. He wears an open necked shirt in one scene. (MacNee would have worn a cravat.) Fiennes just doesn't have MacNee's style and panache. In fight scenes Fiennes tries too hard. MacNee need only tap an enemy on the head with his Gamp umbrella and the enemy would flake out. No need for all that action and rough stuff. (Whatever happened to realism?) But Fiennes's biggest sin is that he does not know how to carry an umbrella, and he does not know how to wear a bowler hat. To be honest, Fiennes looked more like Freddie Parrot-Face Davies than John Steed.

I think that the general American populace cannot appreciate a film that is so nuanced and delicate - a film that is a quasi-parody and yet delivers the thrills and romance.Based on an old TV series, the Avengers stars the splendidly gorgeous Uma Thurman and the greatest James Bond that ever lived, Sean Connery. The male protagonist Raf Fiennes was less known, and doesn't suit the classic male-MACHO man that is bulky in muscles and filled with general animosity to other males and his antithesis (usually the 'EVIL' villain). He visits the elite club for men and pretends not to blush when his partner barges in. Both characters are highly stylized, elegant, and radical. It is possible to see that this is not a sensibility that Americans can understand or partake in.This film is far removed from the normal spy-thriller. It chooses to take a very different tone, and purposely plays on gender-role reversal which is very refreshing to any true connoisseur of film or film study.

Fiennes and Thurman share no chemistry together. Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are mostly wasted in their roles.

Yes there is.... my mother !  . Unfortunately the confusing plot made the film an endless stream of scattered scenes and streched the time slot from the mere 85 minutes to an experience which lasted more than 2 hours in the mind of the viewer . Everybody bashed this film and I believe they had their reasons. Everybody praised the TV show as brilliant , wonderful and tasteful. When the public network decided to broadcast reruns I sat down with high expectations to see this long lost TV series ....... What the h**l was THAT ????? Most of the episodes were load of c**p (the Time Machine for example), literally unbearable to watch !!!!!!!!! Very few episodes were interesting , witty and campy in a good way , like the 10 Little Niggers rip off or the episode where Mrs Peel was kidnapped by insane film makers who wanted to make her the star of their movie before killing her . Other episodes were so - so , cute storylines like The Bird who knew too much  , the Winged Avenger  , the Invisible Man or the episode with the Nanny Academy . But as I said the majority of the show is nothing but a waste of money and film. Did anyone actually LIKE THIS ??? And I watched the so called best colourful episodes with Mrs Peel !!! As for the Patrick MacNee - Diana Rigg so called chemistry ??? Non - existing ! Mac Nee was as stiff as an ice cube and Rigg although has a kittenish charm it failed to reach any acceptor because Mac Nee had the erotism of Hercules Poirot ! Believe me even if you drilled deep deep deep down the MacNee - Rigg relationship it is more possible to find oil deposits than even the least trace of a remotely mild sub-erotic chemistry ! Not even the most unconfessed one , like Linda Hammilton with her colleaque (I thing he was called Joe) in Beauty and the Beast or even Jodie Foster with Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs !! On top of that there are the infamous carate kicks of Mrs Peel , which (you have to trust me) are ATROCIOUSLY bad . I don 't think there are words in the English language to express how HORRIBLE and unconvincingly directed these fight scenes were . This classic series is just a P.O.S. No wonder I had never heard of the Avengers before the movie came out !!! (in contrast with other campy 60's shows like Lost in Space or Batman who retained their reputation throughout time) . The filmic Avengers were a masterpiece compared to their ancestor !!Nevertheless I decided to rewatch the film believing that the second time would be more entertaining . Boy was I right !!!! Now that I knew the plot 's surprises this wonderful satire was highly enjoyable . Everything fits in to place , everything makes more sense , we manage to learn the predicament and the motives of all the characters . Not only the pace is fast moving , not only the plot unfolds with a very composed way , not only the hilarious dialogue delivers A-list British phlegm to the screen (  Join me and we 'll rule the world  You didn't say please ! )but we manage to watch some of the most original and inventive surrealistic sets a film has ever brought us. Many have praised the Escher-esque eternal stairs where  Mrs Peel is trapped but I will stick to  the greenhouse with a pleiad of plants or the musical kist of whistles along with a jewlery collection in Sir August 's manor .The film 's negative points are  Emma Peel is turned more into a victim instead of a more active part and Stead is authorised to kill her if he suspects that she is the leak . On top of that the subplot with Emma 's dark side ( I won 't say more ) should be shortened because it got annoying . The good points  further than the impressive sets and some good SFX (like the snow blizzard) the casting was very successful . Sure Ralph Fiennes was a bit young for the shoes of John Stead but he had all the qualifications for the role . A charming English gentleman , cool tempered and mild mannered , but not deadpan or emotionless , and with the hidden energy of an inert volcano . Uma Thurman was a PERFECT choise for Emma Peel as she had the deadly beauty required . And YES the two leads have the much needed chemistry that their predecessors failed to reach . Oh , their acting skills ? Just as moderate as they SHOULD be . Remember they are British agents and this is a British inspired satire , not your typical adrenaline pumped American blockbuster with explosions and car chases (yes there is a car chase but very different from the usual ones  the pursuers are giant mechanical bees !!) . As for Sean Connery ? Although the script didn 't do Sir August DeWinters full justice , Connery makes a pleasantly memorable and decent job as the bad guy . Remember again  this is NOT your ordinary summer roallercoaster and if Connery stole the show the movie would have failed . The action scenes are wonderfully directed , since Stead kicks a** with his umbrella and Mrs Peel does a fine job with her carate kicks and when she sword fights with Stead .Overall the Avengers is a much welcome witty satire of the American spy films like James Bond and action / destruction blockbusters generally (like Armageddon) . It is charismatic and eccentric in a very positive way . If only the producers hadn't chop it by editing out so many scenes we would have even more entertainment like the plastic transport bubbles or the deliciously quirky sets in the weather controlling headquarters with black and white colours and weird cross linked architecture . I hope we will have a director 's cut some day . Sit back relax and enjoy the Avengers . It is a great cinematic experience and if you find it lame just give it a second shot (much like the surrealistic Batman Returns) . It has top British phlegm and I believe the main theme and point of the film is summarised in a very characteristic line (I can't say in which point in order not to spoil it )  MANNERS , Mrs Peel !!     =) Wonderful sets , costumes , cinematography , the familiar music theme and an intelligent script give a good mix . One special benefit is that (despite the use of computers and electronic gizmos) you can't easily designate the time period of the events since the atmosphere mixes various stylistic elements and is reminiscent of a fairy tale .Soon to become a cult classic the Avengers is vastly underrated but it will grow in the public 's heart as time goes by .

For those of us who remember the charm of the television series with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg when it originally aired on American television this comes as a bitter blow.The trouble in adapting this material as a feature film is in the way the lead roles in the televion show were originally conceived. The role of John Steed had been made to fit Patrick MacNee like a tailor made glove. When it came time to create a role for a new female lead, the role of Emma Peel was carefully conceived to complement MacNee's John Steed. The casting of Diana Rigg solved the problem ideally. The fact that MacNee and Rigg got along famously on a personal level is readily apparent in the shows that they made together. With the  help of astute writers and directors, they made it their own. In its day, it was charming.Both Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were badly miscast in what may prove to be their most ungrateful roles. They lack chemistry, charm, and charisma here. Their relationship simply never connects at all. Fiennes has a tendency to come off seeming cold and mannered in his other work. Unfortunately, that tendency is exaggerated here. Uma Thurman is ... well... unappealing (Emma Peel got her name for the British film industry expression M Appeal meaning man appeal).The miscasting (apparently this picture was a casting director's nightmare) pretty much sank the film's chances from the beginning. Generally, it looks rather handsome on DVD, but it simply manages to leave a bad taste.In a more enlightened world, Pierce Brosnan might have made an adequate John Steed (a pity he will never be an adequate James Bond). Finding an Emma Peel to compliment the casting of John Steed was always the problem. Regrettably, that problem will never be solved for a second time.

The concept of a weather controlling villain was used best the first time in spy spoof Our Man Flint and that was an intentional jab. This time The Avengers took it seriously.While the film had so many reasons to hate it, the biggest fault was in the editing. One scene cut to another with no noticeable plot connections. Items were stressed for no apparent reason. Character movement was confusing. How did they get there?, Why are they going here?, How did she find that?, How do they know that?, etc.On top of that, the chemistry was flat. One liners were delivered too deliberately, yet the meaning was to vague or juvenile. At times I wasn't aware that they were even delivering a line until the dramatic pause. I was waiting for the laugh-track.Connery's acting was third rate. I felt like he was just recruited from a high-school casting couch.Ralph Fiennes, was so egocentric, that he seemed more of the bloated actor than John Steed.Up until now I didn't think it was possible for Uma Thurman to not look stunning on film. Somehow the make-up and wardrobe staff couldn't pull it off.Shaun Ryder, was an instant blessing, but his immediate removal from the film left me angry.The only thing worth-while in the film is the day-glo teddy bears.

I enjoy films which are more cerebral, as opposed to the standard Hollywood blockbuster. I consider myself literate, appreciate good writing in films, and know and appreciate satire. Not only that, but I frequently enjoy dumb, silly movies, if they are fun, even if they don't always make sense.That being said every aspect of the film version of the Avengers is bad, from Uma Thurman's wooden acting, to the bizarre and nonsensical plot. There are no redeeming points to this movie. None. Its just really bad. Its not even fun to make fun of, its too boring.There are people out there who seem to take a perverse pleasure in enjoying (or at least claiming to enjoy) movies that everyone else hates. Its a natural feeling, I guess. If you think something else is brilliant, that no one else likes, it would seem to indicate that you have a deeper level of appreciation of things, than people around you.Many people like that have written reviews to this movie. I've read a few and they claim things like people have become so benumbed by Hollywood blockbusters that they can't understand what a smart, clever movie this is; or they might claim that people don't understand that it was really supposed to be a campy parody of the spy genre; or (my personal favorite) that people just don't get this movie.Take my word for it, there is nothing in The Avengers for you to get. It is not clever, its not some high concept parody, its just a really, REALLY badly written, acted, and directed movie that I doubt anyone on the production team was happy with after it had been finished.I was really excited about this movie, and went on opening night. I went in with an open mind, understanding that it had gotten bad reviews. I wanted to like it. I couldn't, it was just too painful, like watching a video of a botched operation.If you want to see a good revamping of a spy-show, try watching Get Smart. If you want a silly, campy movie based on existing material, try watching Howard the Duck or Doc Savage. Yes, I liked the movie Doc Savage, and still think The Avengers was awful. Trust me on this, you don't want to see The Avengers.

As a feature film, The Avengers makes a great trailer. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are cast as super-spies John Steed and Emma Peel, and their assignment here is a dreary, confusing one. Sean Connery is the villain, a megalomaniac who wants to rule the world by controlling the weather patterns, though his presence only reinforces the fact this script is sub-par 007, without even the bemused panache that made the TV show such a cult hit on both coasts. How are the leads? I forgot about them, mostly while laughing at the Giant Teddy Bear Convention (God help us) or at the insanely old-hat device of having a lookalike Mrs. Peel working for the dark side.

Most ( though not all ) were not terribly good, for the simple reason that their makers were unable to recapture the ingredients which had made the originals so successful. A movie based on the British spy show 'The Avengers' was announced as far back as 1987, with Mel Gibson ( also said to have purchased the rights from E.M.I. ) as 'Steed'. These rumours persisted well into the 1990's, when after the success of 'Basic Instinct', the role of 'Mrs.Emma Peel' was tipped to go to Sharon Stone. What sort of movie would have resulted with these leads we can only guess at, but I am glad that it was never made.Jerry Weintraub, a self-proclaimed fan of the show, hired Don Macpherson to write a script that was true to the style of the original. It centred on a madman who has created a weather control machine, and plans to use it to blackmail the world's governments into paying him for their weather, or else he will condemn them to perpetual winter. It was a witty, imaginative, and outrageous piece of work. As 'Steed', Ralph Fiennes of 'The English Patient' was cast, with Uma Thurman of 'Pulp Fiction' taking up the role of 'Emma'. Weintraub then pulled off another major casting coup - Sir Sean Connery. The former 'James Bond' was hired to play the villain, necessitating a major rewrite. The character of 'Merryweather' became 'Sir August De Wynter', who lives in a mansion called 'Hallucinogen Hall', and is so fixated by Emma he clones her. In a thrilling opening, the clone gains illegal access to 'The Prospero Project', which she destroys. The real Emma is naturally blamed, and Mother calls on Steed to investigate.The film had a decent budget, but was not on a level-playing field with say 'Star Wars' or 'Harry Potter'; nevertheless, it boasts stupendous art direction, cinematography by by Roger Pratt, and music by Joel McNeely. Director Jeremiah Chechik skilfully recreated the look and setting of the series - Agatha Christie England - but mixed with a dose of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. There is humour, but not of the 'funny ha-ha' variety; for instance, the scene in the conference room in which Sir August's henchmen are kitted out in teddy bear costumes. This was intended to spoof similar scenes in Bond films such as 'Thunderball'.Of the supporting cast, Eileen Atkins shone as the gun-toting spinster 'Alice'. Comedian Eddie Izzard played 'Bailey', Sir August's ( mostly mute ) henchman, with Jim Broadbent delightful as Steed's macaroon-munching boss 'Mother'.'The Avengers' was all set for a major launch as Warner Brothers top summer release, but then disaster struck. It registered poorly with a preview audience in Arizona ( why Arizona, for heaven's sake? ), causing it to be recalled for major edits. We shall probably never know the name of the man who butchered the film, but I suspect his first name may have been 'Sweeney'. He took out major scenes, such as the 'Prospero Project' opening, and Sir August's 'Frankenstein'-like creation of 'Bad Emma'.Cut down from a two-hour running time to a paltry eighty-five minutes, 'The Avengers' opened ( rather aptly ) in August to a universal drubbing from critics and public alike. The overkill of bad reviews was enough to destroy any chance the film had of becoming a hit.While the film had its flaws, it certainly did not deserve the opprobrium heaped upon it on its release. Yes, Fiennes and Thurman were not Macnee and Rigg, nor were they intended to be. This was a NEW 'Avengers', intended to be a film for the twenty-first century.Years after its release, the movie has a fan base, whose main aim is to see the original restored. Its worth remembering that Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' was regarded as a boring flop in 1982, now is thought of as a sci-fi classic. I hope that someday 'The Avengers' can pull off the similar feat of being regarded in a whole new light.

Think about it. Both start out with visually splendid opening credits accompanied by a great score. Both were released by Warner Brothers with a megastar playing a badly written antagonist. The scripts are equally deplorable and, most importantly, both films boast Uma Thurman in a huge role demonstrating a dearth of acting talent. Oh, and both have a well-deserved spot in IMDb Bottom 100.Derived from a television show of the same name, The Avengers tells the story John Steed (Ralph Fiennes), a lethal agent of The Ministry, which I think is an elite branch of British intelligence. Not being a fan of the original show, I cannot be sure of that since it is not fully explained in the movie. For that matter, nothing is, apparently because 50 minutes of story were cut after a poor test screening in Phoenix; somehow I am not surprised. Steed's primary weapons are an umbrella and a hard brimmed bowler hat albeit not nearly as lethal as Oddjob's. His female companion is Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a physicist, I think, whose loyalties are in serious question after surveillance footage from a destroyed lab shows her beating up security.The purpose of the lab was to power Prospero, a weather shield that can supposedly destroy missiles So everyone can go home for tea. In fact, the script includes so much tea that it is a wonder that anything gets done. Is England in danger? No worries, the avengers will save us...as soon as they finish their tea! Anyway, Mrs. Peel is given an opportunity to prove her innocence by working with Steed. The twosome quickly determine that the real enemy may be one Sir August deWynter (no bonus points if you can guess what his sisters were named), played by Sir Sean Connery. deWynter, who came up with the principles that allow Prospero to work, seems to be recruiting top weather experts for some nefarious purpose. They attend the board meeting dressed as teddy bears.STOP Unless you are ready to risk death by laughter, read no further! All right, deWynter's grand scheme is to make every country in the world buy their weather from him at some exorbitant price. No, I did not make that up. With the billion or so pounds he already has, one would assume that he has no need for that kind of money.One of the many things that made the original Avengers television series so popular was the chemistry between Steed and Peel, played then by Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. I saw that watching only one episode of the show. Here, the dialogue between the two is dull, monotonous, tedious, boring and whatever other synonym can be inserted. Writer Don MacPherson is obsessed with proving Peel's superiority. The series' was secure in their mutual need and respect for each other and needed no devices. The blame probably should not rest solely on the script, since the lines are delivered without conviction or enthusiasm.This can be directly traced to the two leads. Ralph (be sure to pronounce it Rafe) Fiennes plays Steed as if the man takes Valium with his meals. John Steed was supposed to be a highly proper English gentleman, but not wooden. By the end of the movie I was looking for termites on his over-slicked hair. Despite his efforts to the contrary, Fiennes is more convincing than Uma Thurman, who can never decide what to do with her character. I have seen Thurman in four films now, and I am yet to see her demonstrate any real talent in her craft. Steed and Peel are so boring that they enervate the movie.This is not the first time Sean Connery has lacked appeal; he is somewhat notorious among fans of the James Bond movies for mailing in his last two performances. Granted, deWynter is a lackluster part, but Connery somehow devises a way to make it worse. It is interesting to see him with a full head of hair and a fu manchu.On the trivial side, the movie is rated PG-13 when it was originally advertised as PG. The only reason I can see for this is a solitary f word coming from an otherwise mute henchman and spoken in a proper English accent. It appears that this was added in at the last minute to avoid a PG rating. Why? Audiences go to see Star Wars in masses. Did the director think that this would be funny?

But I kept switching back to see if it was still as bad.  It always was, except when it was worse.They would have done much better to cast the 60-year-old Rigg to reprise her TV role.  They would probably have done better to cast the much older Mcnee as Stead, even if he had to stay invisible for the whole movie.Some scenes (like the teddy-bear conference and the Escher staircase) were whimsical enough to have belonged in the TV series.  But in the TV series, they would have been part of a consistent theme that was plugged throughout that episode and related to the particular evil villain to be foiled that week, and not just plucked from the air as here.Worth seeing, perhaps, to know that the art of making truly awful movies has not been lost.

There are a few moments where this dead-on-arrival remake pleases - a few moments, and minor. I loved seeing Sean Connery as the bad guy in his lab in the dark, his eyes shifting back & forth greedily, actually take on a truly Karloffian aspect (which has nothing to do with the original show, but IS a lovely moment). Fans of the original series may catch the identity of the voice-actor for the pipe-smoking Invisible Jones. Jim Broadbent-lovers will smile to see him cast as Mother, the ministry official whom Steed reports to. And one of Mother's other agents, Alice, unexpectedly brings back the feel of supporting cast characters from the original. And so on. But to sit through the whole thing just for these few bits, continually irked by the wrong-wrong- wrong mis-acting by its stars, is absurd. There is one other moment where things perked up Steed is covertly ambling through the bad guy's huge estate when he hears a telephone ringing, and sees, incongruously, a bright red antique phonebooth a ways off, under a canopy of trees. As he approaches it, the wind picks up - and mounts to gale force. He takes refuge in the phonebooth, the winds roaring violently all about it, & answers the phone. He can just barely hear a recorded voice scoding him for being on private property.

Instead, the studio savagely slashed The Avengers down to an incoherent 90 minutes. Sadly, The Avengers emerges as superficial gobbledygook. Meanwhile, the filmmakers botched a perfectly good franchise with miserable casting and superfluous changes.Anyway, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes of The English Patient) is back in top form as the smartly tailored chap who wields a mean umbrella. The first scene shows Steed combating adversaries without losing his bowler hat! Steed works for an underground spy organization dubbed 'The Ministry.' His paraplegic boss, ironically named 'Mother' (Jim Broadbent), has assigned him to ferret out who sabotaged the Prospero Project. Prospero is a gigantic weather shield (recall a similar shield in Highlander 2) that protects the United Kingdom from inclement chaos. Mysteriously, the shield has collapsed, and the chief suspect is former project head Emma Peel (Uma Thurman)! Straight from the start, the big-screen Avengers commits the unpardonable sin of rewriting the TV series. Instead of reviving Steed and Peel and carrying on as some of us happily remember the couple from the 1960s, the filmmakers have the brazen audacity to split them up, implicate Ms. Peel as a criminal and waste more than half of the movie trying to get them back together. After Steel and Peel eventually team up, they pursue the villainous Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery of The Rock) who demands ten percent of Great Britain's gross national product. If the Brits don't cough up, de Wynter threatens to plunge them into a winter of such nasty proportions that they will have to go to Hell to warm up. Anywhere Sean Connery goes, he carries the baggage of the James Bond franchise, and the implication here is that he is an Ernst Stavro Blofeld type madman. His hidden laboratory looks like the hideout of a James Bond villain.Although scenarist Don MacPherson's formulaic script has updated the action to the '90s, things seem little changed since the '60s. Chechik and Oscar-winning production designer Stuart Craig have faithfully reproduced the eccentric look that summed up the shoe-string budgeted TV series. You can count the extras in any scene on one hand and wiggle left-over fingers. The 1960s' TV series couldn't affor4d extras so many scenes appeared stylishly destitute. While the glossy $60-million dollar Warner Brothers remake preserves this density, the filmmakers themselves suffered no budgetary inhibitions. For example, the lavish set designs resemble a Batman epic crossed with a James Bond extravaganza. The M.C. Escher dreamscape that Ms. Peel stumbles around in furnishes The Avengers with one of its few truly inventive bits.As a meteorological melodrama, The Avengers contains the basic outlines of a tolerably entertaining adventure. The problem is that Warner Brothers gutted the story, and what remain amounts to an unintelligible mess. Any rhythm or pacing that The Avengers had has vanished, too. Scene after scene is patched together with little relation to the previous scene. Worse, the film never reveals the forces that motivated Sean Connery's mad Scottish villain. Never are those killer bees explained either. Another curiously half-baked element adding to the overall confusion is Peel's evil, look-alike twin who Sir August has cloned and whose portrait hangs over his organ. Two moderately exciting scenes invigorate The Avengers. One has robotic bees with machine guns swarming after Steed and Peel as they careen through the countryside. The other shows Emma dangling from a series of high wires as she battles de Wynter's chief henchman, Bailey (Brit comic Eddie Izzard).The casting doesn't help matters. Indeed, Fiennes looks ideal for the role of Steed, but he lacks Patrick Macnee's buoyancy. Fiennes plays Steed as a starchy, tea-drinking umbrella thug who rigidly adheres to the rules of the game. While he cut a fine figure in his Saville Row togs, Fiennes' Steed is too aloof, calculating and snobbish to enjoy. Meanwhile, Thurman blows big chunks as Peel. First, she's an American. Second, Thurman radiates all the charisma of a Barbie doll. True, Thurman boasts a fetching figure in her cat suit, but she cannot hold a candle to the enchanting Diana Rigg who played Mrs. Peel in the television show. The cute banter between Steed and Peel here kindles only a modicum of chemistry. As for Sean Connery, he is the best that this choppy saga has to offer. Indisputably, he sports the best outfits, especially when he attires himself as a murderous teddy bear than later on as a kilt-clad Scottish lord.Other problems plague The Avengers. The destruction of England that Sir August threatens to unleash has little dramatic impact because humanity is never emphasized, much less seen! When a movie has as few extras as The Avengers, nobody seems imperiled. The special effects lack atmosphere, and the miniature work is rather obvious. Like other summer thrillers, The Avengers plays demolition derby with traditional British icons. Big Ben explodes into confetti, and Lord Nelson is toppled from his perch in Trafalgar Square. Occasionally, The Avengers seems almost too civilized for its own good. The tea drinking scenes get old fast. Most of the violence is disarming, and little bloodshed and profanity clutter things up.No surprises spruce up The Avengers. Often the plot (what's left of it) imitates a Bond movie, particularly the escape hatch scene. Patrick Macnee is wasted in a minor role as Invisible Jones, as transparent a spy as you'll never see. You only hear him. As a machine-gun toting auntie, Eileen Atkins makes more of an impression. For the record, the producers use the original Laurie Johnson TV theme music in two scenes.Anybody with fond memories of the Patrick Macnee & Diana Rigg Avengers is forewarned, skip the Fiennes & Thurman Avengers. Not even Sean Connery's diabolical nemesis can save this ill-made mishmash! That such cinematic potential has been squandered is really a shame!

I used to watch the odd episode of The Avengers and enjoyed them, but I wouldn't say that I was fan or anything.Then came the fateful night when I was at a friends place. It was late, about 11pm when The Avengers came on. I had heard that a movie had come out but nothing more and didn't think too much of it. Two danger signs, late night movie and no critical acclaim where there should have been some. I just thought somewhat jokingly, 'how bad can it be?' It was . . . still is . . . awful.People can say that it was a farce of a movie, not meant to be taken seriously or that it was edited terribly. They can point out that Uma Thurman looks good in a cat suit or that one should or shouldn't compare it to the original series.None of that helps me come to terms with what happened on that night! I started watching and the dialog puzzled me, then it got bad. I remember a nanny with a machine gun, a weird house that Uma couldn't get out and was for some inexplicable reason and then scientists dressed in colourful teddy bear costumes! That was the point when I said to myself, OMG! Well, at least it can't get any worse! But then it did! Every ten minutes or so this film plumbed new depths from the second Mrs Peel (for no explained reason) to a mysteriously empty London (again, no explanation was given).To say that my decision to watch The Avengers that night was a bad one is like saying that drugs can make one feel a little strange! When I get a personal apology for this film by its makers I might then consider forgiving them. Until then &#150; no deal! I gave it a 1 because I couldn't figure out a way to give it a 0.

This has to rate as the worst modern movie I have ever seen (though Gigli, I have yet to endure...). As a kid, I remember watching the Avengers, and then The New Avengers which followed. Neither of these series sucked (although the New Avengers had some stupid episodes) and neither series deserved to have such a crappy big-screen adaptation made of it.Sometimes, when you watch a film adaption of a book or TV series, you can be struck by how much the actors have captured the parts they play and made them their own. In other words, how perfect they are for the roles. In Avengers exactly the opposite occurs. Fiennes is totally miscast as Steed and Thurman is, well......far too.....well...just too wrong for words as Mrs Peel.Despite the stupid action sequences and woefully wrong actors. Despite the attempted forced chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman, and the lousy dialogue that emerged, this film could have survived and been a reasonable, if poor adaptation of a great old series.Where it descended into total farce, at least for me, was the Council of Teddy Bears scene, wherein Sean Connery and his evil henchmen discuss their evil plot whilst wearing full body teddy-bear suits. I didn't get any of the lines, I was laughing so hard. As if that wasn't enough, there then followed a chase/fight scene involving the bear and our heroes. It was just diabolically, ridiculously bad. BAD! I say!I think that particular part of the film will rate (along with the draught-excluder snake wrestling scene from the King Kong remake) as my all time most pitiful movie scene.If you want to ruin a good name, just get some inappropriate actors and a rubbish script and mix them together. Et voila! The Avengers is born......or rather dies a horrible, screaming death that, had I not seen the original series on which it was based, would have ensured that I wouldn't ever watch an episode of the original on rerun.

Even Conan the Destroyer wasn't as bad as this, and that had Grace Jones in it, for goodness sake!Take my advice...If you are a fan of the series, give this a wide berth and spare your fond memories the beating that mine took.

In which case, he gets a B minus for effort, if not for imagination.In attempting to conquer content with style, Chernik had two choices - originality or iconography. Unfortunately the TV series was able to take on both, Chernik opts only for icons. And they are all here - red phone boxes, E-type Jaguars, Mrs Peel's boots, English gardens, bullet proof pinstripe suits and a megalomaniac seeking world domination by means so peculiar they wouldn't make a James Bond script. Essentially we are left with sets that look wonderful and feel as though they belong in the Avengers universe. It is not here that the film fails.Ralph Fiennes seems uncomfortable and plays Steed far too uptight. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel copes quite well with the English accent. However, neither actor is helped by a poor script with badly fleshed out characters and a weak plot.The story, by the way, sees former secret agent superbrain Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) forcing retail weather on the world governments. British agent John Steed recruits former weather boffin Dr Mrs Emma Peel to stop him. A few unexplained leaps of logic later our courageous two take turns at being captured, sparring with Sir August and battling various silent heavies. It is almost as if the film is missing twenty minutes and if you have seen the cinema trailer you will realise plenty of it did not make the final cut. Perhaps it should have.The fault for this film being poor can be laid at the writer's feet, as the acting performances are as good as could be expected and the production design is actually first rate. The director should take some blame for failing to notice he had no story to work with.As a summer blockbuster goes it meets all expectations, simply because we no longer expect them to be about anything.

Terrible Script & Bad Casting Ruins This Film.","Date":"22 July 2009","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Yikes!! I loved the old Avengers (even the black & white episodes), but this remake should never have been made. Ralph Fiennes is just fine as Steed, but both Uba Thurman and Sean Connery were miscast for this film. What makes it worse is the script (about a villain using a weather machine to take over the world) is terribly bad. I can't believe this was the best they could come up with. They could have actually used some of the older Avengers' scripts and made a movie out of it. The movie takes awhile to get going because Steed and Peel aren't acquainted yet. The only thing that was halfway decent was a remix of the old Avengers theme song. There's really nothing to see here. I gave it a 4 or of 10 and that's really being generous. Hollywood need to stop with these remakes. Mission Impossible. The Day The Earth Stood Still. I heard they were doing a Mod Squad remake next. Uuhhgg!! Stay away.

What a dreadful waste of money. My opinion was justified when the box office staff said no previews were shown because the distributors didn't want audiences to know how really bad this movie is.

Absolutely ridiculous film, hope I never its like again.

Please Please Please Do not see this film !!!! The best thing about this movie is Uma Thurman in tight leather/plastic pants - it contains no sex scenes with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes/ Sean Connery - which is disappointing. Science Fiction bull**** - I must have looked at my watch a dozen times !!!

It basically was an excuse to use a whole lot of computerized special effects.  It had no followable movie plot.  It made absolutely no sense, was stupid, and should never have been made.

Avengers is the best definition of garbage in a gold wrapping. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is pathetic, everything looks stupid. This is the third movie that I feel asleep watching (the others were Titanic and Ace Ventura. When nature calls). Flee from this movie like a vampire from a cross.

Conory, Uma and Raphle.  great cast big budget spy movie.  WHAT HAPPENED?????? the movie i was most looking forward to this summer was the worst one i ever saw.   I would have rather spent 4 50 to stare at the poster for 2 hours.  I assure you, if you give me 70 million dollars and that cast i could have made a decent movie.Mr. steed came off gay and the oneliners were lost in just plan bad film making.a porn star could have done better then Uma did (and i really like uma)Conory would have been could if they could have matched his voice up with his mouth.  That must be really hard to do.  IF anybody liked this movie they either watch mystery science theater 3000 and think boy these sure are good movies.   If i had to rate it on a 1-10 scale -4.5 to make up for  how much money i wasted on it "},{"Title":"Oh Dear...","Date":"19 September 2012","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Apparently American's taking the Mickey out of the British has hit an all new low and to be honest, I used to enjoy this film. It had some weird effects, some strange characters and Sean Connery (which is fantastic to begin with), but much like Batman and Robin, when I grew up, I couldn't help but think that this film is just a clumsy mess, attempting to portray the British as a bunch of 'Tea before Scones' types yet again, almost as if it were a propaganda movie. The acting is incredibly half-baked, showing that the actors really didn't put much effort into this film, the special effects aren't that special, the story is your basic 'hold the world for ransom' ploy and the rest I don't care to mention.It's obvious they were trying to make their own version's of the Bond films by making things overly complicated in terms of devices and usage. For example, when Emma Peel is given a package by a secret mailman telling her to answer the phone in order to receive her orders. My question there is, why? Why not just phone her as she would just answer the telephone instinctively like any other person would, she doesn't need to be told how to do basic things by letter unless she suffers from learning difficulties. The instructions they give her are to meet her Secret Agent accomplice John Steed at a Gentleman's Club, a place where no women can go. How stupid is that? Also, when she get's there, John comments on how she doesn't play by the rules. Where the hell was that coming from? They were stupid enough to order her to go to this place where no women can go.Next problem, Peel has video evidence incriminating her for sabotaging her own project and yet this secret Ministy allows her the chance to solve her own crime!!! What in the name of God are they thinking?! They think this is smart? Chances are if she was a real villain she'd head off with Steed before killing him in some dark alley and jumping the country within the first 12 minutes, and this Ministry, which seems to have a thing about giving Male Agents Female titles and Female Agents Male titles, wouldn't have a clue where she's gone. There's also a Clone of Emma Peel, which seems to hark back to the Double Man, and there's an Invisible Man! I though it was bad enough in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but this gag is really too stupid for words! Anyway, this film is just silly, with corny acting, a plain as cardboard story and logic that is illogical, you'd better just give it a miss! "}]
