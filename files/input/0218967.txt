Plato put these words in the mouth of Socrates.  Brett Ratner puts this theme into `The Family Man.'  This is not It's a Wonderful Life.  While it is a feel good movie, it is an intelligent, reflective one.  Neither of the parallel lives led by the main character is shown to be flawless.  Both have their attractions.  Jack, the lead character, is forced from his comfort zone by a glimpse of a life connected by commitment and love to friends and family.  This movie does something for me few feel good movies ever come close to causing.  This movie makes me think about what I really value in life.  Both pro-capitalist and pro-family, The Family Man either leaves you pondering whether your life is consistent with your values or goes over your head and leaves you with the impression that your emotions have been manipulated by another crass commercial Christmas movie.  It depends on what the viewer brings to the table.P.S.  Tea Leoni's shower scene has got to be the sexiest portrayal of a movie mom I ever saw.  "},{"Title":"One of my all-time favorites!!

But he also did a wonderful job of transitioning from resentful to begrudgingly intrigued to acceptance. I think Tea Leoni and Jeremy Piven were superb in this as well.

As Campbell and his college girlfriend Kate (Tea Leoni) say farewell, Kate begs him to stay, but Jack gets on his plane anyway. Their relationship ends while he is in London and Jack goes on to become the President of a large Wall Street company. While walking home from work on Christmas Eve thirteen years later, Campbell has an encounter with an angel, who gives him a glimpse. This glimpse shows Jack what his life would be like if he and Kate were still together, and, in the end, Jack must choose between his life of riches and loneliness, or a life filled with family and love.The central idea of the film is to show that a person who is rich in material objects often lacks more important things. It says that these things include being surrounded by people who care about you and having someone to love. Before Campbell's glimpse, his only motivation is money and most of the movie is filmed at his office, showing he does not have much of a life outside of it. Without a second thought, he calls an emergency meeting with his staff at noon on Christmas, causing them to leave their families and come in to the office. The movie successfully shows the struggle between money and family because this is a theme to which the audience can relate.The director is able to keep the audience's attention throughout the movie through the use of humor. Lassiter (Josef Sommer), the owner of the company, when asked why he is still at the office on Christmas Eve replies because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money. In doing this, the director, while still concentrating on the theme of the movie, keeps the viewer watching. In doing these things and more, the director creates a film that is not only entertaining to watch, but also one that carries a message about life and happiness.

A classic film to make you reexamine your own life, and think about what is really important and meaningful for you, what is success and happiness? Young dreamers in love with their successful careers instead of each other, find out that maybe their love really was meant to be. This is what Nicholas Cage finds out, and when he wakes up from the dream of what 'could have been', he rushes to stop 'loosing her' again, and hopefully still live the happily ever after dream. Nicholas Cage provides a stunning and comical performance in character, from the aggressive businessman - big business and small business - to a loving father and husband with his charming sense of humor. Quite a romantic film to watch with that 'someone special' during the holidays.

Whatever limitations the film's storyline or premise has, the individual performances rise above it.In the DVD extras there is an interesting comment by the producer where he says he challenges any man to watch the film and not want to live with Tea Leoni and I must say I wholeheartedly agree with him. To be fair her character is completely idealised (naturally beautiful but unaffected by it, intelligent, insightful, sexy, gracious, humble, caring, unstoppably positive and non-demanding). Have you ever met anyone like this in real life?I enjoyed this film so much that it just about creeps into my all time top ten.

In this movie, Nicholas Cage says goodbye to his girlfriend (Kate) at the airport. He is going to London for a job. We next see him years later as a successful head of a large corporation, unmarried and basically involved in one-night stands. We are later to find out that when Cage went to London, he forgot about Kate and she went her own way, never to be heard from again.Cage is on the way home from the office during a snow-storm and thwarts a robbery. The audience expects the robber to shoot cage but instead Cage seems to convince the robber that he would be a better man if he didn't shoot Cage. It turns out that the robber is not really a robber but a type of Angel (similar to Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life) who will give Cage a glimpse of what life would be like if he hadn't stayed in London but instead came back and married Kate.Cage goes to sleep in his luxury apartment and wakes up the next morning in a bed with an older Kate. Cage slowly learns that he is really a married man with a family and instead of a big time corporate president, he is a tire salesman in his father-in-law's store. There are several hilarious scenes and some very touching ones. His new life looks like a nightmare at first turns out to be the life he will eventually prefer (Some of this is reminiscent of Goldie Hawn in Overboard). Only until he realizes this, he will not be returned to his prior life by the Angel.The director does a great job in giving us an ending that is different than what you seem to expect. I won't say what but I think it was well done.One thing that is not explored is that when Cage's glimpsed life finishes, he will lose his two children from that glimpsed life. The director never touches on Cage's feelings about that, unlike the novel Replay where the main character is torn apart because a child he had in an alternate life no longer exists when he is in a different reality.The movie is well cast and Don Cheadle is excellent as the angel.

This movie not only tugs at your heartstrings, it rips the strings out and whips you with them. Subtlety ain't this film's strong suit.Nicolas Cage plays a slick Wall Street powerbroker (the only kind in Hollywood, and probably real life as well) who has it all money, money, money, and power. Jack Campbell's lacking a family, but he doesn't see that as a bad thing. He's also driven, obsessed with improving the company he works for - he even schedules a crisis meeting on Christmas Day. This guy's got balls, all right. He's making loot hand over fist, and he's probably on his way to an ulcer or a heart attack before he hits fifty.On Christmas Eve, he gets a phone message from an ex-girlfriend (Tea Leoni). Years earlier, the two of them had made a decision crucial to their lives - he went to England to intern with a prestigious bank, and she went to one of the finest law schools in the country. This facilitated their breakup, but since Jack's made out rather well in the interim, he pays the call little mind. Then that night, he stops by a convenience store to pick up some egg nog. An irate lottery player (the always reliable and watchable Don Cheadle) pulls a gun on the clerk behind the counter. Jack offers to buy the man's lottery ticket in an effort to calm the situation, and even attempts to rehabilitate the hoodlum. Cmon, Jack tells him, everyone needs something. What do you need? Cash asks him. Jack considers the point, then replies there's nothing he needs. Ok, says Cash, but just remember, you got yourself into this. Hmm.The next morning, Jack wakes up in bed with the lovely, the delicious, the married-in-real-life-to-David Duchovny Tea Leoni. And he has two kids. And a dog. And whoa! This isn't Jack's life, is it? He doesn't like kids! And here they come, bouncing on the bed he shares with Kate. It's Christmas Day, after all. But Jack's in shock. He panics, grabs the keys to their minivan (Hey! Where's his Porsche?) and dashes off to the city. What's going on?Seems Cash is some kinda sorta angel or something (it's never really explained), and he's offering Jack a glimpse of what his life would havebeen like if he had stuck with Kate back in the day. Now, those of us who are of a certain age do wonder from time to time what life would have been like if different decisions had been made. Jack's problem is that his wonderment is now his reality. And it's most certainly not the reality he's looking for! The Single Jack is a hedonist who recognizes only responsibilities to his job. The Married Jack pays more attention to his familial responsibilities.So we have a general fish-out-of-water scenario. Jack knows he's Single Jack, and naturally he has neither knowledge nor memory of life as Married Jack. He doesn't know his friends, his in-laws, his co-workers (he works as a tire salesman!), nothing. He doesn't even know where he lives! Ah yes, mad hijinks ensue. It's like in that Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show - the audience is in on the joke, but the lead character has no idea. See Jack stumble over gettin' jiggy with his wife! See him mumble greetings to friends he doesn't know! See him stand with his mouth agape most of the time, trying in vain to absorb everything.And, of course, see Jack wrap things up neatly. Too bad it's a two-hour sojourn into schmaltz, though. The problem with the movie isn't that it's sentimental, it's that it's a preachy film, desperate to teach us that Marriage Is Good. And think about it - how many guys do you know are married to someone who looks like Tea Leoni (and is a nice person, too), who goes to work at a tire place with a song in their hearts, who has a loving family with two perfect kids? This life doesn't exist, and damn this movie for making the married versus single issue seem so black and white. Single >bad, marriage = good.The best sentimental films teach lessons with such subtlety that you don't realize you've learned anything until well after the closing credits have rolled. The worst of these films takes a lesson that most people know anyway and proceeds to whack the living crap out of you with it. Ok, ok! I get it! Married life = good things. Got it, ok. And thankfully, Jack got it, too, or we'd still be watching this drivel.

The underlying theme that we who choose not to go down that path and cannot be truly happy, is rediculous.

It is about living with the person you love, and discover that the sacrifices, the things you planned, like becoming famous, going to Wall Street, and be rich, or powerful, are lifeless, void. The revelation comes with the singing of a love song during a birthday party. Everyone thinks it is corny, until you understand the meaning of it. That two people love each other, and have dedicated their lives to being together. As the French singer Julien Clerc said When you are cold, I am the only one who knows. Love is about that solitude of two people in their own universe. Some tough questions are asked, of course. Did you never regret your choice, honey? And the movie does a fantastic job answering those questions. And tall as a King of Men, is the man who walks quietly to his job as a tire salesman, when he knows he has EVERYTHING. So you think it is cruel to be sent to the suburbs after ruling Wall Street, but try to imagine what it is to be sent back to an empty apartment with a view, after sharing one last night with the woman you love, in the quiet peace of your home, with two kids (and a dog).

Where should the super-shallow hero work? Tricky...oh I know! Wall Street! Genius. I could honestly not think of one imaginative element in this, from the 'parallel universe' concept shamelessly nicked from any number of movies to the banal and boringly conspicuous moral - family is more important than money. Even Danny Elfman's score sounds like it was dumbed-down. His music is usually incredibly emotional but in this film it was all middle ground. I understand there is a market they cater to with this stuff, but really,do they have to make the formula so obvious? Hollywood - must do better.

In this version angel Don Cheadle gives business tycoon (Nicolas Cage) a glimpse of what his life would be had he married the girl (Tea Leoni)he left behind 13 years previous.  Cage is a Scrooge like Wall Street tycoon who is married to his job and thinks nothing of calling a meeting on Christmas Day. Following his chance meeting with Cheadle, he is placed into a family situation where he suddenly has a wife and two kids and loses the rich life to which he has become accustomed. The movie then basically follows his transition from one life to the other. But then he is returned to the present and Hollywood being Hollywood, it is not to hard to figure out what the happy ending will be. Cage is OK in the lead and it is hard to imagine any red-blooded male leaving Leoni at the airport. But the best thing about this movie are the two children. Mackenzie Vega as Annie is cute as a button and a real sweetheart and twins Jake and Ryan Milkovich as little Josh are simply adorable.  Insofar as the story goes, Capra did it better with Jimmy Stewart in 1946.

It's a what-if that says, basically, well, no great loss, really--nothing that can't be done today.  And maybe that's the reality for most of us, which is probably why a lot of people are unimpressed by this movie.But I was unimpressed because I can't accept some of the assumptions made. Circumstances may have pushed the characters to a less-than-romantic life of suburban living, but does that mean they automatically join a bowling league and do all their clothes shopping at K-Mart? The Nick Cage character isn't a blue-collar man, period, regardless of where he lives or who he's working for.  Maybe it's a niggling point, but since nearly half the comedy and conflict comes from this Manhattan snob thrust into New Jersey lifestyle shtick, it's a hard point to ignore.The movie redeemed itself for me in its minor ending.  It was a good ending, I thought, that recognized that the glimpse life had to be built, not invented just by grabbing the one that got away. Because I like movies that dwell in the gray areas and make no definitive conclusions, and because I liked the somewhat romantic yet practical ending, I wound up liking the movie.  But because of some of the bad comedy, and a story that runs a little too long with a few too many details, and because most people LIKE a more Hollywood ending, I can't really recommend it.

It is clear at the end of the movie that she has not lived this alternate life with him. In the alternative life, Kate knows there is something wrong with her husband's actions and memory bank but does nothing, accepts it all, would move herself and her kids away from her legal practice, her parents, the kids' schools just to be with this deranged version of her husband. Yeah, right.  I get the feeling this is just the latest attempted brainwashing of the masses back to so-called family values brought out by one of the major studios.

They practically lifted the story and even some amazing details and yet I haven't heard anything about this anywhere.  In any case, the most important thing is that Me Myself I got it right.  Where The Family man struggled to find a tone that worked and mostly missed, Me Myself I got it.  And it's a great lesson in the Hollywoodization of films -- the process that makes the Hollywood films predominantly bland and unsatisfying.  In the Australian version it's a woman who has a second chance to find out what would have happened if she'd taken another road.  And in that one simple choice you find explored the deeper theme of modern women and their choices -- job/career vs. motherhood vs. the incredible burden of trying to have it all.  Typically, Hollywood not only made the lead a man, they made him a rich man!  Why?  How many of us can really identify with a rich Wall Street hot shot?  Why couldn't he be a regular working guy (or gal) with regular working guy (or gal) issues?  You'll find the Australian version to be so much more real and in that, so much more interesting.  I won't even mention the ridiculous need for Hollywood to explain the miraculous by creating the Don Cheadle guaradian angel.  It's typical of their patronization of the audience that they try to explain magic.  Magic needs no explanation, you can't have it both ways, ask us to believe in something and then try to explain it.  In the Australian version Griffiths comes face to face with herself.  Once you figure out what's going on, you move on and forget it and just enjoy where the filmmakers take you.  Hollywood has no clue how to do that.  Or that you even can.

I am unmarried, young, a self-confimred horror buff...I don't usually dig the sappy film type.  But from the first time I saw the preview, I wanted to see The Family Man.  Not only do I adore Nicolas Cage, but this movie deals with the age-old question, What if???  Who hasn't wondered where life's road would have taken them had they made one different choice?  I know I have.It is a movie about evaluation.  I read many comments that said things like he has tons of money, doesn't seem to be unhappy, blah blah blah.  True. Jack is a nice guy, has the ability to buy anything he so desires...But money cannot buy happiness.  On some levels, maybe, but deep down, you cannot buy your emotions.  That's what this film tries getting across. While living the rich lifestyle, he was happy.  Then a reminder about his one true love makes him think, and he is given a glimpse as to what could have been.  After all that the film allows him to experience, he evaluates his rich, powerful life and discovers that a void had existed all along. While he seemed to have everything, he didn't have the love of others.  He had their respect, but not their love.This is not your typical sappy love story.  And if you chose to see it with that in mind, you probably will be disappointed because there are so many more deep things about this film.  While the love between the couple is told to us, it is undeniable...  After all, Jack manages to fall in love with his wife all over again during his glimpse.  What is so magnificent about this movie is the way that it makes you turn to your friends and family and lovers and thank yourself for all the choices you've made in your life to bring you where you are at that point.  And if you are unhappy at that stage in your life, it makes you feel like you can change it.I totally recommend seeing this movie and reading much deeper into it than you feel you have to.

This notion of what happens when two people who are meant to be together, are not -- and the result is catastrophic to the lives of both. In WONDERFUL LIFE, it was one of many little cinematic wonders. In FAMILY MAN, it is really the entire movie. Which raises questions. Does this theme justify a film of its own? Yes. Do Cage and Leoni sell the story? Yes, they do. Cage can be a very unpredictable actor, but here he re-adopted the persona that launched him into orbit (from PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED) and handled the part well. Leoni is nothing short of marvellous and one suspects cinephiles from the future may look back on this era and ask why she was not in more movies...?

Jack, played by Nicholas Cage, is given a Glimpse, a look at a life that he could have had as a family man, with his former girlfriend Kate. They have a family and a drastically different life than his real one.The Family Man represents a dilemma of choices and priorities in life. Jack doesn't realize what he's missing in his life until he sees how satisfying the love of a wife and children can be. The characters consistently reference their plan vs. reality. The theme represents a choice between mind or heart, practicality or passion.The theme of this movie is universal, as it can apply to any viewer's life. There are always choices to make in our lives; choices that are a pivotal point in the future direction of our life; a proverbial fork in the road. For Jack, this fork came in deciding to leave for London for a yearlong internship, one he had worked very hard for, or to forget the plan and stay, choosing the relationship with Kate.The Family Man's theme also reminds me of another classic film about what matters most in life -- Orson Welles' masterpiece, Citizen Kane. In Citizen Kane, Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a man who, like Jack in The Family Man, seems to have it all. Kane owns many newspapers across the country, catches the eye of attractive ladies, and has a mansion and statue collection bigger than anyone can imagine. But in the end, despite having all of these things, Kane is left feeling empty, lonely, and sad. I won't give anything away about how Jack responds in The Family Man, but you must watch this film to see for yourself.Director Brett Ratner's use of camera angles in certain scenes of this movie enhance the suspense of which life Jack is waking up to &#x96; the high-profile, rich life or the modest, family life. Ratner used a camera shot several times in this film in which Nicholas Cage's character is lying in bed. It is an overhead shot looking straight down on him in bed. The shot is very tight on only him and the use of Low-key lighting leaves the viewer wondering which life he is waking up in, as you cannot see the surroundings of the set. As the shot pans out, and the lighting turns to High-key, you start to take in more of the scene's surroundings, and it is only then that you are able to tell if he is waking up in the rich life or family life. The use of these camera shots helps us to see the change in Jack throughout the film as the theme of practicality vs. passion plays out.Ultimately, The Family Man leaves us to question which path we as the viewer would take if we were in Jack's shoes, and also asks us to take a more introspective look into our own lives and consider the choices we have made. Would we choose to stick with our plan, or follow our heart? Have we set practicality aside to follow our passion? These are the questions that The Family Man invokes in us.

Only thing i can say about it, its excellent. And it makes a change where you got a film that could actually happen in real life. (ok I've put down spoilers but ill try not to say too much) The basis is, Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage) is a high flying financial exec and 13 years previous he left his high school/college sweetheart (Tea Leoni) behind. One Christmas Eve 13 years later, she contacts him. and, after preventing a robbery, he wakes on Christmas morning as if he never left her. His existing life is gone and a new one with his sweetheart and two kids is now present. He learns to bond with them over time and gets to see what hes missed out on. When he wakes , he realises. Thats all i'm saying on the film. I'm sure there are people who this has happened to, seeing someone from the past and wondering. It happened to me quite recently when i saw my High School sweetheart after just 12 years. The last time i watched it, i could really feel the emotion that and feelings that were going through Jack's mind. Watch it. Its a quality Christmas based film that doesn't age and is great viewing any time of the year. It's fantastically cast, written, directed and produced.

This film is the latest in a long line of &#145;alternate reality' films. This kind of film features one character who is his/her own worst enemy. One character is both the antagonist and antagonist. Mr. destiny, It's a Wonderful Life, Sliding Doors are a few that come to mind, all good films.The Family Man doesn't disappoint either. It's yet another take on an idea that's been done before, but it's a great story for telling cinematically. Its creators manage to make it seem fresh, even though it tips its hat to its predecessors, especially Capra's Christmas classic. There's the obligatory angel who comes to earth to teach mortals a lesson. Nicholas Cage plays Jack Campbell, president of a Wall Street investment firm. He even raises the pitch of his voice an octave and sticks his nose up in the air most of the time just to seem like more of a snob. Always versatile, Cage fits himself into the role perfectly. Cage's Jack is a stiff on the outside; putting on the armor of heartless businessman to get the job done, to endure the lonely life he's created for himself. But the man's got a big heart, as evidenced by an act of heroic kindness in a convenience store on Christmas Eve. He then goes even further and tries to help the homeless bum who just held the store up at gunpoint. He's just exposed himself, let his good side come out. He's now been chosen. Whether he likes it or not, he's going to get a glimpse of what his life would have been like had he not left his heart at the airport thirteen years before.It was then that he left Kate (Tea Leoni), the love of his life, behind. He wakes up the next morning in a suburban house with Kate as his wife and two kids. He steps into the skin of his other self, with no memory of the life he's led with Kate. Most of the film's comedy is supplied by Jack having to ask people how his life became so terrible. Are you okay? is asked a lot. Most people just laugh. It's just Jack being Jack. This was a nice touch on the writer's part. We're shown a videotape of Jack singing at Kate's birthday party and acting like he can't remember he's married to her. When he acts that way for real in the present, she just throws up her hand saying, Jack, please, it's not funny any more. The key to this film is its script, which is solid. Only Jack's oldest daughter suspects anything is really amiss, except she believes that aliens must have kidnapped her real dad and replaced him with an exact replica. She becomes in invaluable resource then, showing him how to do things like change dirty diapers. This was genuinely cute and genuinely funny.The film trips up at a critical time though the ending. It's a bit cliché by ending at the airport (with the token shot of the hero running through the terminal chasing his true love). Their intention is to bookend the film with airport scenes. Okay fine, but the ending leaves too many questions unanswered. It's good to leave the audience to draw its own conclusions, but I could have used a little more help, especially with Kate's motivation.This is good stuff all around, though. It does proud the films that came before.Grade B  "},{"Title":"One of the greatest modern Christmas classics of all time...","Date":"10 December 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" In Frank Capra's 1946 Christmas epic,It's a wonderful Life James Stewart got to see what life would be like for the people around him and the world if he had never been born. There by discovering that his life was not bad but missing something.In this 2000 rendition of that classic film Nicolas Cage plays a similar character, his characters name is Jack Campbell and he's a greedy and self absorbed investment banker who's only goal and love in life is to make money. Well that all changes one night when he stops a young African-American man named Cash from shooting a clerk over a lotto ticket but little does Jack know that this man is not so ordinary street punk but is in reality an Angel sent to help Jack changes his greedy ways. When Cash ask Jack what he wants out of life? Jack replies, I've already got everything I need. Cash tells him that he brought this on himself and leaves Jack not really thinking about what he had said goes home to bed and the next day wakes up, not as the playboy investment banker he is, but a married tire sales men of two with his college sweetheart he left behind 13 years earlier. Now the only way Jack is ever going to get his old life back is too first learn to live and appreciate life as, The Family Man.The Family Man is heartwarming, charming, sweet, touching and an all around great time for anyone in the mood for a great Christmas fairytale. While the story may seem a little familiar it does have it's moments that just really grab you and pull you into the deep rooted story about love, family and making the right choices even if at the time they seem wrong. It's one of those films that you have to watch and see just for the story or not even that, see it for the great performances, the high spirited nature of the events unfolding on screen see it just because you've got the itching for a good Christmas story. Whatever the reason you see this film see it with an open mind and an open heart and I can promise you that if you do the story will leave you with a great and warm feeling on the inside. All in all Brett Ratner's The Family Man is nothing short of beautiful and touching entertainment at it's very, very best and will entertain if not lift you up.Nicolas Cage gives one of the best and brightest performances of his career as first being the stuck up, self absorb Campbell and then slowly but surely changing into the man deep down inside he knows he is. It's something magical to watch on screen and the change in Cages performance as the film progress is astounding it's something new for Cage and it plays out very well for him on screen. Tea Leoni is astounding in this as the under payed and over worked wife of Jack in the alternate reality, Leoni plays the part with wit, charm and style and really shows how life as a suburban housewife can be. Leoni doesn't lie in her performance or tries to sugar coat what motherhood is like. She shows you how it works and how she helps the other Jack find solace in being a blue collar worker. Don Cheadle doesn't have allot of screen time in this film but the parts he is in are great and well preformed. But all in all the cast is phenomenal and really shine in this brilliant and beautiful holiday love story.The Family Man Has always been a favorite of mine to watch at Christmas time mainly because of the story and the message it plays out for you. It's just such an amazing film and it's so well told and crafted that it at sometimes doesn't feel like a movie with actors, but a really true to life story about a man who lost his way and has to find his way home. It's a great Christmas film and an amazing drama about how the choices we make can either make us a better person or make us into something we sometimes barley recognize. The Family man is a motion picture experience that is pretty original and something that you've never seen before , you may think you've seen this kind of story before but trust me when you watch it you won't think about comparing it to other films because this one is a one of a kind modern classic.

I just saw this a day or two ago and moderately enjoyed it. The message of the movie was obviously that all the wealth in the world can't replace having someone to share your life with. While parts of family man were a bit sappy and not very original, there was enough sweetness and fun moments to make it a fun, if not exceptional viewing experience.I think kudos go to the makers of Family Man for their casting of Cage and Leone in the lead roles, they were both perfect for the roles in question. I read some of the negative comments and can actually understand them. The movie does romantisize an awful lot. Still, I felt they were on target with much of it. Of coarse, not everyone who is rich and single is unhappy, not at all, but I think Cage's character was meant to be more of a caricature of one particular type of Person(The Eagles desperado comes to mind). I have seen this type of situation in real life amongst people I've known (the achievement of a certain lifestyle) and the money don't buy happiness theory happens to be in many cases true. Everyone makes choices in life but wouldn't it be fun to be able to get a peek into how one's life would have turned out if a different choice would have been made? This is a movie that's not heavy at all, to the contrary, it's very sweet and light and so mawkishly sappy at times. Still it makes you think. I'd give it a 7 of 10 and say it's worth a night's viewing.

Horrible.  Awful.  Mind-glowingly bad.  It is the epitome of contrived plots, conflicts which border on the absurd, and characters who you can't relate with.  The character of Kate Reynolds must be the most annoying female character ever created; her petty arguments with Jack Campbell, especially at the end (before he returned to the Real world) never ceased to surprise me.  I don't want to spoil the movie, but logically, most of what she said was ridiculous.  For example, does one seriously think that raising children in New York, or one of its rich suburbs, is significantly more difficult than raising them in New Jersey?Contrived arguments like that fill the movie, and it ends with the Alpha Male Campbell being reduced to a whiney Beta Male.  I don't seem to understand how this could be considered Romantic.  I hesitate to call the ending realistic; it seems more like the director wanted to give the audience a chance to make their own ending.

It stars Nicolas Cage as a financial executive who is given a glimpse of his life had he married his college girlfriend. He encounters an angel who just happens to be pulling a gun at the corner store. Could this really be one of God's angels? Holding up convenient stores just doesn't seem ideal. Anyway, Cage claims that he is satisfied with his current life but the angel sends him into the life he never had, which included marriage, children and suburban life. It's a Wonderful Life gains its points by being pleasant, while this modern day version is watered down with its pushy theme and an ending that doesn't work because Cage is expressing experiences that Leoni never lived. Interesting choice by director Brett Ratner who previously had success with Rush Hour. Fine chemistry between Cage and Tea Leoni that works better than anything else in the film. Don Cheadle's angel is a distraction as this warped angel that is perhaps the single worst element of the film.

The way achieve that is to work hard, giving my wife and my children great living environment, which including a nice house, good food, great education chance and so on. these all stuffs are required money. Therefore, in my opinion, working hard and making more money is important.However, after viewing this movie-the family man, I start thinking that am I missing the right track? Do I really know what is the most essential part? Sometimes I am so confuse.The Jack, the main character in this movie, the main reason for him to go abroad is to have a better career, which means a better salary to have a better life with Kate. But the funny thing is that this is exactly the reason they broke up.Maybe, I think, is that having a happy family is not the ultimate goal for Jack, and maybe that is a nice sugar coat for Jack to chase his real goal, like making more money, meeting better world. Because normally, the ultimate goal means the NO.1 thing, the most priority thing that nothing could compare with, if there is a alternative question, you should go with this goal without any doubt.Apparently, staying with Kate is not for Jack, or they won't broke up. So, that will make me think what is the best for my future family? Is going abroad to make more money the best for my future family? Or staying with my girlfriend by missing the excellent career chance? I found the answer in this movie. The answer is love. Love is an amazing thing, it is not about creating something for each other, it is about scarifying for each other for staying with each other. just like the movie said, I choose us, not a personal purpose, not a personal thought like oh I think this is the best for us. something like that. It is always about us, living together, solving problems together, facing difficulty together, raising kids together and so on. If there is a moment that will possibly separate us, we should reject this moment, we should stick around with each other.Of course, it is not only required love, but also a rational mind, you could not purely choose us because you are afraid of lonely, because you just thinking yourself. There could not be a little selfish mind. The choice have to be made rationally by love.I am a person who also choose to abroad for better education, and that would maybe spent 2 years without seeing my girlfriend. But, After viewing this movie, I will still stick with my choice, because I really start understanding what is real means of my ultimate goal. I know maybe sometimes I will miss the right track, fortunately, there is a movie that could always remind me, that could always make me thinking, that could always teach me, this movie is named The family man.

But outside of the last 15 minutes, the movie is extremely intriguing.Our protagonist is Jack, a complex character played excellently by Nicolas Cage in one his best performances. Jack leaves his college girlfriend, Kate (played by Tea Leoni) to pursue a big career in business. Only 14 years later Jack has achieved tremendous success, being a young, top executive among the big corporations of New York City. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, Jack has dedicated his life to business success, but unlike Scrooge, he is not a wretched, isolated man. Jack is fulfilled, social and deliriously happy with his life.Like George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life, Jack becomes a person of interest for an Angel who has the ability to show our protagonists a glimpse of a different life for the purpose of turning their lives around. But unlike the comedic buffoon Clarence, who descends to save a suicidal George Bailey, Jack's angel (played with a delightfully sinister edge by Don Cheadle), takes notice of Jack, in a perverse twist, only because of a good and brave deed perpetrated by Jack. Jack's glimpse is to see a life where he didn't leave his college girlfriend. No longer among the elite, Jack must orient himself in a life 14 years mired in mundane family life in suburban New Jersey. Comedic mayhem ensues but the capable Jack perceives the aspects of family, hearth and home that he has missed in the penthouses of NYC skyscrapers.And just as Jack embraces the virtues of family life, the glimpse is over and the Angel arrives to send Jack to his old life. And Jack returns to the life he had loved with such absolute certainty but now feeling the emptiness of loss. And the movie asks the question, is this redemption? At the end, Scrooge joyously carries Tiny Tim on his shoulders through the streets of London, George Bailey runs home to be saved by his wife and friends. But if we can argue that Jack is the better man, is he happier?Had the movie ended here, the ending would be deliciously dark and controversial, but true and complete, a kind of Twilight Zone Christmas Carol. The audience might hope that Jack could go and start a different, more balanced life. But the powers that be decided to end the film with Jack finding Kate and trying to undue the mistakes of old. But how would this work? Kate has no experience of Jack's glimpse, and even if she did, they would be different people and the children would not be the same. There is no way to have those 14 years back. Because this makes no sense, the ending feels cheap and manipulative like some Studio Executive mandated a happier ending, ridiculousness notwithstanding. The unacceptable ending notwithstanding, the bulk of the film is both complex and funny and worthy of repeated viewings.

He and Cash settle their business deal outside and he arrogantly offers to help Cash before going to sleep in his penthouse.However, the next morning, on Christmas Day, Jack wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom with Kate and two children. Shocked and confused, he hurries back to his office and condo in New York, but not even his closest friends recognize him. Confused, Jack runs out to the street and encounters Cash, who is driving Jack's Ferrari. Cash explains that Jack is in an alternate universe in order to learn a lesson.Jack realizes that he is living the life he could have had if he had not gone to London and become an investment banker but had stayed in the United States with his girlfriend.

It is basically like another Frank Capra film, or a cross between A Christmas Carol (because he realises the error of his actions) and It's a Wonderful Life (he sees what could have happened had his life gone a different route). Anyway, the film begins with that big decision that Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) had to make whether to go to Paris to make a successful living (he came back of course), or whether to stay with his college sweetheart Kate Reynolds (Téa Leoni), and he chose Paris. 13 years later, Jack is a highly successful and talented Wall Street businessman, and on Christmas Eve, two days away from a million-dollar merger. That night he stops a gun holding punk, Cash (Don Cheadle), and at one point tells him that he has everything, and later goes to bed in his designer Manhattan apartment. The next morning, Christmas Day, he wakes up shocked to be in bed with Kate, and in a suburban with a dog and two kids! He goes to the building where he works, well worked, and the people he used to know have no idea who he is. Cash picks him up, and explains to him that he has been given a glimpse, and he must work out what it is. As the days go by, Jack tries to cope with this new life while he works out why he is seeing this, and of course, slowly he is realising that this is the life he would have had if had not left for Paris. When Cash finally comes back after many weeks, Jack says he wants to stay, but of course he can't, but don't worry, there is a happy ending. The final scene sees Kate doing exactly the same, heading for the airport for a new life in another country, and after she has heard Jack's plea for her to stay (he explains about the life he has seen that could have been), thankfully she stayed for a coffee. Also starring Rush Hour 2 and Scary Movie 3's Jeremy Piven as Arnie, Unforgiven's Saul Rubinek as Alan Mintz, Patch Adams' Josef Sommer as Peter Lassiter, Makenzie Vega as Annie Campbell, Harve Presnell as Big Ed, Lisa Thornhill as Evelyn Thompson and twins Jake and Ryan Milkovich as Josh Campbell. It has some good giggles (including changing the baby's nappy for the first time), and Cage is really good as the Scrooge (except not that grouchy) or George Bailey (except not desperate or suicidal) of the story, a good seasonal film.

Leoni is also very good - she's just developing into a wonderful actress and will probably get an Oscar very soon. I do not also categorize this film as pure fantasy as for me this is of course all Jack's dream and we all know that dreams are in some way part of the reality. It has to be said though that the director (by the way he's a future of Hollywood) draws a clear line between the dream world and the actual one - there is a feeling of urgency when Jack is coming to the airport in the final scene and I could certainly relate to that myself as most of us have to choose in our lives between career and relationships and sometimes there are moments when you're not so sure about your past choices. Overall it's a very good movie about our lives.

We have all met a wonderful person, moved on in life by mistake and regretted our decision. I have... It is a strong family movie, emotionally charged, more for grownups though kids might sit through it and enjoy the humour. There is one memorable poignant and heartwarming scene I should mention. He forgets their wedding anniversary. The little girl suggests he take his wife for dinner into the city. They eat, and dance at a high class restaurant, he has planned a plush hotel room with champagne. She asks What are you sure about? He looks at this beautiful woman, she is stunning, All this time I never stopped loving you. I am sure right now, there's nowhere else I would rather be than here with you. She whispers That's all I wanted to hear ... and he is of course out of the doghouse.

We're talking about an un-original plot man gets a second chance to see how his life would have been if he had made one different decision. There.  Nothing special.  Sliding Doors pulls it off fairly well (thanks to John Hannah and two separate storylines), but it's a tale we can all picture without a motion picture.  However, the performances in The Family Man are extremely believable.  When Nicholas Cage resigns himself to his fate, I see more of Leaving Las Vegas than Gone in Sixty Seconds or City of Angels. Tea Leoni is great as a stressed mother.  Period. But the story and the plot save this movie.  How do you explain your state of mind to a child when you have been transplanted in time.  Family Man handles it okay--Cage pulls it off. I'm not saying this is a great movie, but it's a believable movie with good acting.  Get your wife and kids to watch.

Most of us are fascinated by conjecture on how things might have been if we'd chosen something other than what we did.It's asked again in Family Man.  I'm going to assume that people reading this have seen or heard of this movie, so I won't summarize the story, other than to say, it won't supplant any of the classics like It's a Wonderful Life, but it's edginess and the star power of its protagonists carries it through quite nicely.My only real problem with this movie is the contrived plot elements.  The issues of career versus family are treated as black-and-white... you can either be a soulless Wall Street securities maven, or a suburban family man with a beautiful wife (more on that later), surrounded by a posse of bowling-shirted knuckleheads.  Even when the movie attempts to confront the issue by presenting the possibility of having both, the wife dismisses it out of hand in favor of maintaining status quo. Although, in the end, she's willing to give it up in the name of love. This type of oversimplification has carried mid-level screenwriters for years.  I was looking for something more original.But hey, it's not all bad.  What makes it work for me is the appeal of the characters.  I'm glad that Cage has begun to edge away from action roles in favor of more character-driven material (you know, the stuff that made him a STAR).  He seems perfectly suited here.  And the incredible Tea Leoni simply radiates from the screen.  If there is a more BEAUTIFUL and talented young actress working today, I don't know who she is.  She looks like every guy's unreachable high school crush and radiates simple, earthy sex appeal. She's the one person in the world most men would throw it all away for.  Leaving us to wonder why Cage's character didn't realize his luck and left her at the airport in the first place ... DUH!!!If you haven't seen it, do so.  One case where the stars overcome the weak material.

Although not entirely a fair comparison, this movie thematically treads the same waters but is not as dark nor richly layered. With Wonderful Life, you feel a deep connection to the characters as they are regular blokes from a small town and you grow up with them.  You see George as he grows from a young whipper-snapper, through his days as a young mand and see him finally settle in with wife and kids.  With this one, we are thrust into Cage's career as a Wall Street man who owns a company and unless you are a millionaire yoruself, you can't really relate to the guy. The two movies are similar in plot where both characters are given a chance to see what would happen if their lives turned out differently.  But that is where any comparisons end.  I liked that the movie tried to convey that the family is what is really important and that people spend too much of their lives on career goals and put everything else to the wayside.  But while trying to tell us that, there are some people and things in his 'modest' life that appear to be put-downs rather than being given a fair shake. Shoot, many of our favorite characters go bowling... Ralph Cramden, Bill Murray, the Butthole Surfers, Fred Flintstone, and Dan Conner (Mr. Rosanne). Shoot, bowling is punk rock chique these days.  On the other hand, it portrays the 'rich' side of his life as being empty, without friends or family.  I think the movie delivers a good message but only on the surface. And the corn-O-meter was edging precariously close to the husk a couple of times, especially when the young daughter's speaking lines got a bit cutesy. Cage's performance saves the movie from becoming too shmaltzy and sweet. He has just enough of an edge to deliver the message.

The `alternate life' plotline, which probably originated with Dickens' `A Christmas Carol' and saw its film zenith with Frank Capra's `It's a Wonderful Life' has seen a lot of action lately.  Films that come to mind are `Mr. Destiny', `Sliding Doors', and `Me, Myself, I'.  `The Family Man' is by far the most shamelessly schmaltzy and borrows something from all its predecessors.  It brazenly plagiarizes elements from `It's a Wonderful Life' with a Christmas Eve opening where our despondent hero Jack (Nicolas Cage) tries to do a good turn for a scruffy stranger named Cash (Don Cheadle) who, as it turns out, has magical powers.  Next thing Jack knows he is in a new life where none of his former friends know who he is and his ex-girlfriend is his wife with two adorable kids.  The writers even have Cash give Jack a bell, reminiscent of ringing a bell so angels can get their wings in IAWL.  Then Jack metamorphoses from Mr. Potter to George Bailey right before our eyes.I could fill the page with derivative elements, but you get the idea.  While the story is cute at times, it defies logic that any sane person would act the way some of the characters behave in the situations given.  The story obviously panders to the masses, ennobling the middle class and vilifying the ambitious and successful.  The clear message is that if you work hard and achieve success you will live an empty life and have no appreciation of the joys that come from abandoning your aspirations and cheerfully accepting life's indignities.  Okay, that's a bit cynical, and lionizing the average Joe to sell tickets is nothing new, but this is a bit much.  And the ending borders on goofy.Nicholas Cage is an excellent actor but he is just too deadpan in this role.  Director Brett Ratner can't seem to cajole any dynamism out of Cage except in the boardroom scene early in the film.  Tea Leoni gives a vivacious and lovable performance and single-handedly holds the film together from the fringes.  Don Cheadle once again steals the show with a dynamite rendering of Cash.  I rated this film a 6/10.  It is a feel good film that that is easy to like, but that takes shortcuts to make a buck.  It slathers on the sentiment and makes a virtue out of abandoning one's dreams.

But as Robert Frost reminds us, we cannot take both roads and be one traveler.Except, of course, in the movies.The Family Man, the latest Nicolas Cage vehicle, takes us down both roads but gets lost along the way, and never makes it to Bedford Falls. Owing an obvious debt to Frank Capra's far superior Christmas classic, (It's a Wonderful Life) the filmmakers fail to provide as compelling a story, but successfully update some of the characters Where George Bailey battled an avaricious money man, Cage is that money man; Tea Leoni's sexy yet sensible housewife trumps Donna Reed's more conventional portrayal; and Don Cheadle's angel is intriguingly unpredictable, but is absent for too much of the tale.Jack Campbell (Cage) is a high-flying Wall Street whiz who leads a life of power and pleasure, as he merges and acquires his way right through the holidays. On Christmas Eve his secretary takes a message from Kate (Leoni), the college sweetheart he dumped 13 years ago. Jack blows off the message, but later that night finds himself in a dangerous standoff with an unbalanced, gun-toting angel (Cheadle) who spirits him away--to the life he would have led had he stayed with Kate.Suddenly a tire salesman--with a key slot on a New Jersey bowling team--Jack's new life with Kate includes minivans, dogs, diapers, and a daughter (Makenzie Vega) who is convinced he is an alien (Welcome to Earth!).Cage performs adequately in both aspects of his role, though he is more convincing as a Wall Street wag than a New Jersey nerd. Strong support from Saul Rubinek and Jeremy Piven bolster both sides of the story, but the best reason to see this movie is Tea Leoni's engaging interpretation of a role that could have been played as merely a foil for the Cage character.Rating  2 stars out of 4 "},{"Title":"Bit corny, but interesting","Date":"10 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  Okay, predictable, but enjoyable.

I would have to disagree with a previous review that says the movie celebrates capitalism. By the end of the movie, Jack comes to realize that there is more to life than money and living the high-life. Second, a movie does NOT have to be exclusively a drama or a comedy. It can very well be both and THE FAMILY MAN succeeds in this combination.

He's been in Leaving Las Vegas, in Bringing out the dead by Martin Scorsese and now he's in Bratt Ratner's The family man.  Of everything that I've seen of Nicolas Cage I still think his best performance is the one from the The Rock, although I must say that the actor does a great job in this picture as well.  I'm planning on watching Leaving Las Vegas soon, so it's possible that I'll witness an even better performance of his.  Maybe that's the best he's ever done since he got an Academy Award for that part.  But I wouldn't bet on it, because it wouldn't be the first time that an actor gets an Oscar for a minor role. (Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love is the first example that pops in my head.)In this film Nicolas Cage is a successful businessman who 'thinks' he has everything and that he has no regrets about his life until a shoplifter convinces him otherwise.  He gets the opportunity to see what his life would have been like if he had chosen his wife above his job.  This other life will eventually make him understand the TRUE values of life. This is, in a nutshell, what the film is about.  The story may sound familiar to you and that's because Sliding doors (with Gwyneth Paltrow) deals with that same question.  What if I had done things a different way?  I haven't seen Sliding doors yet, but after watching this film here I just might really go and rent it.Brett Ratner's previous success, Rush hour was a comedy all right.  The family man however can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama.  On the whole this film is actually a drama.  Come to think of it there are hardly any funny sides to this story with the exception of one thing though.  How Nicolas Cage becomes familiar with this 'new' life and finds out what kind of a person he truly is.  The whole picture is actually based upon this one item and it works for a LONG time, but not for the WHOLE time unfortunately.  The last 10 to 15 minutes of the film are pretty lame and the ending (although not disappointing) could have been better.  I like the fact that it's an open ending though.  No one says that those two will get together.  He left her many years ago for his job, why shouldn't she do the same thing?  It's possible that they become friends, but I'm not so sure whether we're dealing with true love here.  Only time can tell us (and maybe a sequel, but that's out of the question, I think.) The acting of Nicolas Cage (as mentioned before) is good and Téa Leoni is much more than just a beautiful woman; she can also act. So not a bad film, but just enjoyable for the first and perhaps the second time; I'm afraid.  After that, it might become somewhat tiresome. "},{"Title":"Great Movie.

There as a point when all his previous mistakes of the past were forgiven and slosh like Con Air could be possibly just another bad decision by a good actor.   But Maybe Nicholas Cage doesn't make bad decisions, maybe he's just really not too smart in landing rolls.   	Fresh from one of the worst, studio-concocted summer flicks of all time `Gone In 60 Seconds,' which just happened to have been gleefully gobbled up by the public, another Christmastime warmness-inducing studio-concocted sentimentalist melodrama like The Family Man is Cage's next big starring role- must've looked like a real good idea on paper.   Not only is The Family Man a horrendous extended ripoff/homage to `It's a Wonderful Life,'  ` A Christmas Carol,'the Rob Reiner dump `The Story of Us,' and basically any other movie that questions &#145;What would have happened if&#133;.,' it is dripping in unforgivably predictable goo.   There's a cute little kid who acts as a guide, a big greedy fatcat  unconcerned of his workers(Cage in his pre-epiphany stage),  a man/dog bonding thing,  the obligatory black guy who acts as another guide/ spirit (though his character confusingly starts off as a brainless hoodlum trying to scam himself a winning lottery ticket),   and an ending providing little solace of believable hope for the futures of its characters.     I can't stress how terribly astray the ending goes in presenting an open-ended scenario that in all likelihood will ultimately fail.  Maybe it was a final desperate attempt to stray from total predictability.  Despite multi-dimensional acting roles performed with skill by Tea Leoni and even Nicholas Cage,  I still can't excuse this boring, lengthy,uninspired script.  Just can't do it.

Danny Elfman's stirring score, Brett Ratner's visual composition, and the acting from Cage and Tea Leoni will break your heart. Scoff all you'd like. Call it a Capra rip off.

To not like this film is to give oneself completely over cynicism. And cynicism, and this will be my only sermon this evening, is the death of the heart.********** SPOILER **********At the end of the film, when Cage stands in an airport and makes a desperate plea to keep Leoni from leaving, he describes to her what their life together was like during his glimpse.

The acting by Leoni and Cage was really quite good. Cage manages to play an ordinary guy surprisingly well (I like him, but one of his Moonstruck/Raising Arizona style roles would have been a disaster here -- I've never seen him act like a normal person before), and Leoni has managed to subdue that irritating smirk she used to have and projects real warmth. The movie is exactly what you expect from the trailers, except that (as other people here have noted) his life as a soulless rich asshole doesn't seem so bad, and his life as a family man is unnecessarily dreary, so the movie is a little heavy-handed. Also, the abrupt shift at the end when he leaves the dream world and goes back to his real life is a little harsh -- for a feel-good movie to spend most of the last part of the movie being cold after all that family-centered-warmth takes the edge off your high. I don't know what else they could have done, but I think that a little tuning would have been in order.But all in all a very sweet holiday movie.

Nicholas Cage plays Jack Campbell, a businessman with everything and everyone at his beck and call.  Téa Leoni plays Kate, his former girlfriend, whom he abandoned for his career.  And Don Cheadle plays Cash, a Puckish angel, who plops Campbell down in a life that might have been had he married Kate.Suddenly, Jack has a beautiful wife, two kids and a slobbering dog to contend with.  Only Jack does not know what the hell is going on, which leads to some fairly amusing scenes.  Instead of being CEO of a billion-dollar investment firm, Jack now sells tires in New Jersey.  But this is only a glimpse of what might have been and nothing real.Where the film falls apart is in the why.  Cheadle's role is never clearly defined.  In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey prayed to God and so an angel was sent down in answer to his prayers.  Jack had no such prayer. He felt none of the helplessness that George Bailey did when the money was lost from the Building and Loan and he was faced with utter ruin.  Instead, Cash plunges Jack into some alternate reality without any explanation, as though he were Ebenezer Scrooge.  But in the end, when things are restored, we, the audience, are faced with the loss of two children, whose lives were simply erased.  Granted, the Lord moves in mysterious ways, but one needs to ask, what the hell was He thinking here?The basic concept was good, but the film lacks completion.  There can be no catharsis in the end because of the children who will never again be born.  So what if rich bad boy Jack found that there is more to life than the mighty buck?  So what if Kate ever forgives him or not?  There is a sadness about the kids that cannot quite be overcome. The Family Man is a feel good movie, kind of, sort of.  It has its pathos and its angst and its humour.  But in spite of it all, it just leaves a bitter taste in the end.

At the airport, Kate has a change of heart and begs him to stay. Perhaps she knows that this is a pivotal moment in both of their lives and that if Jack gets on that plane, things will never be the same.She is right, of course. Jack gets on that plane and 13 years later, Jack is a wealthy Wall Street businessman with Kate nowhere to be found. Almost as an aside, Kate, whom he hadn't heard from in 13 years, calls him out of the blue and he does not call her back. He stops in a store, confronts a gunman who happens to be a magic pixie of somekind and gets granted a 'glimpse' of what life would have been had the airport encounter with Kate gone differently 13 years ago. In this glimpse, Jack realizes that staying with Kate, raising kids, and not being wealthy might not have been that bad. It all culminates into a déjà vu scene in the airport, with the roles this time reversed. Kate is leaving and Jack wants her to stay.The Family Man is not a bad film, but it is rather weak. Too many dialogue exchanges and events occur that seem to really have no other place in the movie except to serve the plot. Too many key scenes just don't play real. I understand that this is only a fantasy movie, but we are not watching James Bond here. No one is jumping a motorcycle off a cliff to leap onto an airplane. It shouldn't require that many leaps of faith. 1.) A man holds a gun to your head and you then walk down the street with him afterwards asking about his life choices? 2.) In the glimpse world, Jack tries 'foolishly' to integrate the two worlds and secures a position which would offer him 2x his salary and Kate doesn't even think about it? OK, so perhaps his idea couldn't be allowed to succeed, but we get the feeling the only reason Kate says 'no' is it would end the film if she says 'yes'. There's no meat to her reservations. 3.) Why, after 13 years of silence, did Kate make that phone call early in the film? 'Real' world Kate is moving to Paris for a job and happened across a box of Jacks' things, she wanted to give them back. C'MON!! After 13 years?? JUST THROW THEM OUT!!! The movie doesn't even have the sense to at least hint that there is more to it than that. (Did Jack really need his yo-yo back?) 3.) Then there is the final scene at the airport. This should be the heartfelt ending. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near as emotional or clever as it could have been, because the dialogue Cage has to deliver to convince Kate to stay is too ridiculous to garner the desired result. If anything, Kate should be calling for airport security.The Family Man is not a terrible film, but it is a disappointing one. Despite strong performances by the leads, it never finds a way to transcend it's derivative roots (It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol) and inspire even the feeling of joy and redemption that it seems to be striving for.

He goes to sleep one night alone in his apartment and wakes up the next morning with a woman sleeping on top of him and 2 kids jumping on the bed.  He walks to the door to leave and as he is leaving, two complete strangers walk in and start talking to him as if they have known him for years.  He then drives to where he works and is surprised when no one knows him.  The man then shows up again to explain what happened.  Cage starts living this life.  He can't believe that anyone would choose to live this way, but he learns to like it.	How many times have we seen a story about a man married to his job and his money?  However, for some reason this one works.  Maybe it's the great acting or directing, but this film fills more than its potential.  With the story line it has it leaves a lot to be determined by the viewer, but the relationship between Cage and Leoni covers all of that up.  The viewer doesn't care why the man has power enough to put Cage in the glimpse, they only care that he does and that Cage learns a huge lesson while he's there.  They don't care why Cage's daughter knows he is not her dad, because it adds to the emotion to the story.  The only thing the audience cares about is the fact that the story does in fact work out. 	   As critics, we do have to recognize that the man with the powers is not explained and appears out of nowhere, and that does bring the movie down a notch or two. Overall, I think it was touching and I would recommend it to anyone, but especially viewers who liked the movie `Scrooged' with Bill Murray because they are very similar.

She was smart, funny, caring and, of course, because she is an actress, cute.That being said, this movie made a big mistake right off the bat. The single Jack (Nic Cage) is a good person, and a very successful businessman. He gives stock tips to the security guy, knows the doorman by name, steps in to prevent what might have been a fatal holdup at a liquor store and wants his employees to work hard but also to make lots and lots of money for that work. His one tragic flaw is he doesn't have that special person in his life.We don't know if he doesn't have that person because he is too busy, because the woman he left behind 13 years ago was the *only* woman for him, because he just isn't good at intimacy (he likes prostitutes, at least to some degree)or because the movie simply chooses not to show us any of his dates. What we *do* know is he has a damn good life, an exciting one, and lots of possibilities in his future due to his success.But, this being one of those sappy Hollywood cliche movies, all that doesn't matter because HE DIDN'T GET MARRIED AND HAVE THAT ODE TO BLISSFULNESS, A FAMILY. Because, of course, having a spouse and kids is the ultimate high, the very best thing about life. Gag. The problem this movie creates is that Jack's original life isn't bad. He isn't a bad person. He has plenty of time to settle down if and when he chooses. Yet the plot juxtaposes that life with what could have been and gives the wife/kids/tire saleman path an unqualified great! and tries to make the successful business man life a lonely, horrible existence. It doesn't work.You could go on to note that the family scenes are all filled with love and laughs, and the business scenes are sort of work-like and hard driving. The movie tends to ignore the pay off of the work scenes while it wallows in the family love is terrific message. Really, jack could have BOTH of those lives if he chooses (though some adjustments would need to be made), and maybe at the very end the movie finally acknowledges that fact.

Isn't this the actor who takes chances when he selects roles? At least put this guy in an action flick. ('Gone in 60 Seconds' was kinda cool in its own way.) Give roles like 'Family Man' to Bob Saget or Adam Sandler.When he's transplanted to what his life would have been with Tèa Leoni (looking very hot for a mom with two kids), his oldest daughter sees that he's not really 'dad.' But she likes him and tries to help him get used to his new surroundings. This doesn't work for two major reasons First, she doesn't question what happened to her real dad. Second, she talks with a phony lisp that makes you want to tear her head off (You're not weally my daddy, awr you?).This poor guy spends an hour of the film hating what's been done to him. Yet, after he is forced back to his original life, he misses his middle-class other-existence. Why would anyone give up being a happy millionaire to being ordinary? Everybody is ordinary. It isn't hard to get to that stage. The premise itself is ridiculous.Jack (Nic) could have looked up his old girlfriend without being thrown into this 'comically' absurd situation.

Well, here we have a guy who's enjoying life, only to have some angel/spirit inexplicably wake him up  one day, next to the old girlfriend he dumped 13 years prior and her kids.

And after awhile (wouldn't ya know), he comes to like this new life as a suburbanite and decides to chase down Leoni upon returning to his normal life and give her a try.  Unlike Mr. Destiny, this goes a dramatic route, with sprinklings of comedy.  Which made it fall short for me, as the other has become a real favorite of mine over the years, with its better storytelling.  This is kind of in and out, ho hum, next movie.

Usually they go for the farcical, in which case every character comes across like an idiot.  The second approach is harder and more risky.  It asks the question, How would the characters really act if this an unbelievable premise actually happened?  To coin a phrase from the movie itself, The Family Man takes the road less traveled, and the result is marvelous entertainment.Nicolas Cage plays a successful Wall Street financier who 13 years earlier left his girlfriend, played by a radiant Tea Leoni, at the airport to take an internship in London.  Through the intervention of an angel, Cage is given a glimpse of what life would have been like had he married Leoni.Cage's over-the-top acting style serves him well as he plays a man who is horrified by the new life he finds himself in Small house in New Jersey, tire salesman, bowler.  Leoni knows that something is wrong, but chalks it up to a midlife crisis--a believable action on her part.  The couples' daughter knows that Cage is not her father.Predictably, Cage grows into his role as husband and father.  And not so predictably he uses his financial knowledge to better his family's life.  This is also a film that could be ruined by its ending, but it doesn't let us down here either.

And to be able to see someone given the chance is great, but would we really be willing to change everything on a glimpse? Enough critical talk, Don Cheadle, though playing a small part is excellent. The limited screen time allows him to Ham up the moments he gets. Though his scenes are shared with Nicolas Cage, he commands them to where Cage is left with the task of playing catch-up, usually to no success.What is interesting is the time frame they choose; 13 years. Apparently an allusion to the havoc that number has played on people and society throughout modern human existence. Whether it ends up being a harbinger of doom or, as I see it, a lucky omen, the movie doesn't quite let you know, even at the end. And if you have seen most feel good movies, you know how it ends happy, or at least with the possibility. And there in lies the problem I see with this movie. The ending. Too Cliche'd. We are placed in an identical scene as how the movie begins, 13 years later, only Tea Leoni is the one forced to make the gut-wrenching decision of stay or leave. Though there are only two possible ending I won't tell you which one it is. To end, I will say that the show stealer was the child who played the daughter. Whether it was just her age that allowed her to play it with such innocence, or she has the same acting potential as Haley Joel Osment; she was very convincing.

The updated version of Mr. and Mrs. George Bailey finds them as a high flying financier and a prosperous lawyer who turned away from each other years ago and now confronts what might have been.  Unlike the original George Bailey who could peel back his present life to see what a mess it could have been otherwise, their counterparts, Jack and Kate are having a pretty good life, thank you.  Even Clarence the Angel doesn't translate well in the character, Cash (Don Cheadle) who comes across as strangely impersonal and without religious overtones.  So what we have left is a film with an unfulfilled wish.  Whenever filmmakers imagine lives to be what they are not, they bargain credulity to fit the circumstances.  The Family Man is no exception.  The fundamental premise is that a rich man, use to getting whatever he wants, can somehow assume another man's life - that of a committed husband and father with an unglamorous routine and job, and a circle of boring friends in suburbia. The other premise in this shaky foundation is that this comforting, albeit middle-class life is but a glimpse ('by definition impermanent'), a mere fraud of what could have been.  The Family Man entices and it tries to be warming but, in the end, it is no more than a fable, played up and played down in agonizing length.  Nicolas Cage, as Jack, is his workmanship self but the real gem here is Tea Leoni as Kate who has to compensate for her mercurial husband and yet keeps the joys of a professional mother intact.  Robert Frost once penned the famous lines, ' two roads diverge in the woods and I, I chose the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference'.  The Family Man' tries to tell us we can travel both roads, a fond wish and the stuff dreams are made of.

This movie is unlike most movies I've seen this year in that it completely, totally satisfied me with a compelling story (largely a new take on A Christmas Carol, but so what - it's a story that can survive and thrive in retellings), attention to details, and brilliant acting.Comedy vs Drama  This is a realistic depiction of how two people respond to events, from the phenomenal to the mundane -- it's mostly a drama, but with humorous moments which do occur in daily life.   The movie does not bill itself as a 'comedy' either in the trailer or in the storyline, and should not be taken as such.   In some ways, the movie has a 'European' film feel to it - it is not afraid to take time to take scenes a little further, flesh out things a little more, and revisit the characters' reactions throughout the film, i.e. no 'quick' answers here.   Viewers never feel like they are part of a studio audience brought in to serve as a laughtrack.   Nor do you feel like you're watching a music video -- there are no scenes where dialogue is replaced by a pop music score, no 'twelve hours in sixty seconds' montages so common in American films lately - a device which always leaves me very dissatisfied because I'd prefer to see the untidy bits between the cute montage clips. This movie delivers just that.The attention to details is marvellous - witness the scene where Nicholas Cage's character Jack Campbell has to use a map to find his way back to his 'new' home after bolting out of the house in the family minivan - other movies would just 'assume' he'd find his way back without incident, but the script here constantly strives for continuity and little spots of realism - it makes sense he'd have to use a map!Acting Chops  Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni are wonderful, both separately and together -- the plot allows them to explore a range of emotions, and their alter-personalities, as the story unfolds.  Tea Leoni's performance is especially noteworthy -- sexy, passionate, and convincing.  All of the secondary characters are very well incorporated -- not one film frame is 'wasted' or 'superfluous.'The Chick Flick Factor  Okay, so all women were wiping teary eyes when the lights came on in the theater, but don't let that fool you.  This is a parable from Jack Campbell's point of view which should appeal to both men and women.  Situations encountered in the film are not gender-specific - who hasn't wondered where an alternate choice would have led them?  Or if they'd be a worse/better person for it?  Or if the guy in the next cubicle would be worse/better as a result as well?  While we're at it - also don't let the presence of two kids turn you off.  Married-with-kids folk will probably relate to the film in a different level from single or child-free folk, but as someone in the latter category, I found the 'kid scenes' not only tolerable, but interesting and believable.  They are not just token 'cute' fodder but actually contribute to the storyline.Meesa Says 'The Family Man' makes my enthusiastically-recommended list. You'll leave the theater completely satisfied.   10/10 "},{"Title":"Very poignant and makes you think","Date":"23 December 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  Just saw the movie tonight (national opening night).

And to her credit, Tea Leoni was extremely natural and as good as she could be in this soul-less, uninspired disappointment. She should be in more movies. She could be great.

In many ways, it is.Honestly, Nick Cage needs a good movie. The last movie I remember seeing him in that I enjoyed, and pretty much everyone else, was Con Air. After 8mm, Bringing Out The Dead, and Gone In Sixty Seconds, Cage really needs something with depth, not to mention quality (but I guess I did mention it). He doesn't get what he needs from this film.The Family Man is the feel good movie of this week. There will be another one next week to take this one's place. Sure, there are some funny parts to this movie, but most of the time it can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy or a serious drama. Most of the humor is centered on Nick Cage being out his environment, being thrust into an unfamiliar situation and having to take on the duties of a parent. That's where Hollywood's research on target audiences comes into play; this film is aimed at women who are mothers and the husbands they drag along to the theaters. The women get to see Nick Cage, often without a shirt on, and the men get Tea Leoni (sorry guys, no nudity).My big problem with this movie is that it feels like it has to explain every little detail, as if the audience was too stupid to figure things out on their own; putting two and two together and such. The last half hour was also far too long and drawn out.Yeah, there were some problems with The Family Man, but it was still better than 90% of the other movies that came out this year.

I guess when you look at it this way, it's just good to keep the holidays with you all year round, so I said, why not let's review the 2000 family holiday movie The Family Man. The movie to me had a combination of two outstanding holiday classics like Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life and the classic Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The Family Man stars Nicolas Cage playing off Scrooge's character named Jack Campbell, a wealthy, successful Wall Street business executive who has no care in the world for anyone or anything except for making money. But one night was a night that will change his views on the world forever. A scary looking thug named Cash (Don Cheadle) is holding up a store clerk at gunpoint over a lottery ticket and Jack tries to stop him. But this hoodlum is not some ordinary thug, he happens to be an Archangel who's mission is to evaluate Jack's self- absorbing ways in hopes to change his ways of life in order to make a better man out of him. When questioned about what Jack wants out of life, Jack replies I've got everything I need. The next morning, Jack awakens and discovers that he's no longer a bigwig corporate shrew, but a married man with two adorable kids and is now selling tires. His wife was an old college flame that he freely abandoned to go on his greedy self-centered path of success. The only way he can leave this fantasy world is if he changes his view of life and to appreciate the limited time he has in this world. The movie is a sweet, charming family-friendly holiday movie with a very easy moral message to follow and will likely keep you intrigued during it two hour plus duration. Sure the story is nothing original and the plot has been milked harder than an over-active cow, it's still grabs you and makes you appreciate the world in front of you. After all, life is too precious to be wasted upon for being greedy and selfish. It deals with such topics involving love, family values, and making life decisions whether they're good or bad. Although the story is unoriginal, it is still intriguing but the performances are also very special and the candy-coated charms makes this movie one of the more engaging holiday films that everyone of all ages could enjoy. This movie requires viewers to see with both your heart and mind in the right places. Under the direction of Brett Ratner, The Family Man is very entertaining while at the same time will likely lift one's spirits. The only main weakness was near the end where it was taking too long to wrap things up. I also expected to have a more pleasant Christmas fantasy ending, sadly The Family Man failed to deliver from that point on. But it did not dapper my spirits in any way.Performances were spot on as each actor and actress knew their roles and played them quite naturally. Nicolas Cage was quite convincing in one of his warmest performance to date as the selfish at first Jack Campbell who progressively becomes a more polar opposite to his former self by the end of the film. It's his change to become a better person is what the audience had came to see and we root for the man the whole way through. It was good to Cage in more family-friendly movie than the films we are used to seeing him in. Tea Leoni is equally poignant as the wife from his alternate world, Kate Reynolds-Campbell who's struggling financially and later reveals that she sacrificed love in college to become a very successful attorney. Leoni has the right amount of wit and charm to carry this film out along with Cage. Don Cheadle has very little screen time, but his few scenes are very effective and special. Jeremy Piven was very good here, but his screen time too is quite limited. The cast is truly amazing, but the real delightful performance comes from Mackenzie Vega as their daughter Annie Campbell. Her charm and perkiness and sweet voice makes her a scene stealer. Too bad she did not reach star quality like other child stars from that era like Dakota Fanning or Abigail Breslin. Although this movie is too long in length and the ending dragged on only to meet with unsatisfying results, there really was no ending in the final product to be honest with you. If I can overlook those flaws, I see an engaging film that's charming and is surely a nice film to add to the holiday pleasures and for the family to enjoy while it delivers a positive message we can all learn from.

Due to a good deed on Christmas Eve he is given a glimpse of what life could be like if he had married her, had two children, and had a life in suburban New Jersey.This is a story that has been done before in other forms, but this rendition is fresh. Jack's shock at discovering his new lifestyle is very funny. Cage makes it believable. His wife, Kate, is also good, as his loving, smart wife.This one is a keeper. Watch it, buy it, and enjoy it!

And what would happen if you got a second chance to be with that person again by going back in time or could be a alternate universe. So the whole movie is basically a what if scenario with romance in it. I admit the main reason I wanted to see this movie again after 10 yrs was because of one youtube video that makes a joke of one scene, the Nicolas Cage Wants Cake scene. But I am glad I managed to see it again, since it's a heartfelt and intriguing movie. I personally like Nicolas Cage as an actor, I find his performances to be very entertaining. Although his acting is a bit deteriorating now a days, but still entertaining never the less. His performance in this may seem a bit over exaggerated but believable. This movie question if you would pick money over true love or true love over money. It's not as magical as when I saw this movie 10 yrs ago and lack the closure in the end. But it's still a worthwhile movie to watch and enjoyable and I didn't mind watching it again at all.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"A Holiday Classic","Date":"22 November 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" A few different times since this movie has been released, I have been able to see almost the entire thing. Yesterday I watched the whole thing and finally got the wonderful benefit of the entire, intricate story and all the characterizations.Most people know that this is a story about What would have happened if... This movie is often compared to It's a wonderful life. While it's true that Jimmy Stewart and Nicholas Cage portrayed men in the financial field, Jimmy's character gets to see what the world would have been like had he not been born. Nicholas Cage's character, Jack, gets to see how life would have been if he had married his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni).During the holidays, many movies about What would have happened if... flood the airwaves, especially on the Lifetime channel. The quality of the acting and the casting of Family Man set it head and shoulders above the rest. A brilliant early scene spotlights this Jack has woken up in bed with Kate, tossed into the life where he is married to her. He frantically scrambles into the minivan and thunders into the city where he tries to get back into his palatial condo. We get to experience his exasperation when neither Maggie, the glamorous matron who shares condo board duties with him, nor the doorman, recognize him.Jack's daughter, the adorable Annie, is used magnificently in the movie. If I were to say how, it would create a spoiler, but I should warn that you have to follow closely to get the full effect. Lisa Thornhill portrays the sexy suburbanite housewife Evelyn, who flirts dangerously with Jack. Saul Rubinek plays the character of Alan Mintz, vice president of the mega-brokerage where Jack used to work, who shows completely different aspects of his character in the Jack-inhabited and Jack-less worlds. Even the tiny character of Lorraine, Kate's mother (portrayed by the lovely Francine York) shows how much thought was given to populating both worlds with the right type of people.Nicholas Cage as Jack shows flashes of Castor Troy (the master villain from Face off), and the angel character Seth from City of Angels, which shows the scope of his character. He changes over the course of the movie in a delightful way (yep, the Castor Troy part is at the beginning). Tea Leoni is perfect in the Kate role. She combines playfulness with a quiet strength and vulnerability at the same time. Her easy, casual beauty works well in this movie, especially in the close-ups of Jack and Kate's romantic scenes, which are breathtaking.In all, this is a collection movie, one that should be brought out every holiday season to remind us that other people matter the most in life.

I think it is rare that Hollywood actually endorses a solid middle class family lifestyle as being something to aspire to (as opposed to sordid affairs, and looking out for #1 type films). I like that the family portrayed is barely middle class - as opposed to living in some luxurious McMansion like a lot of films show. I think they did an accurate job of showing the chaos, love and sacrifice that a lot of us have experienced in raising our families. And that ultimately, we would choose to do it all over again if given the choice.I was surprised this got a PG13 rating with the shower scene though. Very little was left to the imagination behind the foggy glass door.I think the did made good casting choices. Nicholas Cage has a certain everyman appeal to him. And who can resist the beautiful but approachable Tea Leoni. Who wouldn't choose her?! And the little girl that portrayed the daughter did an amazing job - she was so adorable and I loved her whole my dad has been abducted by aliens thing she had going with Nicholas Cage.I think this movie has touches of Its a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol woven through it. So while it is not completely original in concept, it gives a nice modern twist to classic stores that we all can relate to.

The critics sure thought that. But a film like this, especially this one, should be enjoyed for what it is a hopeful and ultimately touching study of humanity and life's choices. The fact that Nicolas Cage and Don Cheadle are in the mix add to the overall 'romantic depth' of the film. I use the term lightly in the sense that many would claim films such as these are over-done and therefore have very little depth compared to other studies. Had the film not been panned a typical formulaic romantic comedy, the overall idea and appealing dialog could've been even more wonderfully adapted for a more poetic and deep approach. Yet, the film in itself works. The pace is not eccentric and forced yet not dragging. There are none of the usual outrageous cliché moments in the film, and the humor is not gut-busting nor embarrassing. It is a subtle comfortable and touching look at what is more important in life, that is more feel-good than cliché. Tea Leoni, not someone I sought after for her acting as much as her looks, controls a light two-dimensional performance, whilst Cage uses all the charm of City of Angels with a contrasting romantic character that may not be award winning but is pleasing. Enjoyable film for what it is and a romance to keep.

Impressive were not only Nicholas Cage with some fine acting, but Tea Leoni whom I'd heard of but never seen as an actress. Fine stuff from both. I know we'll see Mr. Cage again and hope to see Tea Leoni more often - she's very refreshing from the usual Hollywood look and actions. Memorable were scenes where Cage tried on his usual type of Wall Street clothing in front on his wife on a limited budget. Also, Tea's attempted rape of her husband who was turned on initially but zonked out on the bed while his wife changed to seductive clothing. Daughter Annie did a great job in studying and discovering that her Dad was an impostor, and confronting him with her fact. The only one NOT involved was the family dog in its non-recognition of Mr. Cage's non-identity. Dogs know by scent. This was the only actual unbelievable part of the film for me.

Like any time travel movie, we need to let the supernatural intervene and get beyond that. Nicholas Cage is suddenly thrust into a world he knows but doesn't know. He has a family, a job, a life, and it's a hard, blue collar life, away from the executive favors he so much takes for granted. He is a jerk and has abandoned the things that were precious to him at one time, so his about face isn't totally alien to him. Unfortunately, when he finally comes full circle, the rug is pulled out from under him. He must figure out what to do again. His losses are great and we realize that he must go through some incredible pain before he rights himself again. The scenes as he tries to deal with his family, his wife, his co-workers, etc., are the stuff of this movie. There is a bit of reverse snobbery here, of course. We are led to believe that middle America is somehow superior to the Nicholas Cage world. There is substance in middle America. There's also racism, intolerance, wife beating, child abuse, hatred, and all the other things the flesh is heir to. This movie is well crafted if we suspend our disbelief and accept the premise.

The beginning is a bit like The Kid, but with less laughs and more depth. We see Jack Campbell (Cage) preparing to board a plane to London so he can get ahead in his career, and having his girlfriend Kate plead with him to stay in New York. He does board the plane, promising that even though her doubts tell her differently, they'll be together again in a year. In the next scene, 13 years later, Jack is shown single and at work, respected by all - though it's hard to say whether anyone except the girlfriends we see little of truly enjoy having him around. A co-worker tells him he should return the 1st call he's gotten from Kate in all this time; another claims his rich bachelor lifestyle isn't half-bad. On Christmas Eve he plans to have an emergency meeting the next day, not caring that it's a holiday. On his way home he meets a mysterious man, Cash, he makes a deal with over his lottery ticket, who then hints he'll give Jack something unexpected, even if he has everything as he claims. The next morning, Jack's life is turned upside-down when he awakens surrounded by Kate, his wife of 13 years, 2 kids, and a dog, in New Jersey. He flees to his New York apartment then his office, to discover that nobody in either knows him. He has a life in Suburbia with a middle-class family, friends he doesn't know, and a job at a tire-factory, all of which are sub-par to him. Instead of trying to act as though he knows what he's doing to fit in, he rebels against his new life, getting into fights with Kate over how he can't by the $2,400 suit he wants and hates his daily routine involving his average-paying job and family. As he resolves to make things work as long as he's stuck where he is, he gradually warms up to his family, if attempting to regain his old job and maybe a city apartment. But once he seems truly content in what he's got, Cash hints that his glimpse is almost over. Jack doesn't know how much time he has left, or how to keep what he's won, but he'll have to figure it out before he loses Kate a 2nd time. (SPOILERS) It was interesting in the end to see why he saw what life could have been when he ended up loving Kate, especially since the audience is reminded of something only mentioned in the beginning of the plot as he is shocked to see how Kate has changed because of his choices. (SPOILERS END) Nicholas Cage's acting was good, and the story was OK. It's too bad there wasn't a clearer picture of Jack's negative personality before his life changed. The only major thing he's shown doing thoughtlessly between his scenes of leaving then living with Kate is planning a meeting on a holiday, so I don't feel like we ever got to know what kind of person he originally was, even though he was a p**ck compared to the happy man Kate was used to him being. Jack and Kate could've been played by different people for when they were in college and when they were older, or at least used techniques to make them appear notably older, since Jack says Kate has grown to a woman even more beautiful than she was just having left college, though I can't see a difference. Cash is an angel, but I've never seen an angel pull a gun on the 200 lb white man who tries to intervene when he threatens the racist secretary - sounds more like a dervish to me. Also, I'm unclear why he decided Jack's glimpse was over when he did. I wondered whether Jack actually did learn his lesson by that time, because just when things seemed to go smoothly he'd blow it in a big way by having a fight in public, or suggesting to move the family to NYC to get his former job at Wall Street. 1 thing I wish they'd changed was the fact that Jack - in the alternative life - never attended college in London and ended up happily marrying. It would've seemed better to show him as having gone to college but not neglecting and breaking contact with Kate after he returned. And having him have a 3rd kid, 1 too old to guess their dad had been cloned as the daughter did, and maybe showing him/her try to rouse him other than jumping on the bed Christmas morning, would've been nice. Other than that, I felt this movie was just fine. It wasn't your average story of money and 2nd shots. Enjoy.

I'm particularly impressed by the writing of the two Davids--Diamond and Weissman; their brief key lines often capture the essence of the scenes preceding them.

This film about awakening to values that transcend material success leaves me with a feeling akin to that which I experience each time I watch It's a Wonderful Life. The performance of Makenzie Vega as the seven year old Annie rivals those of the young Ron Howard.  The scene in which she realizes that Jack is not her real father and slowly slides from her perch, fights back tears, and then musters a pursed semblance of a smile is for me a highlight of the movie. Though it's a movie very much ABOUT children, however, it's not a movie FOR children.

Next morning, he wakes up in bed with Tea, and their two children come into the room, visitors show up, every indication that he had in fact been a family man for 13 years, instead of a high-powered Wall Street businessman.As we the audience think about what we just saw, one legitimate question is, was it all a dream, triggered by the message that his old girlfriend had called. It could have been, except for one important detail. When he is back to his Wall Street life, one day later on Christmas day, he drives back to the house in NJ which was his family house, with a different family living there. He could not have done that had it all been a dream, in which reality is distorted.It was a glimpse, facilitated by the angel, which in glimpse form spanned several weeks. During that time he went from a very hesitant husband and father to one totally immersed in his role. It became his revelation that you don't have to sacrifice one for the other, career for family, that you can have both. So, even though the glimpse spanned several weeks, in his present time it was simply overnight.Thus, finding her and the final scene at the airport. The simple idea that in life having that special person to share a life with is more important than where you live and what career you have. A simple idea that many never latch onto. This film does not tell us what eventually happened, that is not the point.  Good film.

Don't be fooled though, The Family Man would probably be just a good if it had different actors.  It is a great holiday movie about what life would be like if we made different choices.  Cage plays Wall Street hot shot Jack Campbell, who is on the verge of closing a business deal on Christmas eve.  He gets a call from his collage girlfriend Kate (Leoni), who he left years ago in order to pursue his career.  He ignores the call and then something very strange happens He goes to sleep in his expensive downtown apartment and wakes up the next morning in the suburbs.  He discovers much to his surprise that he is married to Kate, with two kids, and a job as a tire salesman.  After getting over the initial confusion, Jack begins to realize that this new life isn't so bad.  He also begins to fall in love with Kate all over again and finds out that as much as he liked life in the fast lane, the family life is much more rewarding.  Cage gives his character a kind of humanity that shows in both lives. Even before waking up with Kate we see their is a kind side to him, suggesting that his new out look on life is not so much of a transformation as it is something that had been laying dormant in him for some time.  Surprisingly enough as good as Cage is, the heart and warmth of the film comes from Tea Leoni, who is pure perfection in her role making it very easy to understand why Cage would want to pick that life over his previous.  This is definitely one of those movies that leave you with a nice feeling after you leave the theatre, and will hopefully be remembered along with It's A Wonderful Life, as a great holiday classic.

Tea Leoni continues to polish her work. She is a glowingly beautiful woman who can act. She almost steals the film from Nicholas Cage, but that is impossible. Cage is - if one can say this - the new James Stewart. His voice, his lanky physique, even his gestures are Stewart-esque.  No wonder he got this role.   Cage shines as this Jack Campbell, whether the man is an arbitrager with a carbon steel soul or a gentle, bemused husband and father. Cage is so good at this dual personality that it's clear that he still can play the guilt (sic)-edged, slightly deranged and/or highly dangerous types that have built his career, in spite of worried critics who think otherwise.  One reads reviews of the film that praise with faint damns, and vice versa, because Family Man leaves a good feeling. What's wrong with that?  The well-woven characters with interesting, contrapuntal flaws keep the film from being gooey.   Perhaps I'm about to damn this excellent film, but I'll say this anyway the whole family can watch Family Man.  Yes, Mrs. Duchovny - or her body double - does appear nude through a steamed-glass shower stall, and some people are in bed with others now and then.

This is not a great movie, but it's not meant to be.  It's meant to stir up special feelings in your heart, and even keep you thinking a little bit about what you would do if you were in Cage's situation.  Of course, if this were real life I'm pretty sure Cage would have difficulty giving up his playboy lifestyle, having women casually being sent up to his room and stripping down to their lingere.

Overall, I'm sure this movie will help reinforce the catholic dreams of those doubters who chose marriage and family, and now regret the choice somewhat.  The underlying theme that we who choose not to go down that path and cannot be truly happy, is rediculous.

But the script for THE FAMILY MAN, with it's horrendous, leaden dialog, so thoroughly beat down any real chance his acting had, it wasn't even worth viewing for his sake.  Tea Leone is an actress even worse than the two-dimensional, Gwyneth-preen-and-clench variety.  On one hand i guess her character could be called feisty and playful.  On the other hand (the one you reach after you count to 5 on the first hand), I'd have to shoot her if i were actually trapped in a house with her.

Cameron Diaz is a favorite, and she's MUCH prettier than Leone.  It's that Leone is a thin and intrusive personality with the finesse of a salami.The film is insulting to both urbanites and suburbanites; everyone in the city is rich, ultra-modern and sterile (except for the grateful servants of these people), and all the women look pre-fab.  Everyone in New Jersey bowls, has bad lawn ornaments and seems to *like* having the Barcolounger in the middle of the room.

I had never seen Tea Leoni before - guess I have a lot of catching up to do. Her acting reminded me of Jodie Foster/Holly Hunter in their prime and, for me, there is no higher praise. For the cynic this wouldn't work - the plot is idealistic to say the least, but the message that some of the things we value aren't worth a dime, whilst others are incalcuable is spot on. On the way home it occurred to me that the life view put forward in  Family Man  appealed to me far more than the much-hyped  American Beauty  which I loathed.

That's the kind of mentality that makes these suck - they don't have to). In fact, this doesn't seem to understand how humor works at all. Timing appears an especially foreign concept to the people behind this. Not without charm, sure. It's one of the only genuine aspects of this, and the coupling isn't awful. There are subplots that go nowhere and leaves you wondering why they were introduced if they didn't intend to resolve them(case in point, the potential affair with the sexually repressed suburban housewife).

It's hero, George Bailey, is a kind of secular saint whose caring, hard work, and self-sacrifice has bettered the lives of everyone in town.  Jack Cambell (Nicolas Cage), the hero of Family Man, is no such social superhero.  In fact, when the story begins he is reaping the fruits of having taken the road Wonderful George didn't travel, and Jack is now a multi-millionaire financial wizard living the urban good life.  That is, until his guardian angel decides to give him a taste of the life he MIGHT have had as a suburban family man.  Predictably he finds the true meaning of life in domestic happiness (this IS a '90's film) and returns from his alternate reality to rescue the woman he was MEANT to be with, as well as himself, from the sterility of the monetary side of material happiness.This relatively self-oriented rescue is obviously quite different from Frank Capra's social vision, and the film is nothing more than a checklist of 'heartwarming' cliches.  Usually Bill Murray stars in this kind of movie and too many of the comedic possibilities of an urban aesthete thrust into a life of bowling and beer drinking are missed.

Everybody has choices in life to make and we are not always sure where these choices will lead us. The Family Man shows us that whatever choice we make is the right one because ignorance is bliss. Groundhog Day and Mr. Destiny are both great movies but neither leaves you with the feeling of happiness and contentment that The Family Man does. Some people complain about the ending being left open but that is what makes this movie special. By leaving it open they are still telling you that anything is possible depending on the choices the characters make. Will they quit their jobs and give all of their money away? Not likely. Will their lives change dramatically? Surely.If you did not like this movie then you probably over examined its point. You can watch any movie and find inconsistencies but if that is how you watch movies then your life has to be excruciating. The acting was superb from the lead roles all the way to the bit parts like the secretary, Lassiter, Mintz, etc. In my opinion the movie was made by the few minutes we saw of Cheadle.

Notably It's A Wonderful Life, Trading Places, Groundhog Day, A Christmas Carol, Scrooged, and even Back To The Future at times.  I don't really have much respect for Nick Cage, especially after hearing rumors that he has issues with the Coen brothers after Raising Arizona.  I saw this movie out of obligation (don't ask), and went into it with a mind as open as possible.  This is one of those movies that is SO incredibly predictable that you are left feeling empty when it's over.  The screenwriter had an easy job because this stupid movie wrote itself.  Warning, possible spoiler up ahead.  For example, after one particular milestone is achieved by Cage's character, you begin wondering when Cage's daughter will accept him.  And lo and behold, that issue is resolved immediately.  There is no suspense in this movie, save for the ending which is drawn out unbearably despite the fact that we ALL know what's going to happen.  My friends and I came up with three possible conclusions to the movie fifteen minutes after it began.  And guess what?  One was correct, but all would have worked easily.  Basically, a total waste of time.  Go see the other six movies mentioned previously as they are all infinitely better.  Family Man felt like a studio attempt to revive a few old classics into one mega-movie, but it fell short TREMENDOUSLY.  Christmas movies tend to be corny and predictable, but at least those other movies were fresh ideas (at the time) and had good acting.  And one more thing, was this supposed to be a comedy?  Or a drama?  Or a romantic comedy?  Because frankly, it didn't fit into any of these categories.  I'm assuming it's a comedy......but I didn't laugh once.

And that's because he finds himself in a well-crafted film.I have nothing to say about the plot except to remark that its true purpose is to establish itself as a yearly income stream instead of the other seasonal offerings we've adopted as tradition. Its reason for being is therefore contrary to its stated moral, sullying the whole enterprise.Special notice should be taken of four participants.Tea Leone shows real acting talent here. She conveys multiple emotions in each face shot where Cage can put on only one. You'd think he'd insist on not being outshone. I hadn't noticed her before, but she impresses here. Much of the time is working on simple appeal, but there are complex moments.I recently saw `Proof of Life' which had an Elfman score that completely misunderstood the film. Here, he is a much better match. He works a lot with honks and squeeks which works well in this sort of moral comedy.The little girl has been coaxed into a few magic moments. One `I knew you'd come back,' is pure syrup, but two others are alone touching enough  Let's hope they don't haunt her.The writers have done a good job in hitting the marketing center, by rehashing Dickens and Capra with just a little `Groundhog' freshness. Just a little because this is the one job where too much freshness would be off-putting. The one `modern' touch is the alternative universe glimpse which thankfully isn't explained. (What happens to the children when this glimpse blinks out?)Bottom line this is a minor film. But it does not aspire to be a good film, only a competent entry in the commercial Christmas race. It does well at this, and one must admire the craft. Dickens was a crass commercialist after all and he had a big hand in inventing Christmas -- basing it on on lowbrow sentimentality.

I think he likes to take any old acting gig that comes along and so seeing him in another snore-fest is usually commonplace. This movie was a pleasant surprise however, as I found myself seeking it out after catching a glimpse on network television.It's certainly a warm and cozy movie mixed with light humor and cute quips. So pop some popcorn, cuddle with your dog, cat or significant other and flip on the boob-tube.Any guy who has worked in sales or finance can empathize with Jack (Cage) as we see him living the fast life only to find himself confused and striped of his status quo threads and toys. Cage plays a lovable- on-the-inside cold-hearted-on-the-outside investment broker for this role and does a bang up job unraveling into dad for his high school sweetheart (now his wife, Kate (Leoni)) and newfound kids. He learns of his new job as a tire sales men and can't believe his new status as Mr. Mom. He soon begins to strive for his old life back by interviewing at his old investment firm, trying to pump up the tire sales and convince his wife of the fast life. Jack then comes to realize (once and for all) that love trumps the superficial things. While one would think this movie to be corny, it actually plays out quite nicely, touching your heart strings like when Jack admits he's different then old daddy to the eldest daughter and then while (attempting) to make love to his new wife he finds himself falling asleep, like any hardworking husband would, right?

Ever since films like The Wicker Man and National Treasure, not to mention Ghost Rider, he has been seen as something of a joke as an actor by a lot of people. Most assume that he just can't hack it as a box office draw anymore and that becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy because they don't go and see his movies and the box office bombs. But he's had some great movies too, like Adaptation and Kick-Ass. One of my favourite movies of his to watch though is The Family Man. I make a point to watch it every Christmas. Of all the movies and TV that I watch and rewatch over the year, I save this one as part of a group I save for Christmas.Why? Because it's a great Christmas movie. Much like Scrooged and A Muppet's Christmas Carol which are also in the special Christmas group, it follows in the tradition of the Charles Dickens' classic of a man who seems to have everything and is given a glimpse at what he doesn't. But what sets this film apart and why it's on my list of once a year Christmas movies is that there is an element of It's A Wonderful Life to the film as well, brought to you by the semi-angelic character of Cash played by Don Cheadle. A simple act of kindness from Wall Street mogul Jack Campbell gives him the chance at a glimpse into what life would have been like if he had made different choices.And so he's thrust into a world he doesn't understand and a life he doesn't want, forced to figure out a life he doesn't really understand, he slowly starts to wonder if everything that's good in life can really be solved with money. Tea Leoni also stars as the one that got away turned wife and mother and proves why it's a shame that she isn't given the chance to really shine more often. Much like Meg Ryan she's been less visible in recent years. She makes being a wife and mother seem both realistic and sexy, something that's traditionally very hard to do in an industry that caters to the young and available.Where does The Family Man fit?

Some of the characters were not clearly introduced until the movie ended, leaving the audience ask, Is he a magician or a witch or an angel or what? There was not enough closure in the ending, neither making us, viewers, confused.I appreciate the musical scoring, but how I hoped the songs were in English so that the audience may be able to relate better, although I know that there is a reason for playing non-English songs. (I also like the fact that Nicolas Cage was singing. He's got a great voice.)The cinematography and the camera rolling was great after all. It's just the trimming of video clips that needs to be improved, since there were some scenes that can be considered dead air because there actually is no happening, and the succeeding clip could have been previewed on the time occupied by the dead scene.Lastly, I believe some people may think the scenes are corny because it's overly fictional by nature, but I believe it was an asset to the movie.

Our lives turn on the decisions we make every day. Most of those decisions are probably largely inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But then there are the big ones, the decisions that will shape your life, that will in effect determine who you are. What if you got a do-over on one of those big decisions? Or at least got a glimpse of what your life would have been had you zigged where once you zagged? Jack Campbell is about to get such a glimpse. He's an extremely successful Wall Street executive, a driven career man who thinks of money first, last and always. He's got it all. The swanky Manhattan penthouse, the Ferrari, the supermodel types crawling into his bed. Suffice to say Jack is not a family man. Then one foggy Christmas Eve it's not Santa who comes to say something to Jack but Cash. Who is Cash? Well, we're never entirely sure. An angel of some sort perhaps? Anyhow Cash asks Jack what he needs in life. Jack answers that he has everything he needs. Wrong answer. The next morning, Christmas morning, Jack wakes up in New Jersey. With a wife, two kids, a dog and a job as a tire salesman.Years earlier Jack had flown off to London for an internship which started him down the path to the gloriously wealthy life he now so thoroughly enjoyed. But by getting on that plane he had left his college sweetheart behind. He chose money, not love. Now all of a sudden he's living the life he would have had if he had gone for love all those many years ago. It's a life of dirty diapers, minivans and bowling. And it's a life Jack desperately wants to escape. But Cash isn't going to let him off the hook that easily. Jack has to learn something about life, about himself. Will he come to embrace his new life as the family man? And if he does, then what? Cash has told Jack this is just a glimpse. A glimpse is a fleeting, temporary thing.For director Brett Ratner this is not a typical film. Which is probably a good thing as typical Brett Ratner film is generally not meant as a compliment. He tugs on the heartstrings, obviously going for the It's a Wonderful Life vibe. The Family Man never comes close to packing the emotional wallop It's a Wonderful Life did but it is a reasonably enjoyable and entertaining film. Ratner walks a bit of a tightrope in not being overbearing with the money bad, love good stuff. The film doesn't pass judgment on Jack Campbell. The Jack who chose his career is not a bad man. He's just different. He had a good life either way. Feel-good holiday movie that this is obviously meant to be the audience is certainly pulling for him to choose the family life. But Jack was happy the way he was and there's really nothing wrong with that. Nicolas Cage does a commendable job in the starring role, smartly portraying the confusion of Jack when he is thrust into his personal bizarro world. Téa Leoni is very good as the once, and now again, love of Jack's life. We're left wishing we could see more of Don Cheadle as Cash. It's an intriguing performance, an intriguing character we never really know much of anything about. And a special mention for the wonderfully precocious Makenzie Vega who plays Jack's young daughter Annie. She's incredibly charming, often threatening to steal the show. The Family Man is a movie which has its flaws. It probably goes on for too long, starting to drag a bit as it heads towards its conclusion. And that conclusion is not particularly satisfying either. The ending isn't much of an ending at all. But it's a film which has its charms. You wouldn't call it wonderful but it's good enough to leave you satisfied.

And every time I wake up the next morning, no, not in a glimpse, but with a good feeling. It's like It's A Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol and When Harry Met Sally all rolled into one.The story is hugely entertaining, and Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni are doing an excellent job in their roles. It's also very heart-warming and perfect to watch in the run-up for Christmas, although it's probably perfectly watchable at any time of the year.But what, in my view, sets this film apart from others in this genre, is the fact that it can actually bee seen as plausible. One can easily think of the glimpse as a simple (albeit rather long) dream of what could have been. So, if you look at it this way, it will make the whole story totally believable and realistic, as it can all be explained without any magic.For those, however, who prefer it to be magical, they can take the glimpse as what it is presented as in the movie, a several-month long, temporary excursion into another life of Jack Campbell. Either way, it totally works, and I cannot think of anyone watching the film who will not reconsider their own values in life and perhaps make some changes, even if they may seem insignificant ones (just trying to take work that little bit less seriously and devoting that little bit more time to the family will go a long way).When I saw it for the first time, I kind of expected an ending where Jack would, after realising what he had been missing out on in the past 13 years, wake up again in the New Jersey house, surrounded by his wife Kate and the two children, essentially changing 13 years of his past. It's what probably most other directors would have done with the story. Thankfully, however, Brett Ratner resisted the temptation, and I'm grateful for that!I think this is the biggest of many things that really make the movie work and make it relevant. Not only does it teach us important values in life, but it also shows that however much we would wish to, we cannot go back in time and take another path at a juncture in life where we feel that we made the wrong decision. What's past is past, but it's never too late to change your ways.So Jack may not live in that suburban house with two kids that he had grown to love in his glimpse (or dream?), but he can make himself a better person by putting the important things in life first and start anew together with Kate. He can't re-capture what he had lost (or more accurately, never had), but he can do something about the future. And so can we.And that's probably the thing I like best about this movie.

What party A does can affect the lives the parties B, C, D, E, etc. Life is a crap shoot; there's no saying how the dice will roll. It's like a roulette wheel that never stops spinning. That is the theme of this movie. The main character makes a decision that places his life on a certain path. Yet if he had made a different decision, his life would have been completely changed. It's a heavy theme which receives credible treatment in this movie. Nicholas Cage and Tea Leone are excellent as the main characters.

The film ends in a way that does not really satisfy and in a way that doesn't completely make sense. The trouble was, by the time we get to the end, there really was no way to make an ending that would satisfy 100%. As a result, the filmmakers had to end in a way that would make sense and give us a small sense of hope that the main characters end up living happily ever after.

Once this happens, the movie become a little bit campy and very predictable. It is easy to predict that he will hate his new life at first but eventually get used to it and change into a less self-centered person. Anyone with half a brain can figure out that Jack's family life will be a dream and Jack will wake up a changed man. Also, a lot of the scenes with Cash (Don Cheadle) are somewhat campy and do very little for the movie as a whole.Despite all this, the movie is still very entertaining and funny. There are a lot of funny moments when Jack first realizes that his new life, responsibilities and budget are much different than his old one. He begins to realize that it may not be as lucrative but is definitely more rewarding.While The Family Man may not be the best or most original movie you'll ever see, it is a very uplifting film with a good message about the importance of family.

So check it out if you either haven't seen Tea Leoni act or you are a vivid Nicolas Cage fan because that's the only two parts that will give you interests. Perhaps you have older kids in your house. Show them this piece of film. They might appreciate more things around them though. I might suggest this for people 8 or older because this is a PG-13 film.

To market the oft-made point that true happiness can only be found between a man, a woman and their two beaming children? Or was it actual regret on the filmmakers' parts, an honest longing for roads not taken?Well, since Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni have not, to my knowledge, given up on their money and fame and moved to Poughkeepsie, I'm going to argue that the truth lies somewhere between the first three choices.In The Family Man, a Magic Black Person (see The Legend of Bagger Vance for another example of this cliche in action) grants Nicolas Cage's wealthy broker a glimpse of the domesticated life he'd have had if he'd pursued his relationship with his college girlfriend.There are a several problems with this premise. First, Cage's initial character isn't, as one might expect, particularly unhappy or disliked. Although he does make his underlings work on Christmas Eve, he still appears genuinely respected at work. He seems to truly enjoy the material and carnal fruits of his high-powered career. He's not even a jerk.Second, the alternate existence presented isn't all that appealing. Cage, quite understandably, doesn't take well to the world of mortgages and poopy diapers. His newfound career in auto parts is precisely the sort of dead-end job that other movie Everymen would be desperate to leave. That he ultimately comes to prefer it has more to do with the pathological need to demonstrate that white-bread family life is inevitably superior than to the actual merits of that life as depicted in this film. (Granted, being married to the always appealing Leoni would be a strong incentive. However, most of us real-life family men are *not* married to Tea Leoni.)Third, the film is built on a false, either-or premise. Cage can have a rewarding career *or* a family, not both. When the opportunity to rejoin his old firm arises, Leoni promptly shoots down the possibility because she doesn't want to raise kids in the city. Tea may be sexier than any family man deserves, but she's clearly holding him back. A more honest, interesting film might have followed Cage's efforts to merge his two worlds.Finally (and this is a spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you don't want to know the ending), the life Cage briefly experiences is a lie. Choosing family over career, as the feel-good morality of The Family Man demands, doesn't result in Cage magically assuming this new reality. The best he can hope for is the chance to reconnect with Leoni's character as she is in the present a hardened business type like himself. The kids he came to love never existed, and will never exist. He may find happiness with Leoni, but won't he always long for a life that never was? If so, then what is the lesson to be learned?The Family Man is predictable schmaltz for those living lives of quiet desperation, lying to themselves that their own road not taken must be worse than the one that they chose.

For the most part, this movie is charming and amusing in equal measures.

There's also a funny moment when his daughter thinks her daddy has been abducted by aliens and he's a new Jack!

So I expected to like this movie, sentimental feel-good squishiness and all.But I didn't. The cast is very good, so I can't fault them. The problem is the material. You'll laugh, you'll cry, the old cliche says, and yeah, frankly, that's what I expect from a movie like this. But there weren't that many laughs, and the movie tried to be sentimental, but it's so utterly predictable that I never got choked up, not even a little bit.Part of the problem, I think, is that Cage's life-that-might-have-been is really pretty good a gorgeous wife who adores him; two healthy, happy, attractive kids; decent, supportive friends; and a job that allows him to own a good-sized home. His real life is obviously cold and empty, lacking real human contact, even if he has more money and power. So I had a hard time sympathizing with his attempts to recapture his real life while living his almost-life. Furthermore, this set-up telegraphed the ending so clearly that even a predictable movie like this became overly so.A few years ago, I saw Violets are Blue, in which Kevin Kline's character faced a choice between the life he had and the life that might have been (but still could be), represented by his wife and his former girlfriend, respectively. It wasn't the greatest movie either, but at least his character faced a wrenching choice. There's some satisfaction in even the most sentimental of movies from seeing a character struggle with a choice like that--we know what the right choice is, but will the protagonist realize it in time? What little suspense a formulaic romance has comes from that dilemma. But Cage's choice is obvious, so there's no suspense at all. And very little reason to watch this film.

I won't give the reason he's trying to do this, but it's ironic to say the least.I think dads like myself will appreciate this film the most. After all, we all chose to give up our wild, swinging single life in exchange for something else. We chose to give up the shorter term pleasures, which Cage has in abundance as a single man, for the longer term, less physical but more spiritual pleasures, that Cage comes to realize he can never have as a single man.

This movie stood  up well to the best in its genre, including It's A Wonderful Life, Groundhog Day and A Christmas Carol. The performances were mature, the humor mixed with drama in a way that felt real, and the script well done. The closing scene was powerful -- as the Cage character tries to salvage the family vision that he had come to value beyond all material success. The only downside of the film, if it is a downside, is that, in typical Hollywood style these days, it sells the false notion that we can have it all. Cage and his soon to be wife are both wealthy, successful and in the end happy because they find each other. He might have chosen the tire store and suburbia, but in the end he gets the wealth and the girl, which is the twist on It's a Wonderful Life, I suppose.

Her performance is fairly solid, and I must give her points for doing a nude shower scene through opaque glass (which you can still see her best talents).Anyway, I'm rambling. ASide from Tea Leoni's breasts (and just the presence of such a fine looking woman), The Family Man is a family/ comedy/fantasy that works based more or less on grace and charm, primarily of its leading man, Nicolas Cage.The story follows taht of a man who left the country for an internship, leaving his girlfriend in wait behind - only he never returns, and becomes the president of some big shot company. By a simple twist of fate, he is given a glimpse, a quick second chance at a missed opportunity - by waking up one day, lying in bed next to his old girflriend/now wife, and discovers that in this alternate reality, he dropped his internship, married Tea Leoni and settled down with a couple of kids. He's given a second chance to fulfil his life.It's basically a sappy rip off of such classic films as It's A Wonderful Life, but, even at two hours, it works. Not a great film by any  means, but it coats a long way on charm, just not quite two hours worth. Cage is fine as the elading man who wins the audience over with his fish out of water antics, even though it's a schtick we've seen from countless actors over the years in similar situations. The film is relatively predictable, but if you go into thinking that way, then you'll be able to enjoy it, rather than picking it apart. It is, in many ways, a very forgettable film, because it's basic premise has been done to death, but the old formula breathes new life because it works in the capable hands of Cage, Leoni, a solid supporting cast, and even paced direction.I've heard people complaining that this film can't decide whether it wants to be taken seriously, or just funny - well guess what? It wants both because it's a dramatic comedy. In typical, Hollywood fashion, Cage is sent through the ringer in a number of routine fish out of water antics, right down to having to change a baby's diaper. But, like I've said, regardless of how many times we've seen it, it's charming and it works.Don't expect an Pscar worthy film, because fluff doens't win Oscars, even if it wins box office.

I have to watch it again but I think she nailed, precisely and exactly, every moment in the movie.  Any power the film has, any emotion and feeling, has its roots in her performance.  There were moments in the film where her eyes and face seemed to carry quiet tonnage and there were ponderous moments in the film where she seemed to bear the weight of the moment on a whispy, fragile expression, like deflecting an incoming asteroid with a puff of breath.  Low key is the popular phrase but here, Tea Leoni practices it as art, art with enormous but quiet energy.  She plays two people, the one that could have been and the one that was and their distinction is oh so subtle but oh so exact.  Every thing about this film that works has its roots in her performance.  She is the backboard Nicholas Cage continuously bounces his character against, the story tosses itself against.  Whatever heart this movie has, its roots are in Tea Leoni's quiet, subtle yet exactly nailed expressions, eye flickers and timing. She was the movie's heart and soul so we could learn Jack's (Mr. Cage's character) story. The movie is okay, nice viewing for an easy evening that isn't expecting a lot.  But try to take the time to watch Tea Leoni do this ... wow!

Then something happens; on Christmas Eve, Jack does a good turn to the right person at the right time.  His name is Cash (Don Cheadle), and he just happens to be a guy with, well, connections.  And the next thing Jack knows, he's getting a `glimpse' of what his life would have been had he made a different choice all those many years ago.  When he wakes up on Christmas morning, he's not in his bed in his penthouse apartment, but in a house in the suburbs, sleeping next to Kate Reynolds (Tea Leoni), the woman he once loved, but abandoned.  Wall Street is history; he's now a crackerjack tire salesman at `Big Ed's,' and he and Kate have two kids, Annie (Makenzie Vega) and Josh (Jake and Ryan Milkovich).  	Needless to say, Jack is confused; and the enigmatic Cash isn't about to let him in on what's going on-- that's for Jack to figure out on his own.  So Jack has no choice but to go on living his life-- even if it's not really `his' life.  And it becomes a journey of discovery; not only for Jack, but for the audience, as well.  And what follows may be fantasy, but it's fantasy with a message, from some filmmakers who aren't afraid to tell it like it is, and they do it well.	What director Roth presents you with is an examination of what life is really all about, and what-- in the final analysis-- is really important.  And make no mistake, this isn't a film that aims for the head, it aims for the heart, scores a bullseye and doesn't apologize for it.  Is it pure, true, realistic, riveting drama?  Of course not, and it never pretends to be.  What it is, is a film that stays true to what it's all about and says some things that need to be said in this fast-food, cybersaturated world of the here and now.  It's a poignant, well made and well acted film that appeals to the universal sensibilities that in one way or another reside within even the most jaded, modernized and `New Aged' individuals.  Because it's an entreaty to the most basic of human needs and concerns.	Cage was the perfect choice to play Jack; he's got a natural, sympathetic look that makes him easy to like, and combined with the emotional aspect he brings to the character it makes Jack someone to whom it is so easy to relate.  it's a performance that allows you to feel something; and that's really what this movie is all about, capturing that sense of humanity that is so often lacking in people's lives today.  Cage makes it work, and he makes it work beautifully, because he lets you share Jack's frustration, his loss, his fears and, most importantly, the hope and the love he ultimately realizes has been missing in his life.  It's a challenging role that Cage not only met, but surpassed with just the kind of exacting performance that was needed to put this story across.	Tea Leoni gives an excellent performance, as well, as Kate.  It's a sensitive, sympathetic portrayal that serves the character and the story with great effectiveness.  Leoni makes something special out of a character that could've been just the `female lead,' with the purpose of being nothing more than the means of moving the story of Jack's self-discovery along.  Instead, she makes it her story as much as his by making Kate an endearing, truly integral part of the film, and she fairly sparkles on the screen. 	The supporting cast includes Jeremy Piven (Arnie), Saul Rubinek (Alan), Josef Sommer (Peter), Lisa Thornhill (Evelyn), Harve Presnell (Big Ed), Mary Beth Hurt (Adelle) and Francine York (Lorraine).  There's no doubt that personal experience and frame of reference is going to play a big part in the way `The Family Man' is received by the audience.  But Ratner, Cage, Leoni and everyone else connected with this project are to be commended for making an honest, heart-felt film with an important message about life in today's world.  It's a film that says success isn't just being the guy at the top of the heap, that it's okay to just `be' whomever or whatever you are, as long as it's what makes you happy and content.  It's a bold statement for a filmmaker to make today, and we can only hope that more artists will have the guts to make more movies like this in the future.  I rate this one 10/10.

It is beautifully written and directed.  It is an utterly satisfying treatment of parallel universes, parallel realities, time travel, what-if's, parenthood, marriage, wealth, life paths, love, everything.  The humor is unique.

I've seen the movie four times, once alone in the theatre, once alone in a hotel, once with some of my kids' friends (late teens)& finally, after much bartering, with my husband, actor Eric Roberts.

It was a nice variation of the what if... genre where Belushi's Larry is a middle-class guy living the Donald Trump life and all the craziness that goes with it.Ironically, Family Man starts off similarly to Destiny, the *event* in each character's life that changed their future forever.  It is 1987, and Nic Cage plays Jack Campbell, who has an enormous opportunity of a lifetime if he steps on a plane bound for London rather than stay and resume his relationship with his beautiful college sweetheart, Kate (appealingly played by Tea Leoni).  Jack takes the road less travelled and boards the plane.Thirteen years pass, and we see that Kate is no longer with Jack.  In fact, he has obviously succeeded immensely in the business world and can pick any beautiful woman that he wants.  Jack has all the material things any person desires *lots* of money, expensively tailored clothes, a huge penthouse with a Park Avenue view, a fast Italian sports car and people who both envy and follow him. Jack is a nice enough guy.  There is nothing inherently *bad* about him, but he is thoroughly obsessed with work.  He has his staff coming in on Christmas Eve rather than have the day off because of a billion-dollar merger happening the day after Christmas that Jack orchestrated.  Yet, he gets a curious telephone message from Kate, whom Jack never saw again after he boarded that plane in 1987.Though nostalgic about a past love, he doesn't call her back and decides to go about his life.  Later that night, he has a chance meeting in a convenience store with a man waving a gun.  Jack could have just let the events unfold in front of him, but he takes a risk and confronts the man, whom we later find out is named Cash (played by the underused Don Cheadle).  Jack even tries to help him by suggesting counseling or help groups, which makes Cash laugh, but Jack's kindness impresses him nevertheless.  Little do we know that Cash is going to do Jack a favor.Jack goes to bed that night none the wiser only to wake up the next morning in a different bed with Kate, his old college sweetheart, laying on him.  Now, Jack finds out how the other half lives and literally is lost and confused for a time.  Yet, even though he seems to be lost in suburbia hell, a subtle transformation takes place within Jack.  The cold, heartless overachiever that made Jack succeed so well in business becomes a loving, caring husband and father.  Though some of the movie appears hokey and somewhat contrived, the story never veers away from the concept of love and family.  True, Jack does not get to spend money on $2400 suits and expensive wines and dinners, but beyond all that, he realizes that he never truly got over Kate.  Even though it's been 13 years, he sees that she has blossomed into a truly beautiful woman that his friend, Arnie, says any man would give up his left nut to be with.  There are many funny moments of pure suburbia living that most people will identify with.  We see glimpses of what family man Jack, a good husband and father, was like through his friends and the birthday video where he sings to Kate that business man Jack sees and even cries over. I was impressed that Kate was willing to give up the life she had to let Jack pursue his dream of being a business success.  She truly loved him enough to allow something as that life-changing.  Realizing her feelings for him, Jack felt more lost without her when he was unceremoniously returned back to his real life.  Like Belushi's Larry in Mr. Destiny, Jack sees that his life is not truly complete unless he has someone special to share it with.I found myself smitten with the performances of most of the cast, particularly Cage and Leoni.  They have a dynamite chemistry that makes the story believable.  I have never been a big fan of Leoni, but her portrayal of Kate as a charming, sexy, loving, loyal and supportive wife makes her extremely appealing in this movie.  It's not difficult to see why Jack never got over his love for her after all those years.  The ending, appropriately at an airport, was very sweet and realistic.  We can only imagine what Kate thought about Jack's re-cap of the lives they never had.  Yet, it was enough to get her attention.  That last scene with them having coffee in an airport lounge with snow falling outside was just perfect.  Though I wish there wouldn't have been the predictablity of Jack's alternate life ending, he was brave enough to risk his career to get that small chance to have a life with Kate. This is a great feel-good movie not to be missed!

We are then brought to the future where Jack is the President of a powerful investment house and Kate is a lawyer doing well on her own. The reason I think of scrooge is that Jack has no concept of family, only of work, he makes his staff come in on Christmas and makes them work Christmas eve. Well it just so happens that on Christmas Eve he meets what one might assume is 'an angel' we don't actually know who he is, and the next morning Jack wakes up in the life he would have had if he hadn't gone to London.This was my favorite part, as it shows that love can be more valuable than money and real success comes at home, from your family, not from your job and position.Yes it is a feel good movie, and I guess that is why I liked it, it really made me feel good.

He plays a guy who left his girlfriend from college and went off to school in Europe, a choice which led him to a high-level job, a Ferrari, and an apartment in a high-rise building in New York. Along comes, I don't know, The Ghost of Relationships Past, who gives him a glimpse of what his life would have been like had he not ended his relationship with his girlfriend (the stunningly beautiful Tea Leoni, in an excellent performance) at the airport that day. Sound familiar? Well, I don't think there was much effort put into hiding the similarities to the old Christmas Story, which is one of the things that really brought the movie down, despite the fact that it took place during Christmas-time. Who was this guy? He turned out to be some sort of angel or something who went around testing the quality of people's characters and &#145;rewarding' them if they turned out to be of good character, or some such nonsense. Jack Campbell (Cage) bribes a would-be robber (Cheadle, the angel, who is curiously named `Cash') out of forcing a cashier to cash a suspicious lottery ticket, and bingo, he gets a prize that turns out to be a `glimpse' at What Would Have Been. A liquor store cashier (Cheadle again) mistakenly rings up $10 when a young girl really only paid with $1, she doesn't say anything and walks out of the store wide-eyed, and bingo, he disgustedly pays back the difference out of his pocket, and no prize for her. This part of the story is never explained very well, and this guy pops up in some strange places without any explanation. The rest of the movie was actually pretty good. When Campbell gets a look at what he could have had, his initial fear and dislike is eventually eroded away as he begins to like what life is like when he has someone who he loves and who loves him. The most entertaining part of the movie comes from watching him, first of all, doing what he does as the arrogant rich business executive, and most of all, watching him try to get used to the fact that his entire life has been changed, albeit temporarily, literally overnight. Nicholas Cage's charm really comes through in some great scenes as he adapts to the middle class life, as opposed to the upper upper class life, such as when he's going through his poor self's closet to find a jacket (`Oh, this is just sub-par.'). That's some funny stuff.As far as the romance goes, yeah it's pretty prevalent, especially in the second half of the film, but for the most part it's not too exaggerated, and when you see what goes on between Campbell and his wife, Kate (Leoni) it's not too hard to see why he began to have conflictions about going back to his old life, full of money and empty sex. Don't be put off just because Nicholas Cage is in The Family Man and he always gets a little awkward in romantic roles, because this is definitely one of his better ones.

Nicholas Cage says farewell to Tea Leoni at the airport for what is meant to be a year's separation while they both further their careers. He resists her last minute attempt to persuade him to throw out the game-plan and stay. Instead of getting back together, he goes on to become a big-shot on Wall Street. Later, he is given a glimpse of how life could have been if he had married Tea Leoni's character, had kids and lived within very modest means. At first resisting strongly what he perceives as a no-hope situation, he eventually learns to love it. The predictable ending is saved by a few minor twists but basically this is a straightforward tear-jerker. Although it's been done better before, that's no reason not to enjoy it now. The most difficult thing (for me) to believe was why the character played by the beautiful and relatively unknown Tea Leoni is so incredibly in love with Nicholas Cage. He comes across as passable at best, looks many years older (even though they were supposed to be at college together and the two actors are of similar age) and only just about makes the grade (after a long struggle) on admirable qualities. Tea Leoni's character, on the other hand, is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has the emotional qualities and personality that would make almost any man want to marry her. He looks worn and haggard in the film except when he's being a big shot, whereas she looks young and sparkling (and I can't wait for her next movie!).

This was chiefly because I was able to sympathize with both lives that Nicholas Cage's character leads during the course of the film, and there were also ample scenes that had me laughing out loud, though they dwindled towards the end of the film, as the truly corny scenes took over and dominated.Overall, good Cage, light-hearted scenes and tolerable script make The Family Man a perfectly reasonable movie selection but with films like Traffic out there this might be best to wait for the video.

But on Christmas Eve he intervenes in a drug store robbery and his whole world is turned upside down. He wakes on Christmas morning to married life. He is married to his college sweatheart Kate (Tea Leoni), has two kids, a dog and works for his father in law as a tire salesman. Cage spends the rest of the film trying to figure out what's going on and why he's in this new life. Don Cheadle comes in and out as some sort of guide who gives Cage subtle hints on what's going on. Jeremy Piven plays Cage's family man's best friend. This movie is one of those rarely seen but very popular and profitable comedic drama. That's a film with laugh out loud moments  but it's heart is a drama. This film's based on performances and if they are believable or not. Cage is great as Jack Campbell, he does the patented Cage with some crazy singing and wild outbreaks. Tea Leoni pulls her weight and she has some very funny moments. She also does a good Meg Ryan impersonation with a lot of crying and touching scenes. Jeremy Piven is hilarious as the comic relief. Don Cheadle has a small part but it's effective with his talent. The films runs over two hours but it moves fast with the long drawn out scenes and much character driven dialogue.

It IS pleasant and graceful and all of that-- notice I avoided the word cute-- but it is also a dramatic comment on how many of us lead our lives. It's all about choice, and the courage necessary to recognize ourselves for who we are. That is, it's about us facing the cold hard truth about what we have chosen to be. Most of us have chosen some version of a dissociated, emotionally safe life. We live mostly as cliches of ourselves.The Family Man deftly and deeply explores that, and what it would take to re-do the whole thing. I found it inspiring as well as entertaining. I suspect there will be some Scrooges and Grinches out there, who pooh-pooh it as sentiment or treacley veneer. Since it's the Christmas season-- weep for those poor unfortunates, and be thankful that we, at least, can enjoy being fully alive, imperfections and all.Movies about love are hard to make. Movies that hit the right spot heart-wise often scare and annoy the plastic-fingered modern sophisticates who then denounce it all. I say The Family Man hits just the right love button.

So instead of being all out hilarious, like Groundhog Day, we get intermittent amusing scenes of Jack Campbell(Nic Cage) trying to fit in his new life.  And it doesn't go deep enough to have a profound impact.  (Cheap shot here), so WHAT IF the film just make up its mind what it wants to be......The movie felt long because it takes forever for Jack to come to grips with his new life.  The direction is meandering.  For example, the chocolate cake scene is nicely shot, but goes nowhere and adds nothing.  His best buddy disappeared after the first hour.  Also, the movie is forcing us to choose a dichotomy of Jack's real and virtual life.Performance wise, I would like to see the versatile Don Cheadle and Tea Leoni have more to do here.  Tea was only asked to look dazzled and dazzling, which she accomplished easily.  How about making her character funnier or angrier?  How about making Don's guardian angel more mischievous? Cage's performance here is tiring (he seems to be recycling past roles) a nd bland.  I think he was more poignant in Face/Off, an action movie no less.Lastly, the similarity of plot between The Family Man and Me Myself & I, is this Coincidental Millenial Angst or just Hollywood Synergy at work?

Nick Cage plays a high-powered investment broker who, on Christmas Eve, tries to help out who he perceives to be a guy who's down on his luck. The next morning, Cage wakes up to find himself leading a different life -- that of a tire salesman in suburban New Jersey.The story is not entirely new; as I said, it smacks a great deal of It's a Wonderful Life -- ultimately, the central character has to figure out what is missing in his real life. Along the way, he examines his values and his high-paced lifestyle and compares them against the well-worn comfort of married life. What he ends up discovering about himself surprises him.Nick Cage does best in movies where he can show off both his sensitive and his stylish sides -- the movie I best loved him in was Moonstruck, which nicely showed off both. He has been hurting for a good role since City of Angels after a string of lackluster films like 8mm and Bringing Out the Dead.  He has even crafted a niche for himself as a fine action star (Con*Air, Face/Off) and continues to be a fairly reliable box office draw. Sure, he's not Tom Hanks, but he's definitely, IMHO, one of the top male actors of his age range. This movie is a nice vehicle for his talents, and as always, a solid performance.On the other hand, Téa Leoni does not work nearly enough; I would enjoy seeing her in more feature work or even back on TV regularly. Her acting has a very solid feel to it. She did a great job in this movie as the wife who cannot figure out why her husband is suddenly acting so beserk.The Family Man is a feel-good movie and probably one of the better films I've seen in 2000 -- not that this year's movies have been anything outstanding.

This is the holiday `feel-good' picture you've been looking for, and generally speaking, I keep Date Movies at the bottom of my recommendation list as filler.  This one soars.I wanted to write `Cage and Leoni sizzle on screen' after leaving the theater.  In the 1946 vernacular of Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed, that's exactly what they did.  Sizzle has come to mean something very different to audiences in the modern Hollywood vernacular.  I will instead tell you this film is loaded-to-the-gills with charm.  `Sizzles with charm' is the best way to put it.It opens with a classic lovers' struggle.  Jack (Cage) wants to launch his career in London, while Kate (Leoni) begs him to stay for what seem to be all the right reasons.   He delivers an unforgettable response (no spoilers here).  They seem right for each other.  I hoped he didn't get on the plane. But then we'd have only a 7 minute movie ...now wouldn't we?The story Jack Campbell, a Wall Street playboy who has everything he could ever want 13 years after the airport scene.  He unwittingly mediates a convenience store holdup and disarms a potentially fatal situation. Magic sprinkled here  The next morning he wakes up in a suburban New Jersey bedroom beside Kate, the gal he abandoned in the airport 13 years earlier, his college sweetheart.  Adapting to instant family life (complete with two kids and dirty diapers) is laugh-out-loud funny, which I haven't done since My Cousin Vinny.  Even the kids - normally a casting nightmare - are charming.Magic is sprinkled throughout to propel the story.  The tinkling angel's bell is missing, but the camera's angle on the falling snow delivers a 21st century impact that transports better still in the 21st century.Flaws?  Sure a few for the most picayune viewer.  Don Cheadle (who plays his role to perfection!) advances the story, but his character seems unresolved.  No matter.  As a picky viewer myself, that it didn't bother me is the sign of a story well told.  The chemistry is works so well between everyone on screen - dwelling on something so small would construe unnecessary whining, punishable by a week in the critic's penalty box.Kudos roll to every co-star, to Brett Ratner (director), Matthew Barry and Nancy Green-Keyes (casting) who found the right players, and especially to Mark Helfrich (editor) who kept the right pieces of film off the cutting room floor.  Casting is an underrated art.Cage was good in Moonstruck, but he is better in this.  Leoni was good in Flirting with Disaster; she is better in this.  I'll say it again  This picture is chock full of charm!  See it with someone you love, and appreciate those around you more a little bit more afterward.  One for your `Must See' list.

Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni had amazing chemistry on the screen. Their emotions seemed genuine, and very believable. I think this is one of Tea Leoni's best roles. I've always admired her acting, but some of the productions she'd been involved with in the past didn't show her talent and emotional range as this movie was able to. The little actress who portrayed the Campbell's daughter Annie(I think her name is Mackenzie Vega) was an awesome casting choice...some of the best moments in the film are her interactions with Nicholas Cage. Her character is precocious, but not obnoxious. Who would have thought that the director of Rush Hour could direct a movie like this?

A rich businessman who practically lives in his office, has the biggest apartment in the most expensive building, closes million dollar deals for breakfast and beds lingerie models as often as he can. He has it all but a simple good deed done late on Christmas Eve to stop a black man robbing a convenience store sees his life change dramatically. He wakes up the next morning in bed with the girlfriend he left 15 years ago to pursue his career. His kids break into the room with the dog, excited about Christmas and all Jack can think is this is not my beautiful woman. He heads back to his old apartment but nobody knows him and the only person that acknowledges him as Jack Campbell is Cash, the guy he dealt with the night before. Cash tells him that he is on his own and has to work out what he has to learn from this glimmer of a different life.In the first bit of this movie I was actually quite enjoying myself as we build up Jack's high power life and then see it pulled from under his feet. However as we move away from this moment, the film gradually slumps down into a family over money piece of mush that cannot even convince itself of what it is saying. Jack's fall and his upper class revulsion at the life and the wardrobe of the lower-middle classes is quite funny but the film can't spend too long on this or else it risks the audience laughing at the cheap things that we are eventually going to be asked to embrace in favour of money and career. The film then provides semi fish out of water amusement as Jack struggles to fit into his life but really we're heading straight for a sentimental life lesson. In this regard it is so syrupy that I was worried that I would develop diabetes as a result of spending two hours with it. The conclusion is as cloying as you fear it will be and, giving that it doesn't have the lack of money as a worry, more or less makes a nonsense of the family or money theme by letting our characters get away with money and a shot at happiness &#150; which is fine but why did it go so anti-career for so long.The cast try hard to lift it into something touching and engaging but they can't manage it. Cage does well early on but he struggles to stay afloat in the mush. He knows what he is supposed to do but the nature and situation of his character damages his performance &#150; for example he occasionally has a really good chemistry with Leoni but mostly he can't because in the story he is supposed to fear this life and not know her. Leoni is better because she fits into this world; she is not a great actress but she was always good in this sort of light fare and I quite liked her domestic role. Cheadle is given rubbish to work with and produces rubbish; I hope he got well paid for adding his name and reputation to this film because he got nothing out of it other than that. Piven, Rubinek, Presnell and a few others add faces and names to the film but they are all minor characters.Overall this is a sentimental mushy film that, although a little entertaining and distracting, is really only ever going one place. When it gets there, it delivers a corny and unconvincing finale and bails out on the option that would have had the biggest emotional impact and been fair to the audience (Jack grimly accepts his glimmer and his loss but moves on with his current life but as a changed man) because the studio believe that only the happiest possible ending will do. They (and their test audiences) were wrong because it is cloying and sickly and it creates a black hole that sucks the hour leading up to it slowly but surely into the mushy mire with it. Polished and distracting but sadly also sickly sentimental and unconvincing.

Never mind that he doesn't like his job in this life and isn't crazy about the neighborhood, all you need is marriage and babies. Very predictably, he decides he loves his new life and doesn't want to go back, but of course he has to. Then he decides everything he spent his entire life working for means nothing without marriage and babies, and runs away to find his old girlfriend. She is also single and successful, and for some inexplicable reason decides that she too is unfulfilled and needs marriage and 2.5 kids.In short, this movie sends the message that you need marriage and kids to be happy, and no matter how fulfilled you are in your career, it will never truly be enough.

However I was caught with the unavoidable truth, this was a marriage and quasi religious propaganda movie.Also the little circumcised (why was that) penis of Joshua added to it terrible American and religiously conforming propagandistic view.Please Nick Cage and in fact, probably all the cast could have done so much better.

It's extremely well made and written, and I think this is one of Nicolas Cage's best films, plus the ending will make you think. I will admit it did have me almost crying on several occasions,because sentimental movies tend to get to me like that, and I thought the changes that Cage's character made were just perfect, plus Don Cheadle has a small but pretty cool role here as well. This should be a lot higher then 6.5 in my opinion, and It's the perfect Family film as well, plus all the characters are extremely likable.However if your not into this mushy kind of stuff, you probably won't like this one either, but if you are(like me) I'm positive you will love it, plus It's also a brilliant fantasy film as well. I was expecting this to be a good but not a great film, however it turned out to be much more then that, and Makenzie Vega is surprisingly very likable and cute as the young daughter, plus I loved the script in this one as well!. One of the biggest reasons this film works so well though is the relationship between Cage and Leoni, and while I didn't think much of Leoni before because I hadn't really seen her in anything, I am now a huge fan of her's due to her amazing performance in this film, plus Cage managed to crack me up several times throughout the film. The story may seem really far fetched, but just go along with it, and I thought it was so cute how Annie (the daughter) thinks her dad was abducted by aliens, plus it has plenty of surprises throughout. This is an absolutely wonderful film, that's really heartwarming, and often hilarious, with some fantastic sentimental moments, and amazing performances, and if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is outstanding!. Brett Ratner does an outstanding! job here with fantastic camera work, wonderful angles and just keeping the film imaginative and at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is truly amazing!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious, had brilliant chemistry with Tea Leoni, did a perfect job with his character changes, and you will actually feel sorry for him for a bit, because it was all happening so fast, this is one of his finest performances in my opinion, as he showed his awesome range here! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!). Téa Leoni is gorgeous, and is amazing here as Jack's(Cage) wife, she was extremely likable, wonderfully energetic and perky, had an awesome character, and had so many wonderful and memorable scenes with Cage, I will now be checking out more of her work, as she impressed me so much here! (Tea Rules!!!!). Don Cheadle is funny in his small role, and seemed to be having a fun time doing it, I dug him. Jeremy Piven is pretty good as the best friend I liked him.

This movie is about how lonely and void your life will be if you are single and successful and living in New York City, and how wonderful it is to get your girlfriend pregnant, marry her and sell tires in New Jersey. This movie has everything I want in a movie The racist Asian shop-keeper; The poor black street thug that is wise and spiritual; The hot blue-collar wife; the cute small child that says wise things beyond her years, as if she's reading a script. WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! This movie is about a guy named Jack who is rich, single and successful who incorrectly thinks he's happy. But a magical creature in the guise of an armed thug forces Jack to live the life he would have had if he had knocked up his high-school girlfriend, got married, had another kid and worked a dead-end job in Jersey. Well Jack finds out quickly that he really was happy in his New York life, because this new life sucks. There is nothing I love more than a fish-out-of-water movie. Jack doesn't know where he is! Who is this woman sleeping next to him? Who are these kids? This dog? These losers are my friends? Luckily Jack has a guide, his precocious five year old child played by the adorable Makenzie Vega. This kid is so cute, she pronounces her r like a w. There is nothing cuter than a child with a speech impediment. It get's less cute when they turn 15. Well not only can this child see dead people, but she knows that Jack is not her real dad, and plans to help him until her real dad is returned by the aliens that took him. Except for the hot and horny wife, this new life sucks. Crappy job, stupid friends and in debt up to his eyeballs. The only thing that seems to get him through is scotch whiskey. But like all humans, he can either adapt or commit suicide. And what do you know, he begins to find beauty in his middle-class, blue-collar life in Jersey. He re-falls in love with his girlfriend/wife and grows to love his daughter and mildly retarded baby son. Just as he's getting comfortable with his new life, his boss from his previous life blows a tire right in front of the tire store where Jack works. His boss doesn't know who he is, because it's as if that life never existed(just like 'It's A Wonderful Life'). But Jack hasn't forgotten any of his corporate skills and is given a chance to get his old job back. Now he can have the awesome job, penthouse in New York City AND keep his family. But his wife will have nothing to do with it. Her reasoning? Their five year old is happy in the New Jersey public school system and like most five year old children, has developed strong, life-long bonds with her teachers and friends. A change in schools at age five may leave damaging psychological scars that will never heal. Plus, the wife wants to grow old in the house in Jersey. Jack drops the idea and settles in to his new wonderful life. Just as he becomes happy with his new wonderful life, the magical black guy puts him back into his old life. Now he hates his real life and misses the fantasy life that never existed. Sorry Jack, the kids you grew attached to were never real. So Jack voluntarily gives up his high-paying corporate job, finds his old girlfriend and convinces her not to take a job in Paris but start a new life with him, even though he's going to be unemployed very soon. This movie really makes you think. Here are a few things it made me think 1. I wonder how many Hollywood people involved in making this movie gave up there high-paying yet meaningless jobs, moved to Jersey and started new meaningful lives? Perhaps starting new jobs at Burger King or Walmart. I wonder if this movie convinced Nicholas Cage that making millions of dollars and owning fancy houses and cars will not bring happiness. Having kids and working in retail brings happiness. 2. Why didn't Jack ever question this supernatural force that was toying with him as if he were some 21st century Job? He seemed resolved with the fact that this must happen to a lot of people. Didn't he have a best friend or a therapist to go to and say You'll never guess what happened to me and I think I'm going insane. 3. Why do blue-collar schlubs in movies and TV shows always have hot wives?Oh well. These are minor problems in a terrific movie that people young and old will be manipulated into thinking is a new Holiday Classic!

Well, what audience is going to want the protagonist to choose the latter? So of course the multi-millionaire screenwriter, director and star actors (all of whom left home towns far behind them to seek fame and fortune in Hollywood) play out their imaginary preference for family,  home town and house owned for generations - over fame and fortune.**** SPOILERS ****The problem with the movie is that the choices seem false. Does working at an investment bank really preclude marriage? children? a house in the suburbs? Did his flight to London really mean they could not continue a relationship? (The movie wasn't made in the 18th century).When he gains a job with that firm, her dislike of the change is only plausible if one believes that she has no understanding of the difference in his self-esteem from working at the investment bank rather than selling tires. He says that he could commute by car, and they could continue to live in their old home, and she says the commute would be too long due to traffic. This doesn't ring true since the vast majority of investment bankers in New York do in fact commute from the suburbs.Moreover, even if true, does it really mean that she would show so openly her disdain for such a wonderful career jump because she was insistent on remaining in the same house? It just doesn't ring true.    However, overall the movie is redeemed by Tea Leoni who is completely radiant as the wife. (Imagine Roseanne Barr in the role and whether the outcome would be the same). Leoni is one of the most warm and glowing actresses in Hollywood - and to do so with Nicholas Cage and Woody Allen (in Hollywood Ending) - well she's some actress.So although I liked the movie, the need to make these choices never seems real. And if Tea Leoni were NOT the wife, well, would he really fall in love with that suburban life? (For one thing, what if his wife looked Cage's age?!!). *** SPOILERS END ****It's a sweet movie that often doesn't seem to make sense - but worth seeing, particularly for married couples to feel good about themselves. The movie is suffused with Tea Leoni's beauty and warmth - and that makes it worthwhile.

That pretty much sums up why I watched this movie, because no other set of circumstances would have induced me to do so.This film can pretty much be summed up by the moralism Family life is the greatest life you can have.  Everything in the movie leads up to this point, and it is painfully obvious from the get go (hey, look at the title). The concept is interesting, because who hasn't wondered What if I went back and did things differently?.  The premise here has Nicolas Cage's character transported into the life today that he would be leading if he hadn't dumped his girlfriend to go to London on his stepladder to being the head of some major corporation.  This involves a couple kids and a house in the burbs. The whole condition of this change, however, is that he is stuck in it until he realizes that this is the life he absolutely wants, deep down inside. Then, in the end, it all gets taken away and he has to figure out what to do. The wrap-around, which sends him in the end to the old girlfriend's apartment, is utterly pathetic and absolutely unrealistic.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing wrong with love and intimate relationships, and even people seeing their lives somehow fulfilled by having children.  For me, I just get sick of the idea that this is the ONLY way to live a fulfilling life, which is really the message of the film.  I also do not honestly believe that this IS a fulfilling life to live, because people are not defined by who they reproduce, but by what they do themselves.  This film really raises to the level of highest merit the idea that you completely bend your life to such a set-up.  Not that this guy's life was worth a spit to begin with, his type should be fed to starving animals.  But, moralistic pictures like this are best avoided, for fear that they might pique one's frustrations at the problems of this society enough to force you into more drastic measures.I suffered through this film so that you don't have to.  I would never subject myself to this film again, and my already low respect for Cage just dropped lower (Face/Off was a plus).

Jack has everything he could possibly want out of life a gorgeous woman who provides him with lovemaking whenever needed, massive living space, and all the material possessions imaginable. On Christmas Eve, his corporation, PK Lassiter and Associates, Investment House, is about to close on a record setting merger involving many billions of dollars. What more could anyone want out of life?	Jack has an interesting past behind him. Thirteen years earlier he was college sweetheart to a beautiful young woman named Kate (Tea Leoni). When given the opportunity to spend a year in London or continue his relationship with Kate, Jack chooses the road less traveled and packs his luggage for England. Recently, Jack received a message from Kate, who wants a phone call or a visit since she is moving out of town. While Jack is reluctant to do so, as he walks home from work that night, he visits a small convenience market and finds himself in the middle of a heist. Jack eventually talks the gunman, named Cash (Don Cheadle), out of doing anything violent, but he also gets the surprise of his life. 	The next morning Jack awakes in a middle-class suburban New Jersey home, along with Kate as his wife and their two young children. Naturally horrified at the confusion of the events, Jack rushes to his office only to realize nobody knows him as the head honcho anymore. Soon the mysterious Cash confronts and explains to Jack that he must figure out what all of this means for himself. At first the previous bachelor is not satisfied with being a modest tire sales representative, but after a while he begins to feel more comfortable with this alternate universe&#133;and may hunger more for family passion rather than money after all. But will he be able to keep this life, or is it only a matter of time before Cash switches Jack back into his old setting?  	The most obvious mistake The Family Man makes is showing us what a wonderful life Jack has at the beginning, and how it actually decreases in quality in his alternate lifestyle. Many audiences will surely disagree and find a loving family more valuable than a load of cash and luxuries, but after comparing both lives, I would be in a particularly unusual mood to pick the family life. The movie portrays Jack's family is a little too ordinary as well. What would you choose, a life of riches and abundance or changing dirty dippers and dealing with a family's hectic schedule? Kate is a very beautiful woman, and I am sure she would light a few fires for Jack, but his personality seems more convincing as the original corporate entrepreneur. 	Another conflict I had with the movie is how it takes the role of a conventional love story shamelessly through a simple minded gimmick. Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni have ample chemistry, and the performances are tastefully elegant and illustriously charming. However, there is no explanation of how Cash has the power to alter Jack's livelihood. Is he an angel from God? If he was, I doubt he would hold up a convenient store. Or what happens to the family when Jack's new life is transformed into the old? It is plot holes like these that make The Family Man nothing more than a look at two lovebirds going through the motions.    "},{"Title":"Typical schlock chick-flick.

Past that, I cannot condone the other values portrayed in the film which you have so accurately stated in your assessment. The other audiences that I refer to are those who accept the standards of profane and vulgar language, inappropriately timed sexual activity and voyeurism, i.e., watching people make love and being titillated by beautiful women taking showers and undressing, etc. As a recent study suggests, teenagers are governed more by above the neck influences than below the neck, hormones, as so may think.  I believe what we see in the media help young people to determine their value systems and/or codes of behavior. In a sense, they are sorting and determining what they will and won't do. Standards have limits.  Some are very narrow and others are very wide.  The limits are always being stretched and moved further out from one generation to the next.

Since those days, I have asked why did so many of my generation stop at hand-holding, kissing,etc., and stop short of going all the way.  Why was there more respect for a girl? Why? Because we did not have modeling behavior glamorized graphically as we sit with our family and peers. We were not desensitized and subliminally and insidiously taught what is acceptable.By the way, if I think this movie had its negative influences, what would I say about the present genre before us. Last week our family watched The Sound of Music.  Point made, I hope.  Thanks for the opportunity you have offered to view the critiques and to offer our humble thoughts.  "}]
