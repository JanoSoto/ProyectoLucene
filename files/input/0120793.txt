I lived a life in many ways similar to her's - i.e., married a 'yeshiva buchor', supported him, rebelled (emphatically!), was ostricised and found the whole thing stifling, intollerant, conformist (woe betide to those who dared to be a bit different), suppressive and above all 100% hypocritical (I don't look Jewish and if I had a penny for the number of 'orthodox' men who tried to pick me up, I could retire!). Mendel's brother's behaviour wouldn't surprise me in real life one bit.I was absolutely amazed how authentically the characters in this film portrayed the yeshiva going community - to the point where I actually read the credits at the end to see how many of the actors were Jewish! Although Judaism is supposed' to be a lot of things (i.e., the man is 'encouraged' to see to his wife's pleasure), it is in fact quite often the opposite. As is often said, the religion is fine, it's the people who leave a lot to be desired. And that came across so clearly in this film. Sonia was ostracised for not conforming (yup, that sounds about right), her husband was so 'devout' (a tzadik) he was ashamed of his - and her - sexuality that he tried to repress it (yep, right again), the yentas (busy boddies) in the community had a lot to say (um hmmm) - absolutely everything about the movie was so spot on it was eerie - even down to the Yiddish-isms, accents and dress.It brought back a lot of unpleasant memories...but that is only a testament to how authentic the film really was. In terms of storyline, content, acting, music - I thought it was excellent, hence the 10* rating.

After the birth of her first child, a son, a young New York City woman, Sonia Horowitz (Zellweger), struggles with emotional and sexual frustration as she attempts to cope with the extreme ideals of her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), an Hasidic Jew who holds God above all things, including his wife and their marriage.  Mendel is a good man, a holy man, but in his youthful zeal to please God and live according to His Word, he woefully neglects Sonia, a fact to which he has been blinded by his religious fervor.  His devotion to God is so all consuming that he is not only unable to meet, but is unaware of, the needs of his wife.	Sonia is a good wife and mother, a good person who loves God, but is simply incapable of effecting Mendel's degree of devotion and sacrifice.  His concerns are of a spiritual nature, while hers are more immediate.  Increasingly discontent and striving for a means through which she can rise above the stature of non-entity bestowed upon her by Mendel, her life takes a turn only when her brother-in-law, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), intercedes on her behalf.  A jeweler by trade, Sender sees a value in Sonia that he likens to a price above rubies, but his efforts soon prove to be a mixed blessing for her, as ultimately her life becomes more complicated than ever.	Yakin is to be commended for his objective approach to this story; any judgment of those involved is left to God and the audience.  He neither condemns Mendel for his-- what may be deemed by some-- excessive piety, nor does he absolve him of it's implications.  By the same token, he neither condemns nor absolves Sonia for her actions.  And by avoiding any subjective judgment of the characters, it heightens the impact of the film in that it forces the involvement of the individual viewer, who must then decide if what has transpired is appropriate or not.  It's a very subtle and effective way of drawing in the audience, wisely employed by Yakin, as it maintains a balance in the film while allowing the actions of the characters to speak for themselves.  	As Sonia, Zellweger turns in an excellent, understated performance, through which she makes you feel the exasperation of this woman in need of self-esteem and acknowledgement.  There's something of Ibsen's `A Doll's House' in this story, for Sonia (like Ibsen's Nora) is not motivated by selfishness, but by the desire for her family to be able to function as a whole, and to be, herself, an invaluable part of that whole.  It's a selfless pursuit for recognition and equality, rather than an ego driven quest for autonomy, and because of this it is easy to empathize with her.  Zellweger does not play Sonia for sympathy, though it would be the easy road to take with this character; she opts instead for credibility in her actions and reactions, and succeeds with an honest portrayal that makes her entirely believable.  	Fitzgerald also gives a solid performance as Mendel, a man you are neither able to like nor dislike, mainly because Fitzgerald does such a good job of maintaining the integrity of the character.  And as Sender, Eccleston does a notable turn, as well, and again the filmmaker's objectivity in presenting the relationship between the brothers adds that ring of truth that makes the contrast between the two convincing.	The supporting cast includes Julianna Margulies (Rachel), Allen Payne (Ramon), Kim Hunter (Rebbitzn), John Randolph (Rebbe Moshe), Kathleen Chalfant (Beggar Woman), Edie Falco (Feiga), Shelton Dane (Yossi) and Jackie Ryan (Young Sonia).  Yakin's delicate handling of the sensitive subject matter, as well as the unqualified non-judgmental tone of the film, puts the value of `A Price Above Rubies' at a cut above the usual drama that seeks to deal with the issues of religious ardor.  The ending of the film may not resolve the matters at hand to every viewer's satisfaction, but it's honest, and consistent with the rest of the story.  What minor flaws the film may contain can be easily overlooked in light of Zellweger's memorable performance, and the fact that it proffers an emotionally complex and involving experience, especially for the discerning viewer.  I rate this one 8/10.

Although there is much to be admired in the world of Orthodox Judaism, and Hasidism in particular, it is a community with a narrow, ethnocentric perspective with little latitude for behavior outside the philosophical norm.  Many in the community who strive to exceed the acceptable boundaries find themselves isolated and ostracized for their non-conformal attitude.  Sonia's journey, though not typical, had some of the elements I have personally experienced.I must note, however, that the sexual intercourse scene between Sonia and Mendel, where they perform the act fully clothed, is not technically correct.  Jewish law actually expects that the couple be completely unclothed.  It places the burden upon the husband to satisfy his wife to the best of his ability.  I realize to what purpose the scene was done the way it was, but it incorrectly portrayed a very private and sacred part of Jewish life.I was deeply affected by this independent film targeted to a fairly limited audience.

Beautifully photographed, this film's acting sparkles -- and renders a reasonably accurate portrait of an easily caricatured community.In a role played well before her current celebrity (circa Jerry Maguire), Renee Zellweger establishes herself as a talent of unlimited possibilities. That she doesn't look Jewish (by the stereotype) does not make her less convincing....The film's feminist perspective is gracefully realized without belittling all guys -- which greatly enhances the film's power! (And lowers my blood pressure!) While compelling in the early going, the plot becomes a bit overly complex. But the film remains very well worth watching throughout. Production design is exceptional! Those Orthodox Jewish critics who are angered by this film's portrayal of Jewish Orthodoxy might have us believe that the world of Orthodoxy is monolithically benign. It is not. ...Traditional thought and practice -- orthodoxy in many settings -- has its beauties and strengths, and -- like most things human-- it has its dark, shadow side as well. I've personally experienced both the light and the dark, and know they both exist. A Price Above Rubies depicts the delicate balance gone awry.For a very different, also wonderful film which depicts both light and shadow sides of American Jewish traditionalism, but less critical of Orthodoxy, try The Chosen (1982) (adapted from Chaim Potok's book), with Robby Benson (quite good in this film, to my surprise), Rod Steiger and Maximillian Schell.

Only now do I see enough that is special about the film that I feel ready to share.Other reviewers discussed the main plot and primary characters Sonia (Renee Zellweger), burning with desires that few can understand, especially at her young age; her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), whose religiosity is so overwhelming he can't deal with his wife's needs; Mendel's overbearing brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), and sister, Rachel (Julianna Margulies); and Ramon (Allen Payne), the sensual artist whose talents and sexuality offer Sonia the way out of her nightmarish bonds to religious tradition.Watching Price again this morning, I finally realized the deeper importance of three characters that received minor mention by only one other reviewer Sonia's long-dead brother, Yossi (Shelton Dane); the nameless and mysterious beggar woman (Kathleen Chalfant); and the unusually honest and grateful Rebbitzn (Kim Hunter). The purpose of these vital characters is to contrast Sonia's earthy spirituality with Mendel's ritualistic piety.Unlike so many films, the script is so tightly written that as I watched it from beginning to end for the second time on IFC, I failed to detect a single scene or shot that could be cut.

Her family was a family of fanatics. She had a good relationship with her brother. Her brother  kept coming back as the voice of her very own conscience, and kept Sonia true to herself.  This movie to me parallels the movie At Play in the Fields of the Lord which deals with fanaticism in a Protestant community.  Both of those movies deal with people that are excessively judgmental. Too heavenly minded that they are no earthly good. I am quoting a song, but I cannot remember the name of the singer and we lost the tape we had.	I found that Christopher Eccleston (Elizabeth) Sender,  was a very mean and annoying person, and a non understanding husband.  A fanatic, he could not enjoy life itself because everything in his mind was a sin. How binding!  He felt that he had problems dealing with his wife, but instead of dealing with her, he went to the synagogue and prayed instead of talking to her. As the movie was showing what is the point of praying when you are unable to ask for forgiveness? Julianna Margulies (ER) Rachel was very judgmental.  She had the kind of fanaticism that leads people to leave their own family homeless because they do not agree with them.  I just wonder where is God in all this?  This is a very interesting movie, which I recommend, because it made me think about (1) keeping checks and balances on my own behavior as a believer; (2)  thinking about the emancipation of women in this type of environment; (3)  seeing how people can live under the bondage of fear and guilt, without any  relief ever;  (4) how they appear never to experience the deliverance that forgiveness brings; (5) and the core of religion which is love. Love is what unites people and leads mankind toward God,  who is love Himself. The movie was nominated for Grand Special Prize at the Deauville Film Festival.

Here, the woman is stressed, fights back and sees a rosie future. So the evil environment has to have at least a couple friendly characters.As an example of the genre, this one is pallid. It has the metaphor of a jewel finding a setting that superficially looks passionate. That metaphor is pretty thin compared to great films, but it at least puts it a step ahead of the norm of this type. There is a remarkable score faintly derived from klezmer, it has both a quirky humor and a curious promiscuity. Apt, and I liked it.But if you wish, you can get a little more value out of this than was put into it by seeing it as `Nurse Betty' meets `Dancer in the Dark.' That's because there is an alternative reality that Sonia shifts in and out of. Its because her notion of beauty is based on a promiscuous sensuality, contrasted to the exploitive, damaging sex the males give back. `You had me at &#145;hello',' but there's a disagreement on what `had' means. Talmudic arguments could have been used to enrich this situation, but it was avoided. In fact, the Jews here might as well have been Scottish Presbyterians or New England Puritans.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

It was just starting, and being a Modern Orthodox Jew in the Diaspora it made me interested to watch it. I started and got really into the movie, later I was wrong -the whole movie was wrong.Firstly, let me tell you that sexual intercourse is considered to be the Holiest Mitzvah, it is also a mitzvah for a man to satisfy his wife. I have been to Yeshiva and it was taught that a man is obliged to get married and to SATISFY HIS WIFE COMPLETELY. If it is the choice of studying the Torah or being with his partner, the choice is to satisfy the partner (of course). Why did the movie not point that one out?Second This is such an anti - religious movie. WHY? So, that the young Jewish women on verge for getting married will get scared away? And marry out?Thirdly The main character must have been really inconsiderate and immoral. A religious Jewish couple does NOT get married just for the sake's of getting married. The get married to satisfy their complete goals and potentials in live. Before the wedding the two people sit down and talk about what they want? What goals would they want to reach? and if they are heading down the same path!Last, why does nobody ever show Judaism in all it's glory and passion and livelihood as it should be? Why is it always bad? We get shown rocks being thrown at cars in Mea'Shearim, but the commentators forget to tell us that it is Shabbat.I disliked this movie very much. If all Jewish marriages are like that, then why is there such a small divorce rate? Why do people love each other and are inseparable? While, in the Western Society why are the break - ups of people so high? The suicide? The crime? Why is there so much disgust in the world we live in now?

He's a young conservative Hasidic Jew religious teacher. She's a new mother and they don't have a good sex life. She's very knowledgeable in jewelry learned from her father. She abandons her skills to marry a scholar as her parents wish. Her brother-in-law Sender (Christopher Eccleston) offers her a job to run his basement jewelry 'store', and immediately have sex. She grows to hate Sender and discovers new jewelery artist Ramon Garcia (Allen Payne).I am just not sold on Renee Zellweger as this character. I can't see her as a religious person. She has trouble acting reserved. I don't buy her character at the beginning. She just seems out of place. I can understand the point is that she's out of place, but it's a role too far away from her natural persona. The first part of the movie is slow and tedious exactly like her life. It gets more interesting later on. In the end, I didn't really like it. And the character of her brother feels more like a gimmick and a distraction from her own character. Instead of offering depth, her brother only offers confusion. Director/writer Boaz Yakin provides an insight into this isolated world. The husband is ridiculously pathetic at one point. I wondered if Boaz is ridiculing the Hasidic faith? Maybe it's a more compelling movie for people who has connections to that world unlike me. The constant whispered discussions really tired me out. The only truly compelling performance comes from Julianna Margulies as Mendel's sister Rachel in that one big scene.

I have mixed feelings about this film, of which I will explain, without getting into the actual plot or the ramifications or consequences of her actions and therefore avoid getting into a philosophical discussion. I might could have, if I had just seen it last night, but this is two weeks cold. But, then again, the movie's approach doesn't really merit much discussion to begin with.The two best things about it are Renee's earnest effort into portraying a girl, blossoming into a woman, whose world is dictated by her faith, when her heart and/or her mind goes against it; she is quite believable. Also, the film's director makes good use of time and place, and you actually feel you're there with her in her world.On the other hand, as the movie progresses, it begins to resemble a CBS TV drama, with its low-key budget and generic feel to it to please everyone, feeling like a cross between the TV-remake of Grisham's The Client (1995) with JoBeth Williams and John Heard, and the Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino TV show That's Life (2000-2002.) Particularly the latter. Maybe a touch of Judging Amy, too. The plot extremes and her desire to be her own person feels like, this week on The Horowitzes (the family name.) It addresses the issues by glancing over them, in an artificial episodic way, and then they feel they are being faithful to the subject matter by writing about it all.Lastly, I will note that I appreciated the journal the rabbi kept of all his sins; if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. It's about the only real thing I took from the whole movie. I know it sounds like I bashed it; but, while I did like certain things about it, on the whole, I don't feel it accomplished what they set out to do.

Aren't there more shades of grey in all groups? There does need to be more exposure of the plight of women in traditional cultures, but I thought this was too steeped in prejudice, knowing it's okay to be so toward Orthodox Jews, but of course not toward other minorities, who are treated quite differently by the writer/director. I did appreciate that the director showed how cruel the oppression of women is, and the bind many find themselves in when oppression is carried out and defended by a closed community. But the portrayal of a woman who was violently attacked and repeatedly exploited as remaining cohesive in personality and untraumatized in mind was unrealistic, and in a subtle way, minimized the horrors of violence and coercion. I'm sure this was not the director's intention, but in a way it is a distorted view of women to think that we could endure violence without great mental injury.

The acting is very strong and without intimate knowledge of this culture, it had the ring of authenticity to it. This movie comments on morality on different levels. By the light of a legalistic religious teaching; contrasting Goodness and pretended Piety; good outcomes with Sin as a vehicle; and the sin of losing human compassion in pursuit of saintliness.The pacing in this film defeats its message, unfortunately. It wallows in the claustrophobia of the life that sends the main character, Sonia, on her journey of self discovery for about 10 minutes past interesting. It seems as though all of the people advising Sonia have weird observations that are ultimately not as wise as her own counsel. This triumph of finding her own way is muddied in the process of finding closure to every sub-plot in the story. (And may God deliver me from homeless characters with magical powers!)Ultimately, it seems to say that Goodness cannot be achieved unless you are free to choose it. And that God has given us individual passions and talent in order to lead fulfilled lives with one another.(God is somewhat treated as the problem in this film. Or is it His adherents?) It would be tempting to re-edit this to see if the story can be revealed at a cleaner tempo. Overall, a good movie that stays with you for a few days, but don't look for a Hollywood ending.

The film is about a rebellious young Hasidic women Sonia Horowitz, Renee Zeilweger,who emotionally destroys almost every one that she comes in contact with from the Grand Rebbe Moshe, Jon Randolph, to her helpless husband Mendel, Glenn Fitzgerald, with her ideas about life and religion. Sonia does this to the point where she's practically run out of the neighborhood of Boro Park by the very people, the Hassidim, who at first welcomed and accepted her as one of their own. Even her own mother not offering Sonia any support or allowing her to stay at her home when she phoned for help. Actress Renee Zeilweger is very believable as a Hasidic woman at first but when we see her change and become somewhat of a free soul she become a bit ridicules. The only logical explanation I can come to for her actions is that the birth of her son Shimmie and the stress of taking care of him under the difficult conditions of the Hasidic life-style. A life-style that pushed her off the deep end and caused her to have a serious emotional breakdown. What surprised me about Sonia is that you see her in the beginning of the movie as a little girl and she seemed as detached from religion, Jewish or otherwise. How could she then as a young women marry a Hasidic man, Mendel Horowitz, and not know what would be in store for her? Mendel is a fine teacher and Torah scholar at the local Yeshiva, Jewish religious school,and is looked highly upon by his students and friends to become a major leader in the Hasidic community. It's Sonia's rebellious that slowly pulls him down to the point where he becomes a basket case. Mendel becomes so depressed that he's almost at the point later in the film to be committed. There's also a sub-plot in the movie involving Mendel's older brother Sender, Christopher Eccleston. Sender at first gives Sonia a job at his jewelry establishment in both Boro Park and the 47th street diamond district in midtown Manhattan but also forces himself on her. Sader has a secret affair with Sonia to the point where he keeps a secret apartment in Manhattan to continue it. Sonia proves to be a real tough cookie in dealing with crooks and chiselers in the jewelry and diamond business. Confronting them with their illegal practices and forcing them to give her as much as an 80% discount on their products, the real stuff not the phony baloney, or else she'll report them to the authorities. Sonia later develops a relationship with Ramon Garcia, Allen Payne, who worked for one of these jewelry crooks Hrundi Kapoor, Faran Tahir. Romans work really impressed Sonia and later falls in love with to the shock and horror of her Hasidic friends and neighbors. It's very hard at first to muster up any sympathy for Sonia since not only does she cheat on her husband with Ramon not Sender who she was in no way in love with. It was Sender not her who started and continued the affair. Also Sonia's her love for her son rang a bit hollow as she neglected little Shimmie to the point where he had to stay with one of her Hasidic neighbors Rachel, Julianna MaGulies. With Sonia never at home to care for him. Mendel was also out in him being too busy teaching and studying the Mishna, Jewish holy Books, at the synagogue. This gave Mendel almost no time at all to look after Shimmie at the same time putting the entire care and attention of the infant all on poor Sonia's shoulders. With all this going on you can fully understand the situation that she found herself in and how it completely overwhelmed her.Mendel came across far more sympathetic in the movie only because he actually seemed more destroyed emotionally by what was happening. Mendel came across as almost being Brain-dead or unconscious which didn't gain him too many points with the audience. To Mendel's credit in the end he did pull himself together and took Shimmie home and cared for him by himself without the help of the almost always absent Sonia. It was also Mendel, together with Sonia, who in the end of the movie almost came to an understanding about the difficulties of their marriage and how he realized, like she did, that their marriage was at an end. Both agreeing to both go their separate ways. Parting with Sonia Mendel gave her a present a ruby, Sonia's birth stone, that he forgot to buy her for her birthday since he forgot her birthday. The movie A Price Above Rubies wasn't as bad as most reviews on it say it is. The acting was much better then average and there were times where it hit you right in the heart and moved you. The film was just too over-the-top in regard to the supposed excesses of the Brooklyn Hasidic community it its treatment of a somewhat wayward, from their strict religious practices, young woman. Interesting at first but after a half hour or so it just bogged down to where it became an unending TV sitcom about a dysfunctional American family but without any humor or laughs in it.

I would go so far to say that, if the director and/or writer were Jewish, that they themselves lacked an adequate understanding of their own culture.  First of all, Judaism, even the extremely orthodox variety, emphasizes ethical behavior, i.e., family and community values, over deity worship.  Therefore, placing worship above family would be completely incongruous with strict observance.  Secondly, rabbinic Judaism eschews dogma and encourages intellectual discourse, even skepticism.  Lastly, most Jewish philosophy recognizes the inherent contradiction between omnipotence and all-good;  Few if any Rabbim would suggest that the holocaust was God's plan.

In my opinion, this movie pretends to explore deep issues, but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices; with little true insight. What the people in the movie (and therefore, the writer) failed to see was grace. They failed to understand that God is the author of beauty and He is the Creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds. To imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful, and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty, is just an oversimplification. Such stereotypes really don't exist, for even Jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own. Scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh, and that no man ever hated his own flesh, but he nourishes and cherishes it. Even if you want to ignore the New Testament, the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament, and the even the book of Proverbs which says, Rejoice in the wife of thy youth, let her breasts satisfy you always! How can that be read in any way other way than that God knows, and approves of, and smiles on, the marital union and the enjoyment thereof? Real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives. Those that do deny a very basic teaching of the Judeo/Christian religion. God NEVER said those things. It's absurd. Sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true God of Abraham. It didn't need to be so. How sad. What Sonia desperately needed was TRUTH, not tradition. In knowing, loving and obeying God, we love others more; before ourselves. That is the faith of the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob & Joseph; once for all delivered to the Saints; bought & paid for by Jesus Christ, the Righteous. But alright, ignore all this and abandon ancient, holy Scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts. That's a good plan. I would never recommend this movie; partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic, but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight.
