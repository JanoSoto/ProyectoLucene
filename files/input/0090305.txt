I'm saying it. Ghostbusters, Summer Rental, The Great Outdoors, Strange Brew, Gung Ho, Mr. Mom, all of these movies have their place, but none of them can match Weird Science for laughs or pure....eightiesness. Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny, dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs A least one hot girl, a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along, plenty of dashing eighties threads, a corny as hell eighties soundtrack,(and Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get), and plenty of cheap funny jokes. Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere, me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. Bottom Line If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness.

This man single-handedly crafted movies about teenagers for teenagers, without ever becoming patronising or authoritative. Weird Science epitomises the 80s with its fast cars, shoulder pads and big hair. To be honest, Weird Science is synonymous with that decade and reflects most if not all, of its hopes and aspirations (computers in every home, robotic servants etc.). Looking back on it now it's incredibly dated, however and more importantly, the film is still as entertaining today as it was over ten years ago!Anyone who grew up in the 80s and is beginning to reminisce will instantly relate to the exploits of the two lead characters Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), as they use their computer and associated paraphernalia to create a beautiful girlfriend (Kelly LeBrock). Although not Hughes' best work, this was reserved (in my opinion) for the later 'Ferris Beuller's Day Off' which was far more appealing to a wider audience - Weird Science will always be a 'Geeky' 80s classic. The film was so popular it spawned it's own TV series - ten years later!Unless you lived through that decade the film won't touch you in quite the same way. You needed to have been in awe of Tron, to have worn stone washed jeans and to have owned at least two pairs of illuminous odd socks, to really appreciate the naivety of the main characters as they place their faith in computers and 'modern' technology.Today to a younger - more clued up audience, Weird Science could get lost amongst so many other 80s flicks with inferior technology and  visual special FX to today's CGI standards. However there is something quintessentially 80s, something oh so Duran Duran about Weird Science that separates it from even the best of today's films. It's that central 'Hughes' element with its visual nuances and audible gags that makes this a timeless classic, watchable again and again.If you know what 'ghetto blaster' is definitely watch this film, if you were born after 1984 take everything with a pinch of salt and pay attention - you might learn something.

I can tell you he was in Stripes and he was one of the punks in Terminator and he even had a small role in Commando.  His three best films in my opinion are True Lies, Aliens and his classic turn as Chet in Weird Science.  Anyone that has seen this film will tell you that they loved it when Chet comes home to find it snowing in his room.  Or how fun it was to watch him torture Wyatt by extorting money from him.  For Christ sakes Wyatt will you cover yourself!   Bill Paxton may be best known for his work in James Cameron films but it is John Hughes that we have to thank for unleashing him onto audiences with this amazing turn as Chet Donnelly.  He is the meanest, nastiest older brother and yet he is screamingly funny.  Bill Paxton had a cameo in a film called The Last Supper years later and his character really could have been a grown up Chet.  But it is here that we get to laugh at some of Paxton's best work.  Weird Science is one hell of a funny film and John Hughes is responsible for that, but if Chet wasn't played by Bill Paxton then it just wouldn't have been the same.As the film goes, it is quite good.  I don't believe it is Hughes' best, that honour, in my opinion, goes to The Breakfast Club, but it is very very entertaining.  And as one reviewer said before me, you had to have grown up in the 80's to really appreciate this film.  And underneath all of what this film is about, it is still just a film about the insecurities of being a teen, getting the girl and living happily ever after.  I think Hughes may have been writing the script for Sixteen Candles, stopped in the middle of it and then took acid with Chevy Chase or John Candy and then came up with this idea because some of the situations really are right out of nowhere. Take for example the actual creation of Lisa.  The two geeks hook up a doll to the game of Operation?? and then with bras around their heads, they connect the computer and then lightning and winds invade their room and then Kelly LeBrock walks out of their closet.  Acid for sure.Then there is the scene with Vernon Wells and his biker buddies.  A highschool house party and then a bunch of guys on motorcycles straight out of Mad Max breaks into the house and starts to terrorize the kids.  Acid trip for sure.  Acid aside, Weird Science is a trip through time.  If you were born in the 70's and went to highschool in the 80's like I did, then you are probably familiar with the name John Hughes, and if you are then you are probably a fan of most of his work.  Along with Ferris, Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club and some of his adult films like Planes Trains... She's Having a Baby and even Vacation, Weird Science is a film that should be seen again.  It is 15 years old and perhaps people can say it is dated some, but to me it is a throwback to what films were like in the 80's.  This film is fun, hysterical and enjoyable.  And it has Bill Paxton in one of the funniest roles in any career.  This is a fun film and if you haven't seen this in quite some time, then maybe you should.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Funky Teen Sci-Fi  (spoilers)","Date":"8 August 2004","Score":"35 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" 80s! I'm living in the 80s! If you love 80s teen movies, then Weird Science ought to be in your catalogue. It is one of director John Hughes most memorable, and one of the 80s most original.Written in two days, this is a teen science fiction film, the story of two teenage loners, Wyatt (the always grimacing Ilan-Mitchell Smith) and Gary (Anthony Michael Hall before he went deadpan) and their weird way of discovering girls. A variation on Frankenstein, the teenagers create a beautiful woman (the super cool Kelly LeBrock) using their computer and some clever hacking skills (of course, it's exaggerated). Their creation is Lisa, the chic English accent woman who brings a little life to the subtle Illinois suburb. As the antithesis of both Wyatt and Gary's personalities, she's going to show these boys a little adventure, get them to loosen up, and for crying out loud, gain some self-esteem.Because Lisa is a lady with some supernatural power like freezing grandparents in time, erasing the memory of a bad first impression with Gary's parents, turning Wyatt's obnoxious military school brother Chet (Bill Paxton in his funniest, most arrogant role yet) into a giant pus maggot, or even having a gang of mutant bikers storming a house party. And Lisa's greatest gift to the boys showing them true love by helping them along to meet the two girls they've been after all along, their high school classmates, Deb and Hilly, who are unfortunately hung up on the dweeb bullies, Max (Robert Russler) and Ian (Robert Downey, Jr.). So essentially, it deals with many aspects of teen angst (but more like just teen self-esteem or self-consciousness issues) within one story. Parents, class status (done subtly here as opposed to Some Kind of Wonderful or Pretty in Pink), relationships, etc. It works well, and is done quite humorously.One of my favorite scenes is when the trio (Lisa, Gary, and Wyatt) go to the night club looking pretty out of place (they're not only the only white people there, but probably the only ones under thirty). Once Anthony Michael Hall's character, Gary, gets drunk and starts with his slang, it's hilarious. Reminds me a little of Adventures in Babysitting when the gang drops in on the club and they're not allowed to leave until they sing. So eventually, they loosen up and have a little fun.It's a wonderful movie with a classic John Hughes comic touch (says the mutant biker to Gary and Wyatt after they threaten to kill them if they don't leave, Please don't tell anyone about this. I'd hate to lose my teaching job.). Plus, it's got a great soundtrack, featuring Killing Joke, Lords of the New Church, and Oingo Boingo doing the title song. The music video for it was fantastic, and not only features clips from the movie, but Kelly LeBrock herself in Oingo Boingo's own rendition of creating the woman via technology. Although not one of John Hughes' best (I think Sixteen Candles is still his greatest), it is certainly one of his most memorable and one that I will love no matter how old I get. So have yourself a lazy Saturday, pop in the movie, and enjoy.

That message &#x96; horny boys and science is a wicked combination. Once you see John Hughes' masterpiece about Frankensex, you will be asking yourself why you ever quoted The Breakfast Club.

A bodacious babe is front and center with Einstein's intellect and essence of David Lee Roth. A teenage girl is stripped naked by a vacuum cleaner chimney &#x96; which is okay cuz it's in the name of science. Bill Paxton is reduced to a Jim Hensonesque troll! A giant phallic missile penetrates a suburban house. Still not convinced? Well, just watch the last half hour. A gang of road ragers crashes the obligatory 80s teen party, do donuts all over the floors and smack random guys in the crotch.

The humour is infantile, which probably explains why. However, if you revisit this movie as an adult, you're pretty sure to be disappointed by its lame plotting and insistence on crude sex jokes. All the same, a couple of the more inspired jokes still raise a smile, though it's hard to justify sitting through a feature length presentation just to get a couple of giggles.The plot involves two high school losers who invent the woman of their dreams on their computer. She is meant to be a cyber creation, but for some unknown reason she actually comes to life in the shape (and boy what a shape!) of Kelly LeBrock, whom they soon name Lisa. Lisa helps them to gain popularity and street-cred, by doing such enriching things as taking a shower with them and escorting them to a local jazz bar. She even throws the mother of all parties at one of the kids' houses, resulting in full-scale chaos and a nuclear missile being planted in the house (quite literally).Generally, the audience being aimed for here is the slightly immature teenage boy who hasn't got a girlfriend. If that's you, you'll probably love this film. Others might not be so impressed. However, as mentioned before, a few comic moments remain that are funny whoever you are. The scene where a kid named Wyatt accidentally backs into a toilet cubicle and sits down, only to find he has sat on someone who is halfway through taking a dump is pretty good. Also, the scene where Chet (Bill Paxton) says to his brother For Chrissake, will ya cover yourself? handing him a towel only to leave himself stark naked is amusing. If you're after a witty, sophisticated comedy, get something with Cary Grant in it. If you're after toilet humour personified, this is for you!!!

Basically two nerdy teenage boys, Gary Wallace (The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are desperate to be liked, and of course sex-obsessed, and in their desperation (inspired by watching - a coloured version of - Frankenstein, 1931) they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality, but it happens, and Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa, who can get absolutely anything she wants (e.g. expensive cars, mutant bikers to appear) has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence, and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party (they always wanted) they meet the girls they would have always wanted, and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly, Suzanne Snyder as Deb, Judie Aronson as Hilly, young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, Robert Rusler as Max, Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General, Britt Leach as Al Wallace, Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace, Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly, Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive, and there are one or two amusing moments, but the comedy is pretty crass, but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey, Jr. in a film of this sort.

I'm not complaining, since his commitment to character usually overrides all else, making even the most contrived leaps of faith engaging. Unfortunately, his commitment to character takes a turn for the disastrous in Weird Science, easily his worst film. Two shrill, unlikeable high-school losers, frustrated over their inability to score with chicks, decide to create one of their own (through some laughably awful 1985 computer technology), in the form of vacant Playboy centerfold Kelly LeBrock. But hey these shrill, unlikeable losers (who would be justifiably subjected to beatings by their own nerdy peers) really just need to face the fact that a little confidence is all it takes to impress the ladies (and stand up to your sadistic, Army-brat brother)! I have come to expect the contrived, 20-minute opening setup that frames the remainder of a Hughes film, but the setup for Weird Science is non-existent; in its place is a gimmick a glut of special effects and out-of-place action (in the third act, a bunch of bikers out of Mad Max terrorize our hapless losers) that tears any possible humanity to shreds. It's not spoiling anything to say that the losers get with their respective hotties in the end (and are much more worldly, sensitive guys than the horndogs we first met), but the manner by which Hughes arrives at this conclusion rings so patently false it's infuriating.

I love fantasy. And indisputably I love the 1980s. BUT I don't love this John Hughes's buddy comic fantasy from the 1980s !! The 1980s got many movies with a gifted magical woman to a disturbed man. Just recall (Xanadu &#x96; 1980), (Splash &#x96; 1984), (Mannequin &#x96; 1987) or (My Stepmother Is an Alien &#x96; 1988). However (Weird Science) is in the bottom of this list for sure.I didn't feel anything that comic. Maybe the scene with the kid talking in the bar like an old drunken lover. Everything is swift and not in a solid way. The movie is sometimes sluggish and all the time poor. The imagination isn't crazy enough, and the solutions are so easy (the guys will be brave by facing some mad max bikers who appear suddenly ??, the hard brother will be softer by turning into a huge disgusting frog ??,..). Simply, the hastiness ruled. Let alone that the fake frog's level was awful, the dealing with the grandfathers was mean, and even Kelly LeBrock looked not amusing enough or sexy enough.Nothing by (John Hughes) was as low as this ever. To tell you the truth I was thinking for most of the time that this was a work of copycats, doing a bad job at it too. Nonetheless the performance, couple of lines, plus some real wacky moments (when the imagination is fresh) saved the day. Almost saved it!I think the deep innocent tone of it, the wisdom of she is all what I wanted of a woman before knowing the woman I wanted, and the showing of some teenagers' dreams so dreamy were the good points that may ensure a place in us to respect or even love the movie. Add to that, the effective sense of nostalgia which doesn't come from the 1980s fact only, but from what happened to the teen comedies after (being mucous, seminal and emetic). So compared to them (Weird Science) is the morning cartoon ! However, this time I felt that these dirty comedies got something, I don't know what, maybe more interesting than what this 80s comedy got. It could be the polished look, teenager-like leads more than kids, a sexual boldness, or funny stuff?? Generally  Naive fun, but naively made. A melted ice cream.

On one hand it's perfectly entertaining, but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times. The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard.However, if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy, I guess it's all right.It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys (Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who create a woman using electricity, a computer and a Barbie doll.This was my problem with the movie. John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here. The setup is weak and the boys' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast. And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting. The hacking of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic '80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the hacking segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard.Their result? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock, who promptly takes a shower with the boys (their clothes are left on, of course, but hers are not) and then teaches them how to be cool, get girlfriends and so on.I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens. I've seen people say here on IMDb before that '80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true. It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late '20s, sexual innuendo involving the woman (it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night), underage drinking, underage smoking, and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar.I don't mean to sound like a prude, I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s, PG-13 John Hughes comedy.The acting in the movie is decent. Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation, and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious. He comes across as a true comical force, which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films.On the other hand, Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie, even when he's supposed to be scared or angry. Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief, but it's kind of annoying.Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes. He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at.Overall this is one of Hughes' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works. In terms of character development, The Breakfast Club reigns supreme. The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup. It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance, but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable.

Weird Science is another geeky invention of the 80's and I just love how over-the-top the film is and how the film knows it. Any film that turns militaristic brothers into ugly monsters or a beautiful woman freezing grandparents gets a check plus in my book. The film isn't the best teen film from the decades, but it's sure one of the most cheesiest and entertaining ones. John Hughes's film is about two unpopular, bullied kids named Wyatt and Gary who are trying to find true love. They decide to generate a woman through the use of Wyatt's computer. But after Lisa is created, the situation they created vastly spirals out of control. The film has a plethora of enjoyable performances. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith certainly made there characters relatable, awkward, and funny. I liked Kelly LeBrock's sexy performance as Lisa. Robert Downey Jr was pretty good as one of the bullies, almost Tony Stark-like. Bill Paxton was highly enjoyable as the older brother super involved with the military lifestyle. Overall, Weird Science is an over-the-top movie but in a fascinating, enduring way. It's essentially a product of the 80's, a great decade for movies. The film may be weird and quite funny, but it does have relevant thematic issues that every kid should take a note of. I really like how the quirkiness of the film did not take away any of the themes. Not the best of 80's teen comedies, but certainly an enjoyable romp.

Whilst bored one Friday evening they decide to try and see if they can create a perfect woman on their computer. However the boys find that they get more than they bargained for when their creation called Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) enters into their lives and immediately makes a big impact on them.This film worked for me in so many ways and the first thing I liked about this film is that it's a fun piece of escapism. When growing up, how many young men wouldn't have wanted to create a beautiful woman and then find out that said beautiful woman was there to guide them through their adolescence. How much simpler would life be if we all had a Kelly LeBrock by our side.The second more obvious thing that was good about this film is that it quite simply was funny; I wouldn't go as far as saying that it was consistently funny, but when the gags came they hit the right note and I was pleasantly surprised that the film was much less vulgar than I was expecting. I thought that Chet's comeuppance at the end was particularly surprising and amusing. Gary's early scene when he's in the bar trying to emulate the style of the 'black' guys was also funny, but again that scene was funny in a way that was neither crude or offensive. The best character in this film was undoubtedly Chet who kind of reminded me of an 80's version of Stifler from American Pie. Paxton's character was funny, but not in an obnoxious way and he clearly had a lot of fun in this film.The final element that made this work is that it isn't just a dumb teen sex comedy; this actually has a lot more depth to it than one would assume from the beginning and it's actually pretty smart and very well-written. Essentially it's a coming of age film with a few life lessons thrown in for good measure. What also makes this work is that for me it never felt preachy or ever felt like the point was being forced home. Whether you were a nerdish character growing up like Gary or Wyatt or a jock like Ian or Max it's a film that many people can relate to and I think that's ultimately what makes it work so well.If you can look past the embarrassingly dated special effects then there's really very little wrong with this film. It's definitely one of the better teen comedies.

Yes, it's cheesy and the story is ridiculous but it's 80's fun, hilarious and has heart. Of course it looks dated but at the same time, it's the kind of film one will be revisiting. The special effects are quite laughably awful and who could forget the 80s costumes and hairstyles but that's what makes it so enjoyable. 'Weird Science' has all the ingredients of a successful 80's teen comedy. Then there's the ultrahot Kelly LeBrock and Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall playing the dimwitted teens desperate for a girl. You'll also see a young Robert Downey Jr. (in 80s getup) playing the popular bully kid and of course Bill Paxton as one of the worst brothers on film.'Weird Science' is certainly something for an 80s classic fan. In addition to humour, it's got an amusing dose of science fiction and action.

Weird Science serves as the ultimate 1980s high school nerd fantasy, one in which babes see social awkwardness as a turn-on and bullies and extortionist older brothers help themselves to large servings of humble pie. The movie truly doesn't need to be anything more, even in spite of the shallowness of its characters and general disregard for logic.Anthony Michael Hall (in his fourth Hughes film in three years) and Ilan Mitchell-Smith star as two losers who determine that if they can't get girls the old-fashioned way that they can use their computer smarts to play Frankenstein and create the ideal woman. After some illegal hacking they pack her with a high IQ (and an appropriate breast size) then hook a doll up to a machine. One crazy storm inside their house later and suddenly there's Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), who's every bit as stunning with a type A personality as a nerd could possibly imagine or desire.The story then goes the unexpected route. Lisa, equipped with mad street smarts and magic powers, literally takes over the driver's seat and the young Gary and Wyatt for a wild ride. After helping them loosen up a bit, she determines they need a few tests to find the courage they need to stand up to bullies and go after the girl.Hughes determines that Lisa needs no rhyme or reason other than causing an appropriate amount of mischief so the boys can learn a valuable thing or two. She's the fairy godmother of this fantasy; it's one thing to stand up to your parents, for example, and tell them you're going to a party, and it's another to have a hot model do it for you (and cause your father to forget who you are). Hughes basically sticks it to everyone who made his life crappy during his teens, though to be fair, he recognizes the nerd's shortcomings and doesn't paint them as heroes. Hughes has always played things close to the chest, filming most of his movies in the Chicago suburbs where he grew up, even naming the high school in Weird Science after the main road where his actual high school was. In this film he has absolute loony fun with his usual tropes, going as far as turning Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's militaristic older brother Chet, into a steaming pile of crap that looks like Jabba the Hut.Fans of the more romantic side of Hughes, who love his candid nature toward portraying high schoolers, might find Weird Science to be the wild mutt of the family with its irreverence, and high level of silliness. It could be considered the cult favorite of the Hughes collection and that's fine. It definitely caters to those who can relate to being a socially outcast teenage boy and not too many others, but by no means is it a slip-up for the coming-of-age master. ~Steven CVisit my site at http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Failed Experiment","Date":"16 August 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This movie is unbearably low for John Hughes.

Any attempts to make things right with this movie falls into a pit of garbage.  We are supposed to laugh, but there isn't any reason to.  In the end, Hughes insults our intelligence for pranks.

It had some of the biggest comedy stars at their prime at the time and some capable directors, with experience in- and love for the genre, such as in this case John Hughes.Not only was John Hughes just a great comedy director, he specifically was also one who made some great movies for teenagers and he really seemed to connect with his audience. He knew what teenagers wanted for a movie and what issues were on their minds and needed to be handled within a movie. Lots of film-makers just don't connect that well with its teenage-audience, simply thinking that what they put in their movies is what they want to see. It's the reason why there simply aren't any good teenage comedies these days anymore it seems, with the exception of the American Pie-series and a couple of other recent movies like that out there.John Hughes always claimed he wrote this script only in 2 days. And yes, I do believe this. I'm glad it got only written in 2 days, fore if the movie had gotten written in a couple of months or so, Hughes would had probably attempted to let the movie and its story make more sense and would had probably put a more clear main plot line in the movie, giving the overall movie also some more purpose. But I just simply love the movie for not doing this. The movie often just simply doesn't attempt to make any sense and it's all some big fun non-sense. The movie now is basically just the one fun and crazy event after the other.Yes, in all truth this really was one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. The characters, the events, the premise, it's all so much fun to watch and the movie basically has no slow or dull moment in it.It's also a movie in which the main characters are actually being played by some real teenagers. A movie always deserves some extra points for that. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play some teenage characters everybody should be able to relate with. What's on their minds is girls, popularity and sex. Basically all the things real teenage boys used to think about. It was also fun to watch some now famous actors in this movie, in some of their more early roles. Bill Paxton is greatly fun as the prick, military, brother and Robert Downey Jr. also shows up in a quite big early role as one of the school bullies.It's a movie with some great comedy pace and timing in it. Added to this are some good and fun characters and situations and you basically have a great, fun comedy already. John Hughes' qualities as a director probably made this movie work out better than it had the right to and he also makes this one a great one that still connects to a lot of teenagers out there.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"This movie was the best EVER!!","Date":"6 April 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" I saw this movie about half a year ago.

It will never be mentioned in a history of film class, and watching it fifteen years after its release shows that time has not been kind to it at all. But as a good, fun comedy, it lives on forever. Just as computers were really beginning to make a big impression on the world, a couple of geeky kids, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ian Mitchell Smith), decide to create a girlfriend for themselves using Wyatt's 'sophisticated' computer. The way that they actually design her, although ridiculously unrealistic, is hilarious! Weird Science is what I like to call a Cheese Classic. It required minimal talent to put it together, but there is an element of endless amusement that can be found in the film that makes it great. From the bras on Wyatt's and Gary's heads during the creation process to countless inexplicably hilarious pieces of dialogue (Wyatt, your kitchen is blue...), Weird Science is a true comedy classic. It is, however, the film which probably had the most mixed reviews until the Blair Witch Project, so I suggest watching it for yourself.

The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club, the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust, containing two teenagers who are the good guys, but are hard pushed to maintain that.Anthony Michael Hall, a hero from the Breakfast Club, feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.The premise for the story sounds promising, two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers, a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume, a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads, uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head, acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female, until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind, there is more to a person than looks tag.Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery.

Whether his movies follow a group of teenagers coming together on a Saturday detention, cutting school for a day of enjoyment, or getting involved in an unexpected love triangle; his movies are always entertaining, unless of you are someone who doesn't enjoy teen rom-coms. This movie however, takes a slightly different route in the comedy genre by adding elements of science-fiction and fantasy to form up a geeky, but funny teen comedy for teens and adults alike. This film follows Anthony Michael and Ilan Mitchell Smith as Gary and Wyatt, two unpopular teen boys who struggle to climb up the social ladder at school and are constantly pitted targets by the bullies Ian (played by Robert Downey Jr.) and Max (played by Robert Rusler) who manage to maintain high social standing with their girlfriends Deb (played by Suzanna Snyder) and Hilly (played by Judie Aronson). In an efforts to make their social (and sexual) fantasties come true, these two use Wyatt's computer to create themselves a live girlfriend who they name Lisa (played by Kelly LeBrock). Upon her creation, Wyatt and Gary began getting accepted as they began bringing her on dates while she teaches them confidence of getting out in the social crowd. The greatest gem of the film comes from how John Hughes takes such a silly idea and manages to make it work. Now for a science-fiction comedy in the 80s, viewers should not go in expecting groundbreaking special effects or anything blow you out of the water. But this film brings just about everything it needs including a solid cast, good laughs, a heart, and an inspiring message. The main characters are quite funny in some scenes, especially when they get involved in some surprising shenanigans, and come to be easily likable. Of course, these are the typical teen boy stereotypes with fantasies of losing their virginity. It can be fun to watch teenagers take their girlfriend to a bar with fake IDs and throwing parties with booze and loud music. The opposite comes from Bill Paxton who plays Wyatt's abusive brother Chet who torments him whenever he gets the chance, but with unexpected comic relief; and of course Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler who's characters find fun in pantsing the main characters in front a group of girls, or dumping sly smoothies on them. Aside from the silly and occasionally vulgar humor typical for teen comedies, viewers may find enjoyment by the classic 80s soundtrack including songs by Van Halen, and most importantly the message about being socially accepted by people for who are you, not for what you have. Weird Science doesn't meet the heights of John Hughes' other works, but it is still enjoyable and fun for teens and up to watch. This is a funny movie with a great cast and an inspiring message. It is definitely a film teens should watch. Yes, the idea of teenagers making a girlfriend out of a computer is silly, if only Steve Jobs actually made a computer with that kind of power. But what matters in the end is that John Hughes makes it work.

Ferris Bueller, which launched Matt Broderick's career, was not too far in the future, as was Home Alone, which launched Macaulay Culkin on a much shorter career.

In fact, WEIRD SCIENCE has something of a scattershot approach to the material; it feels a little like WAR GAMES at the outset, before turning into the usual teen 'ideal woman' fantasy scenario and then into a bizarre action comedy in the second half.I wasn't too fussed about this film if I'm honest. One of the biggest problems I have with the film is that the two central characters act like a couple of jerks and were completely unsympathetic to me. Half the film seems to consist of them sitting around and arguing in the toilet and it all feels rather stale and uninteresting. The goofy fantasy stuff is better; Kelly LeBrock is having a ball as the 'ideal woman' and has probably never been better in her career. Still, Bill Paxton should have been asked to tone it down a bit, because he's WAY over the top here.After a rather dull first half, things pick up with the introduction of a house party that pretty much takes up the whole second half of the movie. There are some wonderful cameos from Vernon Wells (playing his character from MAD MAX 2 THE ROAD WARRIOR) and Michael Berryman that prove to be the highlight of the whole thing. There are plenty of jokes here too, many of them feeling forced but some hitting the spot. I'd class WEIRD SCIENCE as an interesting failure rather than an all-out cult classic, though.

The answer, according to this film, is that you get a girl who looks like Kelly LeBrock! And that was in 1985. Just think what you might get today when computers are so much more powerful.Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly are two nerdish Chicago high school students. They are also unpopular with their male classmates and are picked on by the school bullies. Wyatt is also picked on by his unpleasant older brother Chet. Although they are only fifteen, however, their main obsession is their inability to find girlfriends. Inspired by an old Frankenstein movie, they try to remedy this problem by performing the aforementioned experiment and are greeted by the emergence from the bathroom of a beautiful young woman clad only in a T-shirt and pair of panties. Despite being only a few seconds old, the young lady, whom they name Lisa, is much more worldly-wise than Gary and Wyatt, and also has magical powers.Now the film doesn't simply end at this point with Lisa becoming Gary and Wyatt's girlfriend. Quite apart from the jealousy that such a ménage-a-trois would be likely to give rise to, there is also the problem that, despite her extreme youth, Lisa has the appearance of a woman in her mid-twenties, and even in the eighties a plot in which Kelly LeBrock becomes the lover of a pair of underage teenagers would not have found favour with the moral majority. (Today it would probably be banned as kiddie porn). So she becomes a fairy godmother who uses her powers to help the boys with their struggling love lives. By the end of the film, they have managed to lure away the former girlfriends of the two class bullies. (Unfortunately, neither girl is as attractive as Lisa, and the film does not really delve into whether their appalling taste in men actually makes them worth having).Actually, there seems to be a perfectly simple explanation for the duo's lack of success with girls. Gary, as played by Anthony Michael Hall, is so wet you could shoot ducks off him. As for Ilan Mitchell-Smith's Wyatt, shall I just say that the girls are probably looking for someone a bit more manly than a boy whose voice still hasn't broken in his mid- teens and who has a penchant for wandering round the house in women's underwear? The film might prefer the alternative explanation that the boys simply lack confidence, but to me they just came across as a pair of dreary wimps.The one really good performance comes from Bill Paxton as the obnoxious Chet, and LeBrock, a model who had previously only appeared in one feature film (The Woman in Red), does more than merely rely upon her good looks. (If only I could say the same of all models who have tried their hand at acting!) Overall, however, the film struck me as a failure, for two main reasons apart from the wimpishness of its male leads. The first has to do with the way the character of Lisa was conceived. She came across as far too self-assured and omnipotent, and did far too much to help the boys. If the intention was to help them gain confidence, making them so dependent upon an all-powerful fairy godmother seems like a weird way of doing it. It might have been more interesting if she had been fallible with fewer magical powers, initially confused and bewildered at having suddenly been conjured into existence with the body and mind of an adult, and then growing in confidence into a sort of loving big sister, being helped by the boys as well as helping them. At the same time the boys would also grow in confidence as they came to realise that this beautiful woman needed them as much as they needed her. Such a concept, however, might have been a bit too subtle for a movie, like this, subtlety being a concept largely alien to John Hughes who acted as both writer and director.The film's other drawback is that, like a lot of teen comedies, it relies too heavily on puerile or tasteless adolescent humour, with little if any genuine wit. (This was characteristic of eighties teen comedies, Drop Dead Fred being another classic example, although plenty have been made in a similar vein since).

So, basically, with this revisit, I focused on those two.Okay, fine, I also wanted to see the gorgeous Kelly LeBrock before she became, well, what she is today. She is such a wonder&#x85;woman. What happened to her that she didn't grow&#x85;more? No, I don't mean her, well, two attributes.I digress. This totally 80s flair film takes virtually no realism and is a ton of fun when you suspend your disbelief. It's a coming of age story in a period of one weekend. It's wildly random at times, and inconsistent, but a lot of fun due to the music, comedy and namely performances from LeBrock and (yeah, being honestly unbiased here) Mitchell-Smith.When watching the wretched 2012's Project X, I always think back to this party movie. While neither is realistic, I would prefer, any day of the week, to watch these party animals have a good time, than the kids of 2012 destroy their souls.I digress&#x85;.again. Best buds and nerds, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt create their perfect woman from a 1985 com-pu-ter and their dreams are set to come true. Of course, there's a little learning to commence during this and some more comedy when they come out of their shells and get the girl(s.) Real girls, that is.It is interesting with what they could get away with back then, i.e. PG-13 rating. Honestly, it would surely be an R in today's time.Nevertheless, not the best John Hughes movie, but a whole lot of fun for those who grew up with this movie.

The plot strings along nicely allowing the kids to do nothing more than create 'weird science' on their computers, and party all the time and chase after women, all while trying to keep their parents and friends, and Wyatt's older brother, Chet, out of their hair. Chet's so funny being played by Bill Paxton. Writer/director John Hughes knows a thing or two on how to cash in a film. John Hughes has such an expansive versatility with writing. Hughes goes against the grain a bit in Weird Science by deciding Gary, played by Anthony Michael Hall, as the main character. That's okay, the problem is that Hall is losing his cuteness, seriously, more like he's loosing his cool. Hall's generous tendencies are fleeting him, and therefore, the character isn't very relatable, but more so sympathetic, which makes it good in a different way, a less conventional way, but Gary should have been the side star, and Wyatt should have been the main character. It's purely sexual. There's nothing wrong with Kelly LeBrock, Lisa, not a thing! What an '80s babe! In the beginning, Kelly LeBrock introduces all the sex appeal needed appearing in her '80s undies, and then she proceeds to manage the movie with sophisticated sexiness the remainder of the viewing. How sexy! Weird Science = Kelly LeBrock. The boys are very good too and make the movie really worth watching. Weird Science scores all the way up to 6 for its creative ingenious fun.

But Wyatt does have a computer, and Gary convinces him to simulate a woman with the hotness of a Playboy model and the personality of David Lee Roth. One lightning bolt later, and presto, there's Kelly LeBrock in panties and a halter top, ready to make their dreams come true.Honeybuns, you wanna party so badly, you can bottle it, she tells Wyatt. If you wanna be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle.Weird Science is an outlier among Hughes' teen movies of the period, which tended to present more authentic emotions in pursuit of comedy. Still, Lisa, as LeBrock's character is known, is of a piece with Bender in The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the rule-bender who has to teach some young charges about escaping adult preconceptions.Employing the outright fantasy of a dream girl with magic powers for such a function could be useful, if the characters were better developed or the comedy funnier. Sadly, Weird Science is a kind of rush job, most of the humor being in the form of crude embarrassment gags on Gary and Wyatt, and their reactions to same. An opening sequence shows them staring at a gym full of teenaged girls, until their reverie is interrupted by a pair of toughs who pull their pants down. That's all the scene has, and it's par for the course.One of the toughs is played by Robert Downey, Jr., making a minor impression except for his hair, which is tousled like a firework. Hall wins the prize for Biggest Big '80s do, though, a layered flip of such intricacy it had to take the boy all morning to set it. Hall is the star of the show, something he earned with his great supporting turns in Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, but Hughes doesn't do him any favors here, letting him overplay too many scenes while Mitchell-Smith winces and grins in fey support.LeBrock does better, in part because she knows she's playing a special effect and has fun with it. People talk about her amazing body, but her kissable mouth is equally lust-inducing. She shows a bit of range, too, but Hughes gives her little more to say than I do whatever they say when asked about Gary and Wyatt. There's a lesson somewhere, too, about finding self-confidence or whatever, but it's a lame tack-on.The film does fly. Hughes' willingness to play for cheap laughs makes this vehicle subtlety-free. The scenes featuring Bill Paxton as Wyatt's unhinged bully of an older brother provide real sparkle, especially when Lisa lays down the law. Every now and again, Hall delivers a decent Hughes line in the old style. Mostly, though, it's enjoyable when giving you a chance to oogle LeBrock.This happens a lot. Hughes is pandering, but sometimes it works. Other times, it is more of an amiable if unimaginative time-waster that reminds you how the director needed to keep things real in order for his films to work.

A lot of people just don't understand this movie. It is supposed to be totally impossible and unrealistic. I believe that John Hughes was trying to push-the envelope to see what he could get away with and still keep a family rating. Today, if a film like this was made at all, it would have to be by Pixar animation. Let's examine the basic premise Two nerdy naive teen age boys set out to create the fantasy girl of their dreams, for their personal sexual purposes. It doesn't quite turn out that way.Lisa what is she? She sure isn't human. She acts like Barbara Eden's Jeannie but may be a 3D hologram made of energy. Her creation makes no sense how can voodoo and computer simulation create anything alive?Like Jumanji and Zathura (The Brass Bottle, I Dream of Jeannie, Mary Poppins, Nannie McPhee) and similar stories, all is returned to its original state and no one is harmed; only wiser for the experience. What I like about this film is that nobody dies, it's just an adventure.It is a teen-age fantasy nonsense film, meant to be enjoyed as just that. Do not try to attach any greater significance to it. It is fun to watch and has great CGI and EFX 1. The big brother as a flatulent- toad is completely outrageous. 2.Kelly Le Brock, sadly, made too few films. (Even she admits that her body was impossible to maintain and she struggles with her weight in later life.) What I don't like about this film 1. The White Superfly bar scene. Too racist and uncomfortable. 2. Nobody makes friends with their high-school bullies. Ever. 3. The Mad Max characters are a little too much over the top. You have probably watched this already and either hate it or love it. It's in the same class as Men in Black. Totally unbelievable and too much fun.

Like all the other films he wrote and directed before 1987's Planes, Trains & Automobiles, this is one of his teen films, but it is certainly not quite the same as its two predecessors, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, even though it was released the same year as the latter! Having seen Sixteen Candles for the first time very recently, after being familiar with The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off for several years, I decided to watch Weird Science. It seems to be less popular than any of the other teen films I've seen from Hughes, so I wasn't expecting it to be any more than pretty good, but my expectations were surpassed!Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly are two nerdy 15-year-old friends who are very unpopular at their high school and have a very poor chance of getting dates anytime soon. One weekend, the two of them are at Wyatt's house while his parents are away. As the two friends watch Frankenstein, they are inspired to conduct a science experiment, one similar to that of Dr. Frankenstein, but instead of reanimating corpses, they will use Wyatt's computer to create a new woman! They feed information into the computer to make sure this woman is both good looking and highly intelligent, and hack into a government computer to get more power! The experiment causes a violent lightning bolt to strike and make a huge mess around the boys, but after this chaos is over, Gary and Wyatt's bold experiment proves to be a success! They find their new woman in the room with them, and it turns out she is gorgeous, intelligent, devoted to the boys, and even has superpowers! The teenage friends decide to name her Lisa, and they are in for some bizarre experiences as she tries to help them gain popularity! The beginning of this movie shows Gary and Wyatt watching gymnasts at school, fantasizing about them, and then getting pantsed by bullies. It looks like the film could be reasonably funny (though I'm not sure how funny the pantsing part is), but not necessarily anything great. However, it soon gets funnier, probably around the time the experiment causes destruction, and I certainly found laughs while seeing Gary and Wyatt in the shower with their new computer-generated woman and then going out with her. The film soon goes downhill again, and I didn't think the part with Gary and Wyatt getting drinks poured on them was very funny, though there certainly are still funny parts around this point. Weird Science soon improves again, I think starting with the scene showing Lisa meeting Gary's parents for the first time and telling them things he doesn't want them to know, which is definitely a comic highlight of the film. From this point on, I thought this 1985 fantasy comedy was consistently entertaining, not just with the humour (though there is lots of that), but also with the bizarre story, which made me constantly wonder what was going to happen next! Kelly LeBrock, who plays Lisa, sure is hot in this movie, and I like the powerful character she plays.Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Weird Science are all John Hughes films featuring Anthony Michael Hall in the cast, and the main characters in all of these movies are high school students. However, the first two are both realistic films, with no fantasy in them, and that's far from the case with this one! Yes, this is one bizarre film, combining not just comedy and romance, but also sci-fi, a genre which Hughes was not usually associated with. If you've seen this film's two predecessors and haven't seen this third one of the bunch but are intending to, I strongly advise you to keep all that in mind! I can imagine many people who usually like Hughes' teen movies really being put off by how over-the-top this particular one is! Still, watching it shortly after Sixteen Candles, I think this bizarre 1985 comedy is the stronger of the two, even if most viewers would disagree. If you have some idea of what you're in for and still want to watch Weird Science, I won't advise you not to.

As you can tell, this is a nerds wet dream come true and before watching this movie it's very important to turn your brain off. I must admit that I was really disliking this thing for the first hour but things finally got so campy that I started to have a little fun with it. I still think this is a disappointing movie that doesn't live up to its cult status but at the same time I've seen a lot worse. I think the best thing the film has going for it are the performances by the three leads and some of the supporting players. Anthony Michael Hall fits that nerd role perfectly and he's also quite believable towards the end of the film when he fills out the role of someone cooler. LeBrock clearly steals the film as she looks incredibly good and her performance is nice as well. I thought she did a terrific job no matter what the scene called for and she really brought the film up a few notches. Bill Paxton was fun in the role of the mean brother and Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't do too bad of a job as one of the bullies. Cult favorite Michael Berryman (THE HILLS HAVE EYES) has a small but nice role as a biker mutant. The biggest fault of the film has to be the screenplay, which is somewhat of a shock considering Hughes is best known for this. I think his dialogue is perfectly fitting and I think the original storyline is good as well. The problem is that very little is done with that storyline and everything is just way too predictable. There are many cute moments but in the end the movie is just a tad bit too brain dead for its own good and a stronger story would have certainly helped.

Combining elements from his previous movie, Sixteen Candles, and the science-fiction genre, Hughes creates a world that isn't fully rooted in reality but has realistic characters you are able to interact with. As the story goes, two nerds are tired of being made fun of and perceived as uncool. They decide to use their computer and create the perfect woman which will then elevate their status at school and in society, they think. What they don't count on is that it turns out to be an intelligent, English woman who has more in store for them than they wanted.To get right down to it, this is the most unusual of the John Hughes movies but it also maintains that message that is so prominent in other movies like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. I didn't grow up in the 80's, but I am sure that teens felt ostracized and left out in many aspects of their life, least not including high school. What Hughes has done with the three aforementioned movies as well as others later in his career is that he has created characters that are memorable, flawed and willing to listen to change that could benefit them. To enjoy this you have to look past the bizarre climax and the other subplots and appreciate that someone made a movie for you as a teenager, a person and not just a dollar sign.

My mind had totally stashed away the memories until this week when the movie was on TV. WOW! If you haven't seen the movie recently, it's worth seeing again.The plot (for those who can't remember it) centers around these two nerds (gary and Wyatt) who decide to create a virtual woman on their computer during a weekend sleepover. The plan goes awry when a real woman (Lisa) pops out of their computer. She not only looks like a goddess but has super powers. In scenes inspired by classic shows such as I dream of Jeanie and bewitched, the guys spend the entire weekend doing damage control for the crazy things that she causes to happen. in the midst of it all, there is a coming of age for the boys, who must face bullies and unpopularity in their quest for girlfriends and acceptance among their peers.Lisa does everything to make these guys the epitome of 80's cool. Big hair, skinny ties, suits with shoulder pads, a Ferrari and 911 Porsche, the classic pink Cadillac, etc. The soundtrack is distinctly 80's, with songs by the General Public and Oingo Boingo as some of the stand outs.A pleasant surprise about this movie is how well it has held up over the years. The scene when dorky Wyatt and Gary end up in an all black bar with Lisa still works. Un-pc as it is, the scene where Gary gets drunk and tries to talk like a black man is still hilarious.This movie has several elements I really dig as an adult that were beyond me as a kid. First, Kelly Lebrock's powers and sensuality are both great analogies for the explosive sexuality of a woman and the insecurity of what it is to be a teenage boy. Much like Bewitched and I dream of Jeanie an incredibly sensual woman uses her powers and these dorks spend all their time begging her not to use them. Despite the fact that she is supposed to do whatever Gary and Wyatt ask of her, she is still totally intimidating to them.In one discussion of why the movie Elektra failed, the critic mentioned that while teenage boys find older women really sexy, they also find them scary. To keep it's appeal to the under 18 set, the movie constantly plays on how intimidated regular guys would be if a real woman were to just pop into their lives.With the old school modem and graphics, the movie also gives a peek into how the world viewed computers not even 20 years ago. There was clearly a belief that someday, computers would be able to do anything, even create life. Author William Gibson envisioned an internet where people would literally plug themselves into their computers. In this movie, the computer has the power of creation. Time has proved that these things are possible, just not quite as sci fi types envisioned them. We do have an internet, but we don't plug our bodies into the computer. And while games like Sims and GTA San Andreas make it possible to have a virtual girlfriend, it's not quite what this movie envisioned.The clutch of this movie is of course the girl herself. Kelly Lebrock sizzles in this movie. She has an understated sexy confidence about her that has not been replicated by anyone other than Angelina Jolie, and her sense of comedic timing is spot on. It's a shame that she more or less disappeared after this movie was made, because she is very memorable in this film. The scene where she picks up Gary at his parents house is the best take on meet the parents EVER.Finally, this movie served as a great launching pad for a lot of careers. Anthony Michael Hall would have probably become a star if only his next movies had been good (instead of the silly Out of Bounds and the pathetic Johnny Be Good), but Bill Paxton (who's role as Gary's older brother alone is worth the price of a rental) went on to become a well known a-lister and this early role is classic Paxton (I'd argue that his role as Hudson in the 1986 movie Aliens is probably Paxton at his best).So, for the soundtrack, the old school science fiction, the bikini-concept of women's sexuality as something dangerous, and the launch of some great stars, this is a movie well worth revisiting.

The usual high school hi-jinx are on display with plenty of teen sex jokes, except unlike past John Hughes comedies, this has elements of science-fiction and the supernatural. I think the movie works so well because of the marvelous chemistry between Michael Hall, Ilan Mitchell-Smith(..as Hall's nerdy pal, Wyatt)and LeBrock. The Frankenstein idea of how Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith is merely playing on our teenage fantasies..I know when I was a youth that LeBrock was certainly a fixture in my pleasant dreams during puberty! LeBrock was in her element, positively a knock-out, with a confidence(..and figure)and swagger that I'm sure had many a gal jealous. She's ideally cast as the fantasy babe, but Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith compliment her very well as our dorky heroes. Bill Paxton steals his scenes as Mitchell-Smith's goofy, crude, bullying brother, Chet.This film stretches the PG-13 rating to the limit and features pretty coarse dialogue and situations for a movie aimed at teens. After all is said and done, the movie's message is similar to other stories penned by the late John Hughes..thanks in part to (im)proper guidance, the nerdy boys find guts to stand up for themselves while wooing lovely girls(Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson) in the process. Robert Rusler and Robert Downey Jr(..two years before hitting paydirt with LESS THAN ZERO)are the two popular high schoolers who pick on Michael Hall and Mitchell-Smith and desire to get a shot at LeBrock.

So this movie is no exception but where it differs is its bizarre way of hammering home the obvious messages this film contains.The plot for those who aren't aware concerns two 'nerds' who decide to create a woman using their computer(!).  As a young teen myself watching this for the first time I never really considered how totally out there this John Hughes film is.  Apart from the idea of creating a perfect woman who does everything you want (a horrendously sexist idea that is hardly redeemed by the weak moralising at the end), we have snow falling in someones' bedroom, a kitchen turned blue, nuclear warheads sprouting through a bedroom floor and furniture flying through chimneys.  The one part of this film that really strikes me as odd is where did Kelly Le Brock (who plays Lisa the created woman) get her powers to make all this weird stuff happen?I was pretty disappointed when I revisited this.  Nostalgia had created this movie as a minor classic in my rose tinted eyes. In reality all I found was a plot full of holes, an unpleasant teen fantasy and a director who looked like he couldn't give a damn about any more 'nerdy teens come good'.

I was hyped to see it. Holy crap was I in for a surprise. I wasn't able to watch this all the way through this thing. I knew something was up when the kids (kids, mind you) walk by wearing black thongs. Excuse me? Isn't that illegal? What the heck kind of anti-pedophilia standards did the 80's have (if any)? The bizarre direct sexual contact between our adult lead and the 14/15 year old boys continues, getting more and more explicit until they're tongue-kissing for a very, VERY long time. I turned the movie off after that. Sorry for being a prude, but these are kids. This is actually happening. I know it was the norm for a lot of 80's films (Carrie, Sixteen Candles, Blue Lagoon, for example) to show actors under 18 in nude and sexually interactive scenes, but that just doesn't fly today.

Minuses The girl is created in the first few minutes of the film and there's no real surprise from anyone. It's just given that she's there.

Although Hughes' films Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day off, Planes Trains Automobiles, and The Breakfast Club are more highly remembered and regarded and all have a message to them, WEIRD SCIENCE is just a pure, fun comedy. The movie stars famed 80s 'Brat-packer' Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) and the not-so-famous Ilan-Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) as two uber-nerds who are mocked, socked, rocked, and jocked continuously throughout the film by their 'more cool' high school counterparts. To get even and become more cool themselves, Gary and Wyatt create the perfect woman 'Lisa' (played beautifully by super duper hot and exotic 80s British model-icon Kelly LeBrock; more on her later). Late one Friday night at Wyatt's house while his parents are away, inspired by watching the classic film FRANKENSTEIN, they create her with various 80s gadgets and objects (an Apple computer, pictures from model magazines, and a Barbie doll that is connected to the parts from the popular old-style game Operation)They even give her a brain and make her super-smart! I know it sounds ludicrous, but its a fantasy-comedy, with the emphasis on comedy.Anthony Michael Hall (as Gary) is nothing short of comic genius in this movie. He just lets it all go and gives one of the most memorable laugh-out-loud comic performances. He has a great, hilarious scene early in the movie in a blues club where Lisa takes Gary and Wyatt to. In this scene, Hall mimics and sounds just like an old, world-weary, club-hanging soul brother and carries it off to perfection. He also sports 'big eyes' throughout the movie at various times to great effect and it totally works. Ilan-Mitchell Smith, even though the movie sports them as a duo, is less funny, but still he works well as Gary's sidekick and on repeated viewing is very watchable himself.Now to 'Lisa'. Kelly LeBrock! What a forgotten bombshell from the 80s! She did this movie, The Woman in Red, Hard to Kill and was never heard from again. But she ought to be remembered for Weird Science. She is 100% total hotness! Gorgeous to look at from beginning to end, she is no supporting character either. She's essentially the female lead and is totally sexy and funny. She looks and acts like she's having fun throughout. And she has some great throwaway lines ('Rex Harrison hat'; trust me, you'll laugh when you see and hear her delivery of it). Even though she is the boys' creation, Lisa is pure fun and has more personality than most humans! She's the ANTI-FRANKENSTEIN, or the ANTI-BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, if you prefer! Lisa gives Gary and Wyatt the confidence they need to become cool like the rest of their high school compadres.Also along for the fun in great supporting roles are Bill Paxton (before he became Mr. Big Shot in the 90s) as Wyatt's older, Neanderthal, jerk of a brother Chet and Robert Downey,Jr. (as one of the guys taunting and bullying Gary and Wyatt throughout). Of course, the movie has its obligatory, happy ending where Gary and Wyatt (thanks to Lisa) get the girls (a couple of standard, high school Madonnas) and well, as for the 'make-believe' Lisa, you'll be happy how it all ends up with her too. Being an 80s movie, obviously the technology looks and is very dated, but that's part of the fun. Also, there's a few moments, especially at the climactic party at Wyatt's house, that don't come off as funny as they should be, but they are few and far in between. The movie, in addition to being funny, also works as a piece of 80s nostalgia that makes you want to be in high school again w/o any cares and makes you just want to party.A fun, funny, 80s teen flick that takes me back to the good ole days!

This was American Pie and Dude, Where's My Car for my generation. But, it has sadly fallen on tough times. Any 20 year old movie would show its age; the effects, the clothes and the slang are all terribly dated now, but that happens to all movies.Where this movie got killed was in syndication. Since, it was so popular, it got shown on many of the big cable networks like TNT, USA and TBS. But, those networks also cut the movie up to fit with broadcast standards. So, not only does it look like an old movie, some of the dialog is dubbed over (badly) to remove any offensive words and some funny scenes are just cut altogether to make it more family friendly. And in so doing, the film is almost unwatchable. So, any teen watching this movie today will be left wondering what the big deal was. If you can see the uncut version, this is a fun film. But unless it magically appears on DVD, it will probably remain a joke that kids born after 1985 just don't get.

And the highlight of the movie for me, was when Kelly LeBrock, asks the two guys what her name should be, and A.M.H. says, How 'bout Lisa?  I about died!  If you'll notice what my name is, that just made my whole day when I saw that. But really the movie wasn't as good as so many make it out to be.  It was a little too juvenile and a lot of the acting was very bland.  The kid who played A.M.H.'s sidekick/buddy did not impress me all that much, and I was shocked to see Bill Paxton play such an imbecile, although he played it almost too naturally...it gave me some suspicions.But, of course the only person who really did a good job was Anthony. He is a true talent even today, especially in Pirates Of Silicon Valley, which he did a terrific job in.  However,  I don't understand what all the fuss is about with regards to LeBrock.  In my opinion, there are a lot of other girls/women who are much prettier, and frankly more talented.  But I won't sell her short, she did do a good job in the movie, but let's face it, there wasn't much to act to.

Two teenage misfits create a woman using a computer.  She prods them to improve their teenage lives and shows them how to have fun.  The humor is often slapstick schtick.  Many of the jokes are obvious.

Like many of his masterpieces, this tale is set in fictional Shermer, Illinois, which must be near Chicago. It starts out with two dorks (Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who set out to become popular by creating their dream babe on the computer. Their idea is straight-forward hanging out with a 10 will make them popular. Once they create Lisa (Kelley LeBrock), the hijinx begin and it does not appear that their plan will work. Until finally, everything does work out and they get the girls and live happily ever after. The reason I skipped the middle part is because it must be watched, and I am too damn lazy to go into it. Notable appearances come from Robert Downey Jr (Ian) and Bill Paxton (Chet).The DVD is pretty good but lacks any features whatsoever. There are no subtitles, no trailer, nothing but the movie, but the movie is so good that the DVD is worth owning. This will bring you back to the days of ultra-hip skinny ties, feathered hair, and English Beat songs. I will give the movie a 9.5, and the DVD itself a 5.

So, all comedies are not funny anymore after you've seen them for quite a few times, but the difference with Weird Science is that you can still watch it over and over again, without getting bored with it.  It is fun to watch, and it should appeal to anyone, not people who were teenagers in the 80's.  I myself, am now only 19, so, I was no teenager in the 80's, but with an intelligent, objective, opinion, I'd say 80's movies and music are the best.Despite the fact that Wyatt and Gary create Lisa, who cares if it is unrealistic?  If you can live yourself into this movie, become part of the fun, you'd have a ball.All the main characters are very funny.  Parts I single out is Lisa asking the old lady for advice on underwear for a 15 year-old; Chet turning into that little monster, Gary and Wyatt in the mall, the list goes on!Even the special effects are quite good for that time.Apart from funny moments throughout the movie, in the end you can also learn something, where Gary says to Debbie  Because I want you to like me for me, and she replies  Whatever you are I like it.  Whereas today, money, looks, etc. are the thing.It is also so sweet in the end, where Lisa says goodbye, what she says to them, the farewell, it is just so overall endearing!  Which just makes you love this movie even more.The sound track is also quite nice, with Weird Science being played at just the right moment each time.I've come across a few people who always give negative comments about this movie, and surprisingly enough they're all teenagers in the 90's mostly. My advice to anyone watching this movie, remember the 80's was a different era than now, the fashion, the music, everything was different.  Take time out, and just see this movie for what it is, a great fun-filled movie, that anyone can enjoy.  The prejudice that such a lot of people have against the 80's is beyond comprehension to me anyway.  Anyone who watches it, cant help but go crazy about Gary, Wyatt and Lisa, who are all such endearing characters.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the fashion and the music in it just adds to that 80's nostalgia that this film gives you.To end off this movie could do with a sequel, with Gary and Wyatt, married, life going downhill again, and once again calling upon Lisa to straighten them out.I gave it 10/10.  Watch and see if you do too.

Their main criticisms of this film seemed to be based on the fact that it is a 1980s movie and therefore must be completely irrelevant and trashy, fourteen years later.What?!?Just because something is old, is it automatically defunct? Is anything from the 80s defined as crap, solely because it is from the 80s?Well, I'd better go and throw myself off a bridge or something, because I was born in 1980 and therefore I must be Past My Use-By Date, and perhaps No Longer Of Any Relevance To This Glorious Decade.But seriously folks. I realise that the 90s is a very anger-oriented decade, and people like to hate anything that isn't from the 90s just because it's fashionable to do so. But that just isn't what the art of film-making is about. Film-making is about being on the cutting edge, indeed, but it is also about respecting fine traditions laid down (gasp) in the past, even (shock, horror) in the 80s. Many 90s films, in their attempts to be avant-garde and completely different to everything from the past, just end up going overboard and get tripped up by their own self-conscious sensationalism.But I digress. This film may indeed contain music and fashions that are different to the somewhat ridiculous contemporary 90s equivalents. But don't judge a book by its cover. Beneath the very 80s exterior lies a brilliantly funny movie, with themes and ideas that are just as relevant today as they were in the 1980s. And the special effects still look good today; they don't have that oh-so-clichéd 90s computer-generated tackiness. And what other film have you ever seen that involves a grand piano being launched from a chimney and landing on a summer-house? I give this film a solid *** and a half out of ****. And remember, what goes around comes around People in 2013 will be laughing their heads off at the bad fashions, horrid music and corny special effects from the movies of 1999. The 80s have a certain timelessness, however, evident in such great movies as this one.

Wyatt can do it on his computer--with a little help from a larger computer somewhere else that he hacks into. The 'woman' is only a simulation until lightning strikes the house. A real woman appears wearing next to nothing, and at that very moment Dr. Frankenstein says from the TV upstairs, 'She's alive!'

And the boys learn this important lesson, and about the best way to be popular with the other teens. After going through some really weird situations including killer mutants and a nuclear missile in the basement.Kelly LeBrock delivered a decent performance. In movies such as this you would expect the girl to be a perennially happy brainless bimbo. Lisa is not. She has a brain and she cares about what the boys need, not just what they want. And if they need to be taught lessons, she gives the boys what they think they want.I did not care for Wyatt's mean brother Chet. Wyatt's grandparents made a brief appearance that was campy. I liked the men in the blues club and the bartender in a later scene. The visual effects were pretty good but not groundbreaking.

It still gets some good gags in and Bill Paxton has the role of a lifetime as Chet, the abusive older brother of one of the protagonists of the film. All the scenes with Paxton are hilarious and I dare you not to laugh out loud when he delivers the wedgie.Kelly Lebrock is so hot in this and that voice is so sexy. When I was a kid, this was as cool as female roles got.Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith flounder as the two leads. They are not very likable and while AMH at least has something going for him, Ilan is terribly miscast and that voice will haunt you. It is not surprising Ilan never made much of himself as an actor.They play this on TV a lot and I'm giving you the OK to check it out the next time they do. It has enough funny scenes to validate watching it and has a genuine classic movie character in Chet.

My boyfriend is a fan of that movie so I decided to watch it, even though I was septic. I didn't know it was made by John Hughes when I rented it, and I thought I was going to see just another 80's goofy comedy, which is pretty much what it is in general.I'm not sure if I liked that movie. I liked the silly story, two geeky teenagers making the perfect woman with their computer who becomes like a big sister to them who gives them advice. It's also so badly made and silly that it can be hilarious for that reason.  Just watch the scene where they create the girl But sometimes it just seemed like an excuse to give real geeky guys something to dream about. The two main characters aren't even that interesting or funny. One of them is a fun character because he's very shy and scared of people around him, but in my opinion, the other character is extremely annoying. I usually like pointless and goofy movies but I was completely discouraged at the end of this movie when there was an attempt at a love story. I know this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but come on...I didn't find this movie very funny overall. It just seemed like another sex comedy for teens. It's sort of like a really bad cross between American Pie and Mannequin. I laughed sometimes, by example, when the two protagonists have bras over their heads, but I don't think anything made me laugh aside from this scene and the general goofy-ness of the movie.I'm not going to talk about the acting either. The appeal in a movie like this one is that it's so stupid and badly made that it can be fun to watch. It can be a good addition to your 80's classic comedies collection as well.

It is simply a feel good 80's movie that shows the lengths that people would go to to be accepted. Ok so maybe no-one would actually create someone on their computer, as thats not possible, but there would have been no point to the film if that hadn't have happened. The actors chosen for the roles were, in my opinion, perfect. They were just the right kinda of people, geeky looking enough to fool, but then handsome enough to carry off the new 'look' Lisa gave them. I wasn't as keen on Lisa's character as I personally thought that she was too...i dunno, too bitchy and condesending. She didn't seem to fit into the character very well. I loved the characters that were played by Robert Downey Jr and Bill Paxton. They were just so typically condesending and nasty!With Paxton as the All American big bro, wanting money and other payments as bribes. Downey Jr was just right as the school bully and hunk (soz but he was !!!) All in all the preformances in this movie were just right for the movie and decade....cheesy but cute.

I did enjoy the film emensly, in that I was laughing my head off at it, but it wasn't because of well crafted and creative humor but more in the vain of the what the hell's going on type of humor that floods this film. I heard that it was written in just a couple of hours, which looking at it seems to make perfect sense seeings the plot is so loosley put together and the situations so far fetched it's almost as if John Hughes asked us to forget about logic for a couple of hours and just sit back and enjoy the ride, this I did, and I was not disappointed.

Basically, with the help of a little computer magic, two dateless dweebs create a dream girl one late Friday night.  She turns out to be an English stunner (Le Brock) who gets them partying, meeting girls, and driving fancy cars.  Once you accept the fact that this is totally fantasy that could never happen, you should have fun.  Hall and Smith are very good together as the buddies, and Paxton is a real standout as the pushy, abusive older brother (who gets turned into some sort of midget-alien in the films funniest moment).

Leonard Maltin describes John Hughes as that shameless panderer to teens, and that's as good a description as any, even if I consider it rather too polite when you consider who we're dealing with. When I was fifteen, I was a big fan of Monty Python, so watching this trash after LIFE OF BRIAN was like following a gourmet banquet with a Big Mac. Once again, Hughes rolls out every stereotype in the book (and some of the most unutterably crass and disgusting dialogue, even in this lowly context) and pads out his paper-thin conceits with a dire cast of unappealing louts, and tops the whole unappetizing recipe with the vacuous talent-free zone that is Kelly LeBrock. The only decent actor in this mess is everyone's favourite movie mutant, the one and only Michael Berryman (THE HILLS HAVE EYES), obviously embarrassed and just paying the bills as a biker. It's worth mentioning that my mother, at the time closing in on fifty, loved this uninspiring trudge through the sludge of Hughes's otherwise empty brain. I told her this is for KIDS! You should be ASHAMED of yourself!, and she countered that I was just being facetious and humourless. Almost twenty years on, I still think this film is as good a trigger for advanced manic depression as any car wreck, serious bereavement or crippling financial difficulty, and the fact that there are still dozens of copies of this in just about every video store in town only compounds my long-held point of view that there is indeed no justice in the world. Oh yes, and it's no wonder Anthony Michael Hall later developed a geek complex and went on to do several bad action thrillers.

I had never seen it before because when it came out I was at the end of my teens and was already into horror but the story always attracted me due being based on Frankenstein, and by doing they added a lot of screenshots from the Universal classic (1931).But I must say that I never laughed it out loud . I was more watching it for other reasons and no you are wrong, not for Kelly Lebrock (Lisa) in her sexy outfit. This is one of the earlier flicks with Robert Downey Jr. with his other teeth. You know what I mean when you are going to watch it. Michael Berryman is also to spot as a biker, you know him from The Hills Have Eyes (1977). The jokes are really stupid and so predictable that for me it was all a bad joke. Didn't like it at all but it must be me because it even spawned a series (1994). A classic, not for me.

Look at the casting. Anthony Michael Hall was tolerable in other John Hughes' movies as a supporting character, filling the nerd quotient. As a lead, however(even a lead nerd)?...I think that question answers itself. Who was Robert Downey, Jr. supposed to be playing? Were the love interests some of the worst drawn roles ever? The only character I liked was Lisa and Vanessa Angel proved to be a much better choice for the role 10 years later.There were a lot of great 80's movies about teens and for them, but Weird Science just doesn't belong. The only way I think you'd genuinely like this film is if you believe in ridiculously fantastical plots or Bill Paxton's ridiculously bad haircut. "}]
