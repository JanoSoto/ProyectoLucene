Insultingly stupid. I really only watched it to see Josh Hartnett, who mercifully was spared a lot of the embarrassment.  Then again, there is so much to be embarrassed about, so much to go around, he could have taken some on to ease the burden for all the 'adults' who are on display dishonoring their craft. Diane Keaton should have the most explaining to do, as she sleep-walks through her part.  She also has some difficult-to-hear dialogue, some of it involving husband Warren's endowment. No, scratch that...Charlton Heston, as a character who has no business in the movie in the first place, has the most to explain.  The scene where he threatens a party with a gun made the NRA also require an explanation.No, wait... the trio of Jenna Elfman, Andie McDowell and Nastassia Kinski, as the women in Warren's life..they appear at will or when the situation calls for something illogical to happen. I guess I should settle this by giving the award to Warren, who still has 'Ishtar' to apologize for.  Its obvious in some ways its his movie, as the majority of the cast has worked with or for him before.  What a great friend you are, Warren!  Good thing for us you're not an agent, then good actors would do garbage like this more often.  1/10, needless to say.  Avoid the pain.

That's the plot in a nutshell, old Warren pretending it's 1966 when swingers like him hopped on the nearest woman as regularly as they hopped on a plane.Seriously, there is no plot.  Every washed-up actor or actress in Hollywood is invited to drop by to make an ass of him (or her) self, including Charleton Heston, who must have already been in the grip of his recently-announced Alzheimer's Disease.  I know rents are high in Los Angeles, but how badly do these people need money?  And did any of them even get any?  This stinker can't have made a nickel.I can't summarize this mess because there was no rhyme or reason anywhere. I can't describe the wild over-acting, except to call it amateur night.

With more than its share of ineptly written dialog and clumsily staged scenes, it is atrocious.  Town & Country is suppose to be a humorous look at the upper middle class and the sexual misadventures of two happily married couples.    There are too many superfluous scenes that should have been edited out of the movie because they go nowhere.  Then there are the sequences in which one immediately knows what will happen, but seem to be interminably stretched out as aggravating time filler.  If Warren Beatty wanted to look like a nincompoop, he has succeeded.  Town & Country feels like a retread of past comedies, but very poorly imitated.  As the jilted spouses, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn come off fine.  Andie MacDowell's character manages to pad at least another twenty minutes to the film.  She displays the amazing eyesight of an eagle because, while riding in a ski lift, she can spot Warren Beatty's character from at least thirty feet away when he is dressed as a fly fisherman with a floppy hat covering all of his hair and obscuring his face, reminiscent of Jack Lemmon in Grumpy Old Men.  Nastassja Kinski, as a cellist having an affair with Beatty, received sixth billing and more than holds her own and is one of the few bright spots of this film.  The opening scene has Warren Beatty watching her play the cello with her completely naked.  He simultaneously confesses in a voice over that he is not interested in classical music and that he is making a mistake.  The initial shot of Nastassja is from behind her in which we see two musical clefts symmetrically painted onto her naked back - except that this is a credited cello body double.  The closing credits list the actors in order of appearance so that Nastassja Kinski is listed second after Warren Beatty - very clever on her part.Town & Country was a box office dud that can best be appreciated if one is drunk.

But I was unaware of the nightmare it was to film it & release it; all I did know was that it was in & out of the theater faster than COOL AS ICE. I had no idea this movie even existed until I read James Robert Parish's book FIASCO, which has a chapter on the making of TOWN & COUNTRY...and which, rest assured, is more funny & believable than what shows up on the screen.After searching relatively high & low to find this movie (it was released on DVD, but logically, stores do not exactly keep a copy on hand), I watched it knowing about its history & that chances are, I would likely want to throw things at the screen. I am glad to say I made it through the first viewing alive, but will start by saying that no, this movie is not a winner in the slightest. Yet is it an all-around creative bomb? Not so fast.Starting to film without a complete script was the oldest mistake in the book & they made it. Yet while it may have been a patchwork effort without much rhyme or reason, some lines were funny & rather inspired (most of them coming from Garry Shandling, who almost walks away with the movie, such as it is). Maybe having mature, veteran actors mouth some of the more scatological dialogue (as if this was supposed to be a senior's version of American PIE) was not wise, but that is often funny to watch in itself. Diane Keaton's line near the end, Is there any women in this room you haven't slept with?, could easily be what audiences have been wondering for years. The only thing the script missed was continuity & structure, and all that showed on the screen, resulting in a film that looked & acted choppy, with many characters played by big names being reduced to glorified cameos, making you wonder if there is a lot left on the cutting room floor (but we cannot blame the editor for all that, seeing as how they did not have much to work with). The producers should have been well aware that working with Warren Beatty, a famously noncommittal perfectionist, was not going to be clear sailing. Part of (if not all) the script problems can be laid at his door, since he kept insisting on changes to the dialogue, taking up time & (most obviously) money. And of course, Warren was in his early 60s when he made this movie, playing the same old Casanova he always did. Audiences, most especially the young people who make up a large part of who goes to the movies, are not going to buy that anymore, or are unwilling to try. The studio should have saw this in the beginning & realized the chances of a box office success were slim to none, and thus rein in the budget before it went haywire.After reading Parish's book & seeing just how things went bad with TOWN & COUNTRY, I rather think a movie about the making of a movie like TOWN & COUNTRY would have been better (and with all the same actors). What went on behind the scenes was funny & screwball in itself, and most of all, it was not even scripted at all. There was potential for a movie like TOWN & COUNTRY, but if a script had been agreed on before the cameras started rolling, then the financial fallout would not have been so large. As it remains now, it is one of the biggest box-office duds in Hollywood history, and the chances of it ever turning a profit are almost nonexistent (just think about inflation).Final thoughts For what it was worth, the actors gave it their best shot with this movie, never once placing tongue firmly in cheek with their parts (though, by all accounts, that would have improved things). I am not sure if anyone of them knew they were making something special.A good portion of the script was actually funny, but whenever it tried to get serious & make some kind of statement about infidelity & morality, it went downhill from there. Even the much-bandied-about ending is so artificial & predictable, you can see it coming from a mile away. More of a cop-out & a feeling of Let's just finish this thing already! Most of the people involved in making this movie have survived professionally, but only time will tell how Warren Beatty fares (that is, if he makes another movie again). Hopefully, the TOWN & COUNTRY incident awoke him to the fact he needs to finally revise (or abandon altogether) his stock character if he ever wants to work regularly & be taken seriously again.

It had a totally incoherent plot that was doomed right from the get-go. The movie felt so choppy and badly edited (considering it was re-edited and rewrote many times). Characters went from one place to another without any reason. I mean, one minute Porter was in bed with a lady (he met just a few movie minutes ago)and then he was back home again. I couldn't understand what the hell was going on in the movie most of the time. The only saving grace that kept me from totally tuning this film out was when Jenna Elfman came on screen but her role was so miscast and she didn't fit in at all with the dumb story. This movie made little sense and was way too serious to be considered a comedy. There wasn't much at all funny about this. I probably laughed maybe twice, and they weren't even good laughs either. Town and Country spent 3 years gathering dust on the shelf before it was pulled down and finally finished, and the result was this fiasco. There was a great cast of actors and actresses who all had successful careers before this film; three of them won Oscars. Now after this film, some of these people are struggling to find work such as Warren Beatty who hasn't been in a film since this one. Others have been more lucky such as Diane Keaton and Elfman and the director managed to stay a float as he did some other films that weren't exactly home runs (Hannah Montana The Movie), but fared far better than T & C. The only thing I got out of this movie A man cheats on his wife, pays the consequences, another man does the same thing, then comes out as gay, and a man comes in with a shotgun. Oh, and the polar bear scene that was rather strange and kind of funny. The movie's dumb, cheesy ending didn't give me any bit of hope that I would like to come back and give this film another shot to try to make some sense out of it. I kept on checking the time to see when this train wreck would end. It really did feel like the cast and crew had to find a way to end the nightmare so the ending it was.I expected this movie to be a disaster based on what I read about it being one of the biggest box office flops in American film history and reading reviews.

The sub-plot with flirtatious Andie MacDowell bringing Beatty home to meet her bombastic parents is bad enough to stop the picture dead in its tracks, and it really never recovers from this gaping pothole.

Fun to watch the actors, but doesn't offer quite enough. **1/2 (out of four)","Date":"2 May 2001","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  TOWN & COUNTRY / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French 	 After being rescheduled more times than you can count on one hand, finally Town & Country hits theaters. With more production problems than my neighbor's dog has flees, I was not expecting the film to be of any extraordinary quality. It isn't. I did, considering the respectable cast and crew, expect to laugh. I did, but not enough. This is the kind of comedy where we laugh when the jokes are presented, but there are not enough of them. Therefore, we want more, but the movie never delivers-leaving us with a feeling of disappointment. With a budget of over 90 million and shooting dates that range over three years, this film should have been the pearl of the ocean. Although Town & Country has its moments of hilarity, insight, and interest, the film as a whole does not quite work.	Town & Country stars Warren Beatty, whose previous satire Bulworth offered more biting comedy than this film multiplied by three. He plays Porter Stoddard, an acclaimed New York architect, who is having an affair with a beautiful, married musician (Nastassja Kinski). Porter has a wealthy lifestyle and a loving wife, Ellie (Diane Keaton), who suspects nothing from her husband for 25 years. The Stoddard's have a close-nit friendship with another couple, Mona (Goldie Hawn), and Griffin (Garry Shandling from What Planet Are You From?). Griffin is also committing adultery, but his wife discovers his betrayal and immediately dumps him-even though she is not exactly faithful herself. 	The setup is basically just a clothesline from which other related situations evolve. Although often interesting, adultery isn't enough to develop a story over 100 minutes in length. The movie begins well (after some painful music during the opening credits) but stumbles very early, with its characters wandering from scene to scene with nothing much to do or say.  Then the story becomes redundant, with Porter making the same mistakes repeatedly. But surprisingly, there is very little tension involved with the plot, simply because we do not care about the characters. There is just not enough at stake here. There are a few hilarious scenes that transpire when the characters attempt to cover up their deceitful decisions, and the actors are consistently fun to watch, with likable chemistry and energy. The cast does a great job with their charismatic and entertaining performances, making this movie relatively easy to watch. But even they can't bring enough life into this otherwise desperate, deprived material.	Town & Country is clearly trying to say that people can engage in adultery without much effort or thought, but it is not fulfilling or constructive. During the film's closing minutes, Porter explains, in a scene much too obvious for its own good, that sex has not filled the emptiness inside him. We never believe that Porter felt such loneliness, however, for several reasons1)  Warren Beatty does not do a convincing job at executing his character's emotions. All of the characters feel very external. We seldom feel anything for any of them.2)  The story runs into a particularly noticeable series of problems during its last third. When it should be calming down, focusing in on the character's emotional areas, it does exactly the opposite introduces new events completely unrelated to the material before. We also meet numerous characters that only distract us from the movie's theme. There is some funny material within these segments of the movie, but for the most part, these sequences really detour the plot.Town & Country isn't as bad as many people are saying. It is just a disappointment considering the ample potential. With 90 million dollars, over three years, and names like Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Garry Shandling, Andie MacDowell, and Charlton Heston, we come to expect a whole lot more. I have seen special effects laden action thrillers made for half the cost of Town & Country and much less talent, but so much more was projected on the screen. The only thing this production does with its talent and money is prove that raunchy sex comedies can be made with older generations too.

Just as the publicity machine talks us into believing films are good (like the muddled `Spider-man'), they need and love stories when they can convince us the opposite.Yes, all these actors are second-raters. Yes, the script starts at TeeVee level and wanders, giving us episodically-linked skits. Yes, everyone is old, even the here-luscious Kinski. Yes, the template is centuries-old and predictable. Yes, the dialog lacks zing and compared to Farrellys (for instance) it lacks edge. But except for the age, the same can be said of the execrable but much-celebrated `Tenenbaums.'The difference is that although the studio has sliced and diced this, there are still some funny bits. Very funny bits, like the polar bear/ Monroe oral sex scene. Very appealing segments like the exuberant Kinski announcing her pregnancy. Some lowkey setups like Master Beatty walking through his house and hearing each of his children, then the help furiously screwing, then all the men come out to the kitchen. Beatty's timing is great he has the ability to coordinate his movements with his comic reactions. Its natural and effective.Obviously, the project has suffered from different cores being swapped in and out. The now watered down scenes in front of the lawyer are an example. They were designed to be like the author/advisor role in `You Can Count on Me.' But there is one core, now muted, that I really liked, the metaphor of building and relationship. It was horribly crude and bungled with `Life as a House,' `Til There was You,' and others. But there are some signs here of a potentially successful project.Porter is an architect. Though most of this is cut, he is designing the `Design Center' that will honor his wife. This is just as the country house which he designed and built and she `decorated.' The awry weathervane of that house is an obvious if heavy symbol. When Mona decides to build her own new life, she aptly chooses a decayed plantation house, while Griffin chooses a cabin. Griffin by the way is a supplier of `furnishings.' There's lots of going to and from these houses and the design center, which must have originally carried meaning.A central quote early on `like old buildings and new relationships.' The cheating husband is thrown out the window.The metaphor carries to the `house' of ourselves -- lots of costumes the polar bear, the transvestite, the stained jacket. Even the sex between dolls and the cello tattoo. Listing these things doesn't at all mean they were used well. They aren't, but clearly someone had some interesting ambitions.

Both the women were given pretty much excactly the same characters as in First wives club.The thing that saves this movie is the performances of Jenna Elfman and Charlton Heston. Both being truly unique and utterly funny. Especially Heston delivering a magnificant performance as an overprotecting father of Andie Macdowell. Jenna does what we are used to seeing in Dharma and Greg yet there is something even beyond that makes here performance superb. Andie Macdowell is a disappointment. Her character is poorly written. Very disturbing and doesn't seem to fit in anywhere. Her mother played by Marian Seldes on the other hand gives a hilarious performance full of dirty language and profanity. Also the music is worth mentioning suitable for this kind of a movie. Better than usually.So all in all it's worth renting on a rainy day or if you just have to kill and hour and a half.

Having grossed less than $7 million at the box office, it stands out as one of the biggest box office disasters in history.  Actually, it isn't that bad, but it is by no means as good a film as one would suppose looking at the cast.The film features an outstanding cast, but an undistinguished director and writing team.  The result is a whole lot of talented people going through the motions saying lines that are seldom funny in skits that are mostly insipid.  The story is a typical midlife crisis comedy where Porter (Warren Beatty) and Griffin (Garry Shandling) perpetrate various indiscretions on their loyal wives of 25 years.  This is clearly a comedy aimed at the 45+ demographic with little traction among the younger moviegoers that represent the lion share of entertainment dollars spent.The ensemble cast of noted veterans does a decent job with sparse material.  Warren Beatty gives the best performance, with a plenty of good physical comedy despite the weak lines.  Goldie Hawn and Jenna Elfman are also good.  Diane Keaton and Garry Shandling are well off their game in this film and Andie MacDowell and Nastassja Kinski are little more than window dressing.  Charleton Heston steals the show with an outrageous cameo as MacDowell's father.This film fails to scratch its way above the water line with a great deal of (expensive) talent wasted.

The fact that it's the biggest box office flop in history didn't worry me to much, in fact that was part of the curiosity.  No, it was Beatty, but I really liked the rest of the cast and was itching to watch a grown up comedy.Overall, I enjoyed Town & Country.  It was a good story, acted out well (even by Beatty did a good job), had a nice mix of humor and drama, and kept my attention through out.  The endless re-writes and trips to the editing room does show, but not enough to take my attention away from the story.  I just let myself go, and found I got into the film very easily.In a nutshell, Beatty and Diane Keaton are a 20+ year married Manhattan couple who soon find out that one half of their best friend couple (Garry Shandling and Goldie Hawn) has cheated on the other.  This starts a chain reaction of double cheating, sneaking and various mid-life crisis'.The only drawbacks that stuck out at me were in fact the numerous editing that occurred behind the camera (rumor is Beatty and the director, Peter Chelsom battled over the final cut).  Secondary characters seem to pop in and out on a whim (I'm still trying to figure out why Tom - Josh Hartnett - showed up in Colorado in the first place).  Also, some of the scenes were borderline hokey for my tastes.  Much of the Colorado sequences could've been cut in my opinion.  One final gripe is to do with Charlton Heston.  Why the guy is still getting roles is beyond me, but I'm even more tired of seeing him doing the same caricature of his gun toting, NRA persona. Word is that Town & Country missed 13 release dates, cost upwards of $90 million, and caused a battle between the director and his star.  I couldn't care less.  With movies that have notorious making-of stories, I always find the stories fascinating, but what really matters in the end is the movie.

Beatty actually passes here as he goes from devoted husband to secretive lover. After he ends his affair with Hawn he becomes involved with a young cello player. Keaton is basically the wife absent minded to her husband's antics. Shandling is a complete miscast because his brand of humour doesn't fit with his co-stars thus coming off as overkill.

What began as a medium-budget comedy drama turned into a costly and inconsistent financial failure that financially damaged a studio and plunged a great deal of actors into obscurity following its release. Town & Country began as a film that was due to be a fairly quick shoot during the summer of 1998 for a release in the middle of the 1999 year. Between actor Warren Beatty's demand for many takes of each scene he was in and unsatisfied reactions to screenwriter Michael Laughlin's original ending to the film, Town & Country saw itself being developed, or more or less made up, as it went along, with production frequently stalling due to an incomplete script. When a majority of the cast had to attend to prior commitments, being that the film's shoot went well beyond schedule, the full cast couldn't be reunited for a full year, leaving a great deal of time and shelf-wear to accumulate on the film. Following various reshoots in 2000, and a rewrite of more than half the script by Graduate screenwriter Buck Henry, Town & Country finally saw itself released in theaters to record low numbers. It wound up losing over $100 million, combining a production cost that ballooned past any and all predictions and eventual marketing and distribution rights.The film remains a curious piece of history for its checkered production history, along with being the last time Warren Beatty was seen in a film. The final product is a lot more watchable than one would expect, moving with a great deal of energy and having a slew of great performers to halfway mask the shoddy material. However, Town & Country shamelessly bears the fact that its production was a mess from the get-go, appearing very disjointed, especially after about the hour mark, when the film takes one baffling turn after another. On top of everything else, the film finds itself uncertain of when and how to be funny, with certain scenarios sneaking by with no payoff, some with minimal payoff in the way of verbal banter, and others desperately trying to obtain a laugh with slapstick.We focus on Porter Stoddard (Warren Beatty), a New York architect living in a lavish home in the Hamptons, married to Ellie (Diane Keaton), a successful interior designer, for twenty-five years. One day, their good friend Mona (Goldie Hawn) informs them that she wants a divorce from her antique-shopowner husband Griffin (Garry Shandling), Porter's best friend, after catching him taking what appeared to be a redheaded woman to a motel. However, the redhead in question is a cross-dressing male, to no ones knowledge but Griffin. Furthermore, this causes a certain restlessness in Porter that he decides to act on, engaging in an affair with a beautiful young cellist named Alex (Nastassja Kinski). When Ellie discovers Porter is cheating, she is beside herself, leaving both him and Griffin to venture out to Porter's vacation home in Sun Valley for a brief retreat, resulting in predictable hijinks and locale craziness.Town & Country forgoes any kind of presumed sociological investigation as to why and how men cheat versus the reasons and methods women use to cheat in favor of rather unremarkable comedy. Despite bearing a cast of proved greats, the film wades in the water most of the time, cycling through a random array of jokes, some the driest of dry wit, others the dumbest of dumb slapstick, in hopes to obtain some kind of reaction out of the audience. This glaring inconsistency is only furthered when the film takes a turn for the inane in its third act, becoming more about situational comedy and sitcom-style gags that it feels more like a scrapped pilot for a Fox program than a feature-length film.At first, Town & Country wants to play a bit more dignified, almost seeming like a quaint, British comedy of manners. However, it rapidly descends into the worst kind of American comedy, which involves a maximum number of allegedly funny antics but a frighteningly minimal number of actual laughs. What winds up being more surprising is that despite all of its narrative issues, this film is never contemptible or even downright bad. It's sloppy and wears its problems like a messy child, but it moves with a swift amount of zeal and disposable energy. Beatty and Shandling manage to cook up something in the way of amiable chemistry at times, and Keaton finds herself in a role that, despite shortchanging her character's opinions and emotions, seems to catch her in a lively, fun mood.To see a film like this bear the hefty pricetag it does and the mainstream release it mustered is nothing but a surprise, even fourteen years later. This is not the kind of film that's likely to end up on the biggest box office bombs ever list, but more like a medium budget comedy drama that scored mediocre numbers upon release and went on to be forgettable cable fare. Town & Country bears a lot more notable features than many films of its kind, and despite them being mostly for the wrong reasons, there's an amiable quality to this film I can't shake; it's the reason my review is about two or three stars higher than it probably should be.Starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Garry Shandling, Goldie Hawn, Nastassja Kinski, Andie MacDowell, Jenna Elfman, and Charlton Heston.

It thinks hearing Garry Shandling yell out I'm gay to a ballroom full of people is just knee-slapingly funny. It thinks destroying a 25 year marriage through adultery is a punchline. If that's the sort of stuff that makes you laugh&#x85;well, maybe you ought to get some therapy.Porter Stoddard (Warren Beatty) is an rich architect, the kind of rich where he can charter a private plane to fly all the way to Paris to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his marriage to Ellie (Diane Keaton) and bring along their married best friends, Mona and Griffin (Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling), for the party. Everything seems to be fine, except Porter is cheating on Ellie with a beautiful cellist. Oh, and Griffin is cheating on Mona with another man. And then Mona finds out Griffin is cheating but thinks it's with a woman so she ends up in bed with Porter, afterwhich Ellie finds out Porter has been cheating on her with the cellist, which leads to Porter and Griffin going to this winter resort where two more women want to have sex with Porter and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Basically, Town and Country is like the most mean spirited and emotionally decadent episode ever of I Love Lucy, where Warren Beatty plays the role of Lucy. Wait, maybe I don't want to make that analogy. Lucy getting in on with Fred is too terrible a mental picture to contemplate.This is a thoroughly unfunny comedy. It's not that there aren't lots of jokes, because there are. It's also not because the individual performers can't do comedy, because they can. It's that this movie doesn't understand that its story is usually nothing to laugh at. Adultery, betrayal, divorce and family break-up are not the backbone of light and frothy humor. You actually can be funny about such stuff, but only if you acknowledge how deep and serious such matters are. If you're going to tell a story where the main character is a guy who cheats on his wonderful wife for no apparent reason other than he's a huge jackass, the humor in such a story had either be very dark and bitter or very, very over the top. That sort of tale can work as a black comedy or some absurd spectacle, but Town and Country is neither that sharp nor that broad.Everything about this movie reeks of a pretentious yet sedate unreality. Porter cheats on his wife, but the film refuses to recognize that makes him a bad person. Mona sleeps with her best friend's husband, but the film refuses to acknowledge her as a bad person. There's a scene where Porter is at home and wakes up in the middle of the night to get a snack. As he walks down the hallway, he hears his son having sex with his girlfriend in his room, his daughter having sex with her non-English speaking boyfriend in her room and his maid having sex with her boyfriend in her room. Then the daughter's boyfriend, the maid's boyfriend and his son all join Porter in the kitchen&#x85;and absolutely none of that makes Porter even the slightest bit uncomfortable. What's obviously supposed to be funny about that situation is how freaked-out the middle aged dad gets at all the sex happening in his home. If the middle aged dad doesn't get freaked out, where's the joke? The one laugh-out-loud moment in Town and Country comes when Shandling's Griffin has a genuinely real and human reaction to another character's crazy behavior, but that's about the only bit of human realism in the whole movie.It's kind of shame how bad this film is because Beatty and Keaton have wonderful on screen chemistry. I f Beatty hadn't become the sort of obsessive perfectionist who could only make one movie every 5 years or so, he and Keaton could have had an entire career playing opposite each other like a modern Hepburn and Tracy or Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. Goldie Hawn is okay and Garry Shandling is really just in the film for some one-liners. Andie MacDowell gives a pretty poor performance, but that's largely because her character is a contrived and phony mess that few actresses could make work. Charlton Heston hams it up as the father of MacDowell's character and his on screen wife could have come straight out of a Judd Apatow film.Town and Country is a comedy that isn't funny. The only way you might enjoy watching it is if you really hate Warren Beatty and want to laugh at him as he flops around on screen in this dying fish of a film.

How about the beginning, and the very first - and in my humble opinion the best scene in the movie. As the opening credits clear, we are in a bedroom with Warren Beatty relaxing in bed, and Natassja Kinski playing her cello in the nude. At this point I felt the movie was going places, far better places than I would soon see. The main criticism I have of this film is that it was a bit too fragmented. The story line jumped far too quickly, and far too often. I believe that all of the main players were well cast in their roles, but I think both Andie MacDowell and Jenna Elfman's parts could have had a bit more bite to them, not to mention a bit more screen time.Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton were their usual top notch actresses, but I found Warren Beatty's performance a bit flat. I'm not sure if I would rush out to see this movie again, judge for yourself - I think it might make for a good DVD rental on a rainy day.

It's 3 or 4 different movies, as we've all heard ad nauseum-- awkwardly pasted into one film. I've heard that before about other movies in the past. But never before have I encountered it so strongly as with Town and Country. It literally, really, and totally is several diverse and unrelated movies-- different styles, different vibes. They kind of come together at the end, although not very well. Overall, the movie is not without some charm, but dang! It is also seriously flawed. The movie starts, for example, as a pleasant, Manhattan-New England romantic comedy. I like the genre, usually. Meaningful fluff. Human; light yet important. Kind of a family thing, multi-generational and charming. then it veers off into an extremely unpleasant (ugly, really), hate and revenge tirade reminiscent of First Wives Club, or War of the Roses. Joan Collins on a rampage kind of thing. Then it abruptly switches to a pleasant, intriguing finding yourself and romance in rural America adventure story. One difficulty with this movie is that all of the disparate parts are well done. The cast is uniformly superb (duh!), and the writing has its moments. Thus, when the movie displays unrelated chunks, and takes off in new and illogical directions, the skill and mastery of each chunk makes its unrelatedness to all the other chunks really stand out. Maybe a crappier made movie wouldn't have been so obviously confused about itself; or at least it might not have revealed its confusion to us, the audience. So-- T & C is not as bad as the critics say. If you can get past the hateful segment of the movie, and get past the need for a logical plot and a narrative logic, then you might find yourself entertained. At least intermittently involved.

After seeing `Town and Country,' one begins to understand why.In this film, former box office headliners Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Charlton Heston are stranded in an embarrassing pseudo-French farce co-written by the famed Buck Henry (he wrote `The Graduate') and Michael Laughlin and directed by Peter Chelsom.  Rounding out the cast are Andie MacDowell, Garry Shandling, Jenna Elfman, Nastassja Kinski and Josh Hartnett - scarcely a cadre of second-rate talents and no-name unknowns.  Yet what these filmmakers have done to these fine people seems all but criminal.  The plot is devised along the lines of one of those Feydeau sexual roundelays, wherein the characters end up in an assortment of compromising situations and have to do a lot of quick explaining to their assorted spouses and loved ones to try to extricate themselves from them. The problem is that the adultery theme around which the comedy swirls is often more painful than funny in its nature.  Moreover, neither the lines nor the situations are ever particularly humorous and, in fact, they more often than not give off an air of desperation, as when the writers throw the characters into funny costumes for no discernible purpose or when all the women involved in Beatty's adulterous affairs somehow find themselves occupying the same ladies room without there being displayed any of the finely worked out narrative logic needed to get them there (which any truly successful madcap farce would absolutely rely on).  The characters are not even consistent with their own personalities.  The prime example is the Garry Shandling character whom we are told early on is a closeted homosexual, yet spends the entire movie picking up on and commenting on women - even after he has declared he will be true to his real nature.Of all the performances, Heston's portrayal of MacDowell's nutcase father is both the creepiest and the most daring.  The filmmakers even poke a little good-natured fun at Heston's NRA President image, having him storming into a New York City social gathering brandishing his prized hunting rifle. Yet, like so much of what happens in this film, this scene seems strangely tacked on and pointless.  Indeed, the plot is so unfocused that one often gets the impression that the filmmakers just thought it up as they were going along. devising storylines as the spirit (and the desire to shoot in an exotic location) moved them.  How else to explain the fact that the plot careens over to Sun Valley for no logical reason other than that Beatty and Shandling probably wanted to get a little skiing in during production time? And how does MacDowell's character - whom Beatty met earlier on an airplane going from New York to the Deep South - suddenly show up on a ski lift in Utah?  In short, this is one hell of a clunky, messy film.One can only hope that, in the twilight of their careers, these once major stars will still be able to find some material that will afford them the respect and dignity they deserve.  In the meantime, the politest thing we can do is look the other way and forget all about `Town and Country.'

Being completely subjective I admit I enjoyed it even more because of my depressing mood at the time. So what if I was searching for fun? In reality I didn't know I was going to see a comedy, so it was a pleasant surprise to get many laughs, not only due to hilarious situations but also wacky lines.It's true that some parts of the movie seem not to connect properly, but the funny stuff makes you forget about that.

Apparently screenwriters Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry don't think so.  And, after all, it is the stuff of which many a black comedy has been made.  Unfortunately, `Town and Country,' directed by Peter Chelsom, is anything but a black comedy.  A comedy, perhaps, but one that lands more in a gray area; there's some laughs along the way, to be sure, and there's something of a moral to be found in the end.  Maybe.  But then again-- well-- it's just that kind of movie.  It takes you on a ride, but it's like one at an amusement park-- by the time you get off, if you're not prone to motion sickness, you may have had a good time but you're right back where you started.  And maybe a little wary of getting back on for another go.	Without a doubt, the star power involved with this project keeps it afloat.  Beginning with Warren Beatty, who plays Porter Stoddard, an architect who lives and works in New York City.  He's just celebrated his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary with Ellie (Diane Keaton), and during all the years he's never once gone astray.  Then he finds out that his best friend, Griffin (Garry Shandling), has been caught cheating by his wife of many years-- and also one of Porter's best friends-- Mona (Goldie Hawn).  And at this point, some kind of domino effect comes into play apparently, because like a contagious virus, the next thing you know, Porter is in the sack with a young cellist (Nastassja Kinski) he's just met.  Actually, that's the first scene of the movie, and from there it goes back to fill you in on how it all came about.  Sort of.	What Chelsom has on his hands is a mishmash of plot lines and characters that are somewhat amusing and interesting in themselves, but like the frayed ends of a rope, they all just kind of hang out there blowing in the wind and lead nowhere.  There's some really funny moments here that will make you laugh out loud, but they come more from a lack of context than anything else.  When you have to put Beatty in a polar bear suit to fish for laughs, you know something is rotten in Denmark.  The funniest part in the whole movie comes when Porter has a brief interlude with a woman he meets while on a trip to Sun Valley with Griffin.  Her name is Eugenie (Andie MacDowell), and she's something of a whack-o; but she doesn't hold a candle to her shotgun toting father (Charlton Heston).  It's funny, sure; but you get the feeling it came about because the writers were looking at their storyboard one day and said, `Hey!  Why don't we put in a crazy guy with a gun here-- and we can get Charlton Heston, and...'	The redeeming factor of the whole movie is the cast.  Beatty and Keaton are good together, and make you believe that Porter and Ellie have been married for twenty-five years.  Shandling is perfectly cast as Griffin, the man with a secret, and Goldie Hawn is not only good, but gorgeous.  In fact, the older she gets, the better she looks.  And MacDowell is a treat, playing somewhat against type, but the real sparkplug of the entire film is Jenna Elfman, who plays Auburn, a young woman the guys meet on their trip to Idaho.  She has a quirky and charming screen presence, and though her part is small, she brightens the whole show.	The supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Buck Henry, Mare Casabani, Marian Seldes and Katharine Towne.  There's more dead-ends in `Town and Country' than the East Side Kids ever encountered, but it's good for some laughs and it's a passable evening's entertainment.  But keep in mind, it's like cotton candy; it's fairly sweet, but the flavor-- what there is of it-- doesn't last very long.  And it just won't satisfy your sweet tooth.  Before you know it, you're going to want some real candy.  I rate this one 4/10.

After watching tons of crude, juvenile, immature comedies aimed at the teen and pre-teen markets, I felt eager to finally sit back and watch an ADULT comedy!  I thought this movie would be a saving grace and a great escape from some of the crappy, half-assed comedies that have been out on the market.  Well, my assumption was wrong.With a cast like this, how can you go wrong?  For one thing, the actors--no matter how superb--have to be enthusiastic.  The actors in this horribly uneven comedy seem to be either hamming it up or sleeping through their roles, extremely bored with the script.  The latter seems to be most existent with Warren Beatty, who seemed about as excited in his role as he was about Ishtar's box office results.  He's usually low-key in his performances--even with Dick Tracy--but this time around he was virtually comatose.  Garry Shandling, who I usually find very funny, belts out crappy one-liners left and right.  I guess he felt the script was so uninspired that he wasn't in the mood to stretch his creativity.  Take my advice check out What Planet Are You From.  A much funnier, much more inspired, creative comedy that better displays Shandling's underrated talent. Goldie Hawn seems almost non-existent, though she technically doesn't have a lot of screen time.  Hell, neither did John Turturro in The Big Lebowski, but he had one of the most memorable roles in the film.  Diane Keaton just seems to be going through the motions.  Jenna Elfman and Charlton Heston (who I thought would shovel the film out of its massive hole) are forgettable and forced to degrade themselves as one-note caricatures.Though, T and C tries to be a slick, sophisticated adult comedy, below its pretentious surface it's no more than a cheap, juvenile, R-rated sitcom. The character flaws are as clear as day (especially in Shandling's case), none of them seem to establish any sort of chemistry and all the themes about philandering and jealousy are strictly played out for laughs--though they pitifully fail in that department.  It aims for truthful romantic comedy, but proves to be no more than a goofy farce.  The comic timing is often predictable, and I only laughed sporadically--its moments are few and far between, with more chuckles than actual laughs.  The all-hell-breaks-loose climax would've worked out in a much smarter comedy, but in this case it just seems forced and overdone.I've heard tidbits about the film's troubled production, and if you watch the film it's clearly evident.  Worst of all, it wasn't worth the wait.  I could be wrong, but I heard they had to keep re-editing the film and do re-shoots.  Well, obviously they kept trying and trying and still got it wrong.  The scenes in this movie are as discombobulated as a sketch comedy show.  With an ensemble piece like this, you have to be careful about the timing and pacing.  Everything in this movie seems to be thrown together at the last minute.  And what surprises me is the script was co-written by Buck Henry (who co-wrote The Graduate).

I mean, Charlton Heston from Sun Valley Idaho in the middle of a NY Designer's Award night with a gun hunting down the feckless Warren Beatty for foolin' with his daughter's affections. Warren Beatty spouting a hymn to matrimonial fidelity. A New York antique dealer having trouble admitting he's gay. Wives in a sophisticated urban setting who at the first hint that their husbands may have been unfaithful clean out the joint account and call their lawyers. Who wrote this cr*ap? Buck Henry? I can't believe it. As for all that wasted acting talent &#150; strangely, none of the major players was all that bad. Warren drifts through proceedings with a faintly quizzical air as the unfaithful husband who thinks he's being faithful as long as he has only one mistress at a time. Dianne Keaton as the cheated-on wife isn't too histrionic, and Goldie Hawn as her best friend is Goldie Hawn, which is fair enough. Gary Shandling as Goldie's closet gay husband is OK, if a bit lacking in impact. Whatever you do, DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS FILM. It only encourages the cretins responsible to make more like it.

However the material was abysmal and left me wondering how on earth this film ever made it to a release.  I guess the star studded cast.

What starts off promising ends up, after a meandering set of incoherent and unlikely plot lines, in a confusing muddle that isn't funny or even remotely interesting... I don't know who deserves more blame the writers, director, or editors. Town & Country simply wasted the talents of everyone involved. Goldie Hawn, who was sensational in Housesitter, Foul Play, and Seems Like Old Times, has little to do in this poorly conceived film. Unfortunately, this also happened to Hawn in the equally ill-conceived remake of the Out-of-Towners. Jenna Elfman and Andie MacDowell, who can be hilarious and light up a screen, had virtually nothing to do or say but wonder why they listened to their agents and signed up to star in this mess of a film. Likewise, Garry Shandling, who can be a funny comedic actor when given the right material (What Planet Are You From?), meandered through Town & Country without a humorous moment (with one exception... falling off the bed in Utah). While Warren Beatty's acting was not an issue,  the story was incoherent and the comedic aspects completely lacking. Much more work should have been done on the script, and a more competent editing job to justify the presence of such a talented cast. Writer/Actor Buck Henry is capable of so much more than this. Oh yes, and whoever thought that the gun-wielding, 'high-society' nut portrayed by Charleton Heston was funny, should have done a few more test screenings... What should have come across as a funny piece of irony, given Heston's position as president of a major gun lobby, was ludicrous in this film. Although the film may have been passable if it starred lesser known names, it just isn't acceptable in a big-budget film full of talented, well-known names. With such experienced actors and actresses, Town & Country was nothing less a cinematic travesty. 5 stars out of 10...

Alex cheerfully tells Porter she's preggers, then cheerfully reveals he isn't the daddy. Such jaw-dropping stupidity makes you question your faith in humanity.No doubt, Warren Beatty snared ex-paramours Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn so his massive ego could justify hooking up with women young enough to be his grand-daughters, then hired Peter Chelsom because Alan Smithee was unavailable.

Happily married couple Porter (Warren Beatty) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) are shocked to find out that a friend of theirs called Griffin (Garry Shandling!) is cheating on his wife (Goldie Hawn). This gets Porter to start thinking about cheating on HIS wife with a beautiful musician (Nastassia Kinski).Abysmal. This movie took three YEARS to make before it was even released. It was plagued by infighting, re shoots, rewrites and clashing star egos. Beatty has gotten most of the blame for trying to control everything. All of this fighting shows up on the screen unfortunately. The script lurches all over the place veering wildly from scene to scene. Sometimes it tries to play like a sophisticated comedy--other times it plays slapstick so broad that the Three Stooges would be embarrassed (was putting Beatty in a polar bear costume supposed to be funny?). None of the jokes are funny--not one! I didn't even smile once let alone laugh. Also we have some talented actors like Jenna Elfman and Andie MacDowell doing some of the worst comedic bits I've ever seen. I'm still waiting to find out how MacDowell and her dolls were supposed to be funny. Then we have Josh Harnett (billed here as Joshua) giving another bad performance and Charlton Heston completely humiliating himself.This gets a 2 because most of the cast really tries. Shandling is bad but Keaton and Hawn are just great and Beatty is somewhat amusing (seeing him doing comedy is--interesting). Also Kinski is just great in her small role. For them I give this a 2 but this seriously can be safely skipped. ALMOST worth seeing to see how bad a comedy can truly be.

Besides that, I'm always willing to give anybody or anything a fair chance before passing judgment. So, when I read the horrible reviews, both by professional and non-professional critics, I figured I had to find out for myself if Town and Country was really that bad. Well, the verdict is out it is really THAT bad! I haven't seen all of Warren's movies recently/yet, but if this isn't the biggest stinker of his career, I would be surprised. And to imagine it was shot in the very same year as the brilliant and inspired Bulworth is mind-boggling. Town and Country is a total, unfunny and uninspired, unco-ordinated chaotic mess. And it starts out quite alright. If the script had just stuck to the family situation, the clash between the generations, even when both generations are messing around with (sexual) relationships, it could have been a lot better. But now? The script ends up going nowhere (literally, when they end up in Sun Valley). Just what the heck is the movie trying to be about? Is it trying to say that EVERY man, even the most loyal one, will eventually feel the genetic need to cheat on his wife? Is it trying to say that even filthy rich and successful people have mundane problems? Is it trying to say that lessons are only learned when one risks losing everything? WHAT? The movie's problem isn't even its older cast as some reviewers seem to think. Older, wrinkly people exist, and yes, they even have sex, so get over it! The movie's problem is that it is totally incoherent and consists of a bunch of strung together scenes that seem for the most part to have been largely ad-libbed, as far as scripting goes. Most of the cast are real life friends (Goldie, Diane, Gary, Warren and Buck Henry). I think they should have just made a home movie and spared us this waste of time and talent. Dear God, please let Warren come up with another great thing like Bulworth to end his career with a big bang, instead of letting it whither to a halt with this monstrosity.

The entire subplot involving Andie MacDowell and her eccentric parents is just embarrassing, and once you see the shot with Warren Beatty, Garry Shandling and Jenna Elfman headed to a Sun Valley Halloween party dressed as, respectively, a bear (with full suit), Elvis, and Marilyn Monroe, you know things went from sublime to absurd in a hurry.  Worse yet, a lot of the strained humor isn't ironic, it's just poorly-written and conceived.  It was encouraging to see Buck Henry's name as a co-writer, but in retrospect, when was the last time you saw a genuinely funny Buck Henry film -- The Graduate? Maybe if you like to see good ensemble casts wasted (i.e. if you think Ready To Wear is Altman's best film) then give it a shot, but I considered shutting it off halfway through, gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched the whole thing, and regretted throwing away 45 minutes of my life on the second half.

The biggest question I had before seeing it was whether or not it was worth the wait and what the result of 4 1/2 years of planning, shooting, editing and further delays would be.It was worth it. The result is the most exciting new comedy of the year. Last week, we had Bridget Jones' Diary another do or die project. Now we have this. Boy, in between all the dreck we've had this year, thank God for gems like this.In most reviews I've read, the most complaints are about the actors' ages. So what? Only young people have these problems? and besides, casting such familiar and welcome actors like Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling and Diane Keaton allows us as an audience to feel comfortable we're watching old friends we like and admire. Hitchcock often cast using that criteria; and it is proven to work.The film is beautifully photographed (by another old friend, William A. Fraker)and the script (co-written by yet another old friend Buck Henry) work so nicely and there is no feel of a troubled production here; instead there are some monster laughs and some surprisingly thoughtful scenes.Town and Country is in the style of those old Billy Wilder/ Blake Edwards/ Paul Mazursky films comedies that work as drama as well. Besides making us laugh, this film makes us think and has a resonance so few films have today. Director Peter Chelsom is an expert at this kind of comedy (his credits include Funny Bones and The Mighty) and it's a pleasure to see him make another great film.**** out of 4 stars "}]
