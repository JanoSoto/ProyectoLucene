[{"Title":"I can't help myself when it comes to Harrison Ford...","Date":"30 December 2005","Score":"47 out of 60 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I rented this a few days ago having discovered it was a Harrison Ford movie I somehow missed. Even though I'm a big fan of his, I really didn't expect much based on the jacket description. But, Eureka! I was completely charmed by this movie. Ford has a very low key way of delivering comedy and when you see a manly man like him being funny, it is all the more hilarious. Anne Heche is captivating as the gamin New York fashion sophisticate who happens to be very smart & sassy but grounded. She also has a tremendous flair for comedy and she plays off Ford in a grand way that Melanie Griffith couldn't even dream about doing in Working Girl. Griffith sleepwalked through that script whereas Heche embraces her character fully.There is a very unique thing that happens in this film that we don't see very often and that is how the romantic chemistry builds between the lead characters. It is as natural as the flora and fauna of the island they are trapped on - rather randomly and sometimes awkwardly taking root - and I give a lot of credit to Reitman for capturing this feeling between Ford & Heche. With most films like this, the leads either hop into bed right away and then sort out their differences, or there is no indication of increasing mutual affection until the last 10 minutes when someone slaps their forehead and a light goes on. In this movie, you see so many small moments when one character is creeping into the heart of the other. Despite this, it never gets sappy.I'd rate this movie as a 7 but am giving it an 8 to try to raise its overall score. It's a very, very good romantic comedy with a funny script, witty direction, great tropical locales, and an eclectic but engaging supporting cast.

I might have avoided this had it been anywhere else but the action part of the video rental store.  There was enough action in it so as not to disappoint the action fan too much, but there is a certain amount of romance too.  The executive has left behind a brand new husband on the vacation island she has been called away from.  And the pilot-for-hire has a girlfriend left behind there too.And so it goes.  There are some suprises, but not too many.  The grand old DeHavilland Beaver upstages everyone and so if you like airplanes, you will like this one.Harrison Ford + Airplanes = Great Movie every time.

This movie is one of my favorites, because if i'm having a bad day...they (Heche and Harrison) are having a much worse one and manage to pick up my mood with the delivery of lines that make me laugh, so, yeah the humor. But also the style, pacing, and emotional involvement they make me feel as a viewer. I'm invested. And though I may think that Schwimmer's character is a shmuck, I can understand his POV, so, he's okay. David and the cast did an outstanding job, and while the filmed script may not have been the original one (I'd love to see it sometime) the end result is fabulous. If you haven't seen it, you should, and I hope you too laugh, and smile, and chuckle, and enjoy a rather grand movie. Enjoy!

In the end, I really couldn't care less if Anne Heche and Harrison Ford ended up together.  Especially since David Schwimmer's character was so likeable.  I did however want to see him end up happy (in fact, I wanted him to end up with Angelica), but they didn't follow through with his character, so we really don't know what happened to him.It may sound like I didn't like the movie, but on the contrary, I liked it a great deal, I just don't think I got out of the film what the director/writers wanted me to get out of it.  I thought the film was fun and entertaining but not superb.The cast in this film was pretty good.  Harrison Ford was excellent as always, playing a very interesting character.  David Schwimmer was superb in his role, I REALLY liked his character.  Anne Heche is pretty much the only player in the film that I'm not sure that I liked.  Don't get me wrong, she looks fantastic in the film and does a good job acting, but I'm just not sure if she was the right choice for the job.  Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it now, so I better just shut up and deal with it.  Jacqueline Obradors looked absolutely stunning in this film!  She is reason enough to watch this film!!!  Her acting is quite good too.  Temuera Morrison (who would later go on to become Jango Fett in Star Wars Attack of the Clones...and Harrison Ford played Han Solo in the original trilogy...kind of interesting) does a fine job in his role.  Cliff Curtis plays a VERY small role in this film, but does a good job and has a very cool look to him.  I'm always amazed by this guy because he looks so different in each of his films.  Danny Trejo also plays a small role, but does a fine job.  Allison Janney kind of bugs me as an actress on the whole, but her role is minimal and has very little screen time, so I can deal.All in all, this is a fun movie, with a lot of cool stuff in it, but nothing spectacular.  If you end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.

This movie has found it's way back to my DVD player several times since it's first release to DVD about 10 years ago. It whisks you up from your easy chair to a sunny vacation spot in the Polynesian Islands and never slows up or misses a beat. One scene moves to the next in a seamless manner often foreshadowed by a soundtrack that is very good and quite catchy.The film was well cast with Harrison Ford as the crusty cargo pilot - Ann Heche as the assistant editor of a fashion magazine - David Swimmer as her pasty but very nice fianc√© and Jacqueline Obradors as the beautiful but dingbat club dancer. This romantic comedy and action adventure film pits two people together from different backgrounds and age groups. Normally the two would never get along long enough to get to know the other. But, forced to spend time together and under challenging conditions, a small attraction begins to develop and grow stronger. The character development of the cast moves forward with the same speed as the rest of this cute story.While the film is certainly not for everyone, judging from IMDb ratings and rotten tomatoes, I really believe it was the message and not the movie that failed to impress. This story expresses a throwback to traditional values in the relationship of Ford and Heche and their experiences on the Island. This may explain the reaction to the film by many of the younger viewers. Some of the more mature viewers may have been turned off by news of Ann Heche and Ellen Degeneres in real life. This may explain why some seem to love the movie, while others have curiously rated it rather poorly.In any case, if you need a quick escape and love flying to beautiful Polynesian Islands loaded with beautiful scenery and good-looking people, then his film may be your ticket!

Anne Heche","Date":"10 July 2015","Score":"13 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Spoilers AheadFord does a great job in the movie. He demonstrates his underrated comic talents that were hidden in the Star Wars movies. Also, the scenery is breathtaking as is the photography. These two factors are why I give it four stars. Remember the snake in her pants scene? Now, listen to his delivery compared to hers; imagine a better actress was doing the scene reading those lines correctly. The writing in romantic comedies is always awful. Yes, the pirates were silly; please, The Blue Lagoon did not even have a script; the two characters were so endearing nobody noticed. Heche goes through this movie like a piece of heavy machinery. That shrill, screeching, misandrist act gets old very, very fast. Yes, just because she is a career woman does not mean she has to be that shrill and pushy. Also, by the way, she has always been a terrible actress. Did you find her overacting and hyper gesticulations to distract you from her lack of talent convincing? When all is said and done, imagine Ford's hot girlfriend in the role instead of Heche? The movie would have been so much better. The woman is always annoying; always lecturing, correcting then yelling and overacting badly. It is worth watching once for Ford's performance in a very difficult role. No supporting cast, out there all alone with bad acting Anne Heche, trying to hold the movie up. Also, the scenery is worth seeing; it has some of the best photography I had seen in a long time. You just need to be honest with yourself about how much of Anne Heche you can take; I watch it occasionally but I would never buy it. She just is too annoying; yes, she had to land the plane, guess whose idea that was? Yes, superwoman saves the day; you can always tell which parts of the script were her ideas. Ford will surprise you in the movie; the writing is not the problem. I love when Ford says,It's an Island, if you didn't bring it with you, you won't find it here. When you watch the movie listen to her delivery, her lines would have worked with another, less strident, talented actress. She is the anchor that sank this movie. She also did considerable damage to The Juror. True, it was DOA when released but she really helped wreck it. If you can stomach her, I can recommend the movie. Ford evokes such sympathy when you watch it. You can see on his face, his worry that he made a terrible mistake. Poor guy, a great performance destroyed and rarely seen all due to dreadful casting. A mediocre movie.

Once they get there... they meet a gruff, rough cargo pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford). Once the pilot brings them to the island, Robin and Frank start enjoying their vacation. But the trouble starts when her boss (Allison Janney) calls her from their trip to take a photo shoot. Robin asks Quinn to bring her to the location, where she has to go.

Slowly Robin and Quinn start falling for each other.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters 1 & 2, Junior, Twins) made this amusing, nicely filmed romantic/comedy/adventure with fun performances by Ford and Heche. This wasn't a huge hit at the box office but it should play well on video. Although involving pirate in the subplot seems out of place with the story. It's entertaining enough to overcome certain flaws in the movie. Probably the best thing of the picture is Ford, which he's especially loose and funny. Certainly worth viewing. Panavision.

It's the confrontation of two people who have got a different disposition but are compelled to cohabit together in an unfriendly environment. This situation is told in a comedy tone By telling Harrison Ford and Anne Heche's adventures, Ivan Reitman must have been influenced by Francis Veber' method.

It contains good and funny moments, especially when the characters are having an argument. But, it follows a predictable advance at first, Ford and Heche can't stand each other but little by little, they learn to know each other better.

The gags were very funny, (particularly when Heche's character displays the her inability to cope in situations where there aren't subways and cell phones.).The movie showcased the range of both Heche and Ford. It might have done the same for Schwimmer and Obradors, if they had significant roles.

His acting in this movie didn't compare to his role as Lt./Captain Sobel in Band of Brothers. Based on this role and Band of Brothers, it seems to show that Schwimmer has a lot of range and can play different roles very well. Schwimmer does seem to be typecast as the inept loser who tries hard and always comes out second in the end.

The beach scene with the life raft and the scene on the mountaintop are two of the funniest bits I've seen in a long, long time.  Mr. Ford has always had a comedic gift for parody - Han Solo, Indiana Jones and now Queenie.  The only flaw in this perfectly casted film is, of course, David Schwimmer.  I hope he has saved his money from his role in Friends because he certainly is bloody awful on the large screen. He doesn't even do selfish, egotistic, self-involved, whining wuss that well; well, perhaps I'm being too harsh.  His whining and being annoying is well done.  He always convinces me.

You sense there's more to it all though when he asks Heche to wear something special and her naughty thoughts are quickly usurped with a ring. Nice script moment and I kept watching...The meat of the film centres around the burgeoning love between the unlikely castaway couple of Ford and Heche. I mean, this film has no pretensions beyond being a fully loved-up snog in the back of the flea-pit matin√©e, so we get flirting almost from the moment they crash. But a mixture of competent shooting at a marvelous location and great acting from Ford that's well matched by Heche (who's not only attractive, but game, wearing revealing costume throughout and having to refer to her own chest as 'small' more than once) renders it sexy and believable.Chuck in some authentic contemporary pirates - I'm also a bit tickled by the fact that the Star Wars prequels' Boba Fett is chasing around after IV, V and VI's Han Solo! - and Reitman's smart decision to avoid excessive tie-ups (e.g. How does Heche get down the island white water Ford found so difficult? Will Schwimmer hook up with the Latino at the end? etc.) and you have highly enjoyable 6.5/10 matin√©e fare for a weekend date.

The pilot is played by Harrison Ford, a handsome yet aging bachelor whose closest relationship is with a stunning island sexpot known for her stage performances which wow the male tourists happening to guzzle cocktails at the hut bars. Because he is defiantly set in his ways (he voices his opinion even if it isn't exactly popular, can be a bit rough around the edges in the conversation department in his lack of mincing words, and has the tendency to offer less-than-polite remarks when antagonized) and argumentative when it comes to someone challenging his sense of liberated relationship purgatory (he's alone, isn't tied to someone who could throw a monkey wrench in his freedom to go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants), Ford and Heche have a bit of friction (his type doesn't often find his way into the orbit of her NYC social class). So Heche is soaking up the sun, drinking some fruity alcoholic drinks, and enjoying her time with Schwimmer (even agreeing to marry him after his proposal) at the resort, her magazine calls, requesting her to fly to Tahiti for a particular article, certain to make the lead of the week. So she offers $700 bucks to Ford if he will fly her to Tahiti, and he reluctantly agrees. When they encounter a major storm, a bolt of lightning strikes the plane, and Ford must land it on a deserted South Pacific island. Once there, Ford and Heche must find a beacon in the hopes of summoning a rescue crew, but they soon encounter pirates who kill the owner of a yacht and take his possessions! Stranded on lush, tropical environs, the two stars bicker a bit (it is all playful banter), try to avoid clear and present danger (totally intentional tie of Harrison to that movie), and find a means to get off the island. They fall in love, comment on each other's looks, try to keep from freaking out when troubles arise, and go into MacGuyver mode building a plan from old WWII plane parts found within the island. I have to say that Heche looks fantastic and Ford by 1998 had kept himself in impressively athletic shape. Ford has a natural movie star charisma a film so undemanding as this can depend upon. I enjoyed seeing him so relaxed and free of the usual intensity; sometimes an actor of his stature can get away with a film like this which just plucks from other better survival island movies. Heche seems perfectly comfortable in a film like this as the lead (she would rarely get another chance to be featured in such a Hollywood high profile fluff piece as this), and her skimpy bikini outfits certainly convey how much effort she put into getting into shape. Turn your brain off junk food this movie is.Schwimmer is a lot of fun as Heche's fianc√©, conflicted about the island hottie who offers her body to him while he's concerned about his missing girlfriend's welfare. His nervy energy is amusing. The pirates subplot is a bit tacked on and truthfully unneeded...it seems like this was applied to provide a little peril for the leads. I felt that those who wrote the film were in dire need of padding to accompany Ford and Heche's arguing and eventual romance.

Or is it Moribunda? The formula was an enormous success with It Happened One Night in 1934, a commercial and critical success, and a lot of fun. There were imitations of course but the pattern seemed exhausted by 1941's The Bride Came C.O.D., which had Bette Davis sitting on a cactus. But periodically since then the coffin creaks open and another attempt to use a tried and true formula emerges. Well, what the hell. All the originals were in black and white, and nobody watches old movies anymore.I really don't mind an occasional visit to the graveyard if the zombies turn out to be entertaining, but this is not. The anger and snottiness turn to love, sure, but it's not very funny. The jokes are the kind you might find in Laurel and Hardy. The dialog is bromidic. The performances are over pitched as if in an attempt to compensate for the uninspired plot.The writers haven't bothered with credibility much, but that's okay because this is supposed to be a romantic fantasy. Still, it's momentarily painful when you realize that they didn't care whether the setting was supposed to be Polynesia or the Caribbean. Everyone speaks English, some with a French accent, others with a Spanish accent. It doesn't matter to the writers, for whom a foreign accent is a foreign accent, just like the 1940s when the heroes spoke American and the Nazis spoke British.You have to be undemanding to enjoy this but the kids should get a kick out of it. "},{"Title":"Funny but suffers from too many details","Date":"16 July 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Filmgoers and critics alike are split on what to think on Ivan Reitman's films. Most would probably say that his earliest productions were the most original and fun. The best example being Ghost Busters (1984). But as time went on, Reitman started making some oddballs like Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Then he started reverting back to more realistic normal comedies. This particular film is in this group and has things going for it. The problem is that it gets too bogged down with other details that it forgets what its main purpose was in the first place. The plot focuses on a couple that heads out on vacation when one of them is called back. While returning the partner is stranded on an island with the pilot and must learn to survive together. The plot isn't all that special but the way it's executed is. Anne Heche and David Schwimmer play the couple on vacation as Robin and Frank. There they meet their pilots Quinn (Harrison Ford) and Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors). The two that become stranded on a remote island is Robin and Quinn. There they learn how to survive on their own. Yet, the casting of Schwimmer and Obradors wasn't necessary. It could've just been Robin going on vacation and being stranded with Quinn. It's not that Schwimmer or Obradors aren't funny or can't act, but their character arcs are predictable from the start and it doesn't end clearly either. If a couple is heading to vacation and the first thing your boyfriend does is stare at curvaceous women, I think viewers will have a clear idea where he's headed. It's not new material.First time writer Michael Browning did an OK job defining each character, but they are either clich√©d or oddly paired. The other strange casting decision belongs to having Anne Hiche and Harrison Ford being together. Over time after learning how to get along, Robin and Quinn form a relationship. During this time, Ford wasn't the strapping youth he once was. Of course some people still find him attractive but most people's viewpoints would be that Ford is too old to be having any kind of a relationship with what looks to be a late 20s / early 30s woman. It's not uncommon (in real life), but for the movie's sake since age isn't the focus, it feels a bit weird. Also cast in the film is Temuera Morrison (known for Jango Fett), Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo. They are hard to spot at times, but if you see them it's cool to see.The comedy also helps relieve audiences of the either familiar story line or characters. Either when it comes to Frank being goofy or Quinn reacting to Robin's actions, it is genuinely funny. Ford has the best quips. Some of it even reminisces to that of something Indiana Jones would say. Besides it's not all fun and games, Quinn and Robin even run into some modern day pirates. Yikes. The cinematography by Michael Chapman looks great. The view of the islands out to sea looks mesmerizing. Even Randy Edelman's score is nice. It has a theme to represent Quinn and Robin and it sounds memorable. The tune involves piano keys, which isn't the most frequent of an instrument included in a score. It works as a comedy but isn't anything new. The elements of comedy are funny and will have people laughing thanks to its cast. Yet, the casting on a direct basis is questionable and the writing is a bit formulaic.

They were actually on the hotel/casino's premises for about 40 hours, only a little more than 1-1/2 days in time - a third of this sleeping. While there on three different days, there were only a few hours left on Friday, and nearly all of Sunday consisted of sleeping and checking-out. If the film's resort actually advertised their offerings as Six Days Seven Nights, this would indicate, say, checking-in on Monday, and leaving following Monday, with the seven nights of Monday thru Sunday. Vegas or Atlantic City, and most other venues, would label this 'EIGHT DAYS, seven nights. No big deal, but just wonder every time I see it how studio came up with the title.

It's got to be one of the most predictable movies ever.Overall, the movie brings up two questions why can't Harrison Ford just stick with what he's good at, and why was Anne Heche getting so many roles in the late '90s? I assume that Ford probably wants to downplay his role in this movie (although his recent roles haven't been much better K-19, Hollywood Homicide and Firewall). Ditto Heche. Also starring - and embarrassing themselves - are David Schwimmer, Allison Janney, Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo.

The only way to get there is by a small single-engined plane, and halfway through the trip the pilot is forced by bad weather to make an emergency landing on a small uninhabited island. The plane's landing gear is damaged, meaning that they are unable to take off again, and the radio equipment was put out of action by the storm, making their chances of rescue unlikely. Fortunately, however, Robin and the pilot, Quinn Harris, find themselves falling in love.This being a romantic comedy, there have to be some obstacles to their love. Robin and Quinn are complete opposites, he being a tough man of action and a lover of the great outdoors, whereas she is a suave, metropolitan New Yorker. Initially, they take a dislike to each other. Most importantly, Robin has a fianc√©, Frank- indeed, they have come on holiday together to celebrate their engagement. Quinn also has a mistress, a local girl named Angelica, although this relationship does not seem to involve a great deal of emotional commitment, at least not on his part.In real life, matters like this might prove insuperable obstacles. In a rom-com, however, they are less obstacles than standard plot clich√©s. (See, for example, You've Got Mail, in which the same three obstacles were overcome equally easily). The three basic rules of love and marriage in rom-coms can be summarised as i) opposites attract, ii) lovers always start off by hating one another, iii) the big-name star always gets the girl, so you needn't worry about other boyfriends on the horizon.Harrison Ford is normally associated either with action adventures, like the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series, or political or legal thrillers such as Patriot Games or The Fugitive. He is not, therefore, perhaps the first actor one would think of when casting the hero of a romantic comedy. He was, however, surprisingly good in Working Girl (even if Sabrina was something of a disappointment) and here, as Quinn, he is able to draw upon his normal gruff and laconic but steady and dependable screen persona in order to emphasise the contrast with the more voluble and emotional Robin. It is clear that he is, underneath his tough exterior, a man of strong emotions, even if he has difficulty in expressing them- he left America to live in the islands after a painful divorce when his wife left him for his best friend. There are, in fact, brief attempts to turn this into an adventure film, when Quinn and Robin have to battle a gang of pirates, although even these turn into comedy when the pirates manage to sink their own ship, making them seem more like inept buffoons than ruthless cutthroats.Anne Heche presumably took this role to bolster her image as Hollywood's first born-again heterosexual, although her Robin struck me as being a bit too abrasive- not the girl I would choose to be marooned on a desert island with. Her treatment of the hapless Frank, whom David Schwimmer played as goofy but likable, also struck me as rather heartless. (I can foresee that Schwimmer is going to have a real problem with typecasting- every character he plays reminds me of his Ross from Friends). The scriptwriters seem to have shared my view about Robin's heartlessness, as they included a rather improbable scene where Frank beds Angelica while both are fretting over their missing partners. The idea was presumably to undermine the audience's sympathy for Frank by insisting that he is as guilty of infidelity as Robin is. We never actually find out how Frank's romance with Angelica progresses, but as she is a very underdeveloped character, we never really care.The film that I was most reminded of was that great eighties rom-com Crocodile Dundee, which also featured a young female New York journalist who falls to an exotic location where she falls for an older man of action. Crocodile Dundee, however, is a far better film, treating this theme with a great deal more style and humour. Harrison's Quinn is not in the same league as Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee, one of the great comic characters of all time. Six Days, Seven Nights makes for enjoyable if undemanding watching, but it lacks both the wit and the psychological insight that mark the best romantic comedies. 6/10 "}{"Title":"A disjointed but amiable romantic comedy","Date":"30 June 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I've written reviews for some of Ivan Reitman's other films in the past. When he wants to, he can make a comedy that fires on all cylinders such as Ghostbusters. That film has a daft plot, but matched it with the right actors that elevated it considerably above a very flimsy premise.But then there have been other films Reitman has made that can have good actors but fall short in other areas. Six Days Seven Nights is such a film. In fact, if it weren't for the likable pairing of Harrison Ford and Anne Heche this would have been a very flaccid affair.Beginning in New York, we're given a brief glimpse into the life of Robin Monroe (Heche). A fast talking Manhattan editor, she's about to go on holiday with her fianc√©e Frank (the eternally drippy David Schwimmer). What she would see in someone like him is anyone's guess.Before they can reach the island of Macatea, they have to be flown there by Quinn Harris (Ford), a grizzled, burned out drunken excuse for a pilot. Quinn and Robin don't exactly hit it off. It's at this point we know this is going to be an Opposites Attract story, something the film dutifully delivers.Robin is contacted by her boss to handle an assignment while she's at Macatea, but she needs Quinn to fly her to another island to do it. Their plane gets caught in a storm, and they're forced down onto a desert island.Now trapped in each others company, Quinn and Robin have to fight for survival until they can find a way to get off the island. Plot-wise that's about it. If the film sounds pedestrian to you up until this point, that's because it more or less is.The different chain of events that lead Quinn and Robin to be stranded on an island are nicely directed and set up in an efficient way. But once they're on the island, it's as if Ivan Reitman began to run out of ideas. He's not sure whether or not to have them bickering or looking for ways to escape.But regardless of all that, Ford and Heche make a cracking couple. Despite the obvious age difference (something they both acknowledge which I thought was a nice touch) they make a good fit. Robin is a typical brash New Yorker, and Quinn matches her sardonic wit at every turn with his wry observations. Some of their exchanges are terrific fun, and even make senseQuinn You know how a woman gets a man worked up? She shows up. Men are easy in that way.Harrison Ford shows quite a talent for comedy with this film. Quinn has some of the self-deprecating attitude of Indiana Jones and the rugged, brash ego of Han Solo. Ford should concentrate on more comical roles now that his action man days are behind him.Anne Heche is typically hyper throughout, but watching her spark off Ford is great fun to watch. I like the scene where she's taken too many uppers when the plane's going down, and when they're discussing their prospective love lives.But as I was saying before, SDSN is a muddled affair. In desperation to give them something to do, Reitman manufactures a subplot about pirates on the island. Although exciting, it shows the fragile nature of the plot. But it does provide an atmosphere of tension towards the end, especially when it looks like Quinn and Robin might get killed now that they've admitted their love for each other.I won't beat around the bush. They do make it off the island, but the way they do it is quite clever, and that I won't spoil for you. Once they're back on the mainland, they now have to deal with the consequences, and how their experience has brought them together. Robin fills a void that's been missing from Quinn's life since his wife left him, and Quinn makes Robin realise she has no future with Frank (I could have told her that in the first five minutes).Quinn and Robin are not exactly Tracy and Hepburn, but they're not far behind. And I was genuinely happy when they finally got together. Six Days Seven Nights is an amiable film, but I feel it could have been so much more. Ford and Heche make such an engaging couple, that in an entirely different setting, this could have been a truly magical experience.

Ford should have slapped together a bamboo raft and paddled as hard as he could to get back to his mamacita.

Liked it so much I watched it twice. Oh, did I repeat myself? Just wanted to make sure you got my point...I like the leads Harrison Ford is excellent as the older ex-pat male (Quinn Harris) who has his little slice of ex-pat heaven turned on its ear by the arrival of New York careerist-yuppiette Anne Heche (Robin Monroe) - who is surprisingly appealing, notwithstanding the fact that Robin clearly displays all those negative qualities that Quinn so glibly enumerates. I find that Harrison Ford and Anne Heche both possess very enigmatic and alluring facial qualities, and as such I like many of the scenes where their facial expressions and body language convey as much emotive force as their dialogue, if not more. (The part where Robin proceeds to get loosened up on Xanax tablets, before they crash land, is worth the ticket price alone. As is the part where Quinn, slightly drunk in the resort bar, starts hitting on Robin.)In spite of seeing it in terrible pan-and-scan format, I was still struck by the excellent cinematography (wish I could see this beautiful movie in wide-screen or big-screen format pan-and-scan is totally geschnichtenfuergen). I like the flight scenes, and just the overall dream-vacation filming location of the movie (it's supposed to be near Tahiti, but apparently was filmed on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. Although, after they crash landed on that lush but deserted island, I couldn't help but visualize them being picked up in a jeep driven by Val Kilmer, and then whisked away to Dr. Moreau's compound of horrifying animal experimentations... the Island of Dr. Moreau! (demonic cackle..))There was a previous commenter who said the movie is gratuitously violent, to which another commenter responded that it isn't very violent. Well, I think it does have a violent streak in it, but, plot-wise, it all seems to work for me. Basically, Quinn and Robin get jumped by pirates (modern day pirates, that is... not the one-legged, black eyepatch-wearing swashbuckler variety of yore). Though a bit of a stretch in the movie, there is an historical precedent for modern-day pirate activity in various parts of the South Seas. In any case, yes - there is some brief but intense violence, but I only see it as serving to cement the bonding process going on between the mutually incompatible Quinn and Robin, which is essentially what the movie is all about anyway.

During an impromptu trip back to Papeete for business, a storm forces Quinn (Ford) and Robin (Heche) to land on a deserted island. There they try to survive and get off of the island. It was here, I thought, that the film had its main theme. But out of nowhere pop some pirates who try to kill Quinn & Robin. I thought the ending was rather short-cut.

People have often compared him to Gary Cooper in the sense that he brings an everyman quality to the fims he is in.  I think that this is the best work that he ever did and its ironic because this is one of the few films he has made that was not a success and I can't understand why. He and Anne Heche make movie magic, the chemistry between them is amazing. You root for Robin and Quinn all the way as they meet, crash on a deserted island, bicker, fight to survive and finally find true love and happiness. It is a joy to watch these two professionals at work playing such likeable characters. They make you care about Robin and Quinn and that is what makes the film. I think Ford must have had a ball spoofing his macho image. The man has a definite comedic flair. Anne Heche is a truly underated performer who can do both comedy and drama. People would realize this if they just left her personal life out of it. People criticized David Schwimmer's performance, but I thought he was hilarious as Heche's dopey boyfriend. Ivan Reitman's direction is impeccable. I don't know where this film was made but its simply beautiful.

Harrison Ford and Anne Heche are convincing and funny as crabby airline pilot Quinn Harris and jet-setting fashion magazine editor Robin Monroe, contending with being lost on a Pacific island, and battling with some modern-day pirates. Though their course from mutual dislike, through respect and friendship, to the finishing line of love, is familiar, they run it with style.  There are the added pleasures of spectacular scenery, realistic flying sequences, and some nifty cutting between a hula dance performance and a crash landing. (Even David Schwimmer, as Robin's waiting boyfriend with a roving eye, is for once reasonably cast.) In some respects this is a remake of the 1951 classic The African Queen - both involve a snooty woman and a tough guy thrown together in adversity. But a big difference is that, whereas Bogart and Hepburn were aged 52 and 44 when their movie was made, Ford and Heche were 56 and 29. It seems ironic that in those far off pre-feminist-movement days both movie-makers and audiences could accept older leading ladies; while now female stars over 40 can't find roles, and have to watch older male counterparts romancing women young enough to be their daughters.But most viewers will ignore such considerations, relax, and simply enjoy this cinematic equivalent of  easy listening music.

The only way off the island, is the same way they got on, by flying in a small prop plane piloted by (Quinn) Harrison Ford. So as Robin and Quinn head back to Tahiti, they encounter a storm and a crash land on a deserted island. Then the rest of the movie is about the two of them surviving and falling for each other, and watching Frank and Quinn's girlfriend cope and have sex.There were no surprises anywhere in this film, except maybe to find out that pirates still exist. From the beginning of the movie, you knew exactly what was going to happen. Frank was going to do something stupid. Robin and Quinn were going to fall in love with each other. Quinn's girlfriend was going to get naked. The engagement gets called off. Robin leaves her life in NYC to stay with Quinn. So since you know the story, the only thing left is whether or not the movie overcame the lame story. Well, it didn't.While visually the movie was stunning, the acting didn't live up to the advance billing.  Quinn's girlfriend was a token bimbo type with a great body, just there to add a little flavor to the film. Harrison Ford was not his usual macho self, but his character seemed to be going through the motions. I didn't get a real feel for how he felt. My favorite character then had to be Frank.

Looking at the film now, one must wonder what all the fuss was about as Heche puts in a very convincing performance.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Kindergarten Cop), the film tells the story of Robin Moore, a successful magazine editor (Heche) who is going on a dream vacation with her fiance, Frank (David Schwimmer - TV's Freinds). The holiday becomes a nightmare when she has to return to the mainland for a photo shoot and her plane crashes on a remote island leaving her stranded with pilot Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford).From there on, the two battle to survive not only each other but a band of pirates led by Temura Morrison (Once Were Warriors, Speed 2). Robin and Quinn's love / hate relationship soon blossoms into a lot more over their time in this remote paradise.This is such a great film that is not only entertaining but also genuinely funny as well. Among the funniest scene's is when the plane is crashing, we see Heche take a large amount of Zanex to help her relax as well as a some great one liners from Harrison Ford. The only thing that really holds the film back is David Schwimmer who becomes quite annoying by the end of the film. The two leads are both great in their roles despite the fact that Harrison Ford looked a little old for Heche. There is also some superb photography as well as a great score from Randy Elderman (Toy Story).'Six Days Seven Nights' is a nice piece of light entertainment for those who enjoy something with a bit of everything like action, adventure, comedy and romance.

The question was not so much how good the film was, but would the public accept a lesbian playing a romantic interest of Harrison Ford's.  The answer was, `no.'    The film underperformed at the box office.And that's a shame, because Heche is terrific.  She takes a stereotypical role, that of a New York magazine editor stranded on an island with pilot Ford, and instead of giving us a typical pampered/complaining/fearful woman, gives us  someone who is alive,  brave and resourceful.The rest of the film is a throwaway.  Ford has played this type of character many times before.  A subplot of murderous pirates attacking Ford and Heche belongs in another film, and the mutual attraction of Heche's fiance (played by David Schwimmer with his worst `Friends' mannerisms) and Ford's girlfriend (Jacqueline Obradors) is a waste of time.

While the casting was a little off, I still enjoyed the main characters. Especially Anne Heche's role. The shooting was nicely done and it was a film that isn't the ordinary Hollywood kind where it takes place in a studio. This movie is good because it is funny, semi-dramatic, has action, and it's not a movie that was made to change something. Here you have a nice little film that is good to watch when you want a taste of the different genres. I don't think that it was given too much publicity when it was released in the theatres, and that's mainly why I never saw it until a couple of weeks ago when it was on TV. It's cute!I enjoyed that the main female role was given to Anne Heche. She was perfect for the role because she is terribly underrated and I hope that this opened some career options for her. In my opinion, Heche can deliver comedy and drama. Some of the writing that was meant to be funny couldn't be pulled off (by Ford), but Anne did a good job. Another thing that I liked about her is that she must have been in excellent shape to pull the role off. Every film has stunt men/women, but it was pretty obvious that the two main actors did some running, swimming, etc. Casting Harrison Ford as the lead male seemed to be a mistake. I'll admit that this was the second movie that I have seem him in. I know he's supposed to be like the greatest actor now days, but I wasn't too impressed. Anyway, he really didn't fit the description as a tough pilot who gets stranded on an island. Another thing that I found odd was why the part of Monroe's fiance was played by David Schwimmer. Other than the complete failure of on screen chemistry between the two, I also frowned on the stupidity that was given to his character. The writing for him was dull and poorly written out, as well as the whole thing with him and Angelica. Boring. Sure, his character was needed and the movie wouldn't have made a whole lot of sense without him, but the crew should have casted someone else. Such as a lesser known actor. I'm not even going to comment on the role and actress of Angelica. Just that it/she was bad.The plot was creative but somewhat original. It's like Gilligan's Island without the S.S. Minnow, but like something else that I have seen before. I can't quite remember but I know that I've seen the whole 'I can't stand you but we're going to have to get along one way or another' idea before. The shooting locations (scenery) was really well put together. This film had a good atmosphere all around. I also liked the different stunts that the movie called for. Monroe and Harris were fit and looked good while trying to survive on an island. Three things I had a problem with. One - the story circling around the pirates was kind of bland not to mention un-necessary. This idea that took up a total of five minutes could have been left out and wouldn't have made a difference. Two - after everything Heche went through, specifically towards the end, she still continued to have her makeup on when the going got tough. I know, not a big deal but everything else was well thought out, I was just disappointed to see that a mistake like this was left in. And third - I found it very unbelievable that a pilot and a woman that was new to the outdoors managed to fix a plane and actually got it to fly again. The pilot could have done this but I still didn't buy it. Those were the things I had some troubles with but everything else was pleasing.Watch this movie if you want a cute, funny, little movie with a partially good cast. Despite what most people thought, I found that this was one of the better films that has a simple plot but turned into something that was very enjoyable.

In Six Days, Seven Nights Anne Heche plays a business woman who is engaged to an overbearing guy named Frank, played by David Shwimmer. When they go away to a romantic island, they meet the laid back, drunken pilot, Harrison Ford. His character Quinn is not as Anne Heche quotes, one of those guys who you send out into the wilderness with a cutip and a pocket knife and they build you a shopping mall. His character is actually realistic unlike Indiana Jones or his president at kombat in Air Force One. The movie is also rather life like itself which you will see as they prepare to leave the island. Instead of a miracle appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the film, you actually see them building and working as you would have to if you were stranded on an island.From the moment Ford and Heche meet you feel the connection they have to each other. Rather than taking a liking to each other from the beginning of the film, they constantly bicker and argue over the funniest topics, one of them being Anne Heche's t**s! When it gets towards the end of the movie they obviously start falling for each other (just like every other typical romantic comedy), but this one I enjoyed imparticularly. Other than it starring two of my favorite actors, it was unpredictable. When they get off the island it looks as if they are going to go their own separate ways, which you would never suspect in a romantic comedy. Besides this, it also throws in some great action sequences including a chase scene with pirates. This is why this film is a perfect date movie, it has the romance for the woman and the action for the men!The acting is also superb. If you had never heard of Anne Heche you would mistake her as a heterosexual. She shows no signs of homosexuality the entire movie. And in my own opinion, it shouldn't matter if she is gay. It is a great film and she is a talented actress. Harrison Ford is also terrific in his first romantic comedy since Sabrina. I only hope that I can see Ford and Heche appear in another movie together sometime soon.

Of course, in the movie, Ford is supposed to be 50-something, but believe me, he never looked worse.Back to the screenwriting, Anne Heche is so terrified of a domestic pig that appears from nowhere, she falls into a lake. However, when a snake gets in her pants while in the lake, she's cool enough to crack wise at Ford when he extricates the reptile from her undies.Please, please let this be the last time we have to endure the sniveling David Schwimmer.

It had a good rhythm and music, the photography was impressive and both the supporting actors and leading characters delivered a very funny performance. Even though Ford did not look like 45 at all, more like 55, his masculinity and the character he played were convincing enough for him to be the right choice for woman who could have been his daughter. We may be old, but sturdy. Ford is great in comedies and would be fun to see him in some more. However, once he said that he wanted to fall out of his leading hero role and become a character actor.

Ivan Reitman has created a niche in telling the Hollywood story, he knows the deal. You get attractive leads. You make a situation where they are put on an island and through urgency, they have to work together. It's all very standard stuff. But Reitman fills in whatever void he can with comedy and it's purely hit-and-miss from how you feel about it.Robin, recently engaged and on vacation, seeks the help of Quinn, who seeks solitude and the simple life after a world of hurt. Quinn flew her to their vacation spot, but for several hundred more dollars, she enlists his help to fly her to Tahiti for a quick assignment her job asks of her. A storm downs them on a remote island and they're stuck with each other.How Ford and Heche work on screen is so important for a film that commands it, but the story is so by-the-numbers, you may find yourself wondering when the couple will just cut to the chase and get off the island.

Second best, the many assassinations cross-cut with the baptism, in (I think) Godfather two.  The third, maybe the military funeral of the bum's brother, cross-cut with little children Xmas singing to President Bartlett in a recent West Wing.The worst example THAT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, is the cross-cutting of all things during the crash landing mixed with David Schwimmer's dancing in an island night club in SIX DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS.Once I saw that, I started viewing Schwimmer's performance as the most overdone 'fop' performance in decades.  I was hoping that the great director, William Wiler could come back to life saying, Ok, once more David; BUT A LITTLE LESS!!!!!!  And I did not have it in for David prior!

It might not be so bad if the film wasn't so 90s. The dated presentation and production design really is quite distracting in the present day.Anne Heche and the wooden David Schwimmer play a couple in love who take a quick vacation to the South Pacific. Harrison Ford plays the grouchy pilot who flies them to their island resort. But a mishap leads to a plane crash leaving Ford and Heche stranded while Schwimmer has to mourn his lost love, leading to the not-so-shocking revelation that he the experience has revealed no character to him whatsoever. A fact that the writer tries to cover-up by not-so-cleverly working it into the dialogue.The dialogue and humor is cheap, simple, and easy. The music generic and dated. All this film really has going for it is some pretty scenery. They try to liven things up by introducing pirates 30 minutes from the end, but they seem unnaturally shoehorned in. None of them are given names, have barely 5 minutes screen time, and hardly any dialogue.The trailers promised an old-fashioned island adventure movie. What they actually gave us was more of a romantic comedy. There were action scenes featured in the trailer that are not in the movie. The running time of 101 minutes and the very abrupt resolution gives the impression that there was more action and plot before someone ordered it to be cut out.What's left is just an okay movie. It is neither original nor clever and has no spark, no edge, and no bite. David Schwimmer once more proves he can only do one character (Ross Geller) and can't even do it very well.Six Days, Seven Nights is hardly groundbreaking but is an enjoyable time-waster.

The plot is nothing above the standard action-adventure plot but the acting does help move this movie above average.From time to time Harrison Ford, who plays Quinn, has to remind us that he is a great actor, not just an action-adventure star. He has had non-action films over the years from Regarding Henry to Sabrina to Working Girl. He turns in the usual gruff Indiana Jones role he is known for here. Yes, the movie has some action parts to it but it is not the focus and seems to be just filler. Anne Heche, who plays Robin, turns in what has to be the best acting ever in film. At the time this film came out she came out and had a relationship with Ellen DeGeneres for several years. Never in the film do you get the sense that she is not into Harrison as their fighting turns into love. If that isn't the best acting I don't know what is. You really can't fake screen chemistry and she and Harrison actually have it. It is a shame that her career took a nose dive after this movie when she had issues with substance abuse and the tabloids.David Schwimmer, plays Robin's fiance Frank Martin. In a sub plot he thinks Robin is dead and he ends up sleeping with Quinn's girl friend Angelica. His acting is really not that much different than his character on the TV show Friends.Angelica, played by Jacqueline Obradors is a treat as the oversexed dancer who thinks everyone has sex after a funeral (that was the best line in my view).As I said the plot was pretty much by the numbers which is a shame because with it being Directed by Ivan Reitman I thought there might be some extremely goofy moments he has been known for in other films. It is a shame the script wasn't better.

A long stretch of time between two people whose initial personalities are in conflict while their inner emotions are in total denial. Harrison Ford plays a pilot who spirits David Schwimmer and Anne Heche off to the tropical. In order to match Ford and Heche together the screenwriter concocts a sudden business trip where he must pilot her away but the plane goes down in the heat of a storm.

Lame plot doubles back and forth between Ford and Heche and the lame guilt ridden affair David Schwimmer indulges in that nobody cares about. Director Ivan Reitman doesn't clash romance, humour and adventure very successfully, and that is unfortunate since he has directed such superior films as Ghostbusters and Stripes. Ford and Heche are able actors stranded within lame situations that are beneath them. Schwimmer is horrible as the guilt ridden beau who needs another drink after being associated with this junk.

I saw this movie quite a while ago and the only reason why I am even talking about it is because I recently saw a story on cinema blender that suggested this would be a great idea for a remake. The problem is that the movie barely registered in my memory (never a good sign when measuring the entertainment value of a film) and then I remembered how boring it was. This was supposed to be a romance, comedy, and action all in one where Harrison Ford and Anne Heche are stranded on a desert island, they hate each other, are forced to band together, and then fall in love. One basic problem of the plot is how is that a sophisticated New York woman like Anne Heche, can fall for a man over half her age? I mean, Harrison Ford is not exactly a young chicken here. All this might be forgiven if the movie wasn't so darn boring. The comedy falls flat, much of the movie is nothing but Ford and Heche arguing, and even when some pirates show up, there just doesn't seem to be any thrill at all. Some people here have said the movie failed at the box office because of the fact that Anne Hache was dating Ellen DeGeneres at the time and people simply discriminated against the movie for that reason.

Six days and Seven Nights is described as an hilarious adventure but feels more like the holiday from hell with its predictable script, a choice of poor settings and one of the most awful and predictable romances to ever emerge on screen. From a man who has starred in the legendary Star Wars and Indian Jones quadrilogy, you would have expected Harrison Ford to be in more intelligent and sophisticated films than this, what can only be described, as a promising prospect gone completely wrong. Ford's talents are wasted against the tiresome script that gives no interest or excitement as it is based on a feeble against all odds morality test. Dull and with no sense of what to focus on, this 1998 picture is an abomination of an adventure. Cast Away, though emerging on screens a few years after this release, tells the story of a man lost with no means of getting home. Tom Hanks gave an Oscar nominated performance as the man desperate to survive and keep himself sane. Now that 2000 Zemeckis film was what the human spirit and survival should be like, a tear jerking journey that puts you inside the character's mind and makes you truly wonder.This plot doesn't know what to cover. The obvious mismatched couple crashing is as predictable as falling rain and the idea that they will hit it off is as clear as day.

First survival against the elements, then lust then exploration. And it seems the inaccurate concept of adventure needed an even dafter reason to entertain so some stereotypical pirates were encoded, just for extra eyebrow raising.There is not enough dialogue to justify the 'hilarious adventure' description. When trying to be funny, it's the typical pit pocking appearance regime or how funny it is to see how predictable the situations can be. Unsurprising, mismatched and so unadventurous you keep looking at your watch wondering when the inevitable will finally arrive. "},{"Title":"An enjoyable movie getaway that becomes surprisingly violent.","Date":"7 February 1999","Score":"7 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  One of the more entertaining comedy movies for the husband-and-wife crowd, SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS offers the peculiar feeling of a vacation getaway that runs amuck. Harrison Ford, a guy we know from many action thrillers this day, is far from being offbeat, and Anne Heche proves to be very reasonable. The adventure is otherwise an enjoyable amount of fun with perils and obstacles abound, all with a sense of humor. But the film loses a precious point for a surprisingly fair amount of violence that goes off the deep end when smugglers spot our two castaways and begin to attack using guns and explosives. Not true for a delightfully romantic evening in the living room. As comedies go, this one could use a bit more of the funny, however this cinematic getaway of mishaps is worth the pleasure. This would've deserved a 7 without the unnecesary violence, but you'll either have to take the 6, or find another nice movie to keep your wife happy.  "}]
