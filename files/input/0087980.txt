Look.  I read Maugham's book in the late 40s and saw the Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, Clifton Webb film.  So what?  This film was neither one but that's beauty of art, dudes.  It doesn't have to.  The Razor's Edge is an odyssey of a man in search of himself.  The transit nature of life and the brutality of war turn him into a superfluous man, who goes off on a quest to find himself.  We can inundate this issue with metaphors until the cows come home, but that's Maugham's story.  Old Somerset, a closet homosexual who was a volunteer in the horrorific WW1 went through a similar transformation and in a way, this novel, which he began back in the 20s, reflects that journey.  Murray takes the character of Larry Darrell into a new domain.  Why shouldn't he?  He's not Tyrone Power.  He's a comedian who plays a tragic role straight.  There is much in this film that makes it superior to the 40s version.  A stronger statement of the tragedy of the entanglement of the two women and a more intense presentation of the character of Larry. I saw this film when it first aired and recalled a young high school kid remarking to a friend upon exiting, Man, this is a totally awesome movie.  I agree.  Alas, the critics and comedy-addicted Murray fa ns didn't and it flopped.  Pity.  It is a totally awesome movie.

It has remained one of my favorite films for fifteen years, and I have owned it and replayed it many times. If you look at the viewer feedback for this film you will find that the vast majority of people rate is as `Excellent' movie (29% of IMDB viewers give it a perfect `10/10' rating).   Those who fail to see it's qualities can be divided fairly equally into the `don't get it' camp (Unlike the typical Hollywood lowest denominator flicks, the minimum IQ for viewing is Razor's Edge is probably at least 100, and that leaves Â½ the population out), and the `disappointed' crowd, who have so typecast the star (Bill Murray) that they wanted `Caddyshack' and just can't allow him to be a serious actor. You must set aside your prejudices and give the man a chance-Bill Murray is a Harvard grad who co-wrote the screenplay-this was a labor of love for him. Just because he has a sense of humor does NOT make him a lightweight, as this film demonstrates for anyone with the eyes to see it.Based upon the 1942 W. Somerset Maugham novel, it follows the evolution of a spoiled upper class boy from Illinois (Larry, Bill Murray), who volunteers to be an ambulance driver in WW I for a little `fun and adventure' and instead gets a dose of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).  His world was forever changed by the events he experienced.  He literally could not go home again after the war.  He tried, and found the lives of those around him to be shallow and meaningless, and their pursuits and interests just trivial.  There had to be a reason why he was here, and this sets the stage for the real point of the movie, which is an exploration of the meaning of life. (I told you it wasn't Caddyshack!)Obsessed with these existential issues, and finding that alcohol did not make the need go away, Larry travels to Paris, and starts to read, serious books on philosophy and religion, supporting himself as a laborer.   He does not care much for his surroundings-his lack of materialism is in marked contrast to his peers and friends from before, whose dreams are to grow wealthy in the stock market.  As such Larry was an early Bohemian.  I found this particularly poignant, realizing as I watched this movie that it foreshadowed yet another stock market boom and bust a whole new generation of crass materialists have had their world was just as rocked by a stock market crash in 1999 as in 1929.  History does repeat, and these themes are timeless. His fiancee could not deal with his `common' friends and lack of modern plumbing, and left him to marry someone she did not love but who had money. Another contrast to the shallow and materialistic, which is a recurring theme throughout the film-what brings happiness to a man?Larry's journey took him to India, and Hindu religion, and then on to Tibet to discover Buddha-the scenes filmed there are absolutely breathtaking, so I hope you can find a letterbox laserdisc or they finally bring this out on DVD-it is worth it to see the whole screen. There is romance, and love, and loss.   I won't reveal the ending, which is truly bittersweet, and a bit nihilistic.  This is truly the best thing this fine actor ever accomplished, and I rate it a strong `10'.   This should have won many awards, and should also be considered a true classic; I am disappointed in my fellow man that they so typecast the star that they could not see what a great contribution he made with this effort here.  Not light fare, and a long film, but one worth seeing.

Murray is perfection in this role, because we seem him change from something we recognize to something quite different.  It is a palpable and comprehensible transformation - the movie draws us in, it allows us to change with him.The rest of the characters are well cast and provide definitive counterpoint to the protagonist - the bon-vivant aristocratic uncle Elliot who simply lives his life appreciatively, the unthinking and manipulative Isabel concerned only with her own comforts and social standing, the uncertain Sophie that allows her uncertainty to trap and destroy her, the practical yet contemplative Raaz who challenges Darrell's notion of things, constructively, and leads him to further his quest.  Good character development, all around.Finally, I was impressed with the faithfulness to the book.  It's difficult for a movie to be that, and still be an watchable movie.

Murray is far more flexible as an actor than he usually demonstrates or is given credit for. He is more than just a comedian.The failure of this movie at the box office rests squarely on the shoulders of Paramount. They gave this movie so little support or advertising money that it was almost doomed to fail. To be honest, if the internet and IMDb had existed back then, the coast to coast word of mouth that could have been generated might have made this movie a winner at the box office.There is a story about this movie that I once heard. Murrary had read the book and the script by Byrum, who also directed. Murrary approached the studio and told them he wanted to make this movie. The story goes that they respond with, Sure, Bill, we'll make The Razor's Edge for you if you will make this little movie called Ghostbusters for us. He agreed and Paramount technically stuck to the deal, but they put no money into its promotion and it dead an untimely death.This is one of the great films of all-time and it is just a shame that more people have not seen it.

In the end Larry's search was fruitless. No book, no bottle, no friend could provide the answer because it did not exist. Life, meaning, purpose, all of these things were succinctly, artfully and convincingly tossed aside as incidental, even distracting to the true meaning of life, which is nothingness.Hopefully that's not too disarming, because the film is simply one of the best ever made (top ten? certainly.). It was an almost incalculable improvement over the 1946 version, which was truly awful. Murray did not preach, he showed by example, whereas the early version was like a post-WWII government instructional film on how to attain karma. Murray's performance was so subtle as even to be missed all together (in my opinion the best acting of all), whereas Power was begging you to see the light.Please, don't miss this film, and if you don't get it first time around, empty your mind of distracting clutter and see it again.

It's a nice film to look at, as the period and place production really sucks one into the story, and has what I thought of as a cozy pacing, but what some might think drags on a little (it was a great, alone-on-a-rainy-Sunday, laying-on-the-couch rental for me).The film does a good job of playing ideas with scenes, and playing the ideas/scenes off of seemingly drastically different ones, from the barren emptiness of a battlefield to the uplifting emptiness of the Himalayas, to the warm loneliness of a Paris cafÃ©, to the cold loneliness of a rich man's death bed.This is obviously a true labor of love for Bill Murray. He nails his character and the ideas the script attempts to channel through his character's development.

Darrell's search within takes him across the globe through many different scenarios, and Murray adds a welcome dose of humanity and - to be quite frank humour, as he treads the path to salvation.The novel by Somerset Maugham is an excellent read, and its not that the performance of Murray detracts from, or belittles the plight of Darrell, rather it enhances it.

Until this one he was best remembered as a goofball in movies like Caddyshack and Stripes, or a comedian in Ghostbusters. Edge was made a full nine years before his best dramatic role as Phil in the superb 1993 film, Groundhog Day. I like Edge very much because it takes the time to develop the characters, and examines Larry's quest to find the meaning of life after his WWI experiences.some SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read any further if you have not yet seen The Razor's Edge.The film begins outdoors at the Lake Forest, Il college graduating class party, everyone is joyful, nicely dressed, there are rides and a kissing booth. Larry (Murray) and his best friend Gray have volunteered to be ambulance drivers for the war. Larry is a shallow, charming guy, but comes home from the war changed, after seeing the realities of friends getting killed right next to him. He postpones his marriage and leaves his fiancee at home as he travels to France, and eventually to Tibet, for his own search for the meaning of life.His awareness is heightened while, working in a mine, he pushes his boozing supervisor to safety as a rail car is about to kill him. He does end up in Tibet, has an experience on the top of a mountain, and finds the internal peace that he was looking for.Meanwhile, his fiancee, looking for a family and stability, marries his best friend, Gray.  His one true love, Sophie, had married Bob, but Bob and their son were killed in a wreck by a drunken driver. Sophie eventually ends up in a Paris brothel, never recovering from her tragedy. The economic depression of the 1920s hit, making those formerly wealthy people distraught. Larry helps his old friend relax, coin in hand, and the headaches disappear.When Larry meets up with Sophie again, he rescues her from the brothel, sobers her up, they plan to marry. Until she has a relapse, there is a fight in the brothel, Larry gets beat up, the next day Sophie's body is found in the river, her throat had been slashed. But Larry is somber, he knows each of us is really alone in the world anyway. Disappointed, he finally heads back home, America. In the last, symbolic scene, he is walking up a very long flight of concrete stairs outside, and as he gets nearer the top, starts to run up them. The DVD is just OK. There are many artifacts on the image, either by a dirty camera gate or, more likely, a poor transfer from film to digital. There are no extras of interest, and the sound is just OK. Still, a very good film for anyone who likes good character studies. Murry demonstrates his acting chops early, even though he was 34 here.

A good deal of the fault for that lies in both the direction and the performances. The general ennui of the performances may in fact be laid at the director's feet. All are capable actors as they've shown elsewhere but here be it a mismatch of actor/actress and part or lack of direction most founder. Theresa Russell does the film's best work but even her Sophie is missing the bruised sorrow that made Anne Baxter's take on the part so compelling and won her the Oscar for best supporting actress. James Keach evaporates from the screen in a rather thankless role that John Payne managed to make an impression in with a show of quiet strength. Surprisingly the weakest of the star spots is Catherine Hicks, usually a very fine actress, adrift in her part. She exudes a warm presence on screen totally wrong for the heartless, mindlessly cruel Isabel that Gene Tierney playing with an icy edge made vivid.A good try but only average.

What kind of casting is that I and many others wondered. Almost 30 years later, I'm still wondering.The original adaption was driven by Tyrone Power probably at his most heroic as the World War I veteran earnestly seeking some kind of philosophical grounding. As Herbert Marshall observes in that film, Power is possibly the most amazing individual he's ever met. No one could have said that about Bill Murray. Try as I may I expected at numerous points in the film Dan Ackroyd and the rest coming on accompanied by the Ghostbusters theme.It's the same plot for the most part, Murray begs off his expected engagement and marriage to Catherine Hicks saying he wants to go to Europe. She refuses to believe it's for study, she just thinks he wants to sow wild oats. His quest and her misunderstanding of him is what drives the rest of the film. After Murray and Hicks have been reunited in Paris along comes Theresa Russell playing the part of Sophie for which Anne Baxter got a Best Supporting Actress Award. Russell comes closest though she doesn't make it quite herself to equaling the original performer. Baxter is a study in degradation from an eager newlywed to a woman who after losing her husband and baby in a car crash drifts to Europe and becomes a streetwalker. Murray as did Power in the original tries to rescue her, but to no avail. There's a different emphasis here as Russell's role is built up at the expense of Hicks's part which was done by Gene Tierney in the original. That was a mistake for as great as Baxter was, in fact the role is a supporting one.Denholm Elliott who usually I like was a pale reflection of Clifton Webb as the society obsessed Uncle Elliott Templeton for which he got a Best Supporting Actor nomination. The part of the author W. Somerset Maugham was written into the original and played to perfection by Herbert Marshall. He narrates and he's the observer of events. It's a very reflective plot device guiding the viewer to what the author was trying to say. Marshall played Maugham in two films and was so effective, he's the image we have of W. Somerset Maugham today. That overall narration was needed, but Murray took the lead into places that Tyrone Power did not and not for the better. Maybe he really was sowing wild oats.I recommend highly renting or buying the DVD of the original version of The Razor's Edge before you see this and see what I mean.

They both focus on an individual who sort of runs away from their life, travels, and attempts to find more meaning in their lives.Personally, the source material gives A Razor's Edge an unfair advantage. But listening to my own criticisms of Eat, Pray, love, I had to think back to one of my own personal favorite films, the Bill Murray version of The Razor's Edge. Some have argued that the Maugham novel was far better than the film, but I disagree. I've read the Maugham novel. I saw the movie. I prefer the film, though I liked them both a great deal.The themes of the novel are there in the film, but the movie chooses to focus on the themes through Larry's story rather than through Uncle Elliot's. The novel focuses most of the time telling Elliot Templeton's life, with this strange bird Larry floating in and out of the scene from time to time. They are both characters on journeys seeking meaning. They both find what they need to find at the end, and it isn't what they set out to find in the beginning.The reason I love this story, no matter which way it's told, is that it fundamentally understands reality in a way that the current rendition ('Eat, Pray, Love') does not. Life is not always going to be pretty, and certainly not just because you have some sort of higher 'mission' to find true meaning in your life. The bad people in A Razor's Edge end up being so much more reprehensible than those in Eat, Pray, Love, and yet you end up hating the lead character in the latter film oh so much more for being so banal. (Isabel is one of the truly evil creatures in literature. Liz is just a thinly veiled version of the author, who naturally can't see that she's vile.) The themes of the two stories? The Razor's Edge, both versions, is truly a student of existential philosophy, The only meaning, the only reward, in life is the experience you have in living it. Eat, Pray, Love, on the other hand, is a child of excess whose only message seems to be, It doesn't matter who you hurt along the way as long as you feel good in the end. There is a certain self-indulgence required in this sort of 'journey of self-discovery' tale. But no one can really say that Larry didn't pay for going on his journey. Maybe it's just as self-indulgent that he did so, but I ended up truly liking and admiring Larry at the end of his journey. Liz, and I cannot really waffle on this primordial instinct, most totally deserves the destined place she has reserved in the 3rd circle of Hell (Gluttony), with an occasional weekend spent in the 7.3.3 circle of Hell (Violence against Art).

The strong point of the film is its' slow build to a point of outer conflict, (the war), followed by the resulting inner conflict of the soul in reaction to the devastation of values on every conceivable level that the surviving characters encountered and felt! They were forced by their inner conflict, (battle field fatigue,later called delayed stress half a century later), to stay in Paris after the War to end all Wars,(The Lost Generation), and try to understand what the hell it was all for, what the hell life was all about, and what the hell was the payoff for a life well lived according to the rules of society. Those rules seemed to not work any longer. The search for a new truth became almost revolutionary as it affected every facet of life; from Science to Literature, to the Arts, and everything else.The Lost Generation questioned everything that had ever been assumed about life and it's motivations, and rewards for a, life well lived, because they found the past models of society sadly lacking in the presence of their current world. Bill Murrays' character cannot carry on without resolving these questions and in a journey to the far reaches of the Himalayas, and back he encounters those special teachers that appear when the student is ready to become taught, willing to open his mind to Truth never before realized, and cleanse the angst that blocks his soul. It is a confrontation with himself. It is a journey to the center of the realization that the NOW is all there is, and the only payoff in life is in the enjoyment of the present fullfillment of lifes' events as they unfold, and crystalize while trying to add his light and energy into the equation in the most natural way he can without his own self-will running amok, and over everyone else. It is about trying to find a way to come into harmony.It is about the process of learning to live in the moment instead of for the moment, and without the clutter of societies rules.It was beautifully acted, directed, and photographed, and started with a great screenplay. In a rare occurance it turns out to be even better than the original film. If you see nothing else and want to be intellectually moved and spiritually enlivened, then see this film. See it before it is no longer available. It is a joy to experience.

It may be my favorite movie. As I understand it, the main character in this movie, Larry Darryl, is actually based (as in the book by Somerset Maugham) on a real person. Some people believe that the character Larry Darryl was based on the life of a man named Guy Hague who went to India after the First World War and met Sri Ramana Maharshi.The book and the Bill Murray movie are very different in how they tell the story but, in my view, they end up in much the same place. I really like the way Bill Murray takes his character to the end of the story. In this movie the main character skips off and leaves the story wide open. Under the circumstances I think it's a nearly perfect ending. I say nearly perfect as perfection on Earth doesn't exist. But, I believe that enlightenment does exist and with it inner peace.In the 1984 movie Larry falls in love with Sophie, played by Theresa Russell. She, in my view, is gorgeous in this movie. The character, Sophie, is complex and embodies the human condition, craving and suffering, the inability to overcome self hatred. Ms. Russell is awesome in this movie.If you like brainless action movies then don't bother with this one. If you like movies that ask the big questions then this is as good as it gets.

Some explanations are given in the very ending of the movie and without those, the movie would have lacked a meaning.The part i found interesting was how amazingly accurate, if I may say so, the story of Darrel's emotional journey is told in the movie. I've been there and I've tried to explain the same things to a lady. It was a huge long deja-vu on my part and I believe that the people who actually liked it also are the ones who feel they can relate closely to the plot and to the characters.

I, too, have watched the movie multiple times, liking what Bill Murray brought to the character of Larry Darrell, whereas I could barely make it through Lost in Translation. In that latter Murray work, I could not bring myself to care whether he would get together with the chick or not, but in The Razor's Edge I found so many characters to care about. Even a minor character like Joseph, Elliott's butler, showed traces of the conflicts that swirled in the people around him. I think that this deep layering is what strikes a chord with those who love the film.A few points I don't think that Larry did not find what he was seeking. He found his grail on the mountain, in the hut. He was supposed to toil to be worthy of meeting the Holy Man, and when he was eventually given permission to ascend the mountain, he survived harsh conditions to reach the hut. After waiting and waiting for the Holy Man, he comes to a point of realization, smiles over it, and begins to burn the pages of his precious scripture for heat. He did meet the holy man, who was within the self. Moreover, the novel certainly does not suggest that Larry's quest was for naught. He becomes a luminous person who confounds his friends by pursuing his life's purpose with clarity and compassion.Neither do I think that the ending was nihilistic. Byrum faced a labyrinth as Maugham juxtaposed segments in his text, the novelist following the natural rhythm of flashback rather than standard narrative chronology. When Joseph asks Larry Where are you going? and Larry says Home, Joseph follows up with But where is your home, Larry? And Larry answers America. He is going back to the place to rectify the mistakes of his unenlightened youth.Some commenters prefer the 1946 movie, and while I enjoy it, I think it missed the point of the book. Take the scene with the monk that Larry (Tyrone Power) converses with he's not Indian, but a white actor (kind of comically) faking an Indian accent and wearing a robe reminiscent of ancient Greece, and not early twentieth-century India. The philosophy is given as a homily, so viewers have nothing to reach for. Clifton Webb is very entertaining but is over-the-top, and so is Gene Tierney. The movie is less cinema than it is stage-play, and the ending gives the audience little credit for intelligence.Finally, how deeply the 1984 film was faithful to the book does not concern me the Murray version supplied a coherence that made me appreciate the novel more. Other movies which have done that are Out of Africa, The French Lieutenant's Woman, Far From the Madding Crowd, and the latest version of Pride and Prejudice. Good company indeed. Especially when I'm still waiting for the genre to do justice to The Great Gatsby or The Scarlet Letter, whose best versions are slightly above average, and whose worst are slow and indulgent.

That was the only part of the film that didn't speak to me.The central theme as expressed at the end of the film is where Larry tells his old flame Isabel When Piedmont died, I had to pay him back for my life. I found out there's another debt to pay - for the privilege of being alive. I thought Sophie was my reward for trying to live a good life. Uh uh. There is no payoff - not now. I think that is a useful truth regardless if one is religious or not.Bill Murray was great as Larry. Of course there are small bits where his history in comedy come through, although I thought some of those small bits were a bit out of character for this film. One example was when he sends down a basket on a rope to get some bread and tea delivered from the cafÃ© next to his apartment building. He lets out the rope too fast and you hear it crash into someone who yells out in French. Yes it was humorous but was too much for the tone of the film. Luckily the majority of the film does have some funny bits more in keeping from the situation and dialogue.Catherine Hicks' Isabel Bradley was great too. I have always liked Hicks and think she is a good actress. Theresa Russell steals the show as Sophie MacDonald. The scene in the hospital after the traffic accident is probably the best scene I've ever seen in film.The rest of the cast is excellent as well.I get goose bumps when the film opens with the theme music. Jack Nitzsche score just adds layers onto a full canvas.This is a very underrated film and from it I knew Murray could do more serious roles which he has done in recent years.

I remember, because I loved Bill Murray since the beginnings of SNL in the mid-70s, and I guess because he had the same class-clown humor that always got me sent to the principal's office. I went to the opening day of this movie because I sensed he would be terrific -- the serious side of a funny man, exposed at last.Well ...yes. I recall enjoying immensely the sweep of the film; but having read the book, I worried that too many viewers wouldn't get it since this Somerset Maugham novel, like Of Human Bondage, would be a challenge to translate to film. Overall, I think the job was done well and certainly better than the Tyrone Power version. But, as much as I liked Bill Murray (now, as well as then) I was somewhat annoyed how he kept sliding into his Nick Rails lounge act. It created a dissonance that I feel hurt the box-office in the long run Imagine, some folks showing up thinking they are to see a comedy; and others (like me) thinking we're to witness a major transition. Murray kinda split the difference, which I think is one weak point of an overall enjoyable film.Now, having just revisited the same movie via NetFlix, my original opinion hasn't changed -- but I still really like this movie, despite its unevenness and quirks. There are some powerful and touching scenes; and I'm reminded again of what a challenge it must have been to contemplate putting Maugham's novel to cinema. I do think that those who are not familiar with the novel might have a hard time coping with the sudden geographic twists, and a somewhat weak introduction of the inter-connection of the various roles. It all comes together eventually, but I just think of those folks sitting behind me, whispering, Where the heck are they now?Bill Murray has since made Lost in Translation and Broken Flowers and, for those who enjoyed those films, one beauty of Razor's Edge is seeing him in his first serious film. What may be hard for first-time viewers of Razor's Edge is to understand how Maugham's novel -- in which Larry spends the first half seeking the meaning of life -- defied the conventional assumption, and didn't really dwell on anything so profound as the search itself.I very much enjoyed revisiting this movie after 20+ years ... and found it far deeper and more complex in spirit than I recalled.

Marked by this experience, he distances himself from the high life in America and begins a global search for life's meaning, from the mines of Britannia to the mountains of Tibet.Beautifully mounted, the 80s 'Razor's Edge' assembles a lot of great components, yet never fully meets expectation. From a writing standpoint, this is down to the inciting incident that leads to Larry's soul search it just isn't well developed enough. The WW1 segment isn't very long, and you don't really get the impression that Larry is scarred or shocked by it. What's more, they try to have him have this relationship with his officer, Piedmont (played by Brian Murray), but the screen time they do share sees them more at odds or Larry being bewildered by the brashness of Piedmont. Why does his death matter so much to Larry? As a byproduct of this one misfire, it weakens everything else in the story, and makes Larry's journey not feel as powerful or weighty as it so badly needs to be.This is a genuine shame that they got this one key element wrong, as everything else is top notch. It's very well filmed, especially thanks to its international, on location backdrop. The stuff up in the Himalayas in particular is pretty spectacular. Performances are also of a similar calibre; for his first straight role, old Bill isn't half bad. Sometimes he can be a little rigid, but for the most part, his dryness and friendly demeanour compensate. He is joined by the likes of Catherine Hicks, Theresa Russell and James Keach, who all add solid work. And finally, Jack Nitzsche's score; very elegant, and though it mainly relies on a recurring motif of strings that sounds very similar to Morricone's 'Time of Destiny', it actually works rather well and is genuinely moving.In the end, 'Razor's Edge' is an ambitious failure, but not a boring or indulgent one at least.

True, that the supporting cast is somewhat cartoonish, but Murray is genuine and is the very essence of the film. Theresa Russel should however also be mentioned as someone who is genuine (otherwise she wouldn't have made 'Whore') and shows this in this film too. And then there is Denholm Elliot of course, but in a very ungrateful role. It's a film that will make a deep impression on you, if you are generous enough to accept that it doesn't try to impress on it's public by being 'literature' or some other equal nonsense. Nothing pretentious here.Addition On later viewings, I'm still impressed with this film. It's too short though. It should have been at least five hours long taking the novel more as a pretense than actually following it. Larry's time as a worker, his time in Tibet and his time with Sophie could have been extended considerably as well as maybe even his time with Piedmont. On the whole this story seems to be so much more than Somerset Maugham - but maybe I'm unfair in assuming so. As it stands now, it is still a fine film and better than the one with Tyrone Power and Clifton Webb, which by no means was a bad film. The simple but beautiful score is yet another reason why I like the film and there's not one actor in it, which I would like to replace. To make the trip that Larry does in this movie, we probably do not have to go to France nor to Tibet. Nor do we need a first world war - that's for sure! We do however need to believe that there is a meaning to our life and maybe several meanings and that finding out that meaning is what life is all about. I believe that a Larry of today would have to be some kind of a Joe Hill or some other freedom-fighter, since there can be no reality without fighting for justice.

Larry Darrell (Bill Murray) with his girlfriend Isabel Bradley (Catherine Hicks), his best friend Gray Maturin (James Keach) and Sophie MacDonald (Theresa Russell) live a comfortable upper class life. Larry and Gray go to Europe to drive an ambulance. After the war, Larry goes in search for himself. In Paris, he and Isabel end up not getting married as he pushes on as a coal miner and eventually cooking at a Tibetan monastery. Isabel ends up married to Gray who goes to work for his father. The Great Depression hits the family brokerage hard and Gray's father commits suicide. Sophie suffers after her husband and child are killed in a car crash. Larry runs into Isabel and Gray with their two daughters now broke in Paris. They also find Sophie who became a drug addicted prostitute.Bill Murray does a good but not a great job. He is always great at the zen jester character. He just can't reach the darker depths necessary during and right after the war. It also occurs to me that this is the story of two people. Isabel is the other person and the movie needs to zero in on that. Theresa Russell would have been a great Isabel although she's a perfectly fine Sophie in the movie. Sophie could have done by somebody more fragile. It's a good attempt by Murray but not all successful.

Larry Darrell embodies something that the human spirit always longs for, meaning. Therefore the Character of Larry Darrell is the incarnate for that 'Search' of whatever void there is in a persons soul. And the longing to fill that void. I like Bill Murray even better than I did before when I found out more about the history behind him doing this role. Mr. Murray really wanted to do this film and play this character as he identified with the character in a lot of ways. Also, Bill Murray wrote a monologue in the movie about a character who dies which he wrote in actuality for John Belushi(it makes the scene a lot more endearing seeing it now after knowing that fact). The Razor's Edge is one of my favorite books by W. Somerset Maugham and it was turned into a movie years before this one with Tyrone Power. Power played Darrell very well, he embodied Larry Darrell's unattainable quality to a tee. However, so did Bill Murray, in just a very different way Murray did. Bill Murray plays Larry with such an indifference, where you will see Murray in many scenes with a Blank Look or Murray's usual Dead Pan face. Murray makes a valiant effort at playing one of the most complicated characters of our time in Larry Darrell. The performance Bill Murray gives is hit and miss. However, whether Murray meant to or not, the character of Larry Darrell is very hit and miss as well. Darrell is unattainable, enigmatic, confusing, and perhaps wild at heart, and also perhaps there's nothing going on in Darrell's head or there is so much going on in Darrell's head, you never know from reading the book nor from the movies. So with that said, Murray playing the character the way he did might have been spot on. It's kind of to the eye of the beholder, and in some ways I do think Murray's Blank Stare and Dead Pan features were perfect for how Larry Darrell is. So in some ways, I think Murray made some very good choices on purpose or not on purpose in playing Darrell, but also in my subjective opinion, there were other scenes that I wish he would have made different choices on. But again, knowing that Murray wanted to play this role so bad and that he even wrote the movie along with other screenwriters, makes me like Murray all the more. Bill Murray is a great actor, very underrated in his greatness. This version of The Razor's Edge has a Terrific Music Score, you would think this is a great movie by how great the music score is, and the movie is almost great, but like Murray's performance, it's hit and miss. Some scenes in the movie are very powerful and great(Some scenes are some of the best you will ever see in my opinion). And some scenes aren't so great, they're kind of off, etc.(again, my subjective opinion). Theresa Russell gives an absolutely terrific performance as Sophie. I believe Russell would have been nominated for an academy award for her performance of Sophie, but the fact remains that in the Tyrone Power version made years ago, Anne Baxter was just as exceptional in the role of Sophie, and Anne Baxter was nominated and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in that role. Both Baxter and Russell were equally terrific in that role and it's tough to say who I like better, very tough to say in fact. Which I really can't, they're equally great. Finally, there's a scene in the movie that hits it right on the money. The book had this particular scenario go a different way as the Tyrone Power version stayed true to the book in this particular scene(basically this particular scene in the Murray version didn't exist in the book or Tyrone Power version).However, I don't know if Murray wrote this scene or not, but the book should have written this part into it, the way it's written and executed in the Murray version. It's an extremely powerful scene and true to the characters. It's a scene where Darrell tries to rescue Sophie from some bad men(I'll just say that without spoiling the scene). Bill Murray plays this very difficult scene terrifically as does Russell, and again, the book doesn't have this, but I wish it would have, it's much more effective in this Murray version. Larry Darrell is a tough character to play. Other actors who have played a similar type of character are Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall(which Brad Pitt played that type of part perfectly I thought, in more of a romantic kind of way)as well as Peter Gallagher in Underneath and also Richard Tyson in Two Moon Junction(where he plays the mysteriousness of that type of character well, even though he's more of a cad and playboy Lothario, but still deep in his enigmatic qualities).

Bill Murray's character finds out that there is much more to life and that it can be very difficult to face. There were characters hiding behind drugs and alcohol or the shallow trappings of high society. The posted quote of Murray's character about his fellow ambulance driver does not contain the most important part. The driver had always written off other killed people as Liars and they won't be missed. Bill Murray labels him as a liar and says that he won't be missed. This is a fundamental of PTSD. One does not have to face the grief and horror if they can diminish the person/enemy/friend in any way. As far as the whole movie's meaning, you sort out what or who is important in your life and cast away the rest. I thank Summerset Maugham and Bill Murray for bringing this movie to life for me.

The crucial moment in that film comes when the rag-tag kids at the camp where Murray is a counselor are locked in a hopeless Olympic-style athletic competition with the rich-kid camp across the lake. Their opponents have all the advantages and can't possibly lose. Murray's pep talk turns into a recitation of all the reasons why his kids are beaten before they start and devolves into Murray beating a fire log on the floor and chanting, It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! putting the whole silly thing in the proper perspective with the important things in their lives. In a more profound, Zen kind of way, that's the same message of The Razor's Edge. Murray's character learns from his experiences as a WWI ambulance driver, French coal miner, Buddhist acolyte and failed savior of Sophie that it just doesn't matter - worldly attachments are transient and the only thing that continues, immutable and indestructible is consciousness. This is heady stuff, but Murray's playful approach to the role signals that, especially post-Tibet, he's enlightened and above it all.

I hope that now, 10 years + on, many of the naysayers are now willing to rethink their initial panning of this work.I think Bill Murray tapped into the romantic curiosity that is crucial to the human spirit as it attempts to override the pragmatic, more disciplined, right brains grip that grounds us. This unbalanced conflict causes our character to go to lengths to find out what adventure, life, and love exactly has to do with ultimate fulfillment (if, in fact, that is at all possible).Of course in the journey itself there is danger one may miss the most important thing, that defining love, that which is real above all else...a true connection that isn't fleeting as pursuits, contests, or monetary gain.In a very melancholy way The Razor's Edge is hauntingly, beautifully, as well as brutally saying Love is Life, Life is Short Don't waste the time you have seeking something only found when you stop looking and start loving. I think Murray conveys the sadly beautiful broken, but enlightened, man who realizes this at the highest cost. So for me this movie is a solid story that hold ups under repeated viewings.

That this movie uses that title demeans the excellent novel so well crafted by the novelist W. Somerset Maugham. Part of what makes the book wonderful is the frame narration by an outside source--so that Larry is always just a construction by another, a person we never really know, who remains as mysterious as his quest and his sense of enlightenment. With Murray's movie, we don't even have the character who is supposed to tell the story--it is like trying to film The Great Gatsby, except without Nick Carraway.The movie transmogrifies the wonderful qualities that Maugham invests in Larry--an indescribable smile that shows the warmth and generosity of his heart; a spirit that never rises to anger, that gives in a Christ-like manor which suggests the purest version of altruism known, untainted by self-interest; an elusive sort that we never can encapsulate--and changes them into Murray's own strong suits witty retorts directed at dull people, low emotion alcoholism coupled with outbursts, clowning for the camera. Murray's Larry is not the pure soul who captivated a famous writer--he is the man from Ghostbusters, trying every now and then to be serious. Many of these qualities are anathema to the character he is to be portraying&#151;and I was hoping to see some completely different side of Bill.The plot changes are ridiculous Larry drives an ambulance instead of flying a plane; he goes with Gray rather than by himself; Sophie and her husband are married at the beginning rather than later; Larry and Isabel sleep with each other; Sophie's a prostitute instead of a whore&#151; and she falls truly in love with Larry rather than dutifully, as she does in the novel&#151;the only way that her leaving him makes sense. Isabel's indiscrete shouting in a dignified restaurant wrecks the grace of her character; the confrontation between Sophie and Isabel is maddeningly trite and destructive to any subtlety that the movie might wish to preserve. Gray, rather than being the commonplace everyman, is instead some spidery sort supposedly war-mates with Larry&#151;a foolish depth to a relationship better left at its tenuous state, as the book does. In order for Larry's character to make sense, he needs to be left alone during the war, rather than have some mate from Chicago there to observe his transition.The end result is a palate of flat, rather dull characters who belong to a soap opera rather than the host created by Maugham, individuals who make poor decisions at times, but who, nonetheless, we can never wholly condemn. In the book, our ethereal vision of Larry is tempered by the compassionate portraits of Suzanne and Elliot and Gray and Isabel and Sophie. In the movie, we must subsist wholly on an unbelievable Murray playacting for the camera but never even approximating the earnestness and rigor of Maugham's Larry.

The problem was that at the time, no one wanted to see a serious Bill Murray (Something similar happened for Steve Martin's PENNIES FROM HEAVEN).

This film would presage the dramatic roles that Murray would take a dozen or so years after its release. It is true that we see traces of the circa 1984 Murray hamming it up (and the film could do without those). But we also see an actor who had carefully studied his role and is totally believable as Larry, the man who goes on a journey of self-discovery after witnessing terrible things in war.I remember the radio ads, featuring Murray, that were aired at the time of this film's release. Murray advised us If you want comedy, go see Ghostbusters! As a sidenote, this may be the only film which featured brothers Bill Murray and Brian-doyle Murray.

The VAST MAJORITY of actors, directors, and writers in Hollywood today can't begin to compete with this calibre of talent, and they had NO BUSINESS remaking this film. As for Bill Murray, I don't consider him to be a talented actor for either comedy roles or dramatic ones. His understated, deadpan acting style is simply evidence that he's incapable of projecting any meaningful emotions on the screen, and I am NOT TAKEN IN BY HIM as some reviewers on this site seem to be. In short, I thought the Bill Murray version of Razor's Edge was EXTREMELY ho-hum, and I gave it a one-star rating because this movie is a very big insult to those of us who appreciate fine romantic drama, and I mean romantic not just in the interpersonal falling in love sense, I mean it with a big, capital R.

There's an interesting back story to it too, with Murray writing the script and refusing to be paid for his actual acting in the film. He then stopped acting for a few years, instead 'life imitating art' by going over to study philosophy in Paris for a year.To be honest, it just helps to secure Murray's place as one of the most interesting/talented actors of his generation.

Even Robert Graves who was pronounced dead on the battlefield and notification sent to his family -- resigned from life, a wife and children, in Goodbye to All That. It's resignation that the producer is misunderstanding? What an American brings to Nepal is the power of individual conscience and subjecting the consciousness to the cultural eternal. The character undergoes change in his inner understanding and outward conscious expression of that change. Bill Murray's only understatement is not surrendering to the temptation to make this character romantic instead of American. An initiate of war is initiated again in life. As a disabled Vietnam combat Vet who has seen and experienced what Murray's character experienced in the novel and movie, I commend Bill for having the discipline and courage to remain in character a fearless American, an initiate of the last and best age.

For anyone who thought the mediocre Lost in Translation was a revelation, they clearly have never seen Murray in The Razor's Edge. The past 22 years, I've been telling friends to watch this movie. Each time I see it, I marvel at Bill Murray's ability to balance his comic screen persona with the dramatic demands of such a heartbreaking story. I can't think of another actor who could ever pull this off, with the possible exception of Dustin Hoffman (remember Murray's cameo in Tootsie?).For all the sadness in this story, there are some laugh out loud moments, too. Murray gives fans the usual unctuous wit, but laced with a world-weary sense of loss, and a profound strength of spirit. The direction rivals anything by David Lean, but the classic formalism of the film-making might be jarring for Bill Murray fans expecting Meatballs or Stripes. Just go with it. You won't regret this discovery.The movie is not flawless. Sometimes, Murray goes for a laugh when he should refrain. Other times, he underplays shamelessly.

Well, he's like that the whole movie, which just doesn't seem to fit W.S.

Compare this to 7 years in Tibet which is another discussion of West learning from the East, but lacks the soap opera features of Razor's Edge.This film lacks the trendy upbeatness of current film, so its not fun.  There is very little action.  Visually, yes some mountains are nice and its good to see Paris even in a movie, but mostly this is a person watching film.  Therefore, it would be nice to see some sort of positive growth in the characters.  Larry's odyssey seems to have done something to/for him, but its hard to put our finger on.  He doesn't have any answers at the end either. In the 15-20 years the film spans (WWI, 1916 - Depression, 1930s), the rest of the characters achieve what?  Well, Sophie didn't learn enough transcendence through tragedy.  Isabel learned how to use people to get by, but she already seemed to have mastered that at the opening frame.  Bob learned that the other guy doesn't get lines in a Bill Murray movie.

It's not that it's a bad film, it isn't, it just isn't that good. The performances by Bill Murray and Theresa Russell are semi-inspired but the insipid treatment of Eastern mysticism is juvenile and just plain silly. However, it's not as moronic and childish as say Seven Years in Tibet which was a laughable B-movie in comparison. Nonetheless, the delivery of the film's title ('the Razor's Edge) by the monk is only missing him winking slowly at the camera (and saying wink, wink nudge, nudge, know what I mean, hey?) to let brain-damaged audience know that this scene is important. Overall, this is not a complete disaster. It is a worthwhile attempt at creating a movie for adults rather than some crappy schlock with car chases and shootouts geared for teenagers and mentally handicapped adults.

He had a good transition into films in films like STRIPES. But in 1984 he felt he had to show his growth as a performer. He left comedies and moved into straight drama. For some reason he chose to remake Somerset Maugham's novel-into-movie THE RAZOR'S EDGE. The results were not bad, but they were not as good as later dramatic films that Murray made in the 1990s and 2000s. The best thing I found about this version of THE RAZOR'S EDGE (which I saw in a movie house in Flushing in 1984) was the opening. Somehow in the 1946 film version, the horrors of the western front were not as well developed in the final movie (a distinct weakness, by the way). Larry Darell (Murray in this version and Tyrone Power in the 1946 version) is, like Ernest Hemingway, an ambulance driver. In Murray's film he is taken under the wing of a cynical ambulance driver who explains how to view things when the pressure of enemy bombing or shelling gets to you. After all, you have to drive to the front lines, pick up the wounded and dying, and bring them back to the hospitals behind the lines. You can get killed in a barrage. The cynical driver, when he witnesses the death of some other ambulance trainees, starts giving a speech of how much he disliked them, and how he won't miss them. His eyes and face show he is lying, and is saying this for his mental health. Subsequently the cynical driver and his assistant are killed. Murray, who has grasped this lesson, repeats the same speech regarding the cynical driver that the latter had given earlier.This was a key scene in the story - it explains how Larry is shattered by the horrors of the war. And it sets the stage (better, actually) for his search for answers in the Far East than Tyrone Power had demonstrated in the earlier version.That was the best difference between the two films. Otherwise, the Murray film lacked the cast strengths of the Power film. Besides Power, Clifton Webb, Gene Tierney, Anne Baxter (Oscar winner here), John Payne, Herbert Marshall and Elsa Lanchester added cast strength there. But here the best performer was Murray, and only Denholm Elliott as Elliott Templeton really was good, and he was pale compared to the great Webb in the same role (although he was able to give an unbowdlerized version of Elliott's final line of dialog). This is a fair film version, but the original is better.

His plans change to marry his childhood sweetheart Isabel Bradley played by Catharine Hicks, and he goes off to spend some time in France working and ruffling about, forgoing a promised job as a stock broker. When the two meet again, Larry informs his fiancÃ© that he is not ready for marriage just yet, he says he needs some more time to understand it all and his place in the world. His materialistic girlfriend can't wait, and decides to marry his friend instead and live a normal life. Larry doesn't flinch, but keeps going this time to India where he serves as a cook in a temple. He looks at the mountains, contemplates existence and heads back to France.It is perhaps time to say that by this point the director has already showed his strengths as well as many notable weaknesses. His strengths being the choosing the material and casting Bill Murray. Teresa Russell was great as Sophie and would have been even better in the leading female role. As often is the case in this film, the script is too on the nose in order to illustrate a point, and the dialog is too. John Byrum moves too fast to cover all the material, and the film quickly looses its temporal integrity and turns into a guided tour of pretty places and plot points somehow circumventing real drama. Another great weakness is the performance of Catharine Hicks. This movie might have been close to a classic, yet still, if it weren't for it's often abrupt characterizations, and for word MELODRAMA written across Catharine Hick's forehead. Exactly half of the lines that she says ring false in this film. It would have been nice if the director had noticed and reeled her acting in.Robert McKee seems to think that the problem of melodrama is that it stems from lack of motivation. To elaborate for myself, I would perhaps add after watching The Razor's edge that if one were to draw out characters more fully, that would be an effective path to avoiding it. What is melodrama, after all, if not the attainment of tears that have not been earned? The definition of melodrama, or when we say something is melodramatic, is that the dialog, events, characterizations, etc., rely too much on sentiment or emotion, without the sufficient amount of reason for it thrown into the formula. That reason could be anything from events taking shape, the events preceding those events, or a character's performance. It goes to say then, that if there is enough reason or motivation in the characters, dialog, events, etc., then the problem of melodrama can be avoided and true feeling reached.Back in France, Larry continues to work in labor related occupations clearly more content with himself than any of his friends. There is a subplot playing out which is more a necessary event for the plot to take shape than a subplot in that Teresa Russell's character, Sophie MacDonald, losses a husband and a child and turns to drugs, liquor and prostitution. Isabel still loves Larry, and when he brings Sophie back from the precipice of self-destruction, can't leave well enough alone. Her shallowness and jealousy destroy this woman in one or two scenes, and like everything else in this film that Hicks does, nearly destroys it with her performance. Luckily, it is time for Bill Murray to save the day.There is an extraordinary sequence when Larry meets Sophie in Paris. After what seems like eons of space time the film finally hits a triumphant note. Bringing back Sophie from self-destruction in two or three scenes Murray is amazing. He pulls the film back from the precipice and finally gives the story meaning. The last scene is truly spectacular in which his character says almost nothing, and rounds out the film like a great bird that finally comes to a resting place. It is his journey, and luckily the material that has seen to the film's final success.Again, I am reminded that it is almost irrelevant how mishandled a film can be through on to its final stages and still turn out a success if the third act climax works, if the material is set up to work in closing minutes. When I first saw this happen right before my eyes in Pieces of April, I was very much surprised by this as well. The film ran its course through every clichÃ© imaginable, sub-par acting, and script-direction, only to deliver in the closing minutes an emotional satisfying experience; something that a huge majority of other films, with better acting and direction are unable to do.Hemingwayesque in its scope and feeling, this is wonderful movie. To this screenwriter it is further confirmation that story is king.

I have never before seen a supposedly serious movie with ALL false moments--not a single scene anywhere in this film rang true-to-life. Horribly acted by all (except perhaps James Keach who appeared to take his responsibility seriously) and just-plain-bad from beginning to end, I'm truly sorry I wasted 128 minutes on this. If not for the costumes, locations, and cinematography (and the fact that IMDb wouldn't let me anyway) I'd have give this zero stars. I think I will now look in IMDb to see what other films John Byrum has made--can we hold him responsible for this mess?

It must be difficult to be so excellent.I'm a fan, apparently. I think if you don't like Bill Murray, there's got to be something wrong with you.I saw this film at a time when I had no expectations of anything (my twenties) and was impressed by all the elements of the film the acting, humor, message, cinematography, casting, etc., even though I knew nothing about anything. I loved that Larry made a promise to Isabel then had to regretfully go back on it rather than try to be faithful to a stupid promise. It's a mark of maturity to believe it's a man's prerogative to change his mind, I believe. Of course, he delayed commitment in the first place, a smart move.I loved when Larry said to Isabel at the end, so perfectly, you just don't get it when he really wanted to kill her, I would imagine.It was excellent when he responds to Denholm Elliot's, an itinerant... with fishmonger? and then he goes on to make his final moments happy ones. Denholm was excellent as the 2nd class snob with a heart.I love at the end of the film when Bill is vaulting up the steps at Montmartre. He makes vaulting look easy.This is a spiritual film that succeeds by not taking itself too seriously. RAZOR's EDGE has been described as BM's dramatic turning point but, even then, he was smart enough not to forget the comedy and to not get overly dramatic, i.e., when he was mourning the death of his real-life brother. Brian was also excellent as the cynical superior officer. Both Murrays are excellent at manifesting darkness when it's required. Apparently.I loved the scene where Isabel tempts Sophie with the fantastic wine, she was so cold and pitiless. Catherine Hicks was excellent as the cutie with a darkside agenda and Theresa Russell was never better than as the betrayed by life sexpot.This, to me, isn't just a good movie, it should be mandatory viewing in high school. It teaches with charm and brings great literature to life.

For myself, for its audience, especially for anyone associated with its production. Bill Murray is Bill Murray. He stands there & does his deadpan thing. No Larry Darrell he. What this movie is is a pastiche. What it makes me realize is what a fraud all movies about western individuals seeking spiritual wisdom from alien cultures are. Hey, let's face it.

Whatever! I am a huge Bill Murray fan, and I got up at 305 a.m. to watch this movie on TV the other day. I was expecting a lot from this movie, but what I got was 2 hours of painful viewing which made me want to go back to sleep.Just from the opening 15 minutes I found myself dreading the next 105. It was a challenge to stay awake, because The Razor's Edge is so damn BORING!!! Forget all this rubbish about beautiful scenes and insightful techniques, thats trash. The movie is about as easy to understand as the pilot controls of a very large Boeing 767 aircraft. In other words, its not even worth your effort trying to understand it, unless you have read the book. It's monotonous, slow and dull and the only time I smiled was right at the end when Larry walked up those steps...which meant the movie was over! Thank god for that, it is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and it saddens me to say this because I love Bill Murray. The average movie fan does not want 2 hours of insights into the meaning of life and stupid old fashioned...wait. Sorry but I'm not even going to waste my time talking about this. Take my advice, unless you ENJOY monotonous, slow, dull, boring movies...then watch it. If not, don't even touch The Razor's Edge with a 40 foot cattle prod!!!

I have not read W. Somerset Maugham's novel, nor have seen the first one that preceded the film.Frankly, 'The Razor's Edge' is a terrible, horrendous, awful 'arthouse drama' movie, if not the worst movie ever to attempt at 'being serious' of a drama expected from well-made drama movies in terms of wasted resources and labor that went to the production of the movie realistically set in the early 20th century (about the only redeeming quality of the film I could say). I have no problem accepting Bill Murray taking a serious and risky role (I have yet to see Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' at the time I submit this comment), but this was a bad career move for Bill. Same could be said for Jim Carrey who took the risk and did quite well in 'The Truman Show' but 'The Majestic' an altogether different story. Bill tried his best at usual deadpan humor expected of him as a comedic actor and he comes off too stoic, somber, subpar, pompous and desperate.I wonder what the heck were adaptation writer/director John Byrum and co-writer/actor Bill Murray smoking when they attempted to make The Razor's Edge. Is their adapted version of the novel about enlightenment? Pursuing the simplicity of life? Poking fun of the rich? Preaching compassion and kindness? Sarcastic insight on hypocrisy, vanity and drudgery? From trying to stay awake viewing the film in one-sitting, it's apparent they did not have focus on these points and instead drag the whole film with lame, tedious and awful dialogues in scene after scene concerning the supporting characters' problems in contrived and cartoonish depiction and how Bill Murray's protagonist is a saint compared to Forrest Gump and Patch Adams. Hal Ashby's 1979 film 'Being There' accomplished the points I laid out above. Peter Sellers' swan song portrayal of Chance the Gardener was the saint compared to the impostering likes of Bill Murray's Larry Darrell and Tom Hanks's Forrest Gump.Apparently, Bill, John and the film producers were trying too hard to make the best Oscar bait movie to come along in the history of the 80's cinema, with them envisioning sweeping movie award ceremonies with the 'masterpiece' they produced. 'The Razor's Edge' failed at the box office not because of the audience's dashed expectation of Bill Murray's risky acting attempt at drama and utter apathy, but simply because the film is deadlier slow-paced, slothful, pointless, frustrating, wholly incoherent, disjointed and dreadful wallowing in Oscar-winning-conscious self-importance pretending to be a top-notch quality serious drama movie. In summary, 'The Razor's Edge' is an ideal cure for insomnia.  1/2 out of **** stars "},{"Title":"Much less than the sum of its parts (spoilers)","Date":"26 July 2002","Score":"4 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  Sorry. I really tried to like this. Overall, it's not a total waste of time, but is too flawed, messy and actually self-indulgent to be in any way an 'unrecognised classic'. While Theresa Russell's performance is superb (Sophie and Coco were the only convincing characters in this film), Bill Murray just looked as if he had a really stiff neck throughout - and kept the same shifty expression for twenty years. It was disjointed; significant events seemed to have no more action devoted to them than really trivial ones, and it was hard to work out whether events were important to the plot or not. Things like the death of Sophie's family (though not her reaction) seemed to be skipped over even though the story really hinged on them. The WWI scenes didn't come across as particularly traumatic, either. A few parts worked well; the books in Tibet scene, the hypnosis scene, the Paris lowlife, the leaving-Sophie-the-bottle scene; which is why it's such a shame the film as a whole falls flat.  It tries to be Heat and Dust meets The End of the Affair and ends up being Mr. Natural meets The Great Gatsby. The gags just jarred, and also, any film that has Saeed Jaffrey as the main Indian character is doomed from the start. He's like Barry Fitzgerald's Irishman. It worked the first time he did it, and nobody told him that was enough.Denholm Elliot's death scene, supposedly mystical, touching and climactic, was the low point. It was like an outtake from Days Of Our Lives. You wonder what the director was thinking -'when's lunch?' probably. But I keep coming back to Bill Murray's performance - more braindead than deadpan, there was absolutely NO spark between him and Isabel his supposed lifetime sweetheart, and why didn't anybody TELL him about the coathanger left in his jacket?

The supporting actors were childish and stilted, the dialog was lame at best and incredibly lame at worst....nothing redeemed this film. There was no direction, no theme, no purpose to this film.Ultimately, my final analysis is, Well, there's two hours of my life I'll never get back.  This movie bites the big green weenie.
