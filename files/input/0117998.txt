I *like* the fact that the money is all up there on the screen - lots of tornadoes ripping apart farmhouses and throwing trucks around. I *like* that it's one long chase movie. I *like* looking at Helen Hunt's beautiful face. I saw Twister twice at the cinema, and at least three times since - and I've enjoyed it every single time. Can you get a better recommendation than that?Twister will never satisfy some people... in particular, those who watch it, for some strange reason, expecting a cerebral masterpiece.

Personally, I don't know how people can bash this movie. I thought it was an amazing film!! The acting is great, the special effects are excellent, the action is intense, and this film actually has a great storyline to it. To me, a 5.9/10 rating for this film is atrocious. I think this film deserves so much better!! I was thinking of somewhere in between a 7 and an 8/10. But I have my opinion and other people have their own right?? I just find it hard to believe that people don't like this movie.Twister has everything I like in an action movie. It has amazing special effects, heart-stopping action, and a reasonably well written storyline. It even has some heartbreaking parts which almost brought tears to my eyes and I don't usually cry during movies. However I almost cried during Twister. Jan De Bont has created a very enjoyable that maybe doesn't come up to masterpiece material, but still is a memorable action movie that won't be forgotten for a long long time.

I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it, in fact right after the movie was done, I wanted to become a storm chaser. That's how much I loved this movie; I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career. But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I'm sure it would be just as much fun to see it again. I have to say this wasn't as awesome as I remembered, in the theater it was like Oh, my God! Look at that flying cow! A house just flew across the road! That is so cool!, now on my TV screen I was like Oh, wow, look at that cow. How the heck does a house fly across the road? Why isn't this as cool as I remembered it? Not to mention that the story wasn't as good as I remembered, granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters, but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic.In June 1969 on an Oklahoma farm a tornado warning is issued, the family seeks shelter in a storm cellar as an F5 tornado strikes. However, the storm is so strong that the locks on the cellar door fail and the father is caught up in the storm and killed as his daughter struggles to catch a glimpse of the powerful storm. Years later, Dr. Jo Harding, the father's daughter, is reunited with her estranged husband; Bill Harding. Bill is a former weather researcher and storm chaser who has taken a job as a weather reporter. He is planning to marry his new girlfriend, Dr. Melissa Reeves, and arrives at Jo's research lab seeking Jo's signature for the final divorce papers. Bill discovers that Jo has built a tornado research device called DOROTHY based upon his own design; the device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure. The team later meets up with Dr. Jonas Miller, a smug and unscrupulous fellow meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has invented a device almost identical to DOROTHY; he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her eccentric team of storm chasers. Tensions rise between Jo and Bill when they have several close calls with dangerous tornadoes as they try unsuccessfully to deploy the new device. So how does Twister hold up over these years? Not so well, the effects are still amazing, but that's about it. I do have to admit, even though it's a bad movie, I still enjoy it like crazy. I think because if you let go of how unrealistic it is, you can just have fun with that want of destruction and chaos. Granted I know this movie is a bit stupid our two leads, Bill and Jo, survive the impossible facing an F5 twister, the twisters always disappear as our hero's are in danger, Bill's fianc√© puts up with quit a bit before realizing that he is a jerk for putting her through all the danger with him, Jo, a scientist, thinks that tornado's are serial killers, and not to mention that this was a record breaking day with numerous twisters. But still as bad as the acting, as bad as the story, as stupid as some of these situations may be, it's still a fun movie to watch and I think I wanna be fair with the rating just because it is mindless entertainment. It's a classic 90's disaster movie and besides, it has flying cows, what other film will give you that kind of situation? But it's all good I think they were taking the cows to McDonald's anyways.7/10 "},{"Title":"WHAT THE HELL IS EVERYONE'S PROBLEM WITH THIS FILM","Date":"13 January 2003","Score":"40 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Ever since this films release in 1996, its very title has become synonymous with Bad films.

He has a talent for making films that are extremely kinetic and seem to actually MOVE and Twister is no different.The story is simple, we follow a group of storm chasers around tornado alley for 48hrs during the most active otbreak of tornao activity on record (not unlike what actually occured this past month in Oklahoma) all the while watching an estranged couple played by Hunt and Paxton fall in love again amongst the windswept action.The tornados are awe inspiring works of digital wonder created by ILM and really come across as powerful.

The movie is about tornados!!! It's not supposed to be a deep and thought-provoking film, it's just meant to be entertaining, and it most certainly does that!!!  I thought the story was excellent and really kept you interested in what was going to happen next, the movie flows very nicely from scene to scene, from start to finish.

I loved them all!!!The actors all did a fantastic job and there were a lot of them that are worth mentioning.  Bill Paxton does an awesome job as always.  Helen Hunt if fabulous, and looks just as beautiful as ever.  Jami Gertz also did a fine job and looked fantastic.  Philip Seymour Hoffman did a really good job, this seems like such a different role for him and he nailed it!  Cary Elwes is one of those few actors that can convincingly play a bad guy and a good guy and is also just as good in comedy films.  He's a very talented actor and did a great job in this film.  I won't mention all names, but all of the storm chasers did a great job with their roles.  As for director, Jan de Bont Another great film to add to his resume!  I can't wait to see his next film!  And, I have to mention writers Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin as well, they both did a great job with the story!If you're looking for a fast-paced, energetic, interesting, fun movie with some killer special effects, then this is the movie for you!  I would definitely recommend this film to just about anyone.  There is rarely anything objectional in the film and I would imagine that this would appeal to a great deal of people.

Where I live an inch of rain is headline news. I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up, don't expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister. You shouldn't be too disappointed.

However, if you watch this movie on a regular TV screen, you definitely don't get the full effect.  Sure the plot is about as predictable as a Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoon.  And sure Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt weren't A-list stars when this movie came out.   However, the special effects and uniqueness really make this film worthwhile.  You have to remember that when this movie came out in the summer of 1996,  it was a considered a big event movie.  Back then, a big budget/big event movie was considered a huge risk(i.e. Waterworld) and only came out about every 6 months.  Nowadays, it seems like every movie is or tries to be a big budget/big event movie.  Back then, the special effects in Twister were considered amazing and it was the first disaster movie to come out in a long time.  Nowadays, most movies have some kind of special effects in them and there are tons of disaster flicks made since Twister.  So, Twister was a ground breaking film and it really helped pave the way for all these high budget/special F/X films out right now.

This is extremely unlikely. There's just not enough heat/lapse-rate (and consequent thermal instability) without sunshine. ¬∑ The fluid dynamics of a guy getting sucked out of a storm cellar just don't work. It would require too much pressure differential in an enclosed space. Stick a small piece of paper in a pop bottle, then try to get the paper out of the pop bottle by blowing. Blow across the opening, into the opening, try anything. Trust me, it just won't work.First tornado encountered¬∑ Mammatus clouds, which they admire outside the gas station, generally indicate that a storm is waning, not at peak intensity as suggested here. ¬∑ The tornado shown does not emerge from a wall cloud, and thus is probably a land-spout. Therefore it's unlikely to be F2 intensity as implied. ¬∑ Storm chasers do not drive like idiots. They're very responsible and safety conscious. Even when deploying damage-path instruments like TOTO they do not deliberately get closer than ¬Ω mile or so. ¬∑ An F2 tornado cannot pick up a truck, just push it around some. ¬∑ If it ropes out as shown, it's very unlikely (but not impossible, admittedly) that it could reconstitute, as it apparently did. ¬∑ The tornado debris cloud varied way too much in size. In the final seconds it looked to be only a few meters in diameter. Not realistic. ¬∑ Hiding under a bridge is a really stupid idea. Storm chasers would only do something like that if no other option was available. Second tornado¬∑ The second tornado appears to be coming out of a wall cloud (good for them!), but there's no such storm-chaser terminology as 'sidewinder'. ¬∑ There's no way they could assess the Fujita ('F') number just by looking at the tornado. Dumb! No storm chaser would ever say something like that. ¬∑ The tornado does not move realistically. Spawning of the second funnel is unrealistic. There's no way a second tornado could 'split' from the first as shown. The fluid dynamics of rotation would prevent it.¬∑ Hunt says they're 'in the flanking line.' They could not be anywhere near the flanking line if they're 'under the core' (mesocyclone, I suppose that means). ¬∑ The whole 'cow' scene, while amusing, is completely unrealistic. ¬∑ They survive a direct hit from an 'F3' tornado and nothing happens? Don't make me laugh.Dinner at Auntie's¬∑ I don't even know where to start with the absurd banter in this scene. The whole 'Jack Daniels' anecdote is absolutely impossible. Not even close to possible.Third tornado¬∑ You can't guarantee touchdown just from Doppler radar. You can determine the existence of a vortex, but there's no way to say whether it's on the ground or in the air. ¬∑ There's a good picture of wall cloud here! One good moment. ¬∑ Where the hell is the debris in this scene coming from? They're too far from the tornado and not anywhere near the RFD. ¬∑ The tornado moves too fast. Not realistic. ¬∑ When it hits the power lines, what the hell explodes in a ball of fire??? ¬∑ Cloud motion is not particularly realistic when the tornado lifts.Fourth tornado¬∑ Once again we have an unlikely level of intensity after dark. ¬∑ What are these people, living mobile home parks? Every damn tornado in the state heads straight for them! ¬∑ There is a bad misconception that the visible part of the tornado, i.e. the condensation funnel, is where the wind is. The actual area of strong rotation may be many times larger and strong inflow can extend even farther than that. The visible funnel is only where the air pressure is low enough that the air is at or below dew point. In dry air, tornadoes may not necessarily have a visible funnel at all, at least until it is filled with debris and dust. ¬∑ 'Downdrafts and microbursts'??? What the hell is he talking about? They took a f***ing direct hit from a funnel. There were no 'downdrafts and microbursts'&#133;The propeller idea¬∑ I'm not sure about this. It might actually be a good one. Mind you, I can't picture a scientist designing objects intended to be carried aloft by the wind that are spherical, which is the most aerodynamically efficient symmetrical shape. The logical design would be something with a high drag coefficient, not a low one (which a sphere would be), so that they would be carried more easily by the updraft. It wouldn't be necessary to make little propellers, though. Just anything that would increase drag.Fifth tornado¬∑ Sure is good of that tornado to hang around for hours until the storm chasers are ready! The longest-lived tornado on record lasted less than 75 minutes. Oh, and they casually drive by the thing on the way to their deployment point. They go from bright sunlight to within a mile of a huge wedge tornado, then back into sunlight, apparently far enough away from the tornado to prepare their instruments, then easily drive to within a few hundred feet of the thing. Yeah right.¬∑ By the way, just because the sensors spill out onto the road, how come they're no good any more? Why do they have to be inside that barrel thing? They'd still get sucked up into the funnel even if they're scattered on the road&#133; ¬∑ How can they drive through the flaming wreckage of a tanker truck and not hit anything? ¬∑ Quibble Explosion of Jonas's truck looked really fake. ¬∑ Continuity error Part of combine harvester hits their truck on the passenger-side windshield. In the very next shot the windshield is intact. ¬∑ There is no way the truck could drive through even a flimsy frame house and come out the other side undamaged. ¬∑ Too many problems here to list. In almost all scenes, they're way too close to the tornado. They would be right in the inflow, and getting their asses kicked by it. ¬∑ Getting caught in an F5 tornado unprotected Probability of survival very low. Probability of surviving uninjured just about zero. Wind speeds inside an F5 tornado are between 250 and 317 m.p.h. Getting hit by even a small piece of debris would be like getting shot with a gun. Even in the core of the tornado they look like they're getting buffeted by winds perhaps 40-50 m.p.h. Yeah, right. If either of them got hit by even a small rock traveling at 250+ miles per hour, they'd be dead as fried chicken. ¬∑ Following the encounter, the tornado doesn't rope out, but dissipates in a matter of seconds. Pretty, unlikely. ¬∑ In the final scene, it is apparent that the tornado passed within a few meters of the farmhouse, yet the house is undamaged. Possible, but very pretty unlikely.

I liked a lot of the humor that was in this film. BUT!!!!! The story is not so good. The idea that two chasing teams would be so competitive almost to the point of ripping each other's throats out is BULLSH*T! Storm chasers all have the same goal...to learn more about tornadoes. Everything that storm chasers do is for the benefit of people who are threatened each year by tornadoes. The movie is heavily testosterone-injected by far. Storm chasers are never as blatantly reckless as the ones portrayed in Twister. When Bill answer's Jo's challenge, Have you lost your nerve?, by tightening her seatbelt and flooring it off the road and into a ditch next to the field where a tornado is in progress without knowledge of the predicament he's getting himself and Jo into is definitely the work of Hollywood. I am going to be a meteorology major in college this coming school year, and, while I don't plan on being a chaser, I know I definitely would NOT do what Bill did in that particular situation. Bill mixes his personal life with his professional life WAY too much. It distracts him too much and he has quite a few close calls. One of the first ones happens when he is arguing with Jo in her truck he runs the truck off the road and nearly wrecks into an Army vehicle (somebody tell me what that thing was). The idea of DOROTHY was derived from TOTO, only in Twister, the chasers actually put themselves right in the path of an oncoming tornado just to place an instrument pack like DOROTHY. That too is BULLSH*T. No storm chaser in their right mind would do that. To conclude, this movie, while I do like it somewhat, is eye candy lots of action, special effects, and PG-13 language.

It stars two b-grade actors, who prove again here they should not be handed the reigns of an expensive movie (Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt). But to be fair the script is lamer than any script has ever been in all of recorded time. What am I saying? Paxton and Hunt are terrible.She's a tornado researcher who just happens to have a very standard Hollywood backstory Dad, you see, was eaten by a tornado, and now she has a grudge, umm, scratch that; she has a weird Oedipal, erotic fixation with tornadoes that makes her trance out and walk towards them like a blond zombie. Uhm... sure. Conveniently this background and volition are explained, as I've never seen before, in a flashback. (< withering sarcasm) Moving along...The tornado team you're supposed to root for is a bunch of unlikeable nerds played by unlikeable people (none moreso than Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who are prone to phony, over-directed cheerful outbursts. Each new scene that featured them, made me wish for a genre switch from disaster movie to R-rated blood bath. I would have had my own outburst (of applause) if they had all been sliced open by heavy machinery in the middle of one of their asinine conversations.However the worst, dumbest, most excruciating part of this turd is that it presents a rival team of tornado researchers as the villain. (Y'know like high school basketball..?) Bill Paxton actually has to deliver the line (I'm paraphrasing) Jonas (head of Team Bad guy) has no instincts, he sought corporate funding and he's in it FOR THE MONEY! Sure, he's in meteorology for the money, not for the love of low pressure zones. I think at this point a few veins burst in my head.Jamie Gertz was apparently supposed to function as the woman who might draw Bill Paxton out of Helen Hunt's clutches, but the writers did the usual Let's make her a drag, so that when she has to go, the audience isn't upset. They actually make this device even more desperate, by having HER deliver the We're finished speech. Relievedly... she's OK with it. Gosh that resolved itself nicely. I'm glad I wasn't asked to feel any tension related to human emotions in this movie. Not since Sean Young excused herself out of the plot in Cousins has a scene designed to erase conflict so infuriatingly failed to erase conflict.Do you know what's at least as entertaining as watching tornadoes break things; watching a good script resolve things intelligently or a great script do it cleverly... & being trusted by writers who don't assume you're an idiot.Making the proceedings that much sadder is the fact that the special effects are actually less thrilling than the low-tech canvas sock they used for a tornado in 1939 for the Wizard of Oz (!).This movie immediately appeared in a scene-for-scene TV ripoff with Bruce Campbell, called imaginatively Tornado that somehow made the whole thing even stupider, with expensive tornado sequences happening off screen during the commercials. That z-grade solution at least made me laugh.This unredeemable slop should only be shown in the rural sector.

However, that's what it's SUPPOSED to be! If you go to see this movie, don't expect an Oscar-winning film. It's a very simple plot (No spoilers) A group of storm chasers are tracking a huge front spawning multiple tornadoes throughout Oklahoma, hoping to test a new weather sensory device that could possibly help with tornado warning systems. To complicate things, the former leader of the group (Bill Paxton) has come back to have his ex-wife and current supervisor of the team (Helen Hunt) sign the final divorce papers. However, he finds himself swept up (no pun intended) in joining the chase again. That's pretty much it; not outrageous nor all that thought provoking.The actors are all reputable (Paxton, Hunt, Elwes, Hoffman, Ruck, etc) and very good in their roles and they work well with the somewhat weak dialog, and the special effects are very good. Also, the physics are relatively accurate; I can't really think of any groan-inducing actions scenes. All in all, a great movie for parties, especially if you have a big screen and a good sound system.

Summer after summer came more explosions and associated disasters of some sort. Many of them were actually pretty good, in a rather brainless sort of way. But Jan de Bont's 1996 movie takes the cake. It's the ultimate in summer action adventure.Granted, the plot is nothing more than an excuse to create some impressive visuals and loud noises (but then again, wasn't de Bont's previous feature Speed like that, too?). But it really doesn't matter anyway. Actually, for a movie like this, the story and subplots are pretty well-developed.Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) is a tornado chaser who, with her team of ragtag scientists, is about to try and get their new science gizmo (appropriately named DOROTHY) up in a tornado to get scientific readings. Enter Bill (Bill Paxton) who has come to get the divorce papers from Jo, but he and his high-strung fianc√©e (Jami Gertz) decide to tag along to see DOROTHY fly.Twister would be just another round of eye candy (albeit very good eye candy, even by today's standards) if it hadn't been for a cast of extremely likable characters. It's a challenge to make bickering people likable, but Hunt and Paxton do it. They bicker, but it's often funny. Paxton is a normal guy who just wants to move on, but he has a good heart. Hunt is not your typical lady scientist, and her deadpan delivery brings some big laughs. Jami Gertz is fine as the high-strung fianc√©e who has no idea what she has gotten herself into, and Cary Elwes is perfectly slimy as the rival with money but no brains. Lois Smith has some very memorable and heartfelt scenes as Jo's aunt.Jan de Bont has a gift for developing a single sentence premise into a roller-coaster ride of a thriller. Just take a look at Speed, his first venture in the director's chair. Twister is just as intense, and if I may say so, a lot more fun. The effects are outstanding, and the cinematography is both beautiful and scary. de Bont also stretches his talent for one liners and physical gags, some of which are laugh out loud hilarious.I also have to mention Mark Mancina's score. It's delightfully upbeat with a sense of fun that perfectly compliments Twister. It's enough to get anyone excited for a nearly 2 hour ride. It's a shame that the Oscars didn't recognize his work.Not everything in Twister works. There are a few minor plot holes here and there, and many of the minor characters aren't developed (though they are put to good use in establishing rapport between the characters and the audience-the dialogue feels very real and again is often pretty funny). But these are minor quibbles, and I chose to give this film a 10 despite them because a, they don't dampen the film's entertainment value, and b, no one will notice (or care) unless they are looking at this movie from a critic's point of view.Twister may not be great art, but it sure is great fun!

One has to wonder why she always appears so high and mighty in this film, with all her stuff together, when her past is supposedly filled with demons she must overcome at all costs. Apparently, the only cure is for her to get so close to a twister she is in danger of being whisked off to Oz. It seems to me it would be far less risky to consult a shrink.Paxton plays the modern, sensitive and conflicted movie man. In this case, one who can't decide between his gentle, gorgeous fianc√© (Gertz) or his flint -faced, self-righteous, soon-to-be ex-wife. You'll never guess who he ends up with!Meanwhile, Hunt's supporting crew is made up of those lovable, formulaic oddballs that teach us how hip it is to be a science geek, and how un-hip everyone else is who just doesn't get what they do (like Gertz, who, in an effort to be portrayed as an out-of-it fifth wheel, is, in spite of the writers' intentions, actually the most sympathetic character in the whole movie!)Every movie needs the rival enemy, and evidently a plague of cyclones wasn't considered enough for this film. So enter Cary Elwes and his crew, which is rival to Hunt's and Paxton's. We know immediately they're the evil antagonists because they drive nicer vans and appear to be better funded with better meteorological equipment. Better, at any rate, than the recycled pop cans that Hunt et al are stuck with.And because we should despise Elwes' crew so much for these reasons, you also will never guess what becomes of them.Twister stretches credibility, but no more than we have become accustomed to in modern action films. I mean, if action heroes can outrun explosive fireballs, then outracing tornadoes, flying oil tankers, cows, and other assorted debris in a pickup truck is a piece of cake.I give the film a two only for mildly amusing special effects. The real downfall of the movie is in the script. The main characters are the kind you hope will get sucked up skyward never to be seen again in a sequel.

To be honest though, it's not as bad as you might think, if anything it's really very entertaining. While not a particularly thought provoking movie, if anything it's more another one of those silly action movies you turn your brain off to and watch the pretty images go by, it was still enough to keep me hooked, with there being no scenes in the film which are particularly cringeworthy.So what's the pasta? In Oklahoma, meteorologist and Tornado Chaser Bill heads out into the wilds with his fianc√©e to have divorce papers signed by his current estranged wife Jo. Although failing to get the divorce paper's signed, Bill sticks around because he and Jo's project, a Tornado reading machine called Dorothy, has been perfected and ready to be deployed into Tornado's so as to study their movements and properties, spurred on also by the fact that his rival, a man named Jonas, has also created his own version of Dorothy and intends to beat them to this multimillion Dollar breakthrough. What follows is Jo, Bill and their team of fellow Tornado Chasers embarking on an epic pursuit across the Oklahoma countryside to track down as many Twisters as they can and get their machine successfully deployed before all of them are destroyed or Jonas gets there first!Indeed the film isn't particularly thought inducing, it's a fairly basic A > B plot of trying to get these machines into Tornado's, whilst occasionally having to dodge death by the violent storms. The thing that makes this film so good though is the action, which is very intense, especially the Tornado that strikes at night, and the really very good CGI, which, for 1996, is very impressive. The Tornado's look and feel as big as they're depicted, which makes them all the more intimidating.The acting is fairly standard, although the bickering between Jo and Bill can be quite funny at times, with a few emotional scenes thrown into the mix. The soundtrack absolutely rocks my socks off every time, with a selection of fantastic artists including Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, Lisa Loeb and the mighty Goo Goo Dolls!Overall though, while I consider this a film I don't put much thought into, it's still an entertaining and very exciting flick, keeping me glued for every single minute!

Another major problem with the tornadoes is that they pull objects towards them like a vacuum cleaner not away like a blow dryer.

The filmmakers could've even gotten away with the same one-dimensional script and bad dialog if they'd just put a little more imagination and realism into the scenes everybody came to see--the tornadoes. Extreme weather--and it doesn't get any more extreme than a full-blown (excuse the lame pun) tornado--has got more than enough stranger-than-fiction quirks that the filmmakers could've incorporated some of those without straining credibility. What DOES strain the credibility here is the usual blockbuster cheats--e.g., a tornado that's powerful enough to lift an 18- wheeler off the highway and fling it back down again but nevertheless leaves the two main characters totally unscathed (not to mention that it doesn't ruffle the grass in the field they're running through).  When the only character to get more than a bruise is poor old Aunt Meg--who was at home minding her own business when a twister blew through, not trying to see how close she could get to a funnel cloud without getting sucked up into the skies--you know you're in Hollywoodland.Not only that, the storm scenes aren't all that frightening, for all the airborne wood, cars, and cows they kick up. (Only the nighttime shots of a twister disintegrating a drive-in movie screen are eerie.) TV news footage as recycled on the Weather Channel's Storm Stories is easily more scary.  That's because the news footage is REAL, and looks it. It doesn't look like the product of a carefully controlled movie set. A little more effort to make the storm scenes in this movie suggest that the crew might have been in actual danger filming them (maybe a little shaky camerawork, a little rain and mud spattered onto the lens, shots of flying debris that weren't always perfectly composed but looked a little more chaotic--y'know, like a real natural disaster) would've gone a long way.Substitute 100-foot waves for 300-mph winds, and all the comments here would also apply to The Perfect Storm, another extreme-weather blockbuster that, aside from the primal fascination of the subject matter, is really pretty awful.

While trying to beat his enemy Jonas (Cary Elwes) by perfecting a data-gathering instrument, designed to be released into the funnel of a tornado, Jo remembers the time of her father's tragic demise and she, Bill and his girlfriend Melissa go after the tornado as they attempt to insert the experiment into the heart of the monstrous weather.This is a pretty interesting film and an action-packed one at that. Granted, the story can be predictable at times with forced and pathetically bad dialogue, but it had an emotional feeling to it with scenes where Jo explains her father's death which makes the story as much sense as it is. The conversations along with some very clever comedic moments were very interesting and funny at the same time. The cast is great. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt make a beautifully great screen couple, Jami Gertz did very decent as Melissa, Cary Elwes did alright as Bill's arch-nemesis Jonas, Phillip Seymore Hoffman did well as Dusty and the rest did pretty well.

With a production budget of $92 million, Twister went on to make a staggering worldwide gross of nearly $500 million, not bad for a picture that the un-popcorn crowd like to call the worst written film of the 90s.The truth is, and trust me I would never try to sell a revisit to this movie to anyone who has seen and hated it, is that it is badly written. The plodding story lacks zip and the character interaction is painfully poor, but as action films go, Twister is one of the 90s most entertaining films. By the numbers block buster be damned I say, I want thrills with my popcorn and thrills are what I get...big time. The storm chasing characters looking like a group plucked out of a Nirvana concert are merely linking us into the next thrill sequence, just like doors on a haunted house train ride at the local fun-fair.

The meat of this film is it's CGI created Tornadoes, which for the most part served their purpose in the context of a film of this nature.However even a layman couldn't ignore the ridiculous moments regarding the behavior of the Tornadoes in this film. For example at one point the first tornado the storm chasers encounter gets close enough to them to suck their truck up in the air and the boards above the flimsy shelter they're hiding under, but leaves them miraculously unharmed. Several times tornadoes in the film dissipate at all too convenient moments including the last one, a monster of a tornado that they actually get stuck inside, but survive somehow strapped to drainage pipes despite the tornado being strong enough to pick up an 18 wheeler, roll a house and make huge tractors fly.Yet for some reason this film is highly watchable.

I managed to convince all of them to go see this (I was greatly looking forward to this after loving director Jan de Bont's first film Speed) instead of the film they wanted to see - The Truth About Cats and Dogs.After the movie, I wanted to crawl in a hole.

This effects are phenominal and maybe even worth watching on the big screen.  I rented the film when it first came out on video to see if it was as bad as I remember and decided yes, and it's even worse on TV where the effects are reduced from giant computer generated storms 50 feet across to nothing more dangerous than a sneeze on a 25 screen.I love disaster movies, I have been a Jan de Bont fan since he was DPing the films of John McTeirnan and Paul Verhoeven and I have read everythiing Michael Crichton ever wrote, so this is a film that should have appealed to me.

The Worst Nothing.In 1994 a man named Jan De Bont (cinematographer of Basic Instinct and Die Hard) was given the shot of direct one of the greatest action films ever done, Speed, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, it turned out that it was a success and it turned both Keanu and Sandra big budget stars. Steven Spielberg had the script of an action film about Tornados in America and realized that this should be a job for someone who can put the audience in the edge of the seat; Jan De Bont was the obvious choice, and this obvious choice, proved once more to be one of the best action directors around. A luxurious trio of actors were called, some expensive special effects companies and sound design technicians and the track was set for another success, which was bigger than the producers already expected, being one of the 20 biggest successes of all time! The story is simple, but compelling a couple on the verge of divorce must reunite to put their new machine to study tornados in action. Twister is one of those movies that you see not by its story and its depth, but for its compelling imagery, water tornados, sandstorms, cows hurling in the air, everything is seen during the heroes chase for the ruthless Twister.     For such a big budget production, the producers wouldn't dare to hire some random actors, they had to be carefully chosen, Bill Paxton (Titanic; U-571), Helen Hunt (TV Series Mad About You, As Good As it Gets) and Cary Elwes (Robin Hood Men In Tights). Since I first saw Speed, one of my all time favorites, I couldn't wait to see Twister.    Jan De Bont's wisdom and expertise are back, and what is back also are the great action sequences, Visual Effects, Sound and Music. Mark Mancina, the composer (also for Speed) wrote once again a score that unfortunately didn't get the praise it should have, it's great, one of the best of all times, check it &#150; (examples the music while they are Leaving Aunt Meg's house and passing through Wakita, the music before they face the F5 twister and so on..) Special Effects are surprise, surprise, top notch, one of the best we've ever seen. Even today, 6 years after the movie was released, they still dazzle us.  Anyway, adding anything more was saying too much of the same thing, which means I would praise this movie in every department, and why? Because it deserves it... and how can I prove my devotion for the movie? Through IMDB, that's why this site exists, and that's why I give this movie a perfect 10 out 10!

The mystery here is why on earth did Hunt ever fall for Paxton, why does she still love him, why won't she just sign the papers, why doesn't she throw him (and his counselor) into a tornado?This film would have been much better if it had just followed the typical horror movie formula and had the tornado suck up one crew member at a time while Hunt watched helplessly. For those of you who need an emotional payoff, she could have flashbacks to her father's death every time the tornado sucked up another friend of hers. It could be Helen vs. the Twister and at the end, right before she kills the tornado with a giant DirtDevil, the tornado could spit up all her dead friends to ensure that she needs years of intensive psychotherapy.Unfortunately, no one consulted me on the plot and we are left with a lifeless special effects vehicle that is only mildly entertaining.

Twister is the kind of thing that belongs in a museum, it is a thing of the past.Bill and Jo Harding used to chase tornadoes, now they are undergoing divorce and Bill has become a weather man.

A little unwilling at first, Bill joins up with his ex wife and his old team to see if they can pull it off.Part of the reason why Twister fails, is because it generates no sense of tension. The scenario is lame and it is that kind of thing that belongs on reality TV, 'welcome to idiots chasing tornadoes' We just don't care for what happens in the movie. The only thing that keeps the viewer from walking out is that there is a very small hint of progression, as each tornado gets more destructive than the previous one, but the pay off is insufficient. There are a couple of memorable moments here and there, such as a car driving through a house on the road, and a cow that goes flying (although it doesn't go over the moon)In the end however, Twister is a dud.

It has nothing approaching nuanced acting, as most characters are either half asleep (Bill Paxton), or completely over the top (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The villains might as well have mustaches so they can twirl the tips while laughing like Snidley Whiplash. The adherence to physics is pretty loose at best and outrageous bad at worst (being 100 feet from a mile wide tornado). But the nice thing is with the wonderful ability of home video, you can skip over all of the filler! And that leaves you with the tornado scenes themselves. 13 years later the CGI isn't quite as impressive as it used to be, with the primitive sky replacement/color grading looking particularly bad and some of the tornadoes looking very 'digital'. Despite this it get's the job done well enough that it's not a huge distraction. Coupled with a dated but still impressive (and very loud) surround sound mix and you can still have 45 minutes of fun with this movie. So many critics seems to judge this movie by the standards of a 'film'. In my opinion this is a mistake.

This is exactly what they're going for. There are about 5 intense tornado encounters throughout this movie, and each one is more extreme than the last. Ironically, the movie in between increasingly gets worse and worse. It's like they're upping the tornado intensity to get you to forget that they can't fill the scenes in between with anything better than crap.The dialogue and actions of the characters make no sense at all. The storm chasing team's major goal is to get a measurement device in front of tornado so that it can take readings and provide information that will lead to better tornado warning times. Bill Paxton can predict the weather by throwing dirt in the air and looking at the sky, and his character is so annoying in this movie that you wish they would have had him sucked up instead of their weather machine. This movie can't even use clich√©s correctly. Cheesy lines such as the cone of silence, they're going to punch the core, and suck zone are used in situations where screen silence would have been less awkward. Despite Bill's miraculous weather predicting powers, they find themselves almost getting killed by every tornado they're chasing.I would rate this film an F5.

The problem with most disaster movies of that time, is that they were so politically correct that it seems that nobody would ever die, but, come on, you are here to watch a disaster movie, so you are expecting to see a lot of destruction and death. Twister is probably the disaster movie with the lowest body count in cinema history I counted 3 dead in total, one in the pre-credits sequence (to explain the heroin's trauma and obsession about tornadoes) and two at the end, obviously the bad guy of the film and his assistant. And that's it!!! You cannot see a lot of destruction happening on screen either, apart from flying cows, cars and trucks. When a small town is hit by an unexpected tornado, everything happens off screen, and naturally everybody survives. Every year more than 50 people die in various tornadoes all over the States, so the film is obviously too optimistic for its own good. For the rest, the 3 stars of my vote are for the special effects, which are quite impressive at the beginning (after that you become used to it), since the story is stupid, the characters completely dumb (a pity to see such good actors like Helen Hunt or Bill Paxton having to say those terrible lines!!!) and what happens to them totally uninteresting.

Even the once cutting-edge special effects (which are this film's only excuse for existing) have grown much less special over time. These characters may be paper-thin, but we never worry that they will be blown away we know they are only trapped within a noisy but harmless digital effect that will repeatedly defy the laws of physics to ensure their safety. The tornadoes will pick up digital cows and farm equipment, but can't quite get a hold on the main characters, which is a pity, because they could only be improved by a few good smacks into the side of a barn.I am willing to suspend disbelief in an action film up to a point, but in this case, even with no special technical knowledge about tornadoes, I constantly found myself saying impossible. Imagine how much more frightening and dramatic this film would have been if it had characters you cared about and encounters with tornadoes that seemed at least remotely possible. Because the characters were constantly running from tornado to tornado there was never any build-up of suspense. Nothing is more ominous than the sky before a really violent storm, but we never got a sense of this since we were always plunging headlong into the centre of tornadoes. Every good horror director knows to hold back the monster at least some of the time. Speaking of which, what a self-defeating mistake for the director to include scenes from The Shining in this film - did he really imagine this mess would compare favourably to Kubrick's masterpiece? It only reminded me of what this film lacked.Twister wastes a number of good actors in small, meaningless parts, including the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman but then it is so dreadful that you could say it also wastes the mediocre talents which are its stars. Apparently good tornado chasers are reckless, wacky and shout a lot for no apparent reason. Aren't we just such fun? they seem constantly (and desperately) to be asking the audience. Well, no they aren't, they're annoying. And the dialog that is supposed to bring these characters to life? Like the plot, it seems to have been produced by a clich√© generator much less sophisticated than the machines that created the film's special effects. If you are over 12 years old you'll want to rent something better. And I may be insulting 12 year olds.

Now as were approaching its 20-year mark, I thought that I should post my review of it since this film played a major part of my childhood, if not my life. I myself was obsessed with tornadoes throughout my childhood days; I drew of them, watched whatever documentary on them, and read on them (well, sort of, if I wasn't paying attention to the dialogue instead of the pictures). Then my mother brought this film home (it was rented from a former video store) and when I first laid eyes upon it, I was hooked! I made it as my number one favorite movie of all time, and it has been throughout my entire life... until 2014. But even before that in the later years, I've started to notice something wrong when I grew older I sometimes grew tired and even sleep through the movie whenever I watch it. So, I dove to analyze it on a more critical level, and the results were less pleasing which I reluctantly admit it myself. Overall, Twister only delivers by its effects and sound, nothing else (except for the score, Mark Mancina really does well), the emotional impact falls short as well as the characters. Also you have to look at it scientifically; it seems ridiculous that they would manage to get close to a tornado bearing winds over 200 mph and still remain planted on their own two feet and escape from it unscathed. But even if it has it faults, I still consider it as one of my favorite movies of all time (In 3rd place). To this day, the special effects still look amazing and realistic. And if you try to compare this film to its spiritual successor Into the Storm, it'd make you appreciate Twister a bit more; in other words it is the best tornado film ever and I don't think it'll be ever replaced in the no-so-distant future. I still love tornadoes though, but I don't think I need that reason alone to hold this film close to my heart.

Yes, it is one of those turn off your brain films, but sometimes I like doing just that. The atmosphere was very thrilling for me as well as the suspense and the cinematography was very well done. The music never fails to give me goosebumps and I love that Van Halen was featured throughout the movie and the guitar solo during the end credits was breathtaking. The film has a very distinct blue collar feel to it which I love and it's not something you see very often in Hollywood. And it's not the mocking, in-your-face kind of representation either. It's very low- key and presented as a normal way of life, as it is for many Americans. Being a mid-westerner, I appreciated that aspect greatly. ***Mild Spoilers***I loved the bickering interactions between Paxton and Hunt and their crew was a fun, lovable bunch. Jamie Gertz was absolutely adorable as the reproductive therapist who finds herself in over her head. Cary Elwez did a great job as the egocentric, sniveling weasel of a rival, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman was a lot of fun in his role as Dusty.Yes, there are some flaws, mainly the segue between action and emotion, which I'd imagine is extremely tough to balance, especially in a 90 minute film. Some people thought there wasn't enough of the emotional aspect which can make it hard for the audience to sympathize with the characters. They tried to sprinkle it in here and there, but with much of the film focusing on the action, it's hard to give your characters any depth and it makes the audience wonder why they should care. And then you have those who would rather do without any of the drama. I can sympathize as I don't always feel the need to focus on it and would rather get right to the nitty gritty. Still, you can't please everyone. Overall, it's a fun, action-packed film that I will continue to enjoy for years to come. "},{"Title":"Oh dear...

So predictable! Hardly believable. The tornado always cleared up literally JUST as it passes them, every time! What are the odds, hey? The scattered chunks of debris that consistently kept missing these two love-birds/storm chasers by centimeters to meters was astounding! It was starting to become very repetitive. Little to no character development, so growing attached to any of the characters is out of the question; if there happened to be any loss of life in the film, it wouldn't affect the viewer at all. Not the mention the acting was rather ordinary, to say the least. The main thing that bothered me in this film was one of the final scenes, where Dr. Jo Harding and Bill Harding are strapped tightly to a pipe in a tiny shack, and this massive F5 tornado rips through and goes straight over top of them, and they walk away afterward with not a single scratch. I might be just being overly realistic with this film, but that's a little much for me. If a tornado that has been collecting debris its entirely journey picked you up, chances are that you wouldn't survive it because you'd be shredded by rapidly moving debris; it wouldn't be a pleasant sight, that's for sure!

Instead of a shark or a zombie there are more tornadoes in the movie than the planet has ever experienced. And the best thing is you don't have to WAIT for them. It's not like Jaws or King Kong or Invasion of the Body Snatchers, in which the suspense is built up until the trap is spring. Oh, no. The kids might be bored after the first ten minutes.Houses, vehicles, trees, and cows fly through the air with the greatest of CGI breeze. The cows moo while being tumbled about, as if PO'd by the disturbance. And the tornadoes advance and retreat like fire-breathing dragons.A dozen vehicle race around after the storms, radios blaring, singing, joking, arguing, but having a gay old time of it. The point is to plant a device called Dorothy directly in the path of a funnel in order to reveal the tornado's hidden secrets. But Dorothy is just an excuse for a lot of violent fun. Everyone overacts.The principal characters include Bill Paxton, who is to acting what a zephyr is to wind. He's the hero driving the red SUV. Next to him is his former lover, Helen Hunt, appealing and brave -- as a lover should be. But along for the ride is Paxton's current girl friend (or wife, I forget), the dark Jamie Gertz, Veronica to Hunt's blond Betty. Gertz is always naive, frightened, stunned, jealous, uncomfortable. Also we have Cary Elwes, who drives a BLACK SUV with Dorothy in the read, Elwes having stolen the idea for the device from Paxton,. Elwes is a narcissistic braggart who loves the press and hates Paxton.Let me put the interpersonal arrangement this way. Paxton is definitely good. So is Hunt. Elwes is clearly bad. Gertz is just bad in quotation marks. So how does it end up? No power on earth could get me to reveal the ending but the viewer is free to take a guess.Surprisingly for a movie that's all about tornadoes, you don't learn much about them. Hooks on radar and wind shear are mentioned without explanation. The F scale is briefly discussed for Gertz' information but a hush falls over the crowd when she asks for a definition of A F-5 tornado, as if she'd uttered God's name in an improper context. And when she's given the definition it's dramatic and wrong. The term wall cloud does not appear in the script.It's an unchallenging and frankly unskilled movie that mixes up monsters and disasters and take considerable liberty with recorded facts, but the kids won't have to exercise any patience. It's all in your face. Of course, after they've seen Sharknado they'll wonder why they find mere twisters so boring.

Although visually appealing director Jan De Bont scored a more exciting film with Speed. Cary Elwes plays an airhead who rides into a twister after being warned not too. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play peons who cannot take a hint. Jami Gertz is wasted as Paxton's fianc√©e.

Focussing on a group of reckless storm chasers, the movie follows them as they court danger by attempting to study 'twisters' at close range.While the death-defying exploits of storm chasers are interesting in and of themselves, the movie needs something more to build a plot around. In this case, as with many other disaster movies, the personal angle is fraught with melodrama.Soon to be divorc√©es Jo (Helen Hunt) & Bill (Bill Paxton) cross paths in order to finalize their divorce proceedings but end up getting swept away in a sort of His Girl Friday plot that substitutes storm chasers for newspapermen. The leads make the best of their questionable material but, in the end, their presence only serves as a necessary excuse for showcasing copious amounts of destruction.The supporting cast contains a good sampling of talented character actors including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alan Ruck & Jeremy Davies. Of the more prominent supporting cast, Cary Elwes is pretty forgettable as the requisite 'bad guy' and Jami Gertz is mostly just annoying as 'the other woman' (though perhaps that was the intent).Where the movie really stakes its claim is in the Oscar-nominated visual effects. Impressive for the time and still not bad to look at, the effects (courtesy of ILM) effectively convey a sense of the power behind these tornadoes. The sound design also received some well deserved Oscar recognition.Unfortunately, the merely competent direction of Jan de Bont and the sometimes laughable script fail to raise Twister to the heights of the best disaster movies. That being said, it is a perfectly acceptable popcorn movie, especially for viewers who are hankering more for spectacle than story.

For me, the thing that really made this film unpalatable was the plot hole that pushes this story forward.The story isn't a bad idea, if they had stuck to it at all. Typical man vs. nature; little girl loses father due to inadequate tornado warning time and dedicates her life to studying said storms in order to increase said warning time; sub-plot marital strife brought on by inability to reconcile or let go of previous trauma. Both plots culminate with her securing the data she needs and simultaneously learning, though a close call, to stop living in the past and embrace the future because there's no guarantee that the future is always going to be there.Again, decent story arc had the writers/directors/powers-that-be actually stuck to that idea without getting lost on making things unrealistically dramatic. The main failure (potentially the most critical) Father's untimely death by tornado had nothing to do with warning time. Open first scene, we see father watching news broadcast while storm rages outside. As the Tornado Warning is announced, the father hears the (oddly animalistic) roar of the impending tornado outside of the family window. Mother and father ascend the stairs and fetch their daughter, Joe, to flee for the cellar. What should have happened Mother, daughter, and perhaps the little dog too, make it into the storm shelter first. As father attempts to close the door behind him, tornadic winds pull it asunder and yank both the door and the father from safety's harbor. If only there had been more time! Then everyone would have been safe. What actually happened Everyone makes it to the shelter in time. When the F5 (winds with the potential to pull at 300+ miles an hour, mind you) arrives, Joe's Dad makes the fatal (and really, really, really stupid) decision, to hold the door closed in a futile attempt to aid in the door's losing battle with the tornado. The real tragedy with this plot point, is that, had brave father never bothered to hold the door, everyone would have made it out alive. So&#x85;if Joe REALLY wanted to attack the culprit of her father's death, she'd be visiting local schools and community centers stressing tornado safety for all and campaigning against tornado myths and ignorance (admittedly, not as compelling as hunting tornadoes, but at least it'd have been coherent). Ignoring this crucial plot point, broke the suspension of disbelief for me. Rest assured there are plenty of far fetched moments in this movie (the ending is so monumentally absurd, it borders on comedic), but that's the one the I found the most distracting.Yes, the CG is beautiful (hence the 5 stars). Yes, the composite team did a terrific job of making a sunny blue sky look like an ominous breeding ground for death, but that's really all there was to this movie. If you like suspense and CG, then by all means, watch away! But if you want coherent story, thoughtful character development, and a plausible ending&#x85;best look else where.

While they are doing this, another researcher, Jonas, funded by corporations, is trying to do the same thing - he is the enemy and also the idiot.The reviewers claimed that the characters were poor and got lost in the special effects of the film that dominated the film. Well, I agree that the special effects dominate the movie, but also the characters had their little memorable traits. I like Jo (Helen Hunt) who seemed to be a scientist dedicated to her work and couldn't hold a grudge against anybody, including her ex-husband's fianc√©. Bill (Bill Paxton) is her ex-husband, and though the reviewers claim that there is no explanation why they split up, I disagree. There is a scene where Jo is simply making conversation and Bill turns it into an argument. I said that Jo couldn't hold a grudge, and she doesn't, but Bill is a bit of a twit at times, not realising what gifts he has.There is another reason why they were together at first, and get together again in the movie, after Bill's fianc√© leaves due to her realisation that he chases real tornadoes, and that is that when you are together in a truck literally facing a life or death situation, it is not surprising that one develops an intense emotional attachment. In fact we can see this attachment developing as they begin to work together again throwing themselves into the front of tornadoes and dodging trees, telephone cables, cows, and semi-trailers.One might claim that with the breath-taking effects, it would only be good on the big screen, but the thing is that Twister works well on the little screen as well. It is probably better in the cinema, especially the scene where the truck emerges out of the tornado, and you think it is something small until it comes a lot closer. And then there is the tornado that sneaks up on the drive-in, giving them absolutely no time to react because it is suddenly there.The effects were good, and the suspense in this movie held up much longer than it did in Speed. Even though we knew that they were not going to die, simply watching them try to outrun a huge kilometer long tornado is something in itself. And then as they tie themselves down and watch a tornado pass over them - it is something that many of us don't get to do or even want to do. I think that Twister is a far superior to the director's earlier creation, Speed, but it still lacks a lot of what would become a superior movie.

The actual 'twister' is Helen Hunt, as male and nature are drawn toward her. Cricton wrote the script, and maybe it's intentional that the actual tornado needed a strong actor counterpart to balance the film -- in any case, she's filmed strong enough that it works. De Bont is OK, but maybe doesn't even know what he's done -- in the commentary all he talks about are the special effects, and maybe that's where the money was for this film and maybe that's what he really is interested in. But, in any case the casting and direction make for as real a cinematic experience for me as Casablanca -- take that as you will and with the understanding that it's the soul of a film that things move towards and away from one another and that the actors are just an outline on the screen too.Great film for anyone with a heart and with a kid's sense of just riding the film.

As other people have pointed out, the science is a good ways off, but unless you're a meteorologist or weather enthusiast it shouldn't be particularly bothersome. As a chaser, I'm able to enjoy this movie because it does get the feeling of a chase almost dead on. The excitement on a day before the first storms go up is caught pretty well. Now to the science part, while Twister has many flaws (the preliminary ratings before the tornado has even dissipated to name one), some of the issues listed below are totally false. Violent tornadoes can and do happen at night. Boundary layer cooling does not mean violent tornadoes cannot occur at night (a la Greensburg, Kansas EF5 in 2007 or the Super Tuesday Outbreak in 2008).

Since she and her group of colleagues are in the field trying to chase tornadoes, that's where he and Melissa have to go as well. Now, prior to becoming a weatherman he and Jo were working on a recently completed project they named Dorothy which was a device capable of measuring scientific data within a twister. But in order for it to work they have to put it directly in front of a tornado as it is bearing down on them. If that wasn't bad enough, a former co-worker named Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) has stolen their idea and has formed his own group. However, unlike Jo's group, Jonas and his group have corporate sponsorship. This has enabled them to build their own version of Dorothy which he has named D.O.T. 3. Jonas and his group also have more sophisticated equipment. But Jo's group now has Bill and his instincts are superior to any man or machine. At any rate, rather than spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it, I won't go any further with the plot. However, I will say that this film is fun and exciting. The special effects were excellent and I liked the supporting cast of characters. And if it wasn't for some of the incredibly preposterous scenarios, I probably would have rated it higher.

"}{"Title":"Disaster leads to Romance","Date":"16 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The film Twister, written by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin and later directed by Jan De Bont was the second highest grossing film of 1996. The heavily anticipated disaster drama was action packed much like Bont's other films. Bont created Twister for anyone who loves to watch natural disasters unfold on the big screen. The movie had quite a few unrealistic scenes; however there were realistic ideas behind the actions. The script as well as acting is what lead to a very popular and exciting film.Twister in a nutshell is about two scientist/ storm chasers meeting up to get divorce papers finalized. While husband Bill Harding is more concerned with ending his marriage to start another with fianc√©e, Dr. Melissa Reeves, wife Dr. Jo Harding is focused on launching a dangerous scientific machine (Dorothy) that will provide the scientist with never before developed tornado data. With the understanding of internal structures of tornados the scientist will be able to create an advanced tornado warning system. Along the way fianc√©e Melissa can't handle the exciting life Bill leads leaving husband and wife to tackle the storms together. After close calls and deadly storms the couple ends up sending sensors straight into the eye of the storm and rekindling a lost relationship.While parts of this action packed film are unrealistic the film is overall enjoyable for families, adults and children. Twister, in relation to director Bont's other film Speed had action unfolding during the opening of the film and never letting up, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats in anticipation. The film producers were able to produce new cinematography never seen before. The realism of the tornados created by new technology lead to this movie placing in one of the top ranked movies of its day. Compared to the graphic of today there is a noticeable improvement, but in the 1990's the realism of a natural disaster was unheard of. Director Bont creates moods and tornadic environments with the green, blue, and blackish coloring. Not only do the colors help the audience know its storm time but the wide verity of up tempo music leads into the scene as well. On the tail of one giant tornado the film's music ranges all the way from rock to classic, all setting the mode for the adventure filled chase.A tornado film had never been done before so at the time the technology seemed amazing, but if you exclude the graphics the film follows a pretty unrealistic path. Events such as a Dodge Ram truck staying grounded and surviving high velocity winds, while a semi barreled out of the tornado made me question the realism of the movie. During the film, lead actor Bill Paxton (Bill Harding) climbs into the back of a moving pickup while hail the size of golf balls come crashing down on top of him. Anyone who has ever been hit by hail knows just how much that hurts and standing in it for a period of time would be painful for him to stand.While the film contains unrealistic events it still has some realistic aspects that can be found in most movies. The films main characters whose job is to follow the tornados in order to collect helpful data do just that. The directors and producers worked hard at making their fast chases seem natural. The cast played these scenes particularly well and it seemed as if they were true scientist excited for the challenge. This film also contains a rivalry between two group of scientist and rivalry between two women pining for a man's love. The scripted bickering was completely believable and left the audiences rooting for scientist Bill and Jo. Not only does the script work in favor of a plausible story line, the main characters Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton create a chemistry that is also very believable. These actors played the parts to their fullest potential and if I had the choice to recast this movie none of the actors would have been replaced. Every part, major of minor played a role in creating the atmosphere and they were all spot on.Everyone was excited to see this kind of destruction on the big screen and the directors and producers exceeded expectations. In my opinion the unrealistic aspects didn't affect the quality of the movie and I think those who helped it reach second highest grossing film would have to agree as well. This movie will forever pop into my mind and the minds of others who watched when they hear tornado sirens blaring. Overall the film is enjoyable and one that everyone should see.

Directed by Jan de Bont, Twister (1996) stars Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Cary Elwes, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's kind of funny that the original tag-line for the film was going to be It sucks but the producers felt that it worked too much to the advantage of disappointed audiences and critics. It's doesn't really suck in a bad way. It's a very entertaining piece&#x97;not that good, but not that bad. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt as an estranged couple who chase tornadoes for a living surprising the dialogue between them is funny and catchy&#x97;it's felt very well written for a disaster movie. We follow these storm-chasers during a wild 24-hour-period in a quest to deploy a large piece of scientific equipment in the path of a tornado, in hopes of studying it's traits from the inside with a rag-tag team of scientists. Each supporting cast of the movie's crew of storm-chasers has its bits of character develop stereotypes and exaggerated caricatures of real people. You have the smart guy with the map, the computer guy, the film and camera crew&#x85; but most of all; you got Dusty play by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's very cool to see him in a role where he doesn't take himself so serious, because most of his roles after this movie were a big serious. While, not chasing storms, the viewer are treated with a sub-story of Bill getting suck into the thrill of storm chasing, forcing him to reconnect an relationship with Josie (Helen Hunt's character) and ignoring his relationship with his new girlfriend. We get a back story of Helen Hunt's character reasons why she track storms, in a way to get revenge on them, for the death of her father who die from one. Then you got the story of the rivalry of competing storm-chasing teams lead by Carl Elwes. Carl Elwes plays also a caricature of the evil, corporation man who in it for money rather than science opposite of Bill's character. Without giving too much out away&#x97;it's incredibly entertaining. It's a very cookie-cutter popcorn flick. The CGI tornadoes were great at the time of filming, plus it's pretty real to me. It's eye candy. Just don't take the sum-story so serious, and enjoy yourself. You would be blow away how some critics deem it 'bad', and find yourself having fun watching it.

Goofy, either!No, wait... on second thought, maybe I am. Let me put it to you this way if a lot of the characters in this flick aren't really clones of Goofy, they're sure close.Tornadoes are my absolute worst fear in the world. Ever since learning what one was when I was 4--the same way a lot of children did, by watching The Wizard of Oz--I have hated and feared them all my life. Fortunately, I don't live in tornado country. But once when visiting tornado country for a couple of years and having to live through tornado warnings, I was absolutely terrified. Even earthquakes, as awful as they are, don't scare me as bad as tornadoes do--that's because an earthquake doesn't look like a giant, living, breathing, demonic THING of a monster hunting you down with an agenda of killing you and devouring everything you own!So I avoided watching this movie for years until now. The first time I ever heard of it was when I went to a local WB store to buy cartoon shirts...and the trailer for this yet-to-be-released-at-that-point film came up on the big screen there, and it scared me so badly that I literally threw up right there on the floor.Now, the reason why I mention all of this is so that you can get a good understanding of what I'm about to describe concerning Twister as entertainment value. You would think that I would be even more frightened than the average moviegoer when seeing this film.Surprisingly, even I watched it without a twitch.Instead of a tense action-packed thriller, what we have here is a supremely silly movie that's so inept in logic and plot development that I don't know where to begin. In fact, it's only a hairsbreath away from being something to be mocked on Mystery Science Theater 3000! I won't go into a list of details which you would have to be blind as a bat to miss, but there's one I just can't resist because it made me laugh so hard--I found it hilarious that everybody was driving right next to dangerous tornadoes, and even between them, and yet all through the bad weather Melissa the therapist continues to get calls on her cel phone and is able to keep perfectly normal conversations with her callers without any call dropping or interference. Just what kind of a technical marvel WAS it she was conversing on, anyway?!As for the crew of tornado chasers... well, that's where the earlier Goofy comment comes into play. We're talking weird, smelly, nerdy, bucktoothed, southern-accent-insulting weirdos here. I mean, you can just imagine their breath smelling of Jack Daniels. Even though Melissa was annoying in her prim neatness, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her--not because her character was interesting, mind you, but because she reacted to these bozos with the exact same disbelief and forced politeness I personally would have!She finally yells at them, YOU'RE ALL CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT??? My feelings exactly, Melissa.Add into all this overacting leads, a completely predictable love triangle situation AND a ridiculous subplot involving a rival scientist, and you have a film which is pretty good for a few bellylaughs on a Saturday night!Oh, and by the way, the tornadoes look fake. Well, at least they do on the TV-sized screen. Maybe they look more impressive in a theater, I wouldn't know. But on a small television tube they look like a jumble of grey computer graphics, like something out of a videogame. Which, in a way, they certainly are.It won't scare, but I'm pretty positive that you'll laugh at it. It's not Plan 9, but it sure does seem to be the equivlalent of a modern-day Ed Wood production!

I love the idea that in this movie you have dueling teams of Storm Chaser's the other team is headed up by a cocky Jake Busey. throughout the movie you will see some of the most horrifying scenes of twisters that can be put on film,, the funnel clouds , the wall the spinning rotation,, the vortex,, you can tell i'm a weather junkie can't you.. I live in the Midwest now and I have seen one tornado high up in the sky once right over my house,, thank god it didn't touch down,, found out later it was a F1 but still, I think that if people would stop and watch Twister seriously maybe some people in the country especially the Midwest would be better suited to deal with a tragedy like this, see you can actually learn a few things from watching a movie these days,, I loved this movie,, it is my perfect storm.

That's why I prefer my old VHS version. The pan & scan is annoying but the slight fuzziness makes the CGI appear more convincing. The DVD is too clear! Otherwise, turn down your sharpness and enjoy maybe the best definitive tornado movie ever made! Stormchasers in Oklahoma in Tornado Alley at the peak of the May season. The plot, at times, is cloying and slows down the action. However, Jo (Helen Hunt) believes that the tornadoes are stalking her and Bill (Paxton) is great as the human barometer. So much eerie similarity to 2013's real disaster It's set in Oklahoma. It's a F5 storm. Are the storms technically accurate? Probably not. I still love that poor flying cow. The gasoline tanker that almost seems to explode twice? Driving through a house turned on it's side?--both impossible, of course. Bill's sex therapist fianc√© is annoying but the Dorothy telemetry tracking devise is real. It's based on a real prototype nicknamed Toto! A lot of little Spielberg touches. The storms seem to growl. Intentionally humorous scenes and dialog. Jo seems to see her family standing in the rubble of her Aunt's town, which of course is impossible. It's a great roller coaster ride all the way, even on the home screen. Look for Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty, who just died in 2014. Today, we have almost a 15 min. tornado warning because of Doppler Radar, but it still isn't enough time to evacuate. Still timely In Oklahoma (2013), thousands were injured, displaced, and many died. This movie needs to be re-released on the big screen with IMAX 3D and updated special effects.

Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton were likable enough leads. The lack of story perhaps meant that their acting abilities weren't really stretched too far. They had to spend a lot of their time looking either apprehensive or downright scared, but - yes - they are likable, and they pulled off their parts well enough.Basically they play storm chasers, and we spend most of the movie watching them do just that chasing tornadoes through much of Oklahoma with a device they've invented that will give more information than ever about tornadoes and how to predict them. The trouble (1) getting close enough to the tornadoes, and (2) getting the tornadoes to suck up the device so that it can take its measurements. Yeah. It was pretty exciting at times. The tornado effects were incredible, with perhaps just one exception near the end of the movie, with a scene of a farmers field in which virtually everything in the field looked like toys. Aside from that, the effects were well done. There's a very good opening sequence set in the past, in which Hunt's character of Jo Harding (as a child) sees her home destroyed and her father killed by a massive tornado, which at least explains why she's so obsessed with these storms.Let's be honest, though. The story is lacking. What story there is turns out to be quite secondary to the tornadoes - and the tornadoes themselves, in some ways even more than Hunt and Paxton, are the stars of the movie. Most of what was included to add dramatic or sometimes even comedic content didn't strike me as especially necessary. Paxton's character of Bill Harding shows up with his girlfriend simply to get Jo to sign their divorce papers. The whole idea of the ex-wife vs new girlfriend added very little to the movie, and for whatever reason there was a decision to turn this into a competition movie. Jo and Bill are the leaders of the good guy storm chasers but there's also a team of bad guy storm chasers (in it not for the science but for the money, as Bill tells us.) They come replete with a caravan of black, official looking vehicles (that's rather clich√©) while Bill and Jo and their team travel around in a motley crew of multi-colored vehicles. I don't know why that aspect of the story had to be included. It struck me as silly.For all that, though, this will never bore you. It's fun and exciting, even if it is lacking in meaningful story content.

It was directed by Jan de Bont, who helmed Speed. Like Speed, Twister is about natural forces causing a group of human beings to struggle through a race for survival, a few obligatory ham-fisted bad guys who lead these people to be in direct opposition with such things as the laws of gravity and physics. The difference is that in Speed, said scientific laws were the weapon of the bad guy. In Twister, which transplants the essential streamlined action-disaster formula onto the wild everyday life of storm-chasers, the tornado attacks function almost as Godzilla-style environmental monsters.I'm sorry to have sacrificed honesty for a well-structured paragraph There is not just one difference between Speed and Twister that makes Twister inferior. Twister also just blindly follows the signifying elements of its lockstep commercial formula and in the process commits adultery against the themes that would've made it genuinely interesting Past us it parades fleeting implications of instinct vs. technology, innovation vs. corporate infiltration, the timeless and crucial necessity of understanding nature to withstand it, and Twister blue-balls us on those terms. Instead of following through with the subject matter it presents us with, it opts for hitting hollowly gratifying notes. More than anything, it plays upon the latent romantic prospects between Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt---two actors who are always good sports---who always seem to get distracted before those divorce papers can finally get signed. Their scenes of flirting, talking about how their marriage failed, the humiliating comic relief of his new psychiatrist fianc√©e completely floundering at adapting to the impulsive, aerobic nature of storm-chasing, are all tritely played for mawkishly sentimental audience reaction.Where it could've been like Contact on Earth, Twister turns out not to have much purpose other than using as many would-be commercial elements as possible. Mark Mancina's schmaltzy orchestral score makes various emotional moments redundant, and yet a soundtrack filled with modern pop, rock and metal blare constantly for no other reasons than to play up those hackneyed, overdrawn emotional elements and to classify the insatiable storm-chasers singing and rocking along as hip and fun-loving. Entire scenes are seemingly devoted to nothing other than their having a good time head-bobbing, fist-pumping and smirking at each other in between skillfully shot and edited tornado disasters. This makes all the computer-generated and hydraulic tornado spectacle feel as upbeat as it ever could, impressively eschewing the sense of true peril.This, in essence, is actually why I somewhat enjoy Twister even now as an adult. It is the closest movies come to actually functioning like roller-coasters. On a roller-coaster, everything is set up and paid off in a physically interactive way that indeed impressively eschews the sense of true peril. As well, people can take or leave roller-coasters depending on their attitude towards it. Some wait in lines for hours so that they can shout and flail their arms at the right time, and others feel sick. The attitude I've been speaking of all has to do with how much attention you pay to the mechanics of the whole thing. You think too much about the fallacy of human procedure and you want off, and on the other hand, if you trust what you're subjected to, allow yourself the thrill of all the wind in your face, you want to go again.

Then with real disastrous experiences at the late 70s like (The Swarm - 1978), (The Concorde ... Airport '79 - 1979), and (When Time Ran Out - 1980) it was obvious that the heyday has had its day. As you know also that in less than 10 years the disaster movie came back again and galore. I think the reason why, aside from of the yearning, was the development of the special effects that hit a new peak with the birth of CGI.The first movie that began the revival was the 1988 super hit (Die Hard). With a threat for a building and all the people in it (a la' The Towering Inferno &#x96; 1974). True that it didn't rely on the CGI much, but definitely it got (Jan de Bont) as director of photography.It's clear that this man has a thing for the disaster movies. The first movie he directed was (Speed - 1994) another super hit with a bombed bus. And its sequel (Speed 2 Cruise Control - 1997) about a ship with calamity.In the acme of this other golden age you'd find in the same year of 1996 movies like (Executive Decision), (Daylight), (Mars Attacks !), and for sure (Independence Day). Compared to them or not (Twister) isn't a good disaster movie inasmuch as a good showreel for the recent special effects at the time ! The main problem in any disaster movie was always the drama. When it comes to (Twister) it's no exception. The case of 2 lovers that return to each other wasn't the best story to fill the in-betweens of this visual show, or to use this very show as a clever equivalent to any dramatic situation.It was total waste to watch a brilliant actress like (Helen Hunt) in the middle of weak story like this. Although the case of 2 different competing teams was thrilling but it ends earlier, and the big climactic sequence at the end, of being in the middle of the twister, was well directed but didn't serve any story well since the script didn't utilize it as enlightenment moment for anything or anyone to look eventually dazzling yet naive; almost like the whole movie.It got the same problem of contemporary movies like (Jumanji) one year ago where you feel that the CGI had been designed first then they looked for any story to fit that ! I know that a lot of viewers at the time came out of (Twister) talking and talking about the flying cow more than anything.. I think that's a shortcoming itself.Among the 1990s disaster movies (Twister) remains at the average section with ones like (Under Siege 2 - 1995), (Volcano - 1997), and (Dante's Peak - 1997) despite its good visual moments.

Early on we have the evil corporate scientists, well maybe not evil but greedy, from so many other films like E.T. or Starman. Admittedly in those efforts the bad guys came from government but you get the idea. Director deBont or someone came to their senses and for a long time they more or less disappear or become just another bunch of guys on the road, but someone in power put them back in to demonstrate the folly of big business sponsorship.Then Romancing the Stone and its concept of man and woman at each other's throats is dragged front and center, but this time with the added presence of the Grace Kelly figure from High Noon, who does not understand her man's obsession. This time she meekly bows out, smiling all the while. I did wonder how her cell phone worked so well as storm clouds flew about.Helen Hunt gets the Julia Roberts role, but while we usually root for Julie to get her man, here Helen is just plain obnoxious, but no wonder since she lived next door to Dorothy Jean as a child. Her daddy was swept away in that same tornado that took Dorothy to Oz.Bill Paxton has had one good film role in his life as the sheriff in One False Move.....what a piece of oatmeal he is, but his grin as he and Helen plunge the truck through the house that confronts them appears so many times on promo's at the beginning of videos and DVDs.The saving grace of the film was the storm scenes, and for this reason I give it a '5'. Unlike underwater scenes where it is hard to tell who is zapping whom, storms make all faces visible. The storms perform one more wonderful function they almost drown out the dialog so that Paxton and Hunt must shout. For me it brought back Richard Strauss rehearsing Salome and screaming to the orchestra, Play louder, I can still hear the Heink referring to the soprano.Of course, they manage to outrun a tornado without losing their breath. And of course, 'Auntie Em' has her house fall on her and comes away with nary a scratch. Only bad guys and cows are killed by these storms.Back in the early Seventies the disaster film was in vogue Towering Inferno, Airport etc etc. Then Steven Spielberg came along, took a perfect book and script and made a perfect suspense film about a force of nature. He is listed in the credits here. He should have known better. In his masterpiece, there were no subplots to clog the action, just a resort town, three men and a big fish.

Rival meteorologists(Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton)--who once were married(go figure!)--find themselves colliding with each other as they are in pursuit of a series of powerful tornadoes in rural Oklahoma. They have a shared enemy in another storm-chasing meteorologist(CAry Elwes),who conspires to steal their technology and take the credit. I'd go on with the story but it feels pointless. The characters are set-ups for the tornadoesbig,awesome funnel clouds that can move building,vehicle,beast and man at will! They are arguably the best thing of this offeringthey look and seem pretty potent.Which leads me to another criticism of this moviestrangely,a very deadly weather occurrence that's supposed to be menacing somehow manages to kill very few of the characters in the film. Let me sidetrack heremost films where there is a menace of some sort,but in this case we'll stick to nature,shows the audience through the course of the picture how lethal and intense it is by killing (or even just seriously harming) a good portion of the players involved. The Jaws movies,The Swarm,Earthquake,The Towering Inferno,The Poseidon Adventure, The Jurassic PArk movies,etc. These films HAD body counts and you,the audience members,felt the danger,panic and terror. Twister has almost none of this. Instead,it seems to be no less than one-third concerned with crazed,adrenaline-junkies who work for the National Weather Servicewho want to chase and(if at all possible)face-to-face with the most powerful of cyclones(an F6 being the ultimate). This had all the menace and seriousness as a Mountain Dew commercial! Being someone who lives in the part of the USA that's sometimes referred to as Tornado Alley,I can honestly say that most people,even the tornado chasers themselves,I doubt have this kind of surfer dude mentality of tracking twisters. And when the tornadoes finally do claim lives,it's only a select few characters that you the viewer either didn't care about or didn't like. It didn't even seem like most of the crews involved or the townsfolk in the line of the tornadoes suffered more than a few scratches or bruises. Lucky them!There's,of course,no shortness of chase scenes,and I'd tell more about them but I'd TRULY spoil the film. Suffice it to say,if you or I got as close to these funnels as the stars of this movie,I'd wager we'd probably not be so lucky. In summary,this film has good technical points,but I'm betting that nobody,not director Jan de Bont nor(it seems)Michael Crichton has actually BEEN THROUGH actual tornadoes. If they had,I feel this movie might've lived up to its potential as a serious natural disaster movie,and not a silly actioner made for summer audiences.

Helen Hunt and a phenomenal storyline will literally blow away any memory you have of that old picture.  Not only is Twister a film with Hollywood's hottest star, Helen Hunt, it also contains a thrilling edge-of-your-seat ride through a plot filled with more twists and turns than a ride through a town with a lot of turns in it.  Not only that, the writers managed to create a film which could easily be modified into a National Geographic special due to its strict adherence to solid science yet it manages to do so without becoming clich√©.  Trust me, you haven't seen a disaster film of this caliber since Deadly Swarm Killer Bees.How packed full of entertainment and science can one film be?  First off, you have an amazing romance between Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.  What makes this romance so unexpected is that he arrives on the scene with his new fiance.  Why on earth would you expect a romance between the lead male and female characters when one is clearly hitched?  As soon as you see the interactions between Bill, Melissa (Jami Gertz), and Jo you'll get it. You'll immediately realize that Melissa is all wrong for Bill and that Jo is actually the one who is the perfect match.  You'll soon scream from the edge of your seat that Melissa Reeves is all wrong for Bill and that Jo is his true soul mate, but due to the thrilling tornado hunting adventure one would think that there's just no room for romance, but fortunately one would be wrong.  Completely out of the blue, Bill comes to his senses and realizes that Jo is the woman for him and he chucks Melissa out in the middle of Oklahoma.But is Melissa sad?  No, she's wise enough to see that her only purpose of being in the movie was to ask the questions that we the audience need answered about the hard-core science of tornado hunting.  She, like the audience, finally realizes that Bill and Jo are meant to be together and as an empowered woman, she has more important things to do than whine about some man who's stupid enough to get sick in a space capsule, yet she made a big sacrifice for us the viewers, and you better appreciate it.Unfortunately, poor Bill and Jo have more than a spare wheel to interfere with their budding romance The Tornado Villains!  Driving in their black minivans with their cutting edge technology, these nefarious scientists are corporate whores to the Extreme.  Armed with their own tornado studying device, shamelessly duplicated from the plans Bill and Jo developed, these miserable excuses for human beings have no soul while Bill and Jo may have meager technology, their love of science and ability to speak directly to the Earth ensures their victory over the scum that was probably funded by C. Montgomery Burns himself.Kids should see this film mainly to learn how to handle themselves in a tornado.  First off, we should all drive Dodge pickups due to their regenerative properties, Chrysler foolishly fails to advertise the vehicle's ability to fix a broken axle and windshield on the fly in their commercials. (Personally, I would see a vehicle's ability to repair itself as a big selling point but those were the days before 0% financing)  The only damage this vehicle will succumb to is the full brute force of an F-5 tornado or a nail.Kids will also learn that tornados have been stereotyped as destructive machines as we now see that a tornado will only affect with wind speed in the cone.  Outside of the tornado the wind is nice and calm giving budding Wind Speakers of the midwest the chance to get close and personal with a tornado.  And their internal winds certainly aren't fast enough to propel dust and dirt fast enough to act like a sandblaster on human flesh.We also learn to avoid bovines when tornados are present, unlike their swine counterparts, bovines CAN fly and appear to do so whenever a tornado is present.  While their flight appears slow and peaceful, children of the farming-centric Tornado Alley know very well that cows have chronic diarrhea and due to the erratic flight paths of flying cows it might be difficult to avoid a bout.I highly recommend buying Twister for your own home collection, in fact buy several copies for every DVD or VHS player you own.  You need to be prepared!  My vote 3 out of 10 stars.

The tornado scenes get tiring because once you've seen the first one you've seen the rest. The F5 tornado at the end doesn't look much more powerful than the first tornado, an F2 tornado that was able to destroy a barn in 2 seconds. The tornados aren't believable either, since when were tornados able to follow humans, in one instance it actually sets an obsticle course,  and purposly drop on them on them for a while, but not leave any significant cut or anything on the humans. One scene I did like was in the drive in theater which was a little more entertaining, but you have to sit though the rest which isn't effective.

Technical issues aside, to get the full measure of all the storms in this film one must yield to the force that metaphor wields within and throughout the plot. The largest most powerful tornado, in the film, is the female lead, Jo Harding, played by Helen Hunt. She is a true F-10 capable of pulling another tornado, her estranged husband an F-8 himself, back to her from many miles away. Her husband, Bill Harding, played by Bill Paxton, has an intuitive relationship with storms, and if he isn't out chasing them, then he's off creating them in his personal life. Joe also has an intuitive relationship with storms, the storms that rage inside her husband. It is quite evident that storms are chasing storms, and we are left without visions of tornadoes until the two are safely back together working, carefully and gingerly monitoring the force of their love. This inspired aspect of the plot, also creates a triangle which in a sense is the same shape as that of a tornado viewed in two dimensions.Each Tornado is preceded and followed by equally turbulent developments in the relationship between the two, and growing clarity of the real distance and lack of true intimacy between Bill and the other woman. The film contains the best cinematic use of double entendre that I have had the pleasure of seeing. It is no accident that the dialog is chock-full of descriptive phrases and expressions that apply equally to both the storms and the relationship between the spouses, and the other woman (for the duration of her tenure in the film). As carefully crafted as the dialog is, in the hands of this fine troupe of actors, it remains consistently spontaneous and witty from the beginning to the end.Consistency is the mark of a great film, and the use of metaphor extends to include the supporting cast who are tossed and pushed around coldly by both Hardings equally like debris in the wind. The end of the film leaves the fate of the supporting cast a complete mystery, again, much like the whereabouts of artifacts in the debris after a tornado has passed.Fans of love stories (fans of all ages) who have not seen the film should definitely see this film. It withstands repeated viewing and would make a fine addition to any film library.

I remembered why I had loved it so much.Let me just say this first- the effects are amazing...stunning. To try to recreate something from mother nature, something real, something that the audience has seen- and to pull it off almost perfectly, well that takes a lot of money, time and talent..all of which was put into this movie.The story is beautiful. It takes us inside the life of these Storm Chasers, to them tornadoes are their lives. The script gives us plenty of opportunities to see the storms, in which time you began to really see how they move- almost balletic, beautiful-but destructive Godly creations.The plot take us to another level. The basic idea is that these scientists have invented a machine that is programed to release hundreds of sensors once inside a tornado. These sensors pick up all sorts of readings about the core of the tornado and send them back to the scientists. The information gathered from them will help when forecasting tornadoes, to give people more time to get themselves and their families to safety. The only thing the storm chaser scientists have to do now is get their machine right in the path of the tornado. There is also a subplot which most of us can appreciate. Two of the chasers are on the verge of divorce and this event brings them back together for one last time, just like the storms their actions are unpredictable.The acting is also pulled off very nicely. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt convey their characters well. The other actors are also great and we get the feeling that this group is all one big crazy but happy family.

A friend of mine bought the tape and dropped it round thinking I might like it, since I have always been interested in tornadoes and storms. After 5 or 10 minutes of Twister, my wife and I turned to each other and tried to decide whether to go on watching it. We pressed on, ever the determined critics, and struggled valiantly to watch to the end. When we finally reached the end credits, Lisa (my wife) turned to me and said We will never again be able to get those 2 hours of our lives back. Those 2 hours are gone forever. Lost. Absolutely right.I concede the point about the special effects, yet I must confess I have never heard of tornadoes growling and sounding like animals. If you get chance, check out the tornado scenes and listen for the tell tale groans and growls. Many people have said that the world seems to go mad around tornadoes, but are strangely silent on the subject of sounding a bit like big scary animals.The comment from the person in Manchester, NH, describes my main gripes and thoughts, so I can leave most of that out since anyone reading this will have read that first. But really, how dire can a film get? The Dorothys for example. Notice the bad guys had a slightly different version of the Same Thing? But *ours* is better cos we're just low paid amateurs who do it for the love of the thing. *They* have the technology but *we* have the guy who can errm sense them. *We're* a band of characters, all funny and sensitive, *they* are cold, humourless uniforms. Can you work out who you are supposed to route for? *They* are paid loads of cash by a semi-scary organisation while *we* do it for sensitive personal reasons.The award for the Most Stupid Behaviour In A Crap Film goes to (gasp) Holly Hunter for the scene under the wooden bridge where she suddenly decides to undo her bindings and go out for a look. I have to see it! Classic. Mind you, the picking up the scrap metal pieces out of the failed Dorothy came a close second.I must admit, I thought the Wahoo! Yoohoo chanting long haired guy was marked for death in the first few minutes after he started getting a bit too likeable. I could almost see the arrow pointing at him saying Enjoy him now, the decapitation in minute 23 is the end of him... but it never came. One point to Twister for being unexpected.As I say, I experienced none of the hype, and merely saw a tv commercial for the video. I came into Twister thinking it might be a film about tornadoes and got a few interesting looking storms held together with shaky sub plots that border on surrealism in their crassness.My advice to others who might be considering Twister in the same way I did is this. Go to Discovery channel and search through their listings. You might find mention of a programme called Storm Chasers of Tornado Alley. Watch this and imagine what Twister might have been like in a perfect world. This show is everything Twister could never hope to be true, interesting, exciting, credible, funny, entertaining and informative. In fact, had the producers of Storm Chasers hooked up with the special effects team from Twister, we could have had a real goer.Finally, if you *do* watch it, rememberYou can never get those two hours back.

Mediocre special effects with a great story does carry a film.  I wonder why Director of Photography turned Director Jan de Bont didn't heed his peers words with his film Twister.Twister is the tale of a group of twenty and thirty something people who chase tornados through the American midwest for a combination of research and the thrill of danger.  Who are these people?  We are left wanting to know because Jan de Bont and screenwriters Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin never develop the characters past the cardboard stage.  They are not characters, they are caricatures.  By the end of the film, I could care less if any of them were sucked up into a tornado.Helen Hunt plays Jo Harding, the estranged wife of Bill Paxton's Bill Harding.  The pair, along with a small following of Twister Chasers, used to brave nature for research and the thrill.  But along the way, their marriage suffered.  They should have paid more attention to thier relationship.  Now, Bill meets Jo out in the field with his next wife in tow, Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz in a thankless role. Her only reason for existence is to act in horror at the twisters and be the butt of jokes thrown at her by Jo Harding), to get Jo's signature on the final divorce papers.  The film telegraphs every move well in advance, as we know from the start Dr. Reeves is way out of her element and does not belong in Bill's world.  We know from the start Bill and Jo should be together.  Cliche.For a protagonist, we are given Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes, in the films second thankless role), Jo and Bill's long time adversary in the hunt for twister research.  He has the edge because his equipment is more sophisticated than Jo and Bill's.  See, he has corporate funding.  We are unsure where the funding comes from for Jo and Bill's research.  Maybe they won the lottery.  Maybe they are independently wealthy.  Maybe the screenwriters didn't think that was an important detail (it could have lead to *gasp* depth!).  Interestingly, after seeing Twister in the theater, I felt as if there were gaps in Dr. Miller's character, as if there should have been more of him.  It seemed as if his character was even more underdeveloped than the rest (as impossible as that sounds).  Later I learned that Actor Cary Elwes and Director Jan de Bont had a major falling out during the filming of Twister and Jan de Bont got his revenge by leaving most of Cary Elwes footage on the editing room floor.  He left only what was absolutely necessary for the film.Helen Hunt and Cary Elwes, two fine actors, do the their best with what they've been given.  However, Bill Paxton is as uncharismatic and wooden as usual.  He would repeat this in Titanic, easily the worst performance of that film.  Bill Paxton has yet to demonstrate any range or depth with his acting.     An annoying feature of Twister is the pseudo-hip attitude of the Jo and Bill twister team.  There is a scene in which they are seated around a dinner table conversing in their hip techno-science jargon.  They seemed like a generation stuck between us Baby Boomers and the Gen-X'ers, trying to be cool, trying to fit in.  They came off like geeks.There is no doubt Twister has great special effects.  The action and pacing are excellent.  But there is nothing in between holding the film together.  Jan de Bont showed great promise in 1994 with his directorial debut, Speed.  But between Twister, Speed 2 and The Haunting, he might find himself directing photography again.

The lead characters, Jo and Bill, are supposedly on the verge of finalizing their divorce.  Naturally, they begin to bicker within 2 minutes of meeting onscreen - this is meant to show that each of them has a tempestuous and strong-willed nature, and is what passes for sparks in a Hollywood relationship.  The problem is, they come off as just bad-mannered and sulky; far from wondering how they will reconcile in the end, the viewer is left wondering how they ever could have been attractive enough to marry in the first place.  A third character, Melissa, Bill's new amour, is tossed into the plot like a creampuff into a shredder.  There is not the remotest chance that this little fuzzball will beat the lithe, sinewy Jo in a competition for Bill's affections, for what they're worth. Naturally, no melodrama would be complete without Snidely Whiplash, and this movie obliges with a villainous tornado researcher who is in competition with our heroes.  One of this character's greatest sins is that he is funded by a private corporation; this sordid money-grubbing is presented as a stark contrast to the noble disinterest of the underdogs, who are funded by the government.  Even in 1996, it seems, the standard government-good; business-bad cliche still thrives in the movies.

They say it's to research these natural disasters. Cue joke about this movie being natural disaster.Leading the pants-wetting charge is Jo (Helen Hunt) with her team of nonces, including a young, beatnik Philip Seymour Hoffman. Along for the sodden ride is Jo's estranged hubbie and ex-leader of the nonces, Bill (Bill Paxton), with his new psychologist boo, played with closed-kneed stoicism by Jami Gertz; with the talented Cary Elwes as a rival storm-chaser, relegated to Dick Dastardly sniggers.The aluminum thingy collects data from tornadoes (euphemized as Twisters for street-cred), to save lives&#133; while risking countless lives driving maniacally down small-town dirt roads, recklessly through cornfields and private property, through gullies where kids could be hiding, smashing through houses &#150; all the while, their computers effectively pinpointing tornadoes, their intensity, girth, location, speed, direction, their credit reports and bra sizes, long before any visual sighting. Yet none of these nonces is astute enough to resolve their goal by simply requesting grants to buy these fancy hi-tech gadgets for threatened locales.Directed by Jan de Bont (SPEED, 1994), written by made-for-filming novelist, Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin, the very fabric of this movie reeks like a rain gutter gone stagnant.Seems these perves get their thrills by facing extinction, the nonces relating an absolutely pointless anecdote about Bill standing his ground before a tornado, railing at it naked and drunk, earning him the nickname The Extreme. So it is no surprise when, during the course of gadding about the Midwest risking their necks for no reason, Bill becomes estranged with his psych chick, when he realizes she is not psycho ENOUGH; seems she's not enticed with the prospect of gadding about the midwest risking her neck for no reason. The very society renowned for its profusion of unnecessary therapists - schizoid Americana - insistently derides Jami Gertz's therapist, who leaves the party when Bill gravitates towards ex-wife Jo (far more psycho!) who reconciles with him amidst the tempest and looks much better in a wet t-shirt.Jo is demonically obsessed with twisters because her father was taken by one in the scary opening sequence. So chasing them is catharsis - ironically, girl, YOU need that therapist more than anyone! This valiant attempt at three dimensional character went balls-up as soon as De Bont opened The Hollywood Clich√© Handbook (Disaster Movie Edition) &#150; hoping against hope we wouldn't notice Jo's vocation is itself sorely one-dimensional.Since when is a storm-chaser (whatever that means) more noble than a therapist? Gertz is portrayed as a sex-with-the-lights-out prude; in one scene, she is made to look like an anal pen-pusher with misplaced priorities, as she consoles a distraught divorc√©e over her cellphone - while the fools in the car with her are *driving into the maw of a tornado.* Which begs the question What, in fact, does a storm-chaser do? The grant-grabbing apologists pipe up They study tornadoes to aid predictability and consequently, survivability. Which begs the corollary question why don't all those people in this film who live in a tornado alley, start the survival process by PICKING UP ALL THE LOOSE CRAP LITTERING THEIR YARDS? Their barn doors are practically falling off their hinges with rot, there are implements and tools scattered hither and thither &#150; ironically, as if a twister has just slammed by! Jo's aunt, Meg (Lois Smith), is out in her yard WELDING PIECES OF STEEL TOGETHER &#150; definitely sensible recreation in a high-risk tornado area!; in effect, NO ONE seems to be taking any precautions for tornadoes anyway - what would a ten-minute warning benefit as opposed to a ten-SECOND warning? And after all the cow-flying and tractor-slinging and wet t-shirts (and snippet of Deep Purple at THE California JAM, with wrong *Child in Time* audio under the visuals &#150; blasphemous swine!), when their last aluminum thingy (filled with Pepsi product-placement) is sucked into the vortex of a tornado, does the cheery, uplifting soundtrack mean the END OF TORNADOES? Is the world safe from natural disasters now that these intrepid swine risked their lives to throw extra aluminum debris into a twister (that probably came down somewhere and sliced a kid's ear off)?

Philip Seymour Hoffman's is the worst (Hoffman would eventually land some decent roles), a manic storm team member who is sort of the 'animal' of the bunch (imaginatively named 'Dusty') who loves loud music and eating and laughing a lot... and to whom everyone's reaction is a good-natured shrug and eye-roll. Yawn. You get the idea. The other characters in this determinedly madcap, offbeat group of storm chasers are only slightly less tiresome. Think of the two kids from Jurassic Park grown up and multiplied by five. Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton) are the two main protagonists, married once but now separated and almost-divorced (never mind), and they are drawn together once again by their mutual love of chasing tornadoes. Of course they argue and bicker through most of the film, which is a lot of fun to watch. Not. Jo's a bit of a mental case; her father was sucked up into a twister when she was little and so she's spent her whole life studying the storms. The tragic incident seems also to have left her with something of a death wish. So Bill, the more level-headed of the two, has to cope with not only trying to get the storm-tracking device to work but also keeping Jo from diving headlong into a funnel-cloud in the process. At various points during all this folderol, the tornadoes strike and never has it been such relief to see nature's fury unleashed. One of the best scenes occurs at a movie drive-in, where one hits unexpectedly while the storm team takes in 'The Shining' and the ensuing chaos and destruction is truly breathtaking to behold.

Throughout the flick, it seems like the tornado has a mind of its own, and it competes with the chasers to see which of them can be more bizarre.First of all, which acts more insane? The tornado that wrecks stuff, or the demented tornado nuts that act like they're filming an episode of America's Dumbest Criminals? Also, which is harder on the eardrums? Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, usually dependable actors, just become two oddball freaks with a vendetta, as they try to drown out the volume of the tornado's destruction with their incessant yelling and arguing. The funnel cloud turns around and attacks them in almost every scene, to the point where you count how long it takes the tornado to stage its surprise move. In one predictable case, it goes after a drive-in (which of course is showing a goofy horror movie--what else?), along with a town where the chasers' friend lives. Cornball? Well, there's more. We mustn't forget the nitwit government loser (also a tornado researcher), who plays follow the leader with his nameless goons in black-painted cars. What action/disaster movie would be complete without a government knucklehead who ends up--oh well, you know.The stupidity of the main heroes will amaze you, and the story is too far fetched. However, this movie has effects that are impressive, so the film does end up having some merit. Fast forward to the tornado action scenes for the best enjoyment.

The realism of this movie is no where to be found... It's merely a variation on one of the oldest of ploys...the car chase. In this case, a car chase becomes a tornado chasing the car. Ho hum. I don't know whether the concept of this movie was actually one of Crichton's or de Bont's, but no one who has lived in the MidWest and lived through many nights of terror thinks of them this way. There is genuine drama associated with a tornado...a storm, then usually a quiet in which everything is very calm...no birds sing...no noises except for people who pay no attention...then another storm and the tornado, usually. Sometimes it does progress to the tornado without the calm, but quite ofter it's very quiet and what a dramatic tool for movie making!

Meteorologists have long the bane of the viewing public, a public that often remembers the few missed forecasts than the many right ones, and those meteorologists are the ones who have had to endure the most from the traumatic event that is known as Twister. As a point of disclosure, I am indeed a meteorologist, so perhaps my harsh view on Jan de Bont's film is borne out of the fact that I know that tornadoes tend not to just drop out of the sky on top of a hill in the middle of a forest, nor do they sound like a hungry rhinoceros. Written by Michael Crichton (in a rare lapse of 90s judgment for the Jurassic Park author) and Anne-Marie Martin, Twister follows around an underfunded crew of tornado hunters, lead by Jo (Helen Hunt) and tag-along TV meteorologist Bill (Bill Paxson) as they race against the evil crew of well-funded scientists lead by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) as they both attempt to get their gizmos of data collectors to fly up into a tornado. How do we know Dr. Miller's team are the evil ones? Simple, they all drive black vans. Both teams are trying to figure out the same thing, how to save lives from dangerous tornadoes, but we have to sit there and watch the good guys try to get there first. We also have to sit through the usual divorced couple soap opera, a family member's life in danger situation, and the completely plausible scene where a pickup truck drives through a house. Would a non-meteorologist enjoy this film more than I? Probably, things do get blown up real good, there are flying cows, and perhaps someone will be prompted to learn something about the weather.

Jan De Bont came hot off the heels of a great success with 'Speed', but unfortunately he couldn't make it two hits in a row. It is a shame, because Twister features lots of brilliantly thrilling action set pieces. The tornado ('Tornado' wasn't as striking a title as 'Twister') is one of nature's most extreme expressions of itself, and the scenes with the humans battling against it really do get the adrenaline running. Cows and 'debris', which consists of things such as Combine Harvesters, Petrol trucks, and my personal favourite; an entire house, which our hero's must drive straight through to get to safety, zip past the screen and cause our hero's all manner of trouble. This film has no problem with it's action side, so why doesn't it quite feel right?It's not a problem with casting, as this movie features a fairly good cast. My favourite actor, Bill Paxton heads it. Bill doesn't put in one of his best performances in this movie...actually, some parts are painful to watch, but Bill is definitely a talent and he makes the movie worth seeing. (He was my main reason for seeing it). Starring opposite Paxton is Helen Hunt. Helen would prove that she could act a year after this movie with the brilliant; As Good as it Gets in 1997, and she gives a decent performance here as the typical woman; bitchy, controlling but ultimately lovable. The Dread Pirate Roberts is the villain of the piece, but he doesn't really get a lot of screentime and to be honest, I don't rate him anyway. Jami Gertz is equally unimpressive as Bill's prissy, yet uncharismatic girlfriend; but those two are made up for by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who, despite having an extremely irritating character to work with, puts in a great little turn and steals nearly every scene he's in. So it's not a problem with the casting, so what's the problem?The human drama is the problem. Frankly, it's laughable. It isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script, which is cringe-worthy at times, but it's not even the script that really makes it falter; it's the complete lack of feeling for any of the characters. Of course, the tornado's are the real star of the show, but if you're going to include a human element; you have to at least make it work. The story behind the twisters is that Bill and Helen are married, but awaiting a divorce. Bill has found another woman in the form of Jami Gertz, and wants Helen to sign the divorce papers so he can remarry. However, life is never that simple and Bill and Helen are actually still in love; a love rekindled by a mutual love for the weather condition of the title, of course. The chemistry between these characters is non-existent and it really spoils the movie. I recognise the fact that you can't have a movie without a human element for the audience to relate to; but the one here is terrible. Just...awful.So, do I recommend Twister? Yes, it's action sequences are fantastic and the film is, therefore, well worth 2 hours of anyone's time for those sequences alone. The movie is definitely good entertainment, but it would have been a lot better with a decent script and characters that you can feel for.

Tornadoes cut swathes of devastation through mid-USA every year and television audiences the world over are shocked and yet strangely titillated by the resulting newsreel footage.  So as a film following a group of (fictional) storm chasers as they attempt to scientifically measure a tornado from the inside (with a view to improving the warning systems), Twister has all the ingredients of an extraordinary viewing experience.  It is certainly fast-paced and exciting, but also regrettably formulaic.        Cliches abound - cute dogs saved from imminent peril; chaser crews composed of stereotypical weirdo science nerds; a daring rescue from a destroyed house seconds before it collapses; some unexorcised trauma about a father's death-by-tornado; Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt cheating death innumerable times, even as the bad guys (rival tornado chasers) succumb. . . . . . . . .. The special effects are what save this film from mediocrity.  The tornadoes are frighteningly real and the debris showers (including a cow and a petrol tanker) will have audiences ducking for cover.  And unlike many disaster films that seem to drag as they build to a climax, the tornadoes in Twister appear right from the word go.  Bizarrely the soundtrack to the tornadoes was made by dubbing a camel's groan and slowing it down - resulting in some rather odd sounding twisters.  By the time the camel is finally silenced and the story reaches its predictable conclusion, the cliches and improbabilities threaten to overwhelm, and the film ultimately fails to completely satisfy.

The true genius is often in the background; often brilliance is marked with personality 'disorders.' So here we have the obviously dimwitted Bill and Jo as the leaders and Dusty and his handpicked team doing the real work. The rest are content to stay in the background.Hoffman plays the gay Dusty, who has long had a crush on Bill, the male 'scientist' leader. Through some device (of which we remain ignorant) Bill's wife drove him away from the project. This film is about the machinations of getting Bill back into the team. That the plot revolves around sexual confusion is underscored by Bill's fianc√©, who is a sex therapist (consistently experiencing 'bad communication,' through her cell phone -- rare in those days).(There's a pretty blunt association of the storm with sexual confusion, as a story is told about a drunk, nude Bill confronting the storm.)Dusty plays Prospero, summoning up great storms to coax events along. (Spero means dust in the gaelic Shakespeare parodies in his play.) This Prospero is not always in full control however, and the forces do get out of control at the end, harming the beloved Aunt Meg, (Meg is a sort of likable Caliban, providing nourishment and making mechanical weathercharms.) But by the end Dusty has his double victory Bill is back and the scientific mission (at least the data collection) is done.I know lots of Dustys, and often suspect them of creating to suit themselves that part of nature they study. The self-referential, rather clever element of the story is how Dusty conspires to focus the movie away from him.

Doesn't sound too gripping, does it? OK, let's say that the two lead storm chasers (Hunt and Paxton) are a couple on the edge of a divorce. And there are a team of evil (read corporate) storm chasers with their own probe and jet black trucks. And... and there's an old woman and her dog in peril! Truly, every tension-raising trick is employed by this film - something you might not expect from a Michael Crichton script.The reason this film falls apart (and the reason I'm disappointed, having been under the impression that this was a good movie) is that almost every one of the characters is fundamentally unlikeable. Less than a day later, I can't remember any one of the character's names but I do remember that every one hacked me off in some way. The woman who dedicates her life to chasing storms because her daddy got sucked up in one. Her husband, the ego-driven extreme reporter on the verge of a blossoming TV career. His girlfriend, a shrieking therapist who clearly knows nothing about the man she's about to marry. Each one is so preposterous that the entire credibility of the film is in jeopardy, not that credibility was ever going to be a strong point of this film. How a tornado (a word I never heard being used in the film) can pick up vehicles, livestock and buildings but not our two heroes running away from the scene is just one example of many of where little thought has been put into this movie. Back to the script, guys!Although the makers might take this the wrong way, Twister reminded me of another natural disaster movie with a Hollywood spin on it - Dante's Peak. Both movies are about setting up the scene and then destroying it in a blur of CGI and special effects, characters fleeing for their lives because so much is at stake. Though the tornado does look impressive, the credibility is broken when you see blue sky next to it or nothing blowing in the breeze. Again, this really should have been sorted out by the editors before release. Sadly, the editors can do little with a corny script, cheesy dialogue, laugh-out-loud ridiculous action sequences and plot holes so wide that only a twister could have ripped it apart. But are any natural disaster movies so different from this one? Even the recent Day After Tomorrow seemed to follow the same template as this - throw people with emotional problems into a situation where the elements conspire against them. This film could probably have been made back in the Fifties, though clearly without so much reliance on special effects.I shouldn't have been so disappointed but I was. Twister is a middling mess of a movie at best, the tornado itself given all the attention while the characters bicker and argue over who will save the day. It's predictable and riddled with inconsistencies. Perhaps I should take back my earlier comments about Living TV. OK, Twister wasn't that bad... I'd rate it slightly above Dante's Peak but that ain't a ringing endorsment. Twister ruffles your hair, rather than blowing you away but at least it will amuse your parents for a while.

It's a light-hearted, action-packed, special effects dominated extravaganza with a great cast. It's about as intellectually deep as an episode of Sesame Street, and the highlights involve a massive force of nature demolishing the property of often nameless, faceless victims. There is little in the way of human pain or suffering so people are not likely to leave the theater depressed. These attributes helped this film make a king's ransom back in 1996. Unfortunately, now that the small screen is the only place to view it, this film's weaknesses are particularly glaring.The story involves two rival teams of storm chasers. One is a motley crew of Bohemian types who are led by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. The other crew is led by Cary Elwes. They drive black SUVs and work for corporate interests. Guess which team are the bad guys. Both teams have similar machines that they plan to release into the tornadoes to recover as much data as possible about the inner wind currents and whatnot. Each team spends the entire film tearing up the Oklahoma countryside and trying to guess where and when the biggest storms will form. It looks pretty good on a big screen, but the spectacle is really lost on the ol' tube at home. The film is predictable beyond belief, but if there's nothing else on it won't kill you to watch a few minutes until something interesting comes on another channel.Those of us who like to critically examine the films we watch are left to ponder such trivial issues as.......How much of the dialog was actually written down? With so many continuity errors, was there a script supervisor? I would have suggested Martin Kitrosser....What exactly are the potential commercial uses for tornadoes? Why would corporate interests send out a team of chasers? Does Phillip Seymour Hoffman look back at his work in this film with a sense of pride? Why did the tornado have to wreck the drive-in screen that was showing a great movie like The Shining? Why were Pepsi cans the only kind they could find when they needed a bunch of cans?

That's common sense; anyone who does, well, I feel sorry for them. In Twister, Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it's dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue (thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a co-author, along with wife Anne-Marie Martin) and sub-par acting. Sure, a number of liberties are also taken with tornadoes (fingers of God - one character calls them), but what do you expect from a film directed by Speed Jan de Bont?And lastly, who goes to see movies like this for scientific accuracy? I remember watching it with a friend and giving him a nasty tongue-lashing afterwards for his redundant pointing out of the various scientific and factual inaccuracies that abound in it (which he told me had each been identified by his science teacher - go figure). I snapped back, Dude, chill out. It's just a movie. Who cares if this does or doesn't happen, or tornadoes don't suck like that. I basically told him to get a grip.Nature is unrepentant in its desire to test human will to withstand her destructive forces. I showered praise on Twister for capturing that and making sure its human characters realize it. I make these statements because Twister is quite terrifying in its scenes of tornadoes blazing paths of destruction, and this is what people tend to miss when watching it. I know I'm sure to run into flak because of it but, what am I going to do *shrugs shoulders*?As the film opens on the plains of Oklahoma's Tornado Alley, the National Weather Service is tracking several storm systems that if they were to merge any time soon, they could see a record outbreak of violent, tornado-producing severe weather. Next, we're introduced to meteorologist and recent divorc√©e Bill (Bill Paxton) and fianc√©e Melissa (Jami Gertz) - She's a reproductive therapist, he reassures us, after Bill is asked if she is HIS therapist. Melissa isn't too keen on the idea of storm chasing, which poses a problem for them both, but for Bill it was always the thrill of the hunt, and we know he's not going to pass the opportunity to get back in the mode of things.We then arrive at a field where we meet the storm chasers, led by Bill's tough ex and fellow meteorologist Jo (Helen Hunt), who has somehow mysteriously forgotten to sign her name to the last page of the divorce papers (she still loves him). When asked if he's back by the various supporting players, he emphatically denies he has returned to his field of expertise. But it turns out, however, that before their marriage went to hell, they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm system-tracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.DOROTHY (real original), the miracle device, a package that contains hundreds of little sensors, could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado's inner-workings and with such knowledge now available, they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is, however, they have to wait until a twister spawns, place Dorothy in its damage path (or Suck Zone), and then run like hell. The action begins when they're forced to take off to chase after the storm, and it's about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects, peril, and destruction.Saying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see Jurassic Park (1993) for the performances - understatement - get real. It's easy for any casual movie-goer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story, but come on, it's a roller coaster film. I'm not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don't go to see movies like this for Oscar-winning actors or plot. I've always liked Bill Paxton (who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood), and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here, his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it thinks, and in essence he's a human barometer (even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs).The writing is substandard, including Jo's barely-hinted upon obsession with chasing the storm (as a child, she saw her dad killed by a monster F5), Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg (who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes), the underdeveloped storm chasing team (some of whom are more colorful than others, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty), and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporate-sponsored rival who stole Bill's invention. But this isn't too glaring a problem, if you're a hard-a** for art in cinema and came to Twister expecting it. You'll see plenty scenes of destruction (just wait for the drive-in showing The Shining), and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.Lastly, I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from Twister. I've never seen one and I don't want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes; in northern Virginia, where I live, we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters, but my grandparents, who live close to me, were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.Twister isn't a failure; it's a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hard-pressing of art, turn off your brain, and enjoy (but you should still watch out for those flying cows, tanker trucks, and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado's winds); it's that simple.7/10 "},{"Title":"Every bit as realistic as Solarbabies","Date":"18 May 1999","Score":"34 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  I'm a tornado chaser.  The movie has portrayed us as a bunch of yahoo cowboys who have no concept of danger. We do not 1) go bouncing across fields and through ditches chasing tornadoes 2) get hit by a tornado, watch our truck slam to the ground, and calmly commandeer another truck and keep chasing. We go home and change our underwear if we ever get hit. 3) We don't get hit because we're not stupid enough to drive up to a tornado 4) We don't find a tornado every 20 minutes.  Finding one tornado in 3 weeks of chasing is getting pretty lucky. 5) We don't yell and whoop and holler when we get hit by two tornadoes. We go home and change our underwear again, and give up chasing because we're too stupid to chase if we get hit twice in one day. 6) In the scene where Bill was dropping grass leaves to determine where the tornado is  The clouds being shown were from an actual tornado chase video. It was a classic, very promising mesocyclone. In this situation, we would be going ballistic and scrambling to go after it, not standing around smelling dirt and commenting it's really talkin' 7) We can't tell when and where a tornado will be by smelling dirt. 8) We can't tell when and where a tornado will be by looking at grass stems. 9) We don't stop in the middle of a chase for steak and eggs at Aunt Meg's. 10) Tornadoes do not growl like a lion 11) We don't have love-interest arguments while a tornado is bearing down on us 12) DOROTHY is actually a rip off of a real tornado package developed in the 70's by the National Severe Storms Lab, called TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory) 13) In a real chase team, Dusty would be shot. 14) There are no evil chasers.  We don't compete against each other, and we don't get corporate sponsorship. 15) We don't go busting through cornfields and almost cause wrecks by blasting out onto a highway. 17) We don't listen to bopping music when we're chasing a tornado.  We listen to AM radio (it transmits lightening flashes), scanners, CB's, and HAM radios (usually all at the same time)   Some of us have TV's in our cars to tune in local weather channels too. 18) We don't run in to barns for shelter from a tornado. We know they'll be blown away. 19) a belt will not hold us down in an F5 20) even if it did, we'd be killed by flying debris.  F5's can lift semitrucks and hurl them around at around 100mph.

This is the kind of movie that you will either like as a guilty pleasure or not care for at all. Me personally? I enjoyed it, but again, as a guilty pleasure.The movie stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as storm chasers who are the verge of finalizing their divorce until a new invention that started when they were married finally starts to come through and they find themselves teamed up again. Paxton's fianc√©e, played by Jami Gertz, joins their enigmatic group as they race to deploy the new invention before a rival group in black cars and backed up 'corporate sponsors' can do the same thing. And they go into and out of one cyclonic storm after another.The thing that attracted audience members to Twister were the great special effects and they are great. Although it is a shame to admit that Twister is another example of Hollywood now taking the assumption that if you lure the audience member with the best thing of a movie, that that's all they're going to want from it, whereas an audience would really be interested if they were lured into a big special effects movie, only to discover that there's also a fresh, exciting story that envelops and surpasses it. And the story is the biggest complaint that I have for Twister. The marriage-divorce scenario is completely predictable as to how it's all going to resolve. And the antagonists of the movie, led by Cary Elwes, are two-dimensional and come straight out of page one on the book of movie clich√©s. They talk big and smart, they have high-tech gear, they drive in black cars, have corporate sponsors, want lots of money, and they're facing down the little guys. The human story did not have me interested.So perhaps it is a good thing that the movie does throw you one tornado after another because the special effects are the best thing in the movie. The combination of computer graphics and props and simulations work brilliantly, even though it is hard to believe that the characters can survive one storm after another so many times. But the tornadoes are terrific and they keep coming on at you every twenty minutes or so for two hours. Now this can be a little tiresome, but Twister does stop itself just in time before it completely overstays its welcome.In the end, it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. Again, this is the film that one will either like as a guilty pleasure, like me, or you won't care for it at all. And even if you do like the movie, there is still one big lapse in the whole thing that you realize at the end. If tornadoes really did show up as often as they do in the movie in the same general area, there would be nothing left standing in the Midwest anymore. It would all be leveled.

Kudos to the brilliant visuals thanks again to the genius of Industrial Light and Magic.Some truly amazing and catch your breath thrills best bits include the destruction of a barn and silo as Hunt and Paxton race side by side in their truck, an 'Oz'-like moment of a house being plopped down (and running the truck through the house!), and arguably the coolest sequence &#150; the drive-in demolition with 'The Shining' onscreen.

When I first watched it, I was expecting excitement and edge-of-your-seat action and was sorely disappointed when I was bored out of my mind. The few would-be tense scenes are so predictable (Really, did you honestly think are going to kill off someone like Helen Hunt?). The actors/actresses are, for the most part, top-notch. I've always liked Bill Paxton, and Helen Hunt is very likeable. But the supporting cast is extremely annoying and throughout the entire two hours, I was wishing they would get sucked away into oblivion by the twister. Also to fault is the lack of reality. I won't give the ending away, but when you see it, you'll laugh at how illogical it is. Twister is, overall, one of those movies that most people have forgotten about by now.

The plot isn't particularly well-developed, and some of the characters are one-dimensional(eg. Melissa being a pretty wobbly leg in the love triangle, it being obvious from the get-go that she's a flimsy plot device). I didn't expect Terminator to be Ben-Hur, either.Second This movie is not a documentary about tornadoes, so all the criticism about fudged details concerning storm-chasers and miscellaneous meteorology seems a tad shrill. No, tornadoes don't usually come in herds, one right after another, but the film does give us several scenes where it says plainly that this situation is unprecedented. In order to tell an entertaining story (not a documentary), many characteristics of 1) meteorologists, 2) grad students, 3) storm chasers, 4) storms etc. are exaggerated. It's called fiction.Third To all those who dislike the quantity of screen time devoted to tornadoes in this film, I have only to say Well, the title IS 'Twister', what did you expect?Now, the good news...Everybody is entitled to their opinion, and my opinion is that this movie accomplishes it's goal to be an entertaining thrill ride with some interesting technical info thrown in as a bonus. It's a spectacle with great CGI and a super score by M. Mancina. Now, if you watch TLC once in awhile, you will learn the following 1) people do in fact get close to tornadoes (not on purpose). Some die, some don't and have some pretty amazing stories to tell. 2) The storm chasers in the movie appear to be a hybrid of amateur chasers and the VORTEX chase team (academic crowd), and it makes a colorful blend.One of our fellow reviewers noted that the story seems to be a retelling of Moby Dick with Jo as Ahab. I would also add that it is a hero tale a la Joseph Campbell. The hero is split into two persons (Bill and Jo), but the gist is the same. The hero has a quest (kill the dragon), must overcome obstacles, has a sage old advisor (Aunt Meg), and must give up his most prized possession (his new truck) to achieve his goal. I'm sure there's more, but that's the Cliff Notes version.The folks who don't like this film seem to focus on particular details (such as not liking Dusty). The folks who like this film either just enjoyed the ride, or picked up on the elements that make this a classic, if simple, archetypal tale.As for me, I've worked in some crazy, dangerous situations and know people like almost every character in the film (except the flimsy Melissa and Jonas), and enjoyed being there with them as the story rolled along.Both thumbs up.

For the next 6 months, all my parents heard was how much I was into weather because of this movie. I read countless books on weather development, and cold fronts, and such. I am totally fascinated by weather, and it's all because of Twister. So critiscize this movie if you want to, but I will never ever forget what a thrilling experience it was the first time I saw this movie on the big screen (and the 5th and 6th time as well!) I have been praying for nearly two and a half years now for a sequel, and maybe someday I'll get my wish!

No, the acting was not first-rate (though this was the fault of the script not the actors), but I have seen worse in other action movies (check out the god-awful Godzilla if you can stand it). Come on, people, this is an *action* movie! It's not *supposed* to be good art! It's a disaster movie that promises thrills and great SFX, and does more than delivers. The tornado sequences are believable, terrifying--and beautiful. If you want a great love story, see The English Patient. If you want a social commentary, see The Last Days of Disco. If you want well-developed characters, *don't* see an action picture! The main character, of course, is the tornado. The various plot devices are there as a backdrop. I think people are taking it all too seriously. Lighten up and just try to enjoy it. At least  Twister isn't gory or steeped in gratuitous violence, like Independence Day, a movie I totally despised.

The last straw for me -- and yes, I stayed to the bitter end -- was the final F-5. And this is a mega spoiler.The guy and gal couldn't get out of the way of the twister so they tied themselves to a pole, in a barn I recall. The high winds sent barn things all around them, which they dodged. Then, the tornado struck the building, it was sucked and torn apart, and they could look way up into the heart of the funnel cloud. And, of course, they both survived to live happily ever after.Oh, get real! Nobody could survive an F-5 under those circumstances. And if one did pass either through them or close by, they'd be cut to shreds by all the debris being hurled around by those ultra-high winds.

It's Only Meant To Be Popcorn Fun.","Date":"19 September 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" I'm surprised that I actually did just watch this movie today. I had seen it countless times when I was younger courtesy of my Geography class and I always thought that I wouldn't bother viewing it again. However, something drew me to it and I ended up viewing Twister again. I can't make any more conclusions besides the ones I had already drawn from previous viewings and I know that this movie has been criticized for an over-reliance on effects and a lacking of substance. I'd mostly agree to this, but I don't really see any enormous issues in it. It's merely designed to be a piece of fun and that it certainly is.The story goes as follows. Bill Harding is a TV Weatherman looking for his distant wife, Jo with the intention of having her sign divorce papers so he can marry his girlfriend, Melissa. Upon meeting with her, he is caught up in an investigation of a series of tornadoes across the state of Oklahoma involving revolutionary equipment that is being used to study tornadoes in a way that has never been possible. The movie then explores a series of violent tornadoes as well as the realization that Bill and Jo have about their relationship.Even though the film was made in 1996 and they may be regarded as outdated by today's standards, I think that the special effects in Twister are wonderful. It is true that there is an over-reliance on them and they certainly do get in the way of plot however I do admit that they were indeed really fun to watch and the action scenes never really felt drawn out to me (a mistake that seems to be very common in poorer action films).The acting is alright. Bill Paxton's performance is rather flat. Helen Hunt I feel did a good job and her character, Jo is certainly the most fleshed out character in the movie. Jamie Gertz was fine as Melissa, but the character has very little purpose and it wouldn't make a huge difference if she was cut out altogether. Cary Elwes' performance as Jonas isn't too great as his accent isn't very strong and its hard to indicate what specific accent he's trying to put on. It sounds very Southern, but there's a mixture of something else in there. Besides these, who couldn't love the irritating yet entertaining character, Dusty, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The guy is so unusual and the reasons for his apeish behaviour is totally unexplained, but what can I say? He's great comedic relief.This film has been heavily criticized for its lack of character and story development as well as an over-reliance on special effects being the only reason it was such a huge hit back in 1996. These complaints are indeed true, but I feel that people overestimated what the film would be like based on the budget and hence came out disappointed. People need to learn to not believe the hype when it comes to profits. They are no indicator for quality. Despite this, it's still a really fun movie.Twister isn't perfect and is faulted, sometimes greatly so. However it does pass as a nice piece of action filmmaking that you'd enjoy for 100 minutes provided that you lighten up and prepare to just have fun and not expect something stimulating for the brain. It's a great movie and I'm standing by my opinion.7/10 "},{"Title":"Great Movie!!!!","Date":"22 May 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" I would give this movie a 9, but I have to save that for the BEST films.

They don't put any effort into making them and the graphics are horrible. Twister, on the other hand, is the complete opposite of that. The best tornado film I have ever seen. The casting is great, I love all the actors they have put together in this film. I would be on Jo and Bill's team any day, especially since Dusty is in it. The storyline is great and they picked a great spot to film the movie. It takes place in Oklahoma but was actually filmed in Iowa. Who knew Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt would make a great team together.I don't know why it is that good movies get bad reviews, 1990 classics such as Twister, Titanic and Armageddon. Critics can't tell the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. They watch it once, write a review and then advise people not to waste money on it if it's no good. Well, I'll tell you that people have their own opinions and if they happen to like the movie then they like it. Every single person is different and have their own views on a movie. Twister just happens to be one of the best movies ever made, and one of the only movies I really enjoy. I watch it all the time and each time never seems to bore me for one minute.My interest for tornadoes started with this movie and since then I have learned so much about real life tornadoes in shows like Storm Chasers and Angry Planet. I have a passion for tornadoes and would love to study them in a future career. The end of Twister is unbelievable, one of the best scenes in movie history. The huge F5 tornado, also aka. The Finger of God. The scene when Jo and Bill come outside of the barn and see this huge tornado behind them is so cool. It always gives me the chills. The graphics couldn't get any better. It's perfect. I give credit to whoever did the graphics.Jan De Bont needs to get some facts straight about tornadoes before approaching it into a movie but he did do a really good job and with the help of Steven Spielberg, it makes Twister so much better.Twister is my second favorite movie (after Titanic) and have seen it countless numbers of times, I've completely lost track.

Most movies just naturally play better on the big screen, with an expensive sound system and an excited audience, and TWISTER just isn't the same experience as it was eight years ago.  The first and most obvious problem is that an effects-driven movie just isn't made for the small screen, so those amazing twisters aren't nearly as scary without the theater experience. Another problem with the CGI (admittedly ground-breaking for its time) is that it's rather commonplace now. How did a movie like TWISTER, with paper-thin characters and almost zero plot, make over $240 million?  You need to remember that 95/96 was the period when CGI first became readily available and abundant, to all of the major studios. This was the period when otherwise mediocre films like ID4 and ERASER made huge grosses on the stregth of special effecs that couldn't have been imagined before CGI... CGI was still fresh and exciting.  Eight years later, however, CGI is everywhere, so over-stuffed and jam-packed into garbage like THE MUMMY and VAN HELSING that these so-called effects just aren't that special anymore.

It is made to appeal to foreign markets and the young and/or stupid American market (a large market indeed).In my opinion, the release of Twister in 1996 marked a turning point in Hollywood. It became apparent to movie makers that it really didn't matter if the dialogue was brainless or the plot was full of holes. It didn't matter if the actors could act or the script was convincing. What mattered was how loud and violent a movie could be. We in America love our violence and it translates well into any language. Since foreign markets make up a large percentage of a film's profits, it just makes sense to create long action sequences with as little conversation (or plot) as possible. In fact, Twister would have been improved had there been no discourse at all &#150; just people fleeing from the hundreds of tornado's that terrorize the American Midwest everyday. I can't wait for Twister 2.

It was predictable, but original (how many feature length films involve tornadoes throughout?) and exciting. It had clich√©d characters, but it had very good acting (Hunt) and believable actions. It had the typical love triangle you'll see in the majority of disaster movies but it put a, well, twist that it was finally the girl (Hunt) chasing the boy (Paxton.) &#x96; That last one I loved the most. FINALLY, the girl was at fault as males always seem to be the wrong ones in movies.I absolutely suspended my disbelief (and knowledge as I'm not a storm chaser, nor have little to zero knowledge on the subject) for Twister. I just sat back and enjoyed, as I do for a lot of disaster movies. (SEE Dante's Peak.) It helps that Hunt's performance was convincing, had depth and interesting. Also, the CGI was well done (for the most part) and believable. Again, I'm not a storm chaser or meteorologist, so I have no idea how many they would just stumble upon, though I would have my suspicions it seriously wouldn't be this many. (ADD dramatic effect.)Bill (Paxton) left his storm chasing life, crew and wife, Jo (Hunt) a while back and (literally) settled for a quieter weatherman's life with therapist, Dr. Reeves (Gertz.) It's barely a coincidence that he shows up with the divorce papers for Jo who decisively left a signature blank on the last page at the peak of the largest (to date) outbreak of tornadoes. Part chasing her with Dr. Reeves in tow, part chasing the twisters is pretty much the rest of the drama. (Aside from him learning where he needs to be, Jo getting over childhood fears and a loved one & dog in trouble, that is.) They moved fairly quickly onto what the movie really drew the audiences in, obviously multiple twisters and more obviously, they got progressively worse, or F1-F5s, until the climax.To me, despite the fact it's hard to believe all these storms were perfectly places all but directly in their paths, it's a lot more believable than all the preposterous and simultaneous events in 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. It's just a fun show. They throw in comedy (Cow!) and fully uses the always impressive character actor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

Not many people really hate this movie with a passion, they just found it kind of stupid or boring. This movie was actually the first movie I have saw on the big screen. I was three and don't remember it, so I'm just hoping my dad didn't lie to me, so because it was my first big screen movie, I may be a little biased.Basically every problem with this movie can be summed upped with two things. The script is so ridicuously clich√©, with it's generic characters and romance, and it's scientifically inaccurate, but not isultingly inaccurate. Also it can be boring in a few places, not too many, but the disaster scenes are a little tame compared to disaster scenes we see today.But the special effects actually hold up pretty well. I say that the twisters in this movie actually look better than the twisters in the Day after Tomorrow. The acting is really good for this kind of movie, and make some really likable characters, as generic as they are. Dusty's pretty funny, I guess it's hard not to like someone who's crazy over tornadoes. The villain is such a douchebag that you can't wait for him to get his due. But the one thing I really liked is that the movie didn't villify Melissa. Think about it, they could have made her a horrible person that hated every member of the team, and maybe even gave away secrets to Jonas, but she didn't.Twister is another example of a flawed but fun disaster movie. Yes it's clich√©, yes it's stupid, but it's fun. I know I say that a lot, but this really does have it's moments.

It was intended to be a summer blockbuster put your brain on hold action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was Independence Day, which is an unwatchable hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchable hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of normal family life by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her in the field as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialog with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.The current rating of 6/10 is probably correct if you are comparing Twister with Casablanca. If you judge it as an action film against other action films, I'd say it's probably more of a 7 out of 10.

It did have exciting parts and the suspense at times is what pushed it from being a seven as opposed to a six for me. I thought the device being named dorothy was rather cute. However, when I first saw this as a kid, I wished that instead of them all being named dorothy they named each one a separate Wizard of Oz character. The special effects were quite good and would probably be the most appealing part of the movie. As far as a movie about tornado chasers goes, they managed to make it more interesting than I thought a movie on said subject might be able to be. I can't say that I am a Helen Hunt fan and wished they might have used someone else, but that is a very minor observation.This movie is good for a rainy day with nothing to do.

So I guess the movie-going audiences are due for a disaster movie about one of nature's deadliest disasters. TWISTER is that movie. It isn't exactly strong in the plot department and neither does it contain convincing characters, but with some neat CGI special effects popularized by JURASSIC PARK and some thrilling action scenes, TWISTER became one of the biggest hits of the 90's, and it's not so hard to see how fun this movie is.The plot is exactly what you've come to expect from a screenplay co-written by Michael Crichton. The man wrote the novel JURASSIC PARK, along with the film's screenplay, so there really isn't any meat on the bones. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton is a bunch of tornado chasers and a husband-and-wife team on the verge of divorce. But it's really all about the tornadoes. They chase them for the greater majority of the film so they can insert an advanced tornado measuring device that will make a more advanced warning system for upcoming disasters. Once again, Crichton has more interest in developing his neat gizmos than he does with his characters. The subplot involving Paxton trying to divorce ex-wife Hunt so he can marry his grating girlfriend Jami Gertz is not more than just filler.But all this doesn't matter. The film is, above all, fun and that's what made it such a huge hit. The effects are still awesome and the action scenes will take your breath away the first time you see it, and maybe a few viewings later. Director Jan DeBont directed SPEED, and he brings the same amount of skillfulness and thrills to TWISTER. While it's not as good as that movie, both films boast just about the same elements You've seen it all before, but not with the same amount of thrills and excitement.

Yes Twister's plot lacks depth, foundation and any real substance, but director Jan De Bont of all people is well aware of this fact, and so concentrates on the well constructed action sequences and the talents of Industrial Light and Magic, who have produced some spectacular computer animated effects.The story concerns a group of thrill seekers who chase tornadoes for the pure adrenalin rush, and the science of course. Ex-chaser Bill (Bill Paxton) returns to Tornado Alley in Oklahoma to finalise his recent divorce form Jo (Helen Hunt) and gets caught up in the excitement of the hunt once again.Performances from the two leads are neither here nor there (support likewise), but no classic thesping is really required. Cary Elwes plays another one dimensional bad guy, as he did in the mediocre Days of Thunder The music is lively and the cinematography (form Jack N. Green) is fast paced and eye-catching, both of course taking second place to the awesome effects.De Bont is no miser when it comes to entertainment value (eg Speed), and so we get plenty of Twister action, each encounter being bigger and more exciting than the last. If visual brilliance is what you're looking for, then this film, a pure knockout, is exactly what the doctor ordered.

Death, defeat, the unknown, commitment, danger, the gaping maw of nature's wrath, Cary Elwes and his corporate sponsors...and sure, tornadoes, if you want to be all surface about it. But really, Twister is about fear, and how people choose to deal with it. The uptight girlfriend flees, while the weatherman can't resist his past life as tornado chaser, and lover of the heroine, tornado-obsessed Helen Hunt, who has formed her life around trying to make sure that no other little girls will have to live in fear of their father getting sucked away while he tries to hold the storm cellar door closed.To do this, she forms a motley crew of character actors (Twister does for the motley tech crew what Die Hard did for the action hero) who are as crazy and thrill-obsessed as her, drives away her dirt-smelling Bill Paxton husband and then steals him back from panicky reproductive therapist Jamie Gertz, drives multiple trucks into the heart of a tornado, and relives the formative experience of her life repeatedly in the quest to finally kick nature in the cojones.The scientific accuracy of the tornadoes is completely irrelevant - they aren't real-life tornadoes, they are a symbol for the ultimate threat, the unknowable void. Do tornadoes work just like they do in the movie? I don't know - most of the tornadoes I've seen up close are in my imagination, or as portrayed by someone else's. And that's the point of tornadoes in Twister, or the disaster in any natural disaster movie. These are the ultimate in devastation - the finger of God, as said in the movie - and as such they represent our fear of being at our weakest and most vulnerable state. (Case in point Helen' Hunt's character, young version.) I think this theme is executed fairly well considering that it's in the context of a big-budget effects thriller. Audiences may not be thinking all this stuff over - and certainly the movie doesn't say much if any of this stuff explicitly - but I think they feel it, and that's why people feel drawn to watch this movie repeatedly, despite its essentially basic and predictable nature. Would you dive into the thrashing pit in order to help save others from future devastation? How would it feel to have Mother Nature literally rip your father from your life...and then continue to stalk those you know and love with the same threat? Would you fight back? Would you give your life to fight back? If you did, you'd be well-put to get yourself a classic nutty motley tech crew headed up by Philip Dusty Barnburner Seymour Hoffman. Though he probably fetches a slightly higher wage these days.The movie has imperfections - the movie's own physics seems cheated to the point of distraction a couple times, and there's at least one action from our heroes which seemed reckless toward others (I like to knock before I drive through someone's house.) But Twister manages to create an effectively threatening villain in an ambitious visual rendering of the classic man vs. nature story. I'm not sure what more we should hope to expect from a movie about tornadoes.

From the dramatic opening, the film funnily moves through different levels of tornadoes as the drama is amped up.We see storms from F-1 all the way through the terrifying, mile-wide and jaw dropping F-5 twister at the climax, and the whole time you'll just be telling yourself I can't believe that's not real. How did they do that? It's so fun to watch today and still be amazed by this thriller. Edited nicely and moving at a fast pace, Twister is always a great, fun popcorn thriller.

Which is fine, because on those terms it works very well.Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) leads a team of storm chasers across sun-drenched Oklahoma, trying to find the perfect tornado to track. Storm clouds of another kind arrive when her separated husband and tornado-chasing partner, Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), shows up with his fianc√©e and some divorce papers for Jo to sign. But Jo is as obsessed with keeping her marriage as she is with the tornadoes' terrible majesty.Twister is, before all else, a fast-moving disaster movie, squeezing in no less than five big tornado encounters and enough CGI to whet the folks at Industral Light & Magic for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. A decade ago, it was the first film released on DVD, and probably sold a lot of those newfangled gizmos with its amazing sound and visuals.But the film keeps us involved even during the quieter periods with excellent pacing by director Jan De Bont; a clever musical score that veers from Copeland to Wagner to late-period Van Halen depending on what's going on; and solid teamwork by Hunt and Paxton. Both can be off-putting in other roles, but here their intensity and humor blend just so to make us care about them, Hunt especially. You're all crazy, says the fianc√©e, Melissa (Jami Gertz), and she's the craziest one of all.Gertz does a good job, too, providing us with an outsider to channel the storm-chasers' world while doing double duty as comic relief. When you used to tell me you chased tornadoes, deep down I thought it was a metaphor, she tells Bill. You emphasize with Melissa rather than resent her, a sign of the film's depth.That depth is not always apparent. A rival storm chaser, Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), is set up as an unconvincing villain. He went out and got himself a lot of corporate sponsors, is how Bill expresses his contempt, a weird point to make in a film that later asks us to believe that the only soda cans in Oklahoma have shiny Pepsi logos.But all is forgiven when the tornadoes come. Today those special effects still hold up, delivered as they are with style and verve. Watching a farm and silo literally dissolve into static while Jo and Bill race past in their jeep, the silo's roof flying off like a Frisbee and narrowly missing them, is a definite suck zone for us the audience.Did anyone else seeing this picture in 1996 realize that none of the principal cast members would be A-listers a decade later, with the exception of that annoying laughing guy with the freckles and red hair? Maybe it's that Oscar, or just being more used to his outsized performance style, but Philip Seymour Hoffman's Dusty doesn't seem as obnoxious as he did on the big screen Imminent rue-age! The Extreme!But the tornadoes remain every bit as powerful as I remember from the big screen, and they still make for a fine cinematic thrill ride.

Twister has a ride there. And even though the ride is only there because Twister's huge explosions and scenes of chaos would work well at a theme park and frighten the nippers, it's still not a bad film. None of the science makes sense, and even though the invention that our main characters have built is interesting and easy to understand, it isn't the most exciting of things, and the end does get a bit silly - crushed up Coke cans being used as probes, anyone? But as I've said, most people care about it for the explosions only. And Twister sure delivers on the action. The start of the film is brilliantly intense (if a bit silly) - and is explained to us later in the film in a highly emotional scene - it has a link to one of the main characters. And that is the only scene which tries for sentimentality - which is good, because if the whole film tried to be a gory tear-fest (*cough*Saving Private Ryan*cough*), it would have been ruined. Character development is tried upon, but you won't really care about any of the characters by the end - you'll only want to see them going through hellish weather anyway. Some of it is breathtaking and fabulously done - take the scene where the main character scientist guy (I've forgotten his name - that's how much the action rams the characters out of your mind) and his girlfriend (forgotten her name too - and I'm not even sure if she's actually his girlfriend) have to drive straight through a house which has landed in the middle of the road (yes, it really did happen) - and some of it is a bit silly, like the cow flying through the air (this could happen in real life, but not with the results shown), but it is all action-packed and very fun, even if not that environmentally conscious. But things have changed a lot in the past 11 years. Although if this film is anything to go by, films haven't changed much.

The contraption was intended to be put into a path of a live tornado so when it goes up, it will open up hundreds of sensors that will be released and will detect several factors in the twister--that had never been done by meteorologists or scientists before. Overall, Dorothy's purpose is to find the exact wind speeds not only in the area of the tornado, but every single part of it---from the top to the bottom, and along the sides and the sides near it.Besides the Dorothy contraption, there were several other good parts in TwisterThe scene involving the tornado's near hit on a drive-in movie theater in the evening was also good. Looks like the winds depicted during the near-strike on the drive-in reached about 110 to 130 mph.The part when the red truck tries to outrun two F2 twisters---but can't escape them---and the truck gets embedded into the tornado---had good camera work as well. You actually hope that you never run into this situation--even as a storm chaser.The shocking part was the scene involving the fictional town of Wakita, which was purposely torn up to re-enact a damage a tornado of F3 to F4 can do. The storm-chasers come to Wakita, informed that a tornado was heading towards the town...but it was too late (the tornado went too fast for them)....and the only good thing was to save their friend in Wakita, Meg, a senior citizen--before her tornado-struck house caves in. And they do save her.The special effects re-enacting the dangerous twisters on land were exciting enough--from a gasoline truck on a road picked up in the air, twisting while in the air, and dropping onto the road in an exploding fireball---to a barn being broken up into thousands of flying splinters of wood.But overall, the final part when the last of the 4 Dorothy contraptions finally goes into the last twister brings the greatest release of Helen Hunt---a release in the form of great relief.

It is populated entirely by over-the-top personalities, who have interesting enough traits that, though not ever fully realized as characters, we still enjoy the time we spend with them. This could not be said for, say, Ethan Hunt, of Mission Impossible. (I still enjoy that franchise, but that is another article altogether. On a totally random sidenote, Philip Seymour Hoffman, villain in the most recent MI flick, appears in this film, which opened in direct competition to the first MI. It's good to see that Tom Cruise doesn't hold that kind of grudge, at least.) The entire movie is set up with a smile, so when it finally dives headlong into silliness, we realize that it is ultimately laughing at itself, and that it's okay to join in.And besides, any movie that understands the innate humor of cows can't be all bad.

There is very little reality in this movie. The science of Tornadoes is very complex and not yet well understood, but to the best of my knowledge, the premise of adding a giant chunk of debris to a tornado in the form of a can of sensors is not only dangerous, but with everything else in there, I don't think it's a good idea. And another interesting point, you can't identify an F5 before it happens - we rate storms based on their damage, not on Doppler wind speeds... And with all that, it's still a Cult classic among my friends - when we need a good laugh, we almost always bust out lines from this movie. So as long as you don't buy the science as reality (not that movies are ever a good reference for reality), it's good stuff.

It opens with Bill Paxton and his bride-to-be going to visit his former wife and her tornado chasing crew. He is about to be divorced and needs her to sign the papers.Well it doesn't take long before Paxton's character is swept back up into the world of the tornado chasers. REAL tornado chasing is nothing like what these people do, but no one's gonna want to see a movie where they drive around bored for weeks until they find a live tornado. The movie takes the usual twists (har har) as the love tension between Hunt and Paxton builds back up.The really disappointing and stupid part of this movie is the ending. Trying to elude an F5 tornado (the strongest type of tornado known), they hide out in a rickety farmhouse and eventually end up tied by a leather belt to some well pipes that go deep underground. Paxton is correct, the pipes go deep in the ground and probably will not be ripped out. However, the flying debris and winds would've left two bloody belted-down meat sacks where Hunt and Paxton were once strapped in. They would've been shredded, no doubt.Other than the ridiculous ending (and the completely stupid addition of Cary Elwes as the bad tornado chaser - I mean, c'mon. A BAD guy? That's so STUPID) this movie will at least keep your attention. Popcorn fare, to be sure.

To think there is a force out in the world that can do that much damage is unbelievable. Twister is a movie about a man named Bill (Bill Paxton) and a woman named Joe (Helen Hunt) who married and started an organization to begin tracking tornadoes. However, Bill and Joe separated, and she continued tracking with the remainder of her crew. Bill and Joe soon come face to face to sign the remaining divorce papers and begin a whole new adventure. Joe has created a machine known as Dorothy, one of Bill's earlier designs. Bill then decides to tag along with them for one day to see if the design works. Will Dorothy work or fail them all for good? Movies come and go, but I think Twister is here to stay. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched this movie. However, I can tell you that it has never lost my attention. The special effects were so realistic for its time. Twister is by far the best tornado movie I have ever seen. Twister is not only a movie of survival of the fittest, but also of a relationship struggling to be whole once more.

This is one film that puts you someplace that nobody ever should be, and does it with spectacular success and sound effects that will make the hair climb stand up on your back.There are a few somewhat corny parts to this film, but they are easily forgiven and forgotten.

The fact that I believe this to be the exception rather than the rule provides scant comfort. Films such as the oft-trashed Armageddon may be said by some to insult the intelligence, but at least the story attempts to move forward a touch, to provide the characters with a different and more challenging obstacle to their quest. Twister does none of this, and as a result, it blows heartily (Arrrgh, I shall be condemned to 'pun hell' for evermore!)It's not the cardboard script and variously bad acting that makes Twister so painful an experience (Lord knows it didn't hurt Jurassic Park too much...!) Rather, its the complete lack of imagination displayed by the film-makers. Whatever its faults, JP certainly had THAT quality in abundance; and a sobering but thoroughly true fact Dinosaurs are a heck of a lot more interesting to look at than tornados.By lack of imagination I mean the deficiency that, when pondering what to do to make the film more interesting for the audience, comes up with this formula Tornado (pretty darn exciting), followed by BIGGER tornado (OK I suppose, but we've seen this already...) followed by EVEN BIGGER tornado (Yawn)...This is a problem that hampers a lot of disaster films, sooner or later overexposure to said 'disaster' leaves us disinterested. So usually, film-makers try to combat this by having the characters respond to the perils they face in a vaguely interesting manner. What do the characters in Twister do? They run away. Hang on, isn't that what everybody else would do when facing a tornado, as well? The producers want us to say Look! They're running away! Isn't that exciting? No, it's just sensible, we don't want sensibility in a blockbuster, we want mindless bravado! (This is, of course, assuming that you're fortunate enough to be such a safe distance away that you can outrun a tornado, but still...)In fairness, they may eventually do something a bit more proactive than running away, or they may not, I can't remember. Blame this on the horrid dialogue and unsympathetic characters. Ultimately, I remember only blessed relief as the credits began to roll. This truly IS a disaster, but one that all involved should not have survived...

The supposed F-5 that they depict, I thought, was hokey as can be. I changed my mind when, on the Weather Channel, they showed a tornado and it looked almost exactly as depicted in Twister. Okay, I have to give them props for that.HOWEVER, some of the other effects and what's supposed to be happening was just wrong. My main example is toward the end, when chunks of fence are supposedly flying past them, and they don't get pelted by anything ONCE.My major gripe on being unrealistic, though, was when they strap themselves to a cold-water pipe that goes 30 feet into the ground. Sure, I think a leather strap and a deeply-embedded pipe would save them, but these two, supposedly scientists, seem to have forgotten that lightning takes the path of least resistance. A cold-water pipe, out in the middle of nowhere, with two bags of water (read Humans) strapped to it? Lightning would've been hitting that thing right and left.Okay, more props for how the tornado looked on the inside. I was reading a great book about twisters, and the man who saw the inside of one and lived to tell the tale described it just as they depicted. This man, who's name escapes me right now, was known to be intelligent and not giving to wild tales, so people believed him. He described the lightning making the inside almost glow, and little vortices, like tiny tornadoes, oozing out of the insides. And that's how they depict this one.The story itself I like. I love Dusty, he's awesome. I like the other characters too. Rabbit is good, Rabbit is wise. I guess I love this movie, technical errors notwithstanding, because I've seen it at least 30 times, so that's one indicator. For those who aren't weather geeks like myself, you'll thoroughly enjoy it! Oh yeah, one more thing the size of a tornado is no indicator of where it is on the Fujita scale. And the rating on the F-scale isn't until AFTER the storm has passed, not before it! It's based on damage caused, which is after-the-fact. So they can't just look at a tornado and say, for example, That's an F-3. Smaller tornadoes, because of their size and intensity (think of an ice-skater pulling her arms in, making herself smaller but also spinning faster) can be an F-5. Tornadoes with big, wide bases are often way less intense. There're always exceptions, of course.

Even as a dumb blockbuster, this goes a little far down the line.  A lot of the movie has corny dialogue, pretty thin characters (even is described inbetween hailstorms) and some other weak plot things.  But, it is big and loud, which helps enough for this film to get the grade it gets, but that might be it.  But hey, having a cow fly around in a twister is pretty cool.  By the way, the dumbest thing about this film, is the mpaa rating (PG-13 for intense depiction of weather), which makes me wonder why any kids live in the midwest or in the carribean during hurricane season.

I have similar feelings about Twister. How could I justify the waste of time mindlessly staring at tornado images and listening to the chatter of lovebirds in the cab of a pickup? At least Bob & Doug are funny, and their special effects make a travesty of films like Twister.Beyond that, I was sickened by the cocoon of safety created for the viewer. Especially the images of riding in a pickup truck - which conveyed a death-cheating sense of truck power, science, love and driving skill. It's a pretty flippant attitude in the face of real suffering. How many Katrinas and 9/11's will it take to wipe out this crass genre of movies?

Well, I like tornadoes. So it kind of fits. But after Speed, Jan De Bont made this movie. And its a lot quicker than Speed if you get my meaning.Twister tells the story of 2 divorced tornado chasers (Bill and Jo) trying to get a device up in a tornado to create an advanced warning system. But to do so, they must get in the twister's deadly path.This movie is filled with action non-stop and even has humor in it. So see this movie today.Running Time 113 Minutes Rated PG-13 For Bad Weather Sequences and Language.

I am a weather nut and this film in incredible! It has great acting by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt! I think that both of them acted greatly together! Their characters are very good and I like the way that they dress. Philip Seymour Hoffman was really the highlight actor in the film. He is so hilarious and his character is so colorful which in My opinion is one of the coolest characters ever in a movie! Carey Elwes Jami Gertz, and Lois Smith also put on good performances. Look for Joey Slotnick in a scene very similar like the one in the movie that would come out years later, Hollow Man! I loved that scene at the table at Meg's house where the guys are telling that story/joke. The special effects are tremendous! The structure of the tornadoes and the power that they have and the unbelievable damage that they do is totally accurate in the movie! Mark Mancina, one of the great composers of the Media Ventures composes an extraordinary score for Twister. The score has a great theme and an awesome choir! I think that the score is one of the best ever! The song Respect the Windin the end credits by Van Halen is a beautiful piece of music and it fits perfectly! I strongly recommend this film!

As a kid, Dr. Joanne 'Jo' Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt) saw her father taken away by a tornado, and now she is working to find the cause of them. He husband, William 'Bill/Billy' Harding (Bill Paxton) is the guy who joins her and her experiments, he has technology of his own. He invented some small microchip balls that can go into a tornado and show the power and size. He called these balls Dorothy (as in The Wizard of Oz), but his not very nice near fellow Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) stole his idea of the balls, and called them Dot. Anyway, this is pretty good disaster action, with a load of tornadoes. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Worth watching!

The heroes are very nice people but also very superficial and lacking real depth while the cameras disappear when there's some really spectacular carnage on its way . This expensive blockbuster cheats in the same way as NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS when the main characters survive a terrible tornado that devastates a small town , devastation that happened off screen . While the budget of the aforementioned TVM wouldn't have stretched convincingly enough to show us lives ended and homes destroyed TWISTER has far less of an excuse .I often found myself bored watching the tornado sequences on screen . Tornado might be spectacular but there also very similar in appearance and unfortunately the special effects here aren't too special with the CGI explosions being especially unconvincing to a demanding and blas√© audience who cry out to be left breathless by FX technology It's an inoffensive film but don't expect too much  "},{"Title":"War of sensibilities","Date":"28 October 1999","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Okay, I'm revealing bias here again, but what good critic doesn't?  Anyway, those who have commented on what a mess this film is need to keep in mind this; the movie was a collaboration between Jan de Bont and Michael Crichton, and this, I think, is a war of sensibilities.  De Bont made a fun movie in SPEED, which was plot driven, yes, but had people to care about, and was exciting(of course, what he's done since isn't that good, but this was then).  Crichton, on the other hand, is completely plot-driven, and while he distills science well, cares nothing about character, and what he writes is so skeletal it has the effect of putting a straitjacket on the story; it has no room to breathe.  The film is a mess, for the most part, because those two sensibilities fight it out, and unfortunately, it seems Crichton wins.The good parts, of course, are the tornadoes, and all the special effects.  I also liked all the scientist characters who are with Helen Hunt.  Usually, when scientists are in films, they're presented as dweebs.  Here, while they are nerds, they're eccentric and funny and human beings.  You also feel the vicarious thrill of trying to chase something like this, which I didn't think was possible.  And while the scientists were after their objective, they weren't callous towards the effects of the tornadoes.  And finally, Helen Hunt.  I'm a big fan of hers, and she projects intelligence, grace under pressure, and humor, plus she handles the emotional stuff well without getting sentimental.Unfortunately, we have the bad parts.  Cary Elwes et al were totally unnecessary to this story(and they're not in it for the money, they're in it for the science! ranks up with the worst lines of the decade), it's merely an arbitrary insertion of a villain where none is needed.  Bill Paxton is good at times, but he's saddled with that line and some other bad lines, which is Crichton's way of spelling everything out instead of trusting us.  And while Jami Gertz was funny at first(trying to do her job during all the chaos around her), she became a bit much after awhile.  In short, this movie doesn't blow, but it's not the great ride I was hoping for. "}]
