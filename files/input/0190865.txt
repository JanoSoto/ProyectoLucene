[{"Title":"There's no limit to mountaineering melodramatics","Date":"16 June 2002","Score":"77 out of 96 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" While mountaineering is one of the most exhilarating of sports it has produced little good fiction, and few good fictional movies, though there have been some excellent documentaries ('The Man who Skied Down Everest', the Imax 'Everest' film, for example). Somehow, when it comes to fiction, the clich√©s take over, and this film, with some genuinely gorgeous camera-work and impressive stunts, is full of them. The wealthy megalomaniac determined to conquer K2 at any cost, the climber who lost his nerve when his father was killed who pushes himself into action to save his sister, stuck in a crevass high up the mountain with the moneyed one, the bitter old man of the mountains who is essential to the rescue, the guide who has sold out, It's all there. One does expect some improbability of plot in a film like this, but the thought that someone might cart Pakistani Army liquid nitro-glycerine in back packs to the top of K2 to blast a crevasse open really was a bit much.Apart from a very attractive opening sequence in Utah (Monument Valley, I think) the film was shot in the New Zealand Alps, with a few clips of the genuine Karkoram Himalaya spliced in. For this viewer, it brought back pleasant memories of climbing in the University holidays around the Southern Alps. But climbing is a dangerous sport; on one trip I was accompanied by four people, all of whom subsequently died in separate climbing accidents (one on Makalu, next to Everest). There is a fair amount of special effects malarky (no-one, not even Temuera Morrison pretending to be Pakistani, would fly an old military helicopter so close to a mountain wall at 21,000 feet), but there are also some genuinely stirring shots. Unfortunately, the acting for the most part matches the script. Chris Connelly, good at sensitive young men, is wrong for the brother bent on rescue (it's more of a part for Bruce Willis), and Bill Paxton is only moderately menacing as the ruthless Richard Branson-style billionaire. In fact the only decent piece of acting is Scott Glenn's Wick, the veteran with attitude. The'comic' Australian climbing brothers, Ces and Cyril, or whatever their names were, were profoundly embarrassing &#150; I guess Ben Mendelsohn will be hoping no-one will recognise him with a balaclava on his head. There were also lackluster performances from the two female leads, Robin Tunney and Izabella Scorupco. One of them, Scorupco, is an ex-Bond girl ('Goldeneye') &#150; the casting people obviously didn't realise she was going to be spending the entire movie wrapped up in Gore-Tex. There's no sex at high altitude &#150; it's too damned cold and anyway survival takes precedence over procreation.I think Roger Ebert got it right on this one &#150; a 'B' movie with an 'A' movie budget. There are all sorts of anomalies &#150; the lack of visible water vapour issuing from the climbers, their sprightly behaviour even after hours at 26,000 feet, the use of north wall hammers to attack a rock/ice pitch, the miraculous helicopter piloting &#150; but somehow the magnificence of those great peaks comes through. The worst thing about a movie like this is that it portrays the mountains as hellish, which is far from the truth. What is it the psalm says 'I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my strength'? Climbing is one thing I have never regretted doing, and it would be a pity if people were put off the sport by stuff like this. Actually I think the people who do attempt peaks like K2 would see this film as preposterous, overblown Hollywood brown smelly stuff, and they'd be right. But there is some nice scenery.

If only two of the many, many catastrophes that happened in the movie happened in real life it would be like lightning striking you twice.  Everything that the actors did (pretending to be the  best of the best climbers) seemed to go against them.  Really, do you think a professional climber would leave his back pack where it could slide down the mountain?  This is your life we're talking about.  How about a nylon climbing rope that snaps two feet above the ground just after stopping a long fall.  You can't see anyone's breath and it's cold up there.  But the way, there aren't any open flame fires that I know of (unless the fuel contains it's own oxygen) anywhere near that altitude.  Or how about a professional climber (who relies on good lungs) that smokes.  Really, enough is enough! If you can't think well you might like this movie but it you have some brains, no way!  No real plot development - only special effects over and over and over...Unfortunately not even plausible special effects.  Jumping a crevasse (didn't they know it was there before they took that route) and actually sticking to the other side.  Come on! I could go on and on but I won't.  Nice scenery though.

Instead, this film is full of spectacular scenery, good looking actors and actresses, and some unexpected insights into issues of morality, judgment and sacrifice. As far as the accuracy about details of climbing, I couldn't care less. This is not a how-to movie. And as for the wisdom of transporting nitroglycerin across dangerous terrain, check out Henri-Georges Clouzot's masterpiece, The Wages of Fear or its excellent remake by William Friedkin, Sorcerer.

The climber's peril thus necessitates a rescue, which puts additional people on the mountain and at risk of dying. That's it. The story is thus fairly thin, but the filmmakers insert all kinds of natural and human obstacles, conflict, and difficulties to rev up the action and excitement.The film's CGI creates compelling tension. We have the illusion of vertical scale, or perspective, which translates into a needed sense of vertigo. The sensation that the characters could, at any moment, fall to their deaths is the film's strength.The mountain scenery is also nice, although it is sometimes wasted, because of the film's fast pace. Cinematography is quite good. And some of the scene transitions make the film flow really well.Dialogue seems flat to me. Production design and costumes are adequate. Acting is largely irrelevant.By far, the biggest flaw is the unrealistic amount of action. In the plot, everything that could go wrong does go wrong, from bad weather to avalanches to exploding nitro to human conflict and discord. It's all a bit much. But, that seems to be a problem inherent to outdoor action films. Directors cram in too much chaos.Another minus is the background music, which is irritatingly nondescript. For a film set mostly in Asia, I could have wished for more indigenous music which, when combined with the majesty of the mountains, could have added emotional depth and a sense of mystery and awe.Vertical Limit does have an emotional spine to its story, but that is secondary to the super action plot. Viewers who expect well thought out characters, meticulous plotting, or a subtle theme will need to look elsewhere. This film is strictly for people who like heavy-duty outdoor action.

Martin Campbell, the same director who did The Mask Of Zorro and Goldeneye, is good at producing eye-popping action scenes.The dialog at times is juvenile, but it could have been worse.

It seems like the producers looked up this bunch of cool gadgets mountain climbers use (many of which are sharp or have pointy ends) and tried to portray some of the most irresponsible climbing you could think of.Sure, it's hell if your sis is stuck in an avalanche on K-2 but, as some climber already pointed out in basecamp, you don't go risking another six people to 'possibly' get two down. Besides, there are better ways to do this than by strapping a can of nitroglycerine to your back.(small note dynamite is essentially chalk soaked in nitro which stabilizes it. Guess they hadn't thought of that?)Furthermore, you never climb beneath another group's ropes (lest they fall and drag you with them...), you do not sprint across a ridge wearing glacier-irons, you do not sit on a 5cm ledge without a safety rope attached, you do jump out of a helicopter trying to fall down unless you intend to end up spaghetti.In short, this movie severely damages the image of the real mountain climbers, who consider safety and precaution a way of life and not something to disregard to look cool.

Here we see a father and his son and daughter climbing a vertical rock. An accident takes the life of the father and sets us up for the events that take place years later in the main part of the film. Unless you are a climber and insist on an accurate depiction of the sport, I recommend this film for pure adrenalin rush.Also, the scenery is absolutely some of the most beautiful in the world. It ALMOST makes me want to go climb a mountain (not really quite though).Fans of Alexander Siddig (previously known as Siddig El Fadil) will want to watch this movie whether they are interested in climbing or not. He plays Pakistani crew-member Kareem, and yes, this film is set in Pakistan as they are supposedly climbing K2 in the Himalayas, but most of the movie is actually filmed in New Zealand.

One of the canisters leaks(how cliche)and threatens to blow everyone to bits. If nitro glycerine is so volatile, couldn't the team use something less volatile, such as dynamite or C4?3. While trying to drop off the team on the mountain, disaster strikes(again)as the weather threatens the lives of the team. If they are so proffessional, couldn't they have anticipated such violent weather?4. about 4 minutes after the last disaster, disaster strikes(again). One of the team members is nearly diced to pieces by the rotor blades5. while scaling the mountain, a nitro cylinder slips out of a guy's backpack, and disaster strikes(again)when one of the climbers is nearly killed in the blast6. As if nearly getting fried by the blast wasn't enough, the film decides to whip up an avalanch to kill off the nearly killed climber.7. Back at the depot, the nitro glycerine crates blow up.8. Two climbers are nearly killed when they don't realize that the cylinders react to sunlight, which, by some ill-fated luck, happened to be exposed entirely to the sun!9. They manage to discover this fact, and cover up the cylinders in snow...but, disaster strikes(again) when the cylinders *somehow* leak nitro glycerine into the sunlight and...can you guess what happens?10. Finally, the trapped climbers suffer from Pulmonary Adima, which they should have been prepared for as proffessionals.Now, as you can tell, in this story what should have been a by-the-book rescue mission, turns out to be disaster after disaster after disaster. If you've seen the trailer then you've seen the movie. Either these climbers are cocky and unprepared, or they're incredibly unlucky.Vertical Limit, however, portrays the harsh cold misery the trapped climbers have to endure very well. You can actually imagine how they must feel like, dying bit by bit from the intense cold, just by listening to their coughing and looking at their shivering.

Incidentally, it must put strange pressures on the filmmakers who want to surf that ever more lucrative wave. Thrill films are basically pornographic the story exists as the barest excuse to cobble together the `good parts.' Acting/reading is incidental. What matters is pace and intensity.But sex pornography is pretty much always the same thing, and thrill porn must always top the previous standard. Nonetheless, there are only so many things to work with fights, car chases, explosions, elaborate spaceships, monsters,Egypt, outerspace, underwater are problematic because these types of film depend on familiarity for instance an exploding space ship now has to look a certain way, quite contrary to reality, or it doesn't look real. Car wrecks must always flip and fly or explode or we don't believe it. You can press humor only so far, as Renny Harlin discovered in `Cutthroat Island.'Renny himself discovered the possibilities of mountain adventure with `Cliffhanger.' Its novelty alone brought success, in spite of cheesy effects and the burden of Sly. Now `Vertical' dips into the same pile, but with much better effect technology and more investment in a story of sorts. It is the same rescue bit, but with two side plots the kid who sacrificed his dad to save his sister -- the climbing ace whose wife was killed by a climber to save that climber's life -- the confluence of those at the end when the ace kills the bad guy climber in identical circumstances, validating the son's decision (and incidentally again saving the sister).There's some art in all these plotline symmetries, even to the presaging in the opening 2 unrelated climbers disrupting a trio, and I appreciate this.The effects are rather good as effect movies go that opening sequence may become classic. But the pacing is dull and repetitive, outcomes and images predictable. One problem is that everyone is wrapped up in cold clothes, so much of range of the actors is off the table. Which is a problem because the director really wants the actors to add dramatic tension to the mix. Alas this group would be unable to do that in the best of circumstances.The heaviest burden of this film is the existence of the IMAX film on Everest.

Two years later and sis has got herself stranded halfway up K2, and Peter has to lug a load of highly unstable nitroglycerine up the mountain in order to rescue her.A stupid movie from the start, Vertical Limit has mix of dumb-ass cheap thrills and ugly, silly special effects. The performances are terrible, Robin Tunney has the only watchable role. The script is disastrous, you'll be screaming at the screen in agony at how flipping stupid the whole thing is. The film is so predictable, I mean, of course O'Donnell is going to save the day and rescue his beloved sister Annie! And the stupid blonde bitch who should of died instantly still lives, and typically falls in love with Peter.

Millionaire businessman (and experienced climber) Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) has surrounded himself with the best climbers in the world to help him reach the top of K2 and effect his `life's statement.'  And coincidentally, there just may be some publicity in it to help him launch his new airline, which is scheduled to make it's initial flight (over K2, of course) just as they make it to the summit.  World renowned climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) is in charge on the mountain; but when conditions dictate a return to base camp, Vaughn's money and position prevails and they continue on with what becomes a fool's errand.  Watching the proceedings from below is photographer Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell), who is in the area on assignment for National Geographic.  Garrett also happens to be an expert climber, as is his sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), who happens to be a member of Vaughn's team.  When it becomes clear that the stranded climbers have a window of but a certain number of hours for survival, Peter goes into action and puts together a rescue team; he's not about to let his sister die on the mountain.  To lead his team he enlists the help of a local, Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), a legendary climber who knows K2 better than anyone else alive.  And with his team in place and good to go, the adventure begins. 	The story-- by Robert King, with a screenplay by King and Terry Hayes-- is substantially well written, and though it has a sense of `been-there-done-that' about it, it's like your favorite ride at an amusement park; as soon as you get off, you want to get back on and go again.  That's the way it is with this movie.  It's familiar territory, but under the steady hand of director Campbell, and with the help of some breathtaking photography, it's a heart-stopping, exciting film that refuses to let you off the hook from the opening sequence to the very end.  The only flaw overall would have to be that King and Hayes took the low road-- or the easy way, if you will-- by introducing a plot twist that concerns the relationship between Vaughn and Wick that is somewhat cliched; almost as if they felt the drama of the rescue and all that surrounds it was not enough somehow.  They were wrong; the element in question merely serves to lower the bar a bit.  Happily, however, it is not enough to negate the entertainment value of the entire project, nor does it significantly alter the fact that this is basically a good story.  I mention it only because I feel that had they used a more imaginative, alternative means to their end, it would have made what is predominantly a really good movie an exceptional one. 	An interesting cast was assembled for Campbell to use in the telling of his story, most notably O'Donnell, who has attained a level of maturity that gives a credibility to his character that he has lacked somewhat in previous outings; and Scott Glenn-- looking aptly weather-beaten here-- who effects just the right touch of isolation to make Wick a somewhat enigmatic presence.  Tunney makes her Annie believable, which is especially important in putting across the climbing sequences, and Paxton does likewise with Vaughn, though his character is not really much of a stretch for him as an actor.  But he does deliver.  The real find here, however, is the charismatic Izabella Scorupco (Monique), who not only proves that she has what it takes as an actress, but is a classic beauty in the style of Lake, Leigh and Bergman rarely seen in Hollywood in the past two or three decades.   	The supporting cast includes Steve Le Marquand, Ben Mendelsohn, Temuera Morrison and Robert Taylor.  There are a number of scenes in `Vertical Limit' that will have you on the edge of your seat and may even have you gasping aloud; at the same time, there are certain aspects of this film that have inevitable conclusions.  But Campbell has put it all in a fresh, exciting package that makes this movie more than worth your while and is thoroughly entertaining.  Check it out; It's a ride you're going to be glad you jumped on.  I rate this one 7/10.

Although many of the trickiest scenes were done with the aide of blue screens and matte backgrounds, the film features many breathtaking aerial shots of the Pakistani Himalayas.  The most beautifully composed sequence of the film is its first, in which Annie Garrett (Robin Tunney, End of Days), her brother Peter (Chris O'Donnell, Scent of a Woman), and their father are rock climbing in Utah.  Someone slips up, and Peter is put in a position where he has to decide whether to save himself and his sister or risk killing all three climbers.  He chooses the former and lets his father fall to his death. Fast forward three years.  Annie has apparently excelled the sport of female mountain climbing so much that she is on the cover of Sports Illustrated, while Peter, having given up climbing after the accident, is a nature photographer.  The two are rather awkwardly reunited in Pakistan, where Peter learns that his sister is part of a mountain climbing dream team seeking to scale the second highest peak in the world, K2.  The climb is part of a publicity stunt created by billionaire Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton, A Simple Plan), who plans to wave at the inaugural flight of his new airline as it soars over K2.  However, the overzealous Vaughn leads the team into heavy weather, trapping them in a crevasse.  To save his sister, Peter assembles a team of international climbing experts-among them, foulmouthed twins from New Zealand with a penchant for misogyny, a tough-as-nails supermodel from Canada, a Muslim who speaks only in clich√©, and a grizzled climbing veteran with an uninteresting subplot. They plan to blast their way into the crevasse with nitroglycerin.  Why anyone with any sense would carry such a highly sensitive explosive on such a perilous mission is a matter screenwriter Robert King III doesn't care to address.  From here, it doesn't take long to figure out who lives and who doesn't. Director Martin Campbell keeps the film moving nicely from stunt to stunt, but gets bogged down by superfluous scenes of people screaming mountain jargon at one another through howling winds.  O'Donnell seems like a former teen idol that never made it to the pages of Tiger Beat.  His turn here as an action star doesn't quite pan out, but I applaud the effort.  In fact, most of the characters are so laughably underwritten and one-dimensional that we really don't care who gets buried under the snow.  Paxton, an otherwise reliable leading man, plays a villain about as evil as a Teletubby.

You don't need to be a climber to appreciate how ridiculous this movie is. It reminded me of the kind of disaster movies you used to see in the 70's like towering inferno, except that, incredibly, it's worse.The movie is about a group of climbers that get trapped in a crevasse, in the death zone, on K2, around 26,000 feet, and a rescue team that undertakes an expedition to find them. The crevasse is a bad Hollywood set with lots of fake snow. One rescuer sits down casually in the snow at 23,000 feet and rolls a smoke. One rolls out the Persian carpet runner that he carries up in order to pray to Allah - I kid you not. If they had performed a live exorcism on the mountain it would have fit the implausible plot. There are explosions from nitroglycerin that the rescue team carries (it's that lame), climbers hanging from ledges with one arm while they dramatically swing their climbing buddy below them, just one stupid and stupider thing after another.If movies like this inject some humour you can forgive the idiocy - it can actually add to the film - but this is so self serious as to be fetching, overly sentimental and dumb.I gave it a 3 for some scenery - at least the scenery that wasn't fake.

Sure, the plot is formulaic, and for those of us who are experienced mountaineers, the events and stunts rise occasionally to the ridiculous. But this movie was far superior to some of the mountaineering films made in the early 90s (K2, Cliffhanger). It is also visually beautiful to watch if you enjoy the mountains or are a climber. Other perks for the armchair mountaineer include a cameo by Ed Viesturs (as himself).The plot is a simple one. Accomplished young sibling climbers become estranged after the death of their father in a climbing accident, but are reunited in the K2 death zone after one becomes trapped with her climbing party at high altitude and her brother forms the rescue party. From there, all that's required to enjoy the unfolding events is an ability to enjoy the stunning vistas and not take the details too seriously.The movie was well cast, with an earnest Chris O'Donnell as a young hero, Scott Glenn as a mysterious, menacing, yet fundamentally well intentioned old school climber, and Tom Paxton as a hard-charging self-absorbed businessman.Also, when this film was first released the plot had some timely elements in the wake of the 1996 Everest disaster. The notion that wealthy clients could guarantee themselves a summit via high-priced guides--often with tragic results--was most certainly not fiction. No doubt the Everest story, although much more serious than this enjoyable bit of mountaineering fluff, influenced the writer of the screenplay here.

Its massive lack of imagination was topped only by its gigantic plot holes.  The characters in this film were as flat and undefined as half a stick figure drawn by a kindergartner on Ritalin working on a deadline.  Not once during the two hours and ten minutes of my life that I will never get back did the film even skim the edges of anything that could be identified as `entertaining.'  This film also was a cause for concern if the people climbing these mountains are this untalented, then we can anticipate many icy deaths in the near future. The film is the story of Chris O'Donnell who is a National Geographic photographer.  His sister is a guide to the evil Bill Paxton, who is trying to climb the mountain as a publicity stunt.  (He has just purchased an airline and, against all rules of reality, plans to wave to the first flight and it soars by.)  So naturally there is an avalanche and the climbers are trapped in a cave which is conveniently positioned near the avalanche. Chris O'Donnell, obviously, is the only one brave enough to venture up the mountain and save his sister, but he soon recruits others whose only purpose in the film is to die so we feel sad and O'Donnell looks braver.O'Donnell gets the brilliant idea that it would be quicker to blast his sister out rather than dig for her.  (Apparently he expects the laws of physics will tailor to his needs and the explosion will create a nice, carpeted passageway leading straight to her rather than bury her under massive amounts of snow, as would happen in the real world.)  Rather than selecting dynamite or some other normal explosive, he `wisely' chooses nitro glycerin, which as we all know explodes if shaken.  This film was obviously written by semi-talented monkeys who were promised a banana.Overall, I believe that Vertical Limit is a waste of celluloid and every copy of the film should be burned so as not to expose future generations to this painfully wretched insult to the sport of mountain climbing.

But even I found this movie very far-fetched and laughable during the parts of it I managed to stay glued to. In addition to the other oopsies everybody else pointed out, if we're going for realism in a movie, can we avoid using fake spray-on Christmas-tree snow on people's faces and sets??  Aacckk, I hate that look in movies!  I realize we can't really freeze people to death for the sake of realism, but with makeup and special effects and huge budgets that we have today we can avoid this little faux pas, can't we??It seemed to me that this movie lasted for about 6 hours.  Maybe this is an after-effect that the director was going for, maybe he wanted us to sense that when you're climbing a 28,000 ft. mountain, your sense of time is distorted or something.  Personally the only inclination this gave me was to wonder how I could get up and leave the room about 27 times, read about 30 reviews of movies here on the IMDb, and this movie was still running!! Freezing to death probably would have the same effect on the brain, I'd assume.The first thing that made me dubious of this flick (and I must admit I didn't even catch the first 45 minutes of it) was after Scott Glenn (in his best David Carradine-from-Kung-Fu incarnation) agreed to go on the rescue expedition, and the helicopter has to literally drop the rescuers off on the mountain.  After watching the (kid's toy-looking) helicopter thrash about in the maniacal winds for about 15 minutes, wondering how the heck, even I knew that a helicopter couldn't survive in a) winds like that for that long, b) hovering at that altitude just wouldn't cut it either, and c) I was ready for that rotor blade to chop the girl's head off just for an encore.And ok, maybe I'm being a little heavy here, but I'm sorry, I just can't take Chris O'Donnell seriously in a movie while I'm waiting on the edge of my seat for him to dash into the Batcave and come out in the full Robin package.  He sure could have used Batman's help out of this mess.  He's so, well, golly gee, earnest or something, he reminds me of Beaver Cleaver trying to act in a big-boy movie.All in all, I would just say, save yourself the time and energy.  The little mountain climbing episode at the beginning of Ace Ventura  When Nature Calls was far more entertaining for me, and sadly, more realistic.

To enjoy characters, even though we may not like them, we must know that what they do has a legitimate purpose. There are a number of fatal flaws in this film surrounding mountaineering in general. Rather than mention them all, I'm merely going to mention one that reflects directly on character motivation.The trapped climbers know the dangers of high-altitude pulmonary edema. This motivates them to take injections of 'dex' (short for dexamethasone) to ward off symptoms. The rescuers also know the dangers and know the victims' supply of dex is running out. This motivates them to race against time and adversity to rescue the trapped climbers. The problem? Dexamethasone has no effect on high-altitude pulmonary edema whatsoever. It's used only in the rare instances of cerebral edema where the primary symptom is denial of the condition, not a mad rush to acquire the medicine or administer it. For pulmonary edema, the proper medicine is nifedipine -- taken orally, not by injection.You would think a major studio production where motivation centers around a medical condition would have a medical adviser on the payroll.

The acting is pretty mediocre, the special effects weren't great either as the blue screen shots were obviously fake, and the action scenes, which usually involved some sort of climbing equipment malfunctioning as the climbers dangle precariously from a rediculously high cliff, were hardly suspenseful.    The editing is pretty atrocious too.  Too many scenes cut from the characters hanging from a cliff with no clear way out of their predicament to them relaxing back at camp, without explaining how they got there.  The scene of Chris O'Donnell leaping across a five hundred foot wide canyon happens so quickly that before we have a chance to laugh at it it's over.    Bill Paxton starts out playing a believable nice guy but suddenly turns bad and starts killing his climbing partners for some reason.  The rescue mission on which O'Donnell embarks to save his sister involves the climber carrying six canisters of nitroglycerin (which is always on the verge of exploding) up the mountain.  Apparently they plan to blow their way through the mountain to save some idiots who fell into a crevasse.  I don't think this is a standard rescue routine.

You can see the similarity when (and only when) it's pointed out both films involve transporting nitro-glycerin over uncooperative terrain, and both films take their sweet time about even mentioning the nitro-glycerin.  (Although in neither case does it ruin the effect to know that the nitro-glycerin is coming.)  It was this feature of The Wages of Fear that particularly struck Campbell.It's a pity he wasn't struck by something else, like the decision to film in black and white.  If nitro-glycerin really DOES look like Cottee's lime cordial, better we don't see it in colour.  (Although perhaps another director would have convinced us that something so goofy-looking could actually blow things up).  Other things to be struck by in The Wages of Fear the way it shows two approaches to each problem, the first setting up the second; the clarity of the quest; the unusual, intriguing obstacles; the precise editing.  With Vertical Limit I have to struggle to remember what the characters were trying to do and how (and if) they did it.The story's moral is a bizarre one.  We open with a family of rock-climbers in one of the drier parts of the United States, halfway up a monolith; very soon there's an accident, and daughter, son and father (in that order) are hanging from the same rope, which looks as though it won't hold.  The father asks the son to cut the rope between them, so that at least the two offspring survive, and the son - after some hesitation - does.  There's a helpful shot of the father hitting the ground, in case we'd forgotten about gravity.  Cut to the Himalayas.Here's what I'm predicting the brother will be there already; the sister will arrive to meet him by chance; within seconds, they'll start quarrelling, and she'll give him a hard time about cutting the rope.  Bingo, bingo, bingo.  It was during this quarrel that my heart really sank.  Once, just once, I'd like to see a film in which the survivors realise that the person who cut the rope did the right thing, or in which even those who don't realise this, understand it was a difficult situation and hold no grudges.  What purpose will this bickering between brother and sister serve?  Here's what I'm predicting none.Bingo.  There is, though, some more rope-cutting (literal and metaphorical), and the moral of the story seems to be this cutting the rope (sacrificing one life to save others) is the right thing to do if you're the hero, the wrong thing to do if you're the villain.  The converse (sacrificing a greater number of lives to save a smaller number) is ALSO the right thing to do if you're the hero, the wrong thing if you're the villain.  It's hard being the villain.If Campbell had thrown out the nitro-glycerin, the villainy, the poorly thought through ethical dilemmas and the rest of that rubbish, and made a simple rescue film, it could have been as thrilling as he wanted it to be.  As it is we're reduced to looking at the mountains (New Zealand doubling for Asia), thinking things like yes, they ARE big. "},{"Title":"Wheeeev!

That film had me on the edge of my seat with my mouth agape at times with a story of a climbing accident and the aftermath.  However Vertical Limit doesn't go for realism at any point.  The plot is a real mess; it doesn't risk having it's thrills from the effects of the mountain so it also adds a traditional bad guy and a `wages of fear' twist involving the climbers carrying nitro in their backpacks.  That's not to say the film doesn't have exciting moments - the opening scene is very dramatic and powerful (despite O'Donnell's crap wide-eyed acting) but it never reaches that again.  Instead, it settles for effect shots of climbers hanging over great heights etc.  These are visually impressive and they do manage to get a sense of urgency to them but it never lasts long.It's a shame, because Cliffhanger was enjoyable and Void showed that the real drama can come from just the mountain itself, however here it keeps adding more stuff to try and force drama out of the situation.  The lack of real characters is a problem - instead we have very wide clich√©s almost; `dudes', wise old men, ruthless billionaires, sexy mountain chick and clean cut siblings.  Aside from the opening sequence, it is hard to feel an emotional connection to any of them and, as the latest disposable actor hangs over a drop awaiting the chop I was more focused on how good it looked rather than nerves over the outcome.  O'Donnell is as bland as he often can be and didn't impress me at all; likewise Tunney was a bit `all-American' for my taste.  Paxton could have been sending up Richard Branson if he hadn't been playing it so straight.  In a similar vein, Glenn would have been better if he'd put his tongue in his cheek and acknowledged how daft his character was!  The support cast or `drop monkeys' as I call them are an average enough bunch but the film basically kills them off one by one like a horror movie - to much audience apathy I might add.Overall this is an OK film if you can just turn off your brain and enjoy the vertigo-inducing effects.  However with no good plot, dialogue or characters it will be very difficult for anyone to really get involved in the film beyond this aspect.  I can only plea to you to seek out a film with a fraction the budget of this and that's Touching The Void.

I will not waste too much time on this comment, since I already wasted enough on the movie itself.First of all, it is painfully obvious that the actors are aware of the quality of the script. They all seem very tired of the film, and they all do their job - not a bit more, not a bit. The only exception from this is Scott Glenn, who by pure professionalism manages to present a decent performance. Clearly the director are also aware about just how much the script sucks, because he has evidently not even tried to inspire the crew to some good acting. I have seen better directing and acting on `The days of our lives'The FX is quite alright, as is the sound. The surroundings are fairly beautiful. But this doesn't help a bit in the long run. Well, actually it helps a bit, because otherwise I wouldn't even had finished the movie at all.What is most upsetting however, is the way the professional climbers are presented. They are all clumsy and careless, and all of the accidents are somehow related to errors that the climbers do. This is not by itself necessary bad, but when all the errors are related to pure sloppiness and utter negligence for safety from almost all the climbers, it becomes absurd and preposterous.Do you remember the old crappie movie `The Net' starring Sandra Bullock ? That movie became sheer nonsense, and was a total joke, to all people knowing juuuust a bit about computers. The same is true for Vertical Limit, if you know juuuuust a bit about climbing.I might also ad, that you DO NOT have to be ANYTHING of an expert on climbing, to see through all the insane errors that the climbers do.

One thing I would have done differently, as a director, is to eliminate the explosives. Blowing a hole at the top of the crevass that your friends and family are at the bottom of is folly, and even if you do feel the need to bring explosives (in avalanche country), use something relatively stable, like dynamite.Dynamite would have been readily available, for it is used to mine Himalayan salt in Pakistan. Certainly, the man with the millions of dollars could have afforded some. the exclusion of explosives from the scenes would have contributed to a more believable alpine adventure (think Without a Trace). The story line was good, and I appreciated the strong, complex dynamics and connections between the brother and sister, and between the two siblings and the rescue team leader. While Vertical Limit strove to expose the harsh realities of technical climbing (especially at K2), however, it lost some steam by being very lax in re-creating the conditions that would have been met by the climbers, even at K2's Base Camp at 18,645 feet.No one was even wearing hats at the alcohol-ridden barbecue at Base Camp, the night before the climb. It would have been blisteringly cold, between -20 and -50 farenheit. No professional climber would have been drinking alcohol at that time.On the mountain, in the raging storm, the climbers did not even have the sense to pull the Cord-Locs on their hoods tight Snow would have accumulated inside their hoods and parkas, then melting. The stoves they used did not even have a forced flame, Like MSR or Kovea. They looked more like Sterno or alcohol stoves, which would not work at that altitude.One scene threatened to de-rail the credibility of this picture That of Chris O'Donnell's character, when he lept 50 feet forward and 40 feet down, and grabbed onto a snowy cliff face while wearing an expedition pack. If the director felt that such a feat was absolutely necessary to keep our interest in the movie, he should have at least made the distances half of what they were, and when Chis O'Donnell hits the cliff face, he is knocked unconscious and is hanging by his rope as the woman climber tries in vain to pull him up until she jury-rigs a make-shift pulley system.One question about that scene How does Chris O'Donnell's character get the woman climber across? Would it have been too much to ask to show 20 seconds of that?Of course, the conditions inside the crevass would have been much colder, darker and desperate than showed, but I can forgive that, I suppose.Although I am glad that there were not one but two women in the rescue team, in reality, they would have not been allowed Women just don't have the brute force necessary to haul 200-pound guys down the mountain (or up on a rope).While I am tempted to say that it is unrealistic that the veteran and renowned ascent team leader and National Geographic photographer (also a highly-experienced climber) could be cajoled into continuing the ascent after the severe storm warning had been issued to them, we have seen bad decisions in the past by real-life alpine team leaders, leading to disaster.Although it may seem that I am being very critical of Vertical Limit, my score of 8 shows that I am willing to forgive the sins that Hollywood felt compelled to commit. The strong inter-personal dynamics, strong story line in-general, and clear, bold decision making in the script made this film worth watching. Heroism is always a welcome theme in the movies I watch, and in Vertical Limit, everyone's a hero in his or her own way.Scott Glen's character as the rescue team leader and sage mountaineer was superb.

Those movies that gather a lot of egotistical people together who are experts at a particular profession or activity and have them talk to one another as if they have been performing this profession/activity from the time they could crawl. They talk in a lot of jargon, they usually insult one another in fun, there is usually one argument that almost comes to blows and most of the time there is a legendary crazy old coot famous for being, well -- a legendary crazy old coot. These movies usually supply a large company of stock characters including the seasoned expert, the good looking hero (who has usually lost a legendary relative, most often dear old Dad), the beer-guzzling party animal, the beautiful sidekick/love interest, somebody's brother (99% of the time he doesn't make it) and of course the usual no-name actor just thrown in so that he can die in a display of spectacular stunt work.I have seen this formula applied to firefighters ('Backdraft'), air traffic controllers ('Pushing Tin'), navy pilots ('Top Gun'), stock car racers ('Days of Thunder'), surfers ('Point Break'), yacht racing champs ('Wind'), storm chasers ('Twister'), Alpine skiers ('Aspen Extreme') etc., etc., etc. They aren't exactly people that you would want to be around as an amateur because as these movies usually go your death could be foretold even before you met them (If they are such experts then why do three-fourths of their crew die?).'Vertical Limit' supplies all of the stock characters and hurls them into a chaotic series of predictable tragedies each one seemingly designed to wipe out the supporting characters in the order of the actor's place on the Hollywood celebrity food chain. In other words, if most of the people in the audience know who the actor is then the longer that character's death will be delayed in the film's running time. If they have top billing, they make it out alive.The movie begins when Peter (Chris O'Donnell), his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and their father (Stuart Wilson) are rock climbing when an accident leaves them hanging from a rock with a clamp that is about to come loose and send all plunging to their deaths. Dad (at the bottom end of the rope) informs his son to cut him loose to lighten the load, which he does after some heated shouting.Three years later in the Himalayas a group of mountain climbers have gathered to see off a team who are about to go on an expedition despite warnings that a harsh storm could shift it's direction at a moment's notice. The two kids meet up just as Annie is about to head out with a famous gusto millionaire (Bill Paxton) and his cautious guide (Nicholas Lea). After the usual banter about turning back the three press on and barely miss getting swallowed up by an avalanche only to end up trapped in an ice cave. This provides the time-honored tradition of having people trapped together so that they can argue about the need to conserve supplies despite the fact that one of them is standing at death's door (for this person's identity, see which of these three actors you haven't heard of).Peter gathers a rescue team made up mostly of the aforementioned no-name actors so that we can watch them die according to the aforementioned Celebrity Death Meter. The expedition is lead by The Crazy Old Coot (Scott Glen) a long-haired mountain man with no toes whose wife's death leads to one of the most effectively bone chilling sights that I have seen in a movie in a long while. He leads Peter and crew up the mountain because he knows the mountain better than anyone. To make matters worse, the clock starts ticking for Annie as she contracts pulmonary edema.No time for plot development because the movie is too busy hurtling its characters from one crisis to another. The movie also adds a stupid plot device involving O'Donnell deciding to carry nitroglycerin so that he can blast open the area where his sister is trapped. The movie isn't kind enough to explain why they think that such an unstable, unpredictable chemical can be used to open the ice cave without causing an avalanche.The movie has the usual stuntwork with characters hanging by pick axes over precarious drops, having them swallowed up by avalanches and having them slide back down the mountain and trying to get hold with their axes. It does provide one fascinating piece of stunt work as the climbers have to climb out onto the leg of the helicopter, slide to the end and drop onto a ledge. I'm starting to count on one hand the number of movies that don't provide the chopper pilot the opportunity to shout 'I can't hold it!' 'Vertical Limit' reminded me of 'The Perfect Storm' a much better movie about people who put themselves in harm's way to save their own skins. The movie wasn't perfect but as least I felt like the sailors on that boat seemed to belong there and had individual personalities that carried them even when they made the wrong decision. They were played by actors that I knew but the way they played their characters made me believe that they actually lived life on the sea. The actors in 'Vertical Limit' just look like actors in front of a blue screen supplied for the movie's overblown stunt show. These characters may come on screen talking a lot of jargon about mountain climbing but it seems to me that most of their success comes from dumb luck.

This is marvelous action, with unique locations, smart plot, and perfect directing. The climbing scenes are excellently made, I never felt overabundant, or originally any, CGI. Obviously, a lot of efforts was spent behind this movie, rather gem. However, some points bugged me. Let's see how bad they are.First off  the way the second act was written. The movie kind of remakes the Seven Samurai story, yet for nothing but killing most of them, as if they were there for just getting killed ! No doubt that the movie overused the matter of the nitroglycerin bombs, and badly. Yes, they're a heck of thrill element, but not to an extent where the Pakistani army doesn't know how to save them, or the Pakistani general doesn't see their leakage under his foot, or the movie uses them as Freddy is used in Nightmare on Elm Street's movies ! Chris O'Donnell is talented, however not that charismatic, and doesn't fit action movies so much. In fact, hiring him with the lovely Robin Tunney back then, whether was for cutting down the budget, or as a chance to experiment new stars, proved to be something not that successful. And after 10 years, both of them ended up in TV shows like NCIS  Los Angeles and The Mentalist.Although I don't think, for a second, that a helicopter's fan can only cut off a sleeve of someone while getting centimeters close to her. But, for the sake of an action scene, I'll forget about this. Nevertheless I won't forget that the movie's evil man, played by Bill Paxton, returns to the same place where he went into big accident a few years ago, near to the man who he killed his wife ! Cheeky ? Maybe. Odd ? Full Yes !I liked that, finally, a Muslim character was shown in a Hollywood movie without the forever usual dealing (being a heartless brainless terrorist !). I suppose that was for putting wildly different characters together. Especially, when that character, of a Pakistani religious solder, joins forces with an Australian nihilist playboy. Btw, the Islamic prayer's moves weren't done rightly. Clearly they needed an expert on the set for that.Izabella Scorupco is no less than great, as an actress or a beauty. I don't know, and eager to know, why she was exiled from movies ? Because within nearly 20 years, after her first starring role in Golden Eye, she made something like 5 movies ! Being a James Bond girl was sure a problem more than a blessing. It's embarrassing that even when she got work, like in here, it was with Golden Eye's director, Martin Campbell. As if no one else wants to work with her ! (she even was offered the lead female role in The Mask of Zorro (1998), for the same director, but turned it down). Otherwise, she doesn't like acting !So, I'm a big fan of this movie, its script, directing (and Scorupco!). But, in the same time, I hate some points, on their top is the sense of laziness at the second act's writing; it's where this fine action leaned toward being an easy slasher. The final verdict  The bad points turned out to be light, and this is a real classic movie. The authentic trailer is one of the best as well.

It isn't a climbing guide and it's not meant to be. I really don't know what people want from a film these days. Reality TV seems to have rotted people's brains. This is FICTION. Enjoy it on it's own escapist level, or don't watch it. In fiction you can take certain liberties. That is why it's fiction. Taking up a sport as physically demanding as climbing because you saw a movie once is ridiculous.What's good Chris O'Donnell is a solid choice for leading man, and Robin Tunney doesn't disgrace herself as the single-minded sister. Scott Glenn is the standout as the reclusive loner, but he doesn't really have enough screen time. It was also frankly a relief to see the Pakistani characters, although minor, treated with some respect, making them reasonable, reasoning men.The problems Far too many crises. Avalanches, explosions, the helicopter nearly cutting someone to ribbons, the list never ends, and as characters just keep dying you start to feel as though the punchline is just going to be more death and destruction. Which is a little wearisome. The script is also somewhat clich√©d. It's worth watching once, but this is certainly a movie I wouldn't go back to. Many of the minor characters are just there to die, so they are not especially well-fleshed out. The central 'villain' played by Bill Paxton is a pale shadow of what a villain should be. Contrast Michael Moriarty in Cliffhanger, but since the real 'villain' is meant to be the mountain, Paxton's character is not given enough substance to be more than a one note performance.All round, the film scores on beautiful scenery, but crucially falls down on the overloaded plot.

A mountaineer who walks around near the edge of a precipice without her backpack, all the while waving around her ice axe as if it weren't the primary tool intended to save her life in case of a fall. A different mountaineer who does not appear to make any effort at self-arrest (other than a lot of yelling) when he slips and starts sliding on a glacier. There are many examples.Here's the main problem. Why is it that, in real life, you can't take a bunch of people from K2 base camp and tell them to fetch some distressed hikers at 26,000 feet? The answer is lack of altitude acclimatization. In other words, these people would basically lie down and refuse to move (or at least come down with a severe case of altitude sickness, including headache, dizziness, and vomiting) about halfway up. But that wouldn't make for such a dramatic movie, would it? So we need to play down that angle, and instead work on some external dangers. Like the need to carry some canisters of extremely volatile nitroglycerin to the top of the mountain. (Of course, its extreme volatility is the primary reason why not a single military in the world actually uses the stuff - nor did for the last 100 years. At the very least, they'd use sawdust soaked with nitroglycerin, better known as dynamite because it's way easier to handle.)

So as I walked into O'Donnell's latest multi-million dollar picture Vertical Limit, lets just say I wasn't expecting much. After walking out of the same movie, the little I had been expecting was even more than Vertical Limit offered. Let's just get one thing straight Vertical Limit is a bad, bad, BAD movie. From the wooden acting to the wobbly sets, it's terrible from start to finish. The plot is weak, the script is a poor rip-off of Stallone's Cliffhanger and as for the special effects- I've seen better results from cut up cornflake packets and PVA glue on Blue Peter.We start with Peter Garrett (O'Donnell), sister Annie (Tunney) and their father climbing up some cardboard and polystyrene&#133; oops sorry- incredibly realistic rock face. Some amateur climbers above them slip off the face and fall to their deaths while their ropes accidentally entangle with our heroes. We're left with Annie, Peter and their dad all suspended from one rope with the hook beginning to fall out of the cliff. Their father, tells Peter to cut the rope and sacrifice his life to save his own and his sister's.From there we cut to &#145;three years later&#133;' Peter and Annie have survived and Annie is attempting to climb one of the most dangerous mountains in the world &#150; K2 in Pakistan. Her brother has given up climbing after being blamed for their father's death by his sister, they've barely spoken in the time since. Yep, you've guessed it; her party gets into trouble and estranged brother O'Donnell vows to save his sister because he couldn't save his dad. Altogether now, arrrr&#133;There are many problems with this film, but possibly the biggest one is why the audience are meant to empathise with O'Donnell trying to save his sister at the expense of multiple other lives. It wouldn't be so bad if her character had been developed into a nice person to begin with but with all her constant whinging and whining, it's clear that she's a big pain to begin with.Most of the climbing scenes are terribly unlikely and inaccurate, take for example climbing K2 with just one rope between each pair. On top of that, if you decide to climb one of the world's most treacherous peaks when you know a storm is approaching, quite frankly you deserve all you get!There are few saving graces, only the comedic Australian duo spring to mind, but they don't last long enough to save the film.The script is weak, the acting is poor, there are too many clich√©s and as for the set (especially in the opening scene), Jordan's chest looks more realistic.

I'm lost, staring at the screen in utter amazement.  What beauty!  What photography!  Unfortunately, within a few seconds, an enormous bird glides onto the screen.  It was probably meant to be a hawk, but it's so poorly made you can't be sure.  You would think in this day of amazing digital capabilities, they could at least afford a realistic looking bird.The rest of Vertical Limit continues in this manner.  Sure, there are moments of extreme grandeur, but they're always interrupted by something so horribly fake that it's simply painful.  The result is one of the most bloated films I've ever seen.  Everything is either overdone or done poorly.  Take the script.  Or better yet, don't.  Besides the fact that it's completely illogical and chock full of cliches, the basical story is dead on its feet.  The heroic rescue team risks its life to save their friends is certainly serviceable.  The idea of six people strapping nitroglycerine to their backs is not.  There's also James Newton Howard's soundtrack, which is so bad to the point of being offensive.  It's obvious that Vertical Limit is intended for people of limited mental capacity, and the musical score confirms this.  Nothing of any interest can happen without a dramatic flurry from the orchestra.  In fact, it's not just when something interesting is going on.  It's all the time.  I'm thinking of one particular instance where there is nothing going on at all, and suddenly there's a Titanic-esque panflute solo.  Come on, people.  This is ridiculous.Martin Campbell knows how to direct.  (Remember Mask of Zorro?)  Here I guess he simply chose not to.  Actually, that's not quite fair.  He deserves some praise for making a movie that, for the most part, looks really good.  Or maybe this is just because of the camera work, which is as stunning as it is overdone.  Yes, that's it.  It's the camera work.  What Campbell did manage to do is get terrible performances from a very capable cast.  Not that I can blame them in the least.  When the material you're given to work with is this bad, decent acting isn't a possibility.Vertical Limit tries to be everything and ends up being nothing.  There are parts that are clearly aimed at being exciting, engaging, or romantic, but they fail across the board.  If your reason for going to the movie theater is to have your intelligence insulted for almost two hours, then this is clearly the film for you.* 1/2 (out of ****) "},{"Title":"predictable boring and unbelievable","Date":"14 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  The acting in this piece was formulaic and uninspiring - none of the characters were developed and the tragic start to the film (the fathers death) had little bearing on the character development of the children.

It has a clear objective, well defined villain and hero, some internal conflicts that periodically rears its ugly head, and a formula ending.  The acting is good especially Chris O'Donnelland Robin Tunney as brother and sister. Taking from the book, Into Thin Air about men who mistakenly think they can conquer Mother Nature, the film explores the mountain climber's risk taking psyche, their male brotherhood rivalries as well as an ethic of self-survival that runs counter to love and loyalty.   But the heart of the film is the action scenes with breath-taking shots of an awesome avalanche approaching tiny mountaineers, of sheer ice that breaks and consumes, and of the precipice before a huge fall.  There is even a double sequence involving the almost impossible retrieval of a life-sustaining backpack and the desperate efforts of two people to save themselves after falling off the edge.  Never mind that in some of the most intense scenes - the father and his two children dangling off the side of the mountain, the female climber who has just lost her partner and fights to stay on, and the final rescue beyond the vertical limit of human endurance - everyone who survives is instantly recovered and brought back.  Think of an action thriller which truly had a central message, The Poseidon Adventure, and you can see how Vertical Limit hems and haws but falls short.  The issue of the commercialism of the mountain climb and how that was doomed to fail would be a red herring.  Rather it is the issue of self survival and how the film delicately walks all around it that ultimately demeans it.  It wants to be brave and say cut the rope, exsanguinate the dead, ration the dexamethasone but it also wants to leave room for error, for that emotional break that overrules whatever is rational.  Enjoy Vertical Limit for entertaining escapism, not for any measure of insight.

I liked VERTICAL LIMIT also, not as much as those other Campbell films, but enough to feel like my 6 dollars were well spent (I saw a matinee show).However, at 100 million dollars, I think the film is underproduced.  First of all, why it was decided not to photograph a big screen adventure like this in scope beats me.  Campbell is a master at using the wide, wide screen in spectacular ways and LIMIT, restricted to the 1.851 aspect ratio, feels claustrophobic and unexpansive despite the locales it supposedly takes place in.Second, while some may like the special effects in the movie, in my book the film suffers from too much digitalization and too many obvious CGI's.  The helicopter scene, with the characters hanging on for dear life thousands of feet above ground, is obviously filmed on a set that's lit like a set with a cyclorama that looks like a cyclorama.  Something similar happens with the opening sequence in Utah (just compare the obvious artificial quality here with, say, the opening rock climbing scene in MI2).There are literally hundreds of shots in the movie that are obviously shot in the studio's green room and later composited with live action backgrounds that look artificial -- too digital, if you will.  (These, folks, are the kinds of shots we'll be looking at years from now saying, Wow, did we really buy that back then? like we do when we see films like THE MOUNTAIN today).  Campbell is a master action filmmaker and has such a good sense of how to photograph action sequences that you almost forget you're watching phoniness most of the time.  But still...Finally, Chris O'Donnell is too puppyish for this part.  He looks good, and acts alright, but the film would have benefited from a bonafide film star like Brad Pitt or Matt Damon.All of this notwithstanding, VERTICAL LIMIT is better than most movies out there and well worth the price of admission.

Chris O'Donnell stars as Peter Garrett, a professional photographer for National Geographic who we see in the opening scene climbing one of those tall mesas in Utah with his sister Annie (Robin Tunney), their father (Stuart Wilson), and two other climbers. A tragic occurrence befalls them. Fast forward to three years later, when Annie plans on taking a rich Texas tycoon (Bill Paxton) up K2, the second tallest mountain in the world. Things don't go according to plan. A storm gets in their way, and they end up falling into a cave. Through morse code, Peter finds out his sister and a few others are still alive. He then gathers a team of climbers to help him go up the mountain and rescue the people trapped in the cave. Vertical Limit reminded me somewhat of Sylvester Stallone's excellent 1993 action movie Cliffhanger with its beautiful scenery and mountain climbing. It's not as good as the Stallone picture, but Vertical Limit is very well done. Director Martin Campbell, who directed the very good 1995 James Bond thriller Goldeneye, does an terrific job with directing action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat (I know I was). The cinematography is gorgeous, and the stuntwork outstanding. Portions of the story is the only weak link in Vertical Limit. There were some parts in the story that were kind of ridiculous, but it's only a minor problem. The performances are good though. It's nice to see Chris O'Donnell in a good movie again. He hasn't made a good film in five years since Batman Forever, and he's very good here in Vertical Limit as the one who does everything he can to save his sister from the jaws of death on the mountain. Other good performances are turned in by Tunney as the sister; Scott Glenn (looking bizarre) as a long-haired Zen climber; and Izabella Scorupco (who played the good Bond girl in Campbell's Goldeneye) as a French-Canadian climbing nurse. Only Paxton (who's usually good in most of the films he's starred in) comes off negative. He's not all that convincing as the heartless tycoon. Aside from that and some of the story, Vertical Limit is a very good adventure movie that definitely had me on the edge of my seat.

Chris O'Donnell plays a former mountaineer who returns to climbing in order to save his sister (Robin Tunney) and two other climbers (Bill Paxton included) who are left stranded due to a storm on the most difficult mountain in the world, K2.  Along for the ride are a wild-eyed veteran (Scott Glenn), a local climber who lost his cousin in the storm, a somewhat mysterious female climber, and two crazy brothers who are there simply to provide comic relief (and do so successfully).Indeed, the strong points of this film are the humor and, of course, the action sequences.  Director Martin Campbell, who showed what he can do with a good script on The Mask of Zorro, films the tense climbing scenes very, very well.  Admittedly, there are a few too many sequences where a lone climber is left hanging by a couple of fingers but, again, this is a script problem, not a directing problem.  The only real shortcoming with the directing is that the surroundings aren't used the way they could be.  The climbers are on the most difficult, and one of the tallest, mountains in the world.  Yet, it always seems that they are in a tight space.  There are very few wide shots that truly show the expansiveness of the area.  During the few shots of this type found in the movie, the viewer is left breathless. It's a shame there weren't more.  Campbell also does a fine job of pulling out good performances from actors and actresses who didn't get much to work with.  Bill Paxton is his usual wooden self, but the rest of the cast, especially O'Donnell and Tunney, give fine performances.  Campbell is a highly capable director who can do both action, which he showed in Goldeneye, and drama, which he wonderfully displayed in Zorro.  A good script could put this guy on Hollywood's A-List of filmmakers.This movie is certainly not a great film dramatically (again, a script problem), but from a pure action standpoint, it is hard to top from recent memory.  It brings to mind another recent disaster film, The Perfect Storm. Both provide terrific action, but fall somewhat short elsewhere.  Still, Vertical Limit is a really fun escape.

It was entertaining, but that's pretty much all that could be said for it. The dialogue is on par with modern B flicks like 'Bats' and 'Bad Moon', the direction (by the talented Martin Campbell) was way off, and it's obvious that there were a lot of problems during production. Why do I say this? It looks like they went with an early, unfinished cut, and that the production team just wanted to get it over with and go on to bigger and better things, and didn't even bother to do more than a take or two, so ultimately the entire film has this crude, unpolished look to it.Piling on the criticism, did anyone even bother to hire anyone to monitor the continuity in this movie?? I mean, even my films have fewer small problems with it than this. For starters, the entire thing takes place above 26,000 feet in the middle of the snowstorm, but not once is the characters' breath visible, and it makes you feel like you're in the tropics, even though all of the faces are constantly frozen, everyone's always shaking so much that it's almost nauseating, and wearing a ton of heavy clothes-- but you don't see their breath. Additionally, there a ton (literally) of small errors and places where computer effects are obviously added in. For example, one scene has a shot of the midday sun, and tracks out to reveal that the camera is actually inside a hut looking out a barred skylight, but when the sun is supposed to go behind the bar, the special effects/cgi crew apparently forgot to actually put the sun behind the bar, so it just goes over top of it and looks fake beyond words.The dialogue is unbelievably bad for a movie that had an estimated budget of over a hundred million dollars. A four year old could've written a better script. The characters aren't really flushed out, and other than the two main characters (Peter and Annie Garrett), you barely know the names or faces of the others, and feel for them or generally care when they run into the inevitable troubles that seem to happen in every climbing movie. The villain of the piece doesn't emerge until minutes from the end, and never is actually very menacing, it seems he was just made into a villain to spice things up a bit... as if the mountain wasn't bad enough already.I know it sounds like I've absolutely trashed this movie, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. The stunts and locations were stunning, and rare action scene that actually worked was exhilarating... but that wasn't often enough. The acting was surprisingly good for a script this bad, Scott Glenn being the stand out. He was given one of the weakest, most two dimensional character in the piece and almost succeeded in making Montgomery Wick fun to watch.There's no doubt that this had potential, but it is little more than a bloated disappointment. It runs way too long, takes forever for anything to happen, and is generally, well, bad. This film supposedly went way over budget during production, but it doesn't really show. Only a few shots actually had a high gloss, refined look to them, and a more efficient director could've made the film on far less. A really good climbing movie still has yet to be made, as neither 'Cliffhanger' or 'K2' were really all that good, and this sure doesn't fit the bill.Entertaining, but little else. It's better to stay away from it, especially after it leaves theaters, where at least the action and scenery seem impressive.4.5/10 "},{"Title":"Vertical Limit keeps you on the edge of your seat.","Date":"9 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  When I saw the previews for `Vertical Limit,' I was really impressed with all the action.

The story basically starts out with a tragedy very similar to the one that occurred at the beginning of the film Cliffhanger. Years later (of course) the sister who was involved with said accident is still climbing, while her brother has pretty much given it up. Well, the sister is part of a group trying to climb this super mountain that the one millionaire in the group tried before, but had a lot of misfortune as a guide died and he barely got off alive. Well they soon get stuck in some ice caverns near the top and a rescue mission involving a lot of people forms. And most of these people are going to die in great slow motion fashion like in the film Cliffhanger the movie would probably be better titled many deaths on the mountain. The ending is fairly predictable as well, with more deaths making the whole rescue effort and all the sacrifice pretty much for one person. The acting is bland as we get Chris O'Donnell who I have not seen in anything since this movie and Bill Paxton who seemingly appears in any movie. The scenery steals the show, and there are some good action sequences here and there to make the movie watchable. I also learned a lot about what edema is.

Overlong at two hours, and at times too talky, Vertical Limit just about manages to rise above its sign posted formula to produce an effective popcorn thriller. The action sequences, once they arrive in the second half, come in rapid fire succession and are very well constructed by Campbell and his team. While Tattersall's work at Monument Valley, Pakistan and New Zealand is worthy of the rental alone. The question is if viewers can get past the first hour,? where loads of base campers ponder dangers and personal complexities, or perhaps more importantly,? if the barely adequate acting of Tunney & O'Donnell can stop you from wanting to free-fall off of your local cliff face? The inadequacies of the pair is more noticeable due to the presence of Paxton reliable as ever and Scott Glenn in the support cast. Glenn is the best thing in the movie, his grizzled, hurt, man with a mission climber, Montgomery Wick, holds the attention and offers up a more interesting emotional thread than the telegraphed one involving the siblings.A mixed bag but certainly an entertaining enough one if you hang on in there. 5.5/10 "},{"Title":"Corny","Date":"8 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Peter (Chris O'Donnell) and Annie (Robin Tunney) are brother and sister who once shared a tragic mountain climbing experience.

Based upon that, I'd have to say that a lot of the climbing scenes in this movie are silly (1) The movie suggests that Elliott, Tom and Annie summit from base camp in one day. That is simply not possible. (2) Everyone is looking way too fresh, considering the altitude at which they are at. (3) None of the climbers or the rescue teams seems to need to acclimatize.

If you don't fall asleep, you'll find yourself laughing at the pitiful attempts at convincing performances by pretty much all involved. The special effects are decent at best. The intensity is lacking due to poor acting and even worse character development. I never felt for any of the characters, since all of them are poorly acted, the better part of them are clich√©s and stereotypes, half of them are just there for comic relief(promised but not delivered) and the fewest of them are even slightly interesting.

In this case they can't. This movie is so stupid that no amount of fancy stunts and effects is going to save it. First of all, nearly all characters are supposedly experienced mountaineers, but it's clear that not a single one of them knows a thing about alpinism. Every law of physics is completely ignored, as we see people jump over huge chasms and grab hold of the other side without any kind of problems, we see nitroglycerin that gets set off by sunlight but not by people that perform all kinds of crazy jumps with the same nitro strapped to their backs and much much more. I laughed myself to death when the nitro finally exploded and created an explosion that a tactical nuclear weapon would be proud of. All of this wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. Going over the top with action is OK, as long as the movie knows it's over the top. Instead, we get a movie that tries to pass itself of as realistic we get an overly serious and clich√©-ridden plot filled with boring and predictable characters. Everything is there, from the traumatic experience at the start to the obligatory love interest and the occasional comic relief in the form of two Australian hippies. Throw in some corny and melodramatic one-liners (on this mountain you're not dying, you're already dead) and you've got an yawn-inducing two-hour soap episode that happens to be set on a mountain.They couldn't even do the effects right...some of the shots are so clearly shot in front of a blue screen that it's a disgrace for a 21st century movie. In a '60s Bond film, the blue screen was charming. Nowadays, it's just sloppy. Anyway, I could go on for a while like this but the bottom line is that Vertical Limit is a movie with utterly ridiculous action, huge leaps in logic, and a tired and boring plot, without offering anything to make up for that.

It could just as easily be retitled Disbelief Limit, for it does indeed push the boundaries of audience acceptance to new limits with its outrageously improbable storyline and plot developments.The story follows a mentally scarred climber (O'Donnell) who has not scaled a peak since the ill-fated expedition which saw him have to cut his father's rope (thus killing poor old pa) in order to save his sister (Tunney). Years later, sister Tunney is climbing K2 when her team is hit by a freak avalanche and trapped in an underground tomb. O'Donnell enlists an eclectic rescue team to get her out before she runs out of oxygen. Members of the crew include mountain guru Scott Glenn, seething after his wife died on an under prepared ascent; doctor Isabella Scorupco, in it to prove that she can; a couple of boozy Aussies, who want the money and have a carefree attitude to life anyway.There are spectacular moments in this film, but few touch on reality. Scorupco's escape from a terrifying bomb blast, followed by the subsequent avalanche, with just a broken finger is pretty hard to swallow. The contrivance in the plot which requires each climber to wear a nitra-bomb on his back seems unconvincing, and in many ways is a plagiarised plot device from Wages of Fear. The dramatic helicopter sequence looks fake, and I'm quite certain that no-one could hang on so valiantly if it were to happen in reality. However, Vertical Limit has the courage to roll with its ludicrous moments and treats them as part of the fun. So, if you watch the film as a fun experience, and remember to leave your brain and your need for plausibility at the door, then there is a couple of hours worth of entertainment to be had here.

I saw some TV movie about a climbers group lost in the hymalayas that was even better then this, with all its technincal tricks. they are so contradicting themselves in it. SPOILERS!! In the beginning they said that it's not worth sacrifying the lives of 6 people to save 3 of them!!!! And then, in the end, 3 persons only survived. Now what was that good for. This was a nonsense idea from the beginning and they should just have left them in the mountains. This just makes the whole movie so unrealistic, and i'm not talking because i am taking this to seriously. not at all. i hesitated for a while to watch it at all, so i knew what i was probably going for. They were really behaving like on a boyscouts camp-tour at the age of 6, smoking near some nitro,.... I was wondering why now one has fallen over his own feet yet???? And then the poor 3 people in that hole had only 6 hours to go and peter and blondie had to have a very dramatic talk about why she wants to leave the camp. WHO CARES AT THAT MOMENT?????And then there where these ultra funny scenes, where i didn't really know whether there was supposed to be some humour with them or not. like for instance, all at the beginning when the father fell to the ground, like a rock, sorry this was probably supposed to make everyone cry but i just thought i was going for some scary movie parody. and then the long lost girlfriend of old yeti standing there all frozen, looking like a plastic doll (shame to the costume and makeup artists). Whow, and that huge blood stain in the end, all from this tiny little plastic bag? And monique carrying 4 adults at one point in the end, how is this supposed to work for a woman who apparently is NOT a body builder?  well i could go on forever,...but prefer to watch a good movie instead.

He's there taking pictures for National Geographic, while she's part of a team created by billionaire Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) to head to the summit as part of a publicity stunt for his new airline. When they near the top, the weather takes a turn for the worse, and just when they decide to head back down the mountain, Annie falls into a crevice, followed by Elliot and lead climber Tom McLaren, while an avalanche takes out most of the team. Peter decides to risk a quick climb up the mountain to save his sister, and takes along Mongomery Wick (Scott Glenn), an old time climber, and friend of his father. Along with 4 other team members, the 6 of them must risk their own lives, to save the others, with time not on their side.   The action sequences in the film were amazing. Very realistic looking, and very dangerous. The biggest problem I had was that every time something exciting would happen, the director would cut away to another story line which slowed down the pace. It was very stop and go for most of the movie. The opening sequence was very poor in my opinion. It reminded me a lot of the opening to Mission Impossible 2, just not as well done. And we all knew their father was going to die, but was it really necessary to show him hitting the ground? The entire opening just didn't feel right. Then the movie got very slow as got to meet the rest of the characters. I didn't really care for any of them, since we really never got to know any of them. We were just introduced to them, then they went on their business. Once they started the rescue mission however, at about an hour into the film, things started to pick up. Watching the three teams of two climb the mountain, and all the pitfalls that occurred, was very exciting. It's hard to describe action sequences, but rest assured, they all looked and felt very real. And there were a lot of explosions to keep things interesting. But as I said earlier, for every exciting action moment, they would cut back to the three trapped in the mountain, where most of the time they would be coughing. It slowed down the pace of the movie tremendously. While it is necessary to go back and 'check up on' the rest of the characters, it needs to be paced better, so the movie doesn't slow down as much as it did.The characters weren't very interesting, other than Paxton's billionaire who had his moments. Peter and Annie I didn't care for too much, while Wick was just another strange guy who enjoyed climbing mountains. His story line dealing with his wife and her death upon the mountain didn't move me too much. Vaughn on the other hand was interesting. He had this look of madness in his eyes that I wish had come out more. He did snap on one occasion, but other than that, it was more of a fury in his eyes. Some of the supporting characters were OK, like the two brothers who enjoyed sunbathing nude on the mountain, but they weren't explored very well. And sometimes you couldn't understand what they were saying. Then there was the strange romance between Peter and Monique (Izabella Scorupco). Where the hell did that come from?So overall, if you're looking for some really good action, take a look at Vertical Limit. But if you're looking for a good story, don't bother.

I had a feeling I was in for a hack film at the opening shots of Monument Valley. An eagle flies through the landscape. In the close up, it is clear it is a computer mock-up of an eagle. It is so poorly done, it looks like Mothra attacking Godzilla.The plot is pedestrian and predictable. The 'cliffhanger' action sequences are so incredibly contrived they evoke laughter instead of chills. Teenagers will no doubt enjoy it but it is third rate tripe not worthy of the acting talents of Scott Glenn. Robin Tunney as the sister stranded on the mountain is embarrassingly amateurish. The only strong actor in the film is the Izabella Scorupco in the role of the French-Canadian climber.Did the screenwriters even reread what they had written? The lost climbers have 22 hours to live. It will take the rescuers 27 hours to find them. They need the crusty veteran (they should have called him Quint) to help them climb quickly as he knows the mountain. So they get within 3 or 4 hours of the lost climbers and they stop and pitch tents and have a nap. Come on!I stopped the DVD when Chris O'Donnell is saying Welcome back to his sister. They didn't even mention the fact that four people died to save her stupid butt. Five if you count her Dad at the beginning.I can't believe people spend millions of dollars on such amateurish pap.If you have rented the DVD already, your money isn't wasted. Watch the National Geographic special on K2 that is in the Special Features section. It is the only thing worth watching.

After seeing the previews I knew that it wouldn't be something that I would like.  I do have to say that I love climbing movies and I do a lot of climbing myself. I do have quite a lot of knowledge in High Altitude climbing, though I have never been there.The movie was too unreal.  I like movies that have at least some hope of reality but this went beyond that.  Let me lay out for you everything that is to unreal about the movie.1.)  Base camp parties with beer and over 100 people never happen. 2.)  Helicopters cannot fly as high as they did in the movie. 3.)  After 30-45 minutes in a crevasse you freeze to death and   therefore your dead.  Unlike the couple days in the movie. 4.)  No bottled oxygen for any of the climbers the entire movie.  Only a few people in the world can climb at that altitude without oxygen. 5.)  No sherpas the entire movie to haul gear.  It just all appeared. 6.)  Jumping off cliffs and dangling from ice axes is Hollywood. 7.)  People can't live at high altitudes unlike one man in the movie. 8.)  Real climbers where entire jump suits with about 5 other layers of clothing.  These climbers, or should I say actors in the movie had about one layer on that was thin with no insulation. 9.)  You can see your breath because it is so cold in the mountains.  Not once did we see anyone's breath, even in the crevasse.Well, now that I am done complaining about the movie, I do have to say that it was entertaining but predictable.  I basically predicted every major part of the movie.  If you like movies that are real and have REAL action, then you won't like this.  But, if you are sucked in my Hollywood and like anything entertaining, then you will like Vertical Limit.  If you want to see a good climbing movie involving K2, watch the movie called K2.  It is old but still good.So to rap this up, Vertical Limit was truly a disappointment to me.  I can't believe how badly they portrayed High Altitude climbing and how bad of a disgrace it is to the real High Altitude climbers.  Don't go to this movie and send Hollywood a message that unreal climbing crap like this, is not good.

The mountain was such a beautiful set, and a formidable adversary, but this Hollywood treatment seemed to cheapen the mountain and the image of the sport itself by failing to portray the inner landscape of its characters.Vertical Limit was good at presenting defining moments for the main characters.  The unforgiving environment of high-altitude climbing is good for that kind of thing.  If you were able to suspend your disbelief long enough to put yourself in the shoes of the characters, it should have been possible to get lost in the film.Unfortunately, the characters never got developed enough to empathize with them, nor does one have any time to reflect anyone's predicament.  There was so much emphasis on a string of suspense sequences that stretched from one end of the film to the other, that the script never really got a chance to work at the character level...  The film had all of the elements, competently executed, that a good adventure film should have-- an excellent inciting incident, a pure and noble motive for the main character, a series of risks that the protagonists must overcome...  in short, a textbook script.What it lacked was heart.  Peter and Annie are brother and sister who look at each other like lost lovers when they meet at K2 base camp. And Peter's love interest, the supermodel nurse, has no palpable chemistry at all with Peter, so when she kisses him on the lips at the end in a kind of a boring end-of-movie-substitute-for-an-embrace, it looks forced.Twice, Peter and the Nurse met, and you could tell they were supposed to be baring their souls to each other in a gesture or an anecdote, and yet the scenes came off cold.  Someone decided this movie was about the mountain, and that it wasn't important to get these kinds of scenes right. The characters were secondary.  But the characters should never be secondary.

The suspense scenes work very, very well and will make you jump. Alfred Hitchcock once said, If a bunch of guys are sitting around a table playing poker, and a bomb explodes under the table, that's a shock.  A cheap shock.  If the camera tilts under the table, allowing the audience to see the bomb slowly ticking away, followed by the explosion, then that is suspense.

And of course the movie is completely technical inaccurate but that doesn't really matter, at least that is what makes the movie entertaining to watch.Visually the movie also isn't perfect. Sure it has some nice scenery but the special effects are pretty disappointing, especially in the beginning.Still the movie is not a complete wreck, it still has some nice and even exciting moments and the musical score by James Newton Howard is also surprising good and so is the excellent camera work from David Tattersall.

Chris O'Donnell was ostensibly the star of the movie as Peter Garrett, a wildlife photographer for National Geographic who organizes the rescue of the team which included his sister Annie, played by Robin Tunney. Neither O'Donnell nor Tunney exactly captivated me. I was much more taken by Scott Glenn's performance as Montgomery Wick, the reclusive mountain climber who ends up leading the rescue mission. But this was a good ensemble cast. No one really took over, but everyone held up their end.All sorts of subplots spin around in this. Questions of who should live and who should die when not everyone can make it; issues of greed taking priority over safety and good sense; the complicated brother-sister relationship of Peter and Annie. It all worked well. I'm not usually a great fan of adventure movies, but this is a must see - and even if you end up not liking the story, it's a must see even if only for the spectacular photography.Personally, though, I can't think of anything not to like in this, and I rate it as a 10/10.

It is just a string of unbelievable, disconnected exciting sequences.Halfway through the movie, I would start laughing as a new cliffhanger developed. I waited to see how many ludicrous elements the director and writers could pile on (he's hanging from his ice axe over a cliff, the cornice is breaking; now the woman is hanging, and he's hanging off of her; now the nitro explodes; now an avalanche comes). But at the end of each sequence, someone is either saved or dead, and we move on as if nothing happened....Great action directors know how to build excitement on top of excitement, with a rhythm. Each situation, while locally resolved, contributes to an even larger tension, until the audience is sitting at the edges of their seats.Vertical Limit fails utterly to compound the tension of its action sequences.

An accident causes him to cut the rope and send his father to his death in order to save his life and that of his sister. That scene is well filmed and exhilarating and director Martin Campbell certainly sets out his stall.Three years later Tunney is on an expedition to climb K2 with a publicity seeking billionaire (Bill Paxton). She has reunited with O'Donnell who is now a nature photographer in Pakistan.However Paxton takes unnecessary risks leaving his team trapped when the weather turns and O'Donnell leads a rescue effort where they plan to use nitroglycerin to blast their way into the crevice where the climbers are trapped. Included in the team is grizzled Scott Glenn who is suspicious of Paxton as he blames him for taking risks on previous expeditions which lead to the death of his wife.The problem is by then the film gets sillier and sillier. Paxton reveals his true colours as a cold hearted egoist, the rescue team gets whittled down through mishaps, explosions and avalanches. Glenn finds a large frozen Popsicle and O'Donnell get superhuman powers to be able to jump from one part of the mountain to another armed with two axes.Despite the silliness, cardboard characters and absurd sequences Martin Campbell keeps the film entertaining but some of the green screen effects could had been better.

Unfortunately, a movie with nothing but pyrotechnics is basically a video game without the interactivity or role playing.There is a cast, of course, but it's a curious and unfortunate one. Scott Glenn's stoic, haunted climbing veteran is the most successful casting choice. Bill Paxton is the curious call here, drawing the heavy card for one of the few times in his career. But Chris O'Donnell lacks the chops to carry a film like this. Most of the other actors at least look like they're exerting themselves, but you'd never know his character is at 23,000 feet, much less trying to rescue his sister. The script is a litany of every disaster movie clich√© of the past 40 years. The Eiger Sanction and even Cliffhanger are marvels of restraint by comparison.

In the first scene Dad urges his kids, played by Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney, to cut the rope holding them together and send him plummeting to his death off the side of a mountain--because why should three die if two could live. Fair point, which is echoed in the film's climactic scene. However, when Robin Tunney's character and two others become trapped on a mountain with little chance of survival, Chris O'Donnell and five others set out to save her on what ultimately becomes a suicide mission for four of the six. As only Robin Tunney's character is saved from the three trapped on the mountain, that means four people died so that one could live.So is the point of the movie that some lives are more important than others--in that sometimes four people have to die to save one life? Or did the movie completely miss the point that it was trying to make--that sometimes you have to let people die to minimize the ultimate amount of casualties? Four people would've been alive if Chris O'Donnell's character had just let his sister die. I think the message got lost.I doubt anyone who reads this will find this review helpful.

A rescue team is assembled; it is to be led by Montgomery Wick, a climber who lost his wife on Vaughn's first summit attempt. At 26,000' the three survivors can't last long so it is a race against time for the rescue party as they head up the deadly mountain&#x85; and if that wasn't dangerous enough they are carrying unstable nitroglycerine so they can blast open the sealed crevasse!This is a solid enough film with plenty of exciting moments&#x85; it is also a bit too melodramatic. Set on K2, a mountain that kills a fifth of all people who try to climb it there seemed little reason to add the extra dangers of a man who would kill to save his own skin and having the rescue team carry large canisters full of nitroglycerine! If you can get past that the film is fun and has some absolutely stunning scenery, New Zealand's Southern Alps doubling for the Karakoram Mountains. The acting is okay but lacks star presence&#x85; Scott Glenn, who plays the grizzled Wicks, is the best known person in it and he is the most interesting character&#x85; the rest are a bit bland.

Conversely, it's also one of the many reasons I try to stay in bed for as long as possible. The medium has successfully made me afraid of rollercoasters (Final Destination 3), planes (too many to count), desert ground (the Tremors franchise), trains (Unstoppable), the woods (almost every horror film ever made), clowns (Stephen King's It), among countless others.Add Martin Campbell's Vertical Limit to the above list for its depiction of snowy mountains and mountain-climbing, another activity I'll never be able to indulge in thanks to the paranoia bestowed upon me by the film. If possible, I'd like to see the correlation for Americans' participation in mountain-climbing after the release of Vertical Limit just to see if I'm not the only soul who felt the need to stay away from anything large, snowy, and with a peak.Vertical Limit is a b-movie manufactured by the likes of Hollywood, who sometimes know how to make a good film of the genre and sometimes don't. While every now and then the industry throws out something like this or Eight Legged Freaks, it also was hellbent, for a while, on remaking several classic seventies disaster films such as Flight of the Phoenix and even The Poseidon Adventure.While often advantageous with the direction and the filmmaking aesthetics, Hollywood has often been miserably bad at giving their film's relatable, believable characters that don't feel like anything more than the pawn of a big-budget disaster flick. This is sadly the case for Vertical Limit, with writers Robert King and Terry Hayes shortchanging characters and relationships and instead making the picture largely about its characters dangling from high-altitudes with scenes involving forced, unremarkable dialog are spliced in for good measure.The story centers around experienced climber Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell), who lost his father during a climbing trip gone wrong and has now lived with the guilt and responsibility of his death for many years now. Six years later, we see he is retired from climbing, while his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and a group of her teammates are still persistent with their climbing ambitions as they plan to climb up the treacherous K2 mountain in Pakistan. Annie climbs with the founder of the trip, Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) along with his friend Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea), who instantly find that the weather has a lot to be desired. The wind is brutal and the conditions are almost blinding thanks to the blowing and drifting snow.Eventually, an avalanche occurs, trapping Annie, Elliot, and Tom in a cave, hurt, cold, and undernourished. Due to Peter's experience, he decides to form a group of equally-experienced climbers, all armed with nitroglycerin in case an explosion to create a hole in the ground is necessary for rescue, to attempt to search for and return the band of climbers to safety as soon as possible. One character reckons they have about forty-eight hours to live, and since the first audible amount of time for survival in films is usually correct, think of that as the imaginary time-limit for the film.Right of the bat, Martin Campbell packs in exceptional direction with Vertical Limit, effectively showing off the mountainous regions, the treacherous conditions that come with the K2 expedition, as well as tricky aerial and midair shots of the environment for maximum effect. Campbell's directions is one of the strongest things in the picture, making the film a showcase for some of the most dangerous conditions possible while climbing a mountain.However, the lack of character-depth makes this film a task to watch at times. Consider the first half hour. After the incredibly intense opening scene, which lasts about five minutes and sort of sets the film up for suspense and potential it can't really match at any point in the future, the next twenty-five minutes are wasted on boring exchanges of dialog at a pre-climbing party. These scenes would be better if they involved some character development or at least some ideas to ping-pong back and forth, since without it we have no connection to these characters. We sit within arm's length of them the entire time.One can criticize the homebrew-style special effects if they must, however, I believe they emphasize what I was talking about earlier when it came down to the b-movie style the film was trying to achieve. Vertical Limit may not be a very strong film in the long-run, but there is an undeniable talent with Campbell's revealing and tricky direction, as well as a solid scene of intensity every now and again. But when a film focuses on an mountain expedition gone awry for two hours, one can only expect it to sour well before the film ends.Starring Chris O'Donnell, Bill Paxton, Robin Tunney, Nicholas Lea.

Fortunately, Annie's brother, Peter (Chris O'Donnell) is at base camp, and gathers a crew for a rescue mission, including a pretty nurse (Isabella Scorupco) and a mountain hermit (Scott Glenn). It's a race against time to find the trapped climbers before they die, if the mountain doesn't kill the rescuers first.Vertical Limit is an action movie, plain and simple. Complex plots and deep characterizations are not warranted nor expected. Good performances are not mandatory, but are always a plus. Once you understand that, Vertical Limit is a lot easier to enjoy, and a lot more fun.This is one of those movies that once it starts, it never lets up. It opens with a scene that would be breathtaking had it obviously not been faked (as it is, it's still pretty suspenseful). Then it sets up the plot, and it's off.The film keeps two stories running simultaneously the rescue mission, and the trapped climbers. It brings in other sequences as needed. Both stories are equally compelling, but in different ways. The rescue mission provides the excitement, while the trapped climbers provide the tension, and the backbone of the story.The cast is solid. Chris O'Donnell, despite not having an original role, fills Peter's shoes well. He's a guy who's easy to root for because he really cares about his sister, Annie. As his sister, Robin Tunney offers more than her cute looks. She's tough, and ably conveys her complex feelings towards her brother (the first scene explains this). Bill Paxton is great as the arrogant billionaire, whose hubris causes this whole mess. Scott Glenn is suitably mysterious as the reclusive Montgomery Wick. He's takes complete control, and is not a guy to be messed with. Of special note is Nicholas Lea, who plays Tom McLaren. For most of the movie, he's very sick, and getting worse. It takes skill to pull it off well, and Lea makes it work. It's heartbreaking to see him on screen. Isabella Scorupco doesn't have much to do, even though she's re-teaming with her GoldenEye director Martin Campbell. Steve Le Marquand and Ben Mendelsohn provide comic relief as the climbing brothers, though it's hard to understand what they are saying. The only member of the cast that doesn't work is Alexander Siddig; he's so noble he's dull.Martin Campbell is one of the masters of action films. He made the brilliant GoldenEye, and the equally brilliant but different Casino Royale. Campbell knows his stuff, and he creates some outstanding action sequences. The term nail-biter was coined for this kind of a movie, and most of the credit has to go to Campbell.It's not a classic thriller, but it's a good one.

A mountain climbing mishap results in the death of their father.The story would have worked better if quickly expiring father Stuart Wilson (as Royce Garrett) had persuaded Ms. Tunney to cut the rope, and save Mr. O'Donnell. This would have matched their later career choices; note, survivalist Tunney continues mountain climbing, while brother O'Donnell becomes a photographer. The gender reversal would have given an otherwise painfully ordinary script some real distinction, and it matches up with later events well.Still, you have a lot of excellent visual effects; and, extraordinary photography and location shooting by Mr. Campbell, with cinematographer David Tattersall. The film is set in New Zealand (as Pakistan). Immoral billionaire Bill Paxton (as Elliot Vaughn) and vengeful veteran Scott Glenn (as Montgomery Wick) try to give the story some weight.

I may have liked it during those two viewings (I'm not 100% sure), but while I watched it a third time, which was just last night, it failed to impress me, no doubt about it. Five or six years ago, I couldn't see any problems with Vertical Limit, but since then, I have obviously changed somewhat, and I think I am now more observant while watching movies.The movie begins with two siblings, Peter and Annie Garrett, climbing with their father, Royce. When it all goes wrong, it seems that the rope can't hold the three of them, so Royce, who is at the bottom, tells Peter, who is in the middle, to cut him loose (even though that would mean Royce's death), while Annie, at the top, begs him not to! Peter has a tough but quick decision to make, and decides to do what his father tells him. Years later, the two siblings are both in Pakistan at the same time. Peter is there to take pictures for National Geographic, while Annie is there to climb K2! Annie is still upset with her brother's decision to cut their father loose. However, after Peter learns that his sister is trapped, he is determined to climb up that dangerous mountain in an attempt to rescue her! That plot might make it sound like Vertical Limit is filled with excitement, but it's not. I occasionally found myself in mild suspense, but very briefly, it didn't last. Yes, there is a lot of action in the movie, but it just doesn't work. That is certainly not this action/thriller's only problem, another one being that the dialogue is fairly weak in parts. There's one part with a guy literally trying to kiss his a&# goodbye. Was this part supposed to be serious? I should hope not, but even if it was meant to be a joke, it's not funny! There's some excellent mountain scenery featured in the film, but that's not enough to make up for the many flaws. The movie is over two hours long, which doesn't help.Usually, I like movies with a lot of action in them, but this one in particular. While I don't absolutely loathe it, I can see why it doesn't have a very high IMDb rating. If you want a good, well-scripted action movie that can be taken seriously, and/or a guide to mountain climbing, Vertical Limit is not the film for you. I guess there are some ways that this movie can be enjoyed.

If I'd spent the full ticket price to see just this movie on a Saturday night, I think I might have been p*ssed.This is a great looking movie, with spectacular scenery and photography and astounding stunts. So if you turn your mind off and throat some serious beverage, munch some popcorn and soak it all in, you can enjoy it.But it is a stupid movie. The script piles absurdity upon absurdity, clich√© upon clich√©, and throws in plot elements straight out of a vaudeville mellerdramer, until you can't choke down even one more improbability or overwrought line. In particular, poor Bill Paxton is forced to play a ridiculous caricature of a sociopath billionaire who is both stupid enough to insist on risking his life for an ego boost AND cowardly/mean enough to kill a helpless member of his climbing party for more of the chemical that keeps them from dying of pulmonary edema. (I can't imagine Warren Buffet or Bill Gates doing that, or even Donald Trump.) And the whole thing with the nitroglycerin...uhhh,guys? Wouldn't someone in the Pakistani army KNOW that the nitro kept in their warehouse would blow up spontaneously if it got warm? Hmmmm? I mean, that IS why it was being kept in sealed containers away from the outside and sunlight in the first place, wasn't it??? Does anyone believe that once the Pakistani army guys opened up the storage unit where the containers were kept, that they would just LEAVE the thing open,with nitro sitting around in the open air for hours afterwards so they could discover (via violent explosion) that sunlight set the nitro off ? And if this stuff was from the Pakistani's munitions dump, wouldn't they also simply have a few sticks of dynamite lying around? There is one great throwaway line delivered by the Pakistani officer which almost carries the movie Well, 300 o'clock. Time to wake up the Indians, followed by the crash of artillery guns. It's a good, funny moment. There is also a nice bit with some 'field first aid' where Chris O'Donnell's character Peter distracts the nurse with a question and then unexpectedly resets her broken finger with a brutal yank in the middle of her answer; she howls in pain and bursts into tears. This was nicely done by both the actors. It was the most human and believable moment in the movie, because it was something that one climber might actually do for another on the side of a remote mountain. These two examples show that director and the writer were obviously capable good work - they just felt the movie had to be overblown and overwrought. It's kind of a shame.If I saw a DVD of Vertical Limit in a bargain bin for $5, I might go ahead and spring for it, to watch with friends on a Saturday night with several a lot of other similar movies. And VL is somewhat more watchable than the similarly themed Cliffhanger because no matter how match crap Chris O'Donnell may catch about being 'bland', he and Scott Glenn and Bill Paxton are still head and shoulders above Stallone as actors. (I like Stallone, but he's a body, not an actor.)===================================================== UPDATE (04/07/06) - well, oddly enough I did find a used copy for $6 and picked it up and watched it last night. I stand by my earlier remarks, although it's interesting to me that I actually like VL a little better now than I did back when I first saw it. I think it's because I knew where the good bits were coming up,so I had something to look forward to as the stupid bits went by. I still think Chis O'Donnell's performance in underrated here.

Although it does seem impossible for all these bad things to happen to one group of people, it's only a movie, and a rather good one at that.There are some flaws, as every movie has.  For instance, a woman (I've forgotten her name) is clinging to a cliff face and drops, only to be stopped by a protruding rock.  You can definitely tell she is held by a wire, as her hands grope around her waist and hold her up.  Along with that, she swings around a small crack in the face of the wall, her arm stretched out horizontally.  Some things are always going to be overlooked by the cast and crew, and we, as the viewers, have to take the bad with the good.  Let's not shoot these guys because of a few mistakes.Vertical Limit is a great movie, especially when seen in theaters.  It is very interesting to learn how everything works up at the vertical limit, how they climb, and that sort of thing.  The action is nice, and most of the time quite realistic.

Nothing more, nothing less. You can see it's stupidity in the trailer (remember the final jump!!) as well as it virtuosity (remember the final jump as well!!). Everything is exaggerated of course. The story will NEVER happen like this because NO real climber would do so many faults in a couple of hours. But that doesn't matter actually it is an ACTION flick. What DID you expect? It is fast, the special effects are well done to breathtaking. The opening sequence kicks ass compared with MI-2. And when you rent the DVD just watch the featurettes they had professional climbers you advised them and they ADMIT that all the catastrophes happening in the movie DID somehow happen before but not between just a couple of days. But honestly it doesn't matter! If you want to see real characters, a great plot and development of both than just go and see Magnolia. I am not dumb but i like a nice action flick which leaves me stunned after it's 120 thrilling and entertaining minutes. And Vertical Limit does that. That way it is not going to be my favourite movie of all time but a nice way to spend a Friday evening. Now i am going to watch Eyes Wide Shut again and guess i won't complain about it's weak special effects!

The 'Pakistani group' take it out of the sun, but the liquid is already flowing. Then they do something funny and begin to laugh and in the same moment, the liquid ignites and they disappear in a great explosion.Now I won't go further and explain the other scenes, where the actors show superhuman strength in jumping and holding their colleagues with one hand when they fell down.Well if you want a nice action movie, which is funny in many ways and has a few nice dialogues, and you don't mind such faults as I mentioned above, then go ahead and watch it.

This film is one of the exceptions.  `Vertical Limit' is a film that has such outstanding action, suspense and photography that its hackneyed story is barely a factor.  The story is about an improbable rescue mission on K2, the second highest mountain on the planet.  While writer Robert King tries weakly to throw some human interest into the screenplay, this film is all Martin Campbell.  Director Campbell is no stranger to the action adventure genre having hit with `Goldeneye' and `Mask of Zorro'.  From a directorial standpoint, this film exceeds both of his previous successes.Filmed in Campbell's native New Zealand, he gives us majestic backdrops and generally beautiful photography.  The action sequences are exciting and the climbing authentic.  All the actors went to climbing school and did most of their own climbing in the film despite never having climbed before.  The film was a logistical nightmare, with equipment and crew having to be flown daily to the mountaintop locations.  Weather constantly trumped the filming schedule and the film ultimate cost a whopping $75 million.  The fact that Campbell was able to complete the film at all was close to miraculous.The acting was solid all around.  I have always liked Scott Glenn.  While he doesn't have leading man looks or dynamism, he is one of the most compelling and solid actors around, like a block of granite supporting the leads with the unassuming power of his performances.  He gives another strong performance here as the reclusive guide who leads the rescue mission.  Robin Tunney also did a fine job as the veteran climber who is one of those trapped in the avalanche.  Bill Paxton has always flirted with leading man status, but never really gets the lead.  Here he does a fabulous job rendering a Darwinian character with a malicious coldness befitting the climate on the mountain.  Chris O'Donnell, while adequate in the lead, is really outshined by the rest of the rugged cast.  There is something about him that is just too whiney and cute to qualify him as an action hero.Overall, this is a highly entertaining film with little reason for existence other than the gut wrenching action and suspense.  I rated it a 7/10.  Don't bother bringing your thinking caps to this one, but be prepared for an adrenaline rush.

And it is to a certain degree.  It is unfortunate though that 'Cliffhanger' made a better hash of it than this one did.Brother and sister (Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney) are both climbers who haven't spoken to each other for three years after the death of their father in an horrific climbing accident - she blames him for his death.  She becomes a reporter for a news service - one that is covering the ascent of K2 by flamboyant billionaire (Bill Paxton).  He wants to be at the top of K2 in time to wave at the inaugral flight of his airline.  Great publicity, wrapped up in a great adventure.So after the team heads up the mountain and gets into a spot of trouble, it is up to O'Donnell to put together a rag tag team of climbers to go and rescue the party - one of whom is his sister.So the stage is set for a few interesting climbing set pieces - some of which are genuinely exciting.  Some fall very flat (O'Donnell jumping the chasm to the opposite cliff face is not set up at all - and is cut away from and forgotten as soon as he hits the other side - very strange indeed), while some are very nail biting indeed.Mention must be made of a duo of aussie actors who provide a lot of the comic relief - Ben Mendelsohn and Steve Le Marquand - they are very funny as the brotherly team who only seem to be at K2 for the weather.What really irked me about this film was the utter predictability of it.  Many early comments I was sure where to have their payoff later in the film, and I was not disappointed.  The initial accident that took the life of the father was later repeated nearly shot for shot; the grizzled old climber who lost his wife on the peak and spent the next 10 years looking for her body is resolved in a probably unintentionally comic way.  And of course the foolhardly billionaire who just doesn't listen to anyone.Chris O'Donnell again puts in another near cardboard performance; whoever in Hollywood thinks this guy can act should be given a further reality check with this film.What saves this film from being a total wipeout is the beforementioned action sequences which do provide some interesting tension to the proceedings.If just a little more thought had gone into the script this might have been more of a winner.6 out of 10.

Also, why wouldn't he just descend 100 feet where the air is more dense, so he could fly straight, rather than risking bobbing around, hitting someone with the rotors.I love how they couldn't even think of something different for the bad guy to do.

Curiosity got the better of me.To be honest after about twenty minutes I wanted to walk out.  Not because the movie was lame but because I had began to care about the characters so much I didn't want to watch any of them die.  The screenwriters had solved the major problem about why should we care by putting us in the shoes of someone who did care who wanted to rescue his sister.  Other characters were humanised by being noble or funny or in love. The rescue mission in itself is one story but within that there are other little stories going on, some majorly significant to the overall picture others personal ones with accelerated arcs. A shortcut to creating characters is to create stereotypes and Robert King  and Terry Hayes are a little guilty of this but they gave the characters a fresh enough twist so they still work.

First we have the wonderful sequences where the Alps are made to look a little tiny bit like the Himalayas. Then there are various scenes of what appear to be computer generated avalanches. Not bad! But the true achievement of Vertical Limit comes with the appearance of one of the first entirely computer generated actors in a major motion picture. And who knows... within ten years perhaps those crazy technicians at Industrial Light and Magic will make a Chris O'Donnell that can show life-like emotions.But I'm too mean to Mr. O'Donnell. In reality, his only flaw as an actor (beyond his inability to deliver dialogue outside of a high voiced monotone) is that his screen presence is just too blandly benign. When that presence is correctly used, O'Donnell isn't really a disruptive force. See Cookie's Fortune for evidence. However, in Vertical Limit, O'Donnell just doesn't have the charisma or presence to hold the movie together. It's likely that even a proven action star couldn't have overcome the cliched script and perplexing resolution, but O'Donnell adds nothing to this movie.O'Donnell plays Peter Garrett, a former mountain climber and current photographer for National Geographic. In the opening scene of the movie we see Garrett forced to make a touch choice which led to his father's death. Naturally things are a little tense between Peter and his sister Annie (Robin Tunney), who was also involved in the opening accident. Annie, though, has continued to climb and she's about to go on an expedition to summit K-2, the world's second tallest mountain. The trek is being funded by billionaire sportsman Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), who's using the trip as a publicity stunt for his new airline. Wouldn't you know it, though, an accident leaves three climbers stranded on the mountain with only 36 hours to live and it's up to Peter Garrett to put together a team of climbers for a rescue mission. That team includes a French-Canadian babe, two crazy Aussies, a devout Muslim, and the inevitable hairy mountain man (Scott Glenn), who knows the mountain better than anyone. If you can't look at those character types to know who's going to live and who's going to die... Well, then Vertical Limit will contain nearly endless thrills and chills. Otherwise, you're pretty much going to watch people slide down tall mountains.The first 50 minutes of the Vertical Limit script (credited to Robert King and Terry Hayes) are a little twisty and jargon-heavy. The moments involving the Pakistani army are arbitrary and the guilt laden conversations between O'Donnell and Tunney are necessary to the plot, but nothing more than perfunctory. After the rescue mission gets going, though, people mostly stop talking and the movie picks up. Director Martin Campbell is fairly proficient at directing this kind of glossy, big budget action movie. He lacks the style that Renny Harlin brought to Cliffhanger (hey, Euro-hack is a style, isn't it?), but he's a master of pacing. Working with Oscar-winning editor Thom Noble, Vertical Limit comes together very well and produces some very solid action moments.MAJOR AND TOTAL SPOILER BELOW***************************Vertical Limit ends on a strange note. We're looking at pictures of the men who died on the mountain during the movie. It becomes clear that the rescue mission led to the death of six people and the only person who was saved was Robin Tunney's character. Are we supposed to feel that it was worthwhile because the Glenn character revenges his wife's death? That's bittersweet. It would be tough to argue that the loss of human life was worth saving one climber and yet the dead are looked at as heroes. There's no point in talking about the acting in this film. Tunney is nice for me to look at. I assume looking at Chris O'Donnell will also please people. And Scott Glenn is amusing and comes the closest to acting. The supporting characters all blend together completely. Vertical Limit is not a horrible movie, but for its first hour it's fairly dull and as a whole it only delivers on a hint of its promise. This is a 5.5/10.

Maybe I left out a detail here and there, but that's what it all boils down to.Extreme sports fans are sure to be happy to see Vertical Limit, but will probably also be disappointed because movies like this almost always screw up or manipulate some crucial reality about the sport being portrayed, like the way skydiving was pathetically presented in Drop Zone. And Vertical Limit is clearly no exception.  It's a formula film, so there's really no question from the beginning how it's all going to pan out, and the main plot can therefore be largely overlooked for simple lack of interest. However, there are a few surprisingly interesting subplots, such as the one about the climber-turned-mountain-man who remained on the mountain to search for his wife's body, because he suspects she was killed. That's the subplot to really pay attention to, because even though it's not exactly breathtaking, the way it ends is probably the best part of the film.There were a lot of good characters in the film, such as the two brothers who practically lived on the mountain, but the whole thing with Chris O'Donnell's character making a heroic mission to the top to rescue his stranded sister is just the same old crap that Hollywood constantly cranks out. It's so predictable that you already know how it's going to end after just watching the preview. Given that, and the fact that O'Donnell's ridiculous leap over the canyon in that preview probably drove off the majority of the thinking public, it's amazing the film made any money at all. Vertical Limit is recycled garbage with one or two minute ideas thrown in, resulting in a goofy thriller that is sure to be forgotten right quick.

Superb, Wonderful, and Classic are most certainly not amongst them! This film is full of everything that makes a film bad. Where do I start? Well, the acting. Each and every main character excels in their role of totally destroying any form of realism this pathetic film could even possibly hope of possessing. It got to the stage where I was eager to see the demise of one character in particular, whose name I shall not mention in case it is deemed a spoiler. In fact, I should save you whatever valuable time you have by telling you to watch the first ten minutes and repeat that scene a few times. Oh, back to the acting. Right, these actors are not going to get anywhere. It was like watching a cheap remake of Cliff Hanger. Using that, to highlight my point. Can you imagine Sylvester Stallone in a Hamlet play? Doesn't work eh? Well these actors don't belong in a film like this. In fact they aint even worthy of the name actors. I'll call them Steve Martin students named after the very physical definition of pathetic acting. In fact , these Steve Martin students where most probably rejects from Steve Martin school of acting. I'm not exactly a card carrying member of Equity myself, but I'd be a great deal more enthusiastic of my own acting credentials after watching this film. To move on, there is always the plot. Well, its about some total jinx who, having suffered at the hands of climbing earlier, decides to tackle the dreaded K-2. You know whats coming next. There is not one piece of originality in the direction of this film, and I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO GIVE THIS FILM A SINGLE MARK!  In fact, just writing about this film makes me angry, the cinema will charge an entry fee, as it did to me! ¬£3.25 may not sound much, but trust me, it is! Anyway, if you're depressed, feel there is not point to life and that you are heading no-where, then here is the remedy. One, you can try and hunt down the main actress and go climbing with her, in which case you are effectively commiting suicide. Or, you can go and watch this film. I urge you to try and get a student discount as paying the full whack may just send you over the edge. However, as you leave this film, you will feel talented, happy and above all, re-invigorated with a fresh feeling of hope.If there were any justice in the World, the good people of the movie databas would afford me to vote with a zero, but I am compelled to force myself to give it a 1/10.

The plot (to keep it short) is as follows  Peter Garret (Chris O'Donnell) used to be a professional climber but a tragedy happened and he decided to quit. His sister Annie(Robin Tunney) decided to give the mountains one more chance and is currently planning to go to the K2 with an expedition led by Tom McLaren(Nicholas Lea) and sponsored by Elliot Vaughn(Bill Paxton). An avalanche encounters them on their way and they're trapped. Peter decides to go there and help them out together with Montgomery Wick(Scott Glen) and Monique Aubertine(Izabela Scorupco).The acting is superb, especially Mr. Wick played by Scott Glenn. He's the Pope of climbing. Never wrong never gives up. The only thing I don't understand is why do Americans treat Izabela Scorupco as if she had nothing to do with the movie. You didn't even put her name on the poster. I'm not saying that because she was born 100 miles from where i was born but because she's the second best character of this movie.

(The reason for their estrangement is supplied in an exciting opening sequence that will take your breath away.) Peter has given up climbing and is photographing snow leopards for National Geographic, while Annie, now a star climber, is assisting an arrogant mogul (Bill Paxton) to reach the summit in order to salute the fly-over of a plane from his new airline, a commercial stunt that puts the climbing crew at risk.As in all mountain climbing movies, the weather is unpredictable--but in this one, the plot is not. When the mountain reveals its wrath, Peter must dust off his climbing gear and lead a team to rescue Annie's party. He recruits a ragtag group of oddballs (a cast of characters ransacked from yesteryear's westerns and war movies), which includes a crusty Jeremiah Johnson-like loner (Scott Glenn) who has his own score to settle with Paxton.Who's Involved Scriptwriters Robert King and Terry Hayes populate the plot with a pastiche of one-dimensional, but interesting characters, whose main purposes are to be in jeopardy when director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye and The Mask of Zorro) unreels his dazzling and dangerous, effects-laden dilemmas. The story calls for the rescue to team carry nitroglycerin on their climb, a less than credible plot device that nevertheless supplies sufficient tension between special effects sequences.The performances are adequate if not challenging. The three leads play off one another in interesting ways, but sometimes seem tongue-tied by the script. Lively supporting performances, led by the fascinatingly grizzled Glenn, also include an appealing Izabella Scorupco as Monique, a medic who seems more like a model.Why See It For the dazzling special effects; replenish your popcorn during the base camp dialogue.

Number one, the climbers are scaling the summit without ropes attached to themselves.  Wouldn't happen.  Two, Dangling climbers who are hanging on by nothing more than one person above them with a rope- should not, under any circumstances, panic and writhe around as much as they can. Three- Avalanches usually do not happen under stormy conditions as it did several times during the movie.  There are exceptions of course.  But usually, and avalanche will only occur naturally under spring like conditions when the snow loostens and the sun is shining on it.******* Moving on to another serious point.  In real life, this would have never happened.  The helicopter scene alone is enough to create evident reason why you could not rescue 3 people stranded in a crevasse ontop of K2.  You could not attempt anything as dangerous as this, and expect to be seriously successful.  Yes, in real life, Chris O Donnell might have been able to rescue the girl.  But at the cost of what?  8 lives?  That would be selfish and irresponsible of him to sacrifice that many lives and hurt that many families, just to save his sister.******** Onto the good points-  The drama was appealing enough for an audience to feel (the emotion and the tragedy).  Plus, there was reasoning in the film.  Why the climbers and the stranded people, make the choices they do.  And it is very logical.  Another great point is that the characters are not superhuman, and can die as a real person would, under the same circumstances.

Martin Campbell has talent obviously, witness his terrifying and dizzying mountain side shots in this film (though sadly the best bits were shown in the trailer), and the romance and spirit that he injected into Mask Of Zorro making it the best adventure film since Indiana Jones.This script however too often relies on disaster movie clich√©s - e.g. anything that can go wrong, will, and leaves it just a little predictable and hardly memorable. Unless something changes, this genre cannot live on much longer. There are far worse ways to spend a couple of hours, it is certainly on of the more thrilling on-edge-of-seat movies on offer for a while.

Huh? And like any self-respecting climber would have a defective buckle like the one portrayed still in use!), Vertical Limit is a refreshing look into the world of climbing. To say the opening scene is harrowing would be a mild understatement. As a climber myself, I was at the edge of my seat as I watched my worst nightmare unfold on the screen. Monty Wick (Scott Glenn) was right--Chris O'Donnell did the right thing. But still...... The drama is definitely there. There are too many nerve-racking scenes to describe. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Thankfully, the Aussie brothers (Cyril and Malcolm) provide much-needed comic relief during the tense moments of this movie. As for Bill Paxton's character, well, sad as it may seem, he does exist somewhere out there among the climbing world...those of you who have read Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air will have an alarming sense of deja vu when you see his interaction with Nicholas Lea on the mountain. Speaking of Into Thin Air, having Ed Viestiurs on the movie was a nice touch, although I wasn't too impressed with the reference to the 1996 Everest disaster. But hey, if Ed was ok with it, I will bow to The Man. All in all, it's an enjoyable ride. Like I said, mountaineering WAS in sore need of a semi-realistic portrayal on the screen, and Vertical Limit, while it has its faults (what movie doesn't?), does the job quite well. Even non-climbers will get a rise (pun intended) out of this movie.

Izabella Scorupco is particularly noteworthy as a mountain-climbing nurse.O'Donnell, not one of my favorites, is terrific here; sensitive and  forceful at the same time, qualities he usually doesn't project on screen convincingly.

Annie Garrett (Robin Tunney) is considered the best female climber in the world. She's dating a billionaire, Elliott Vaugh (Bill Paxton), who wants to climb K2, a difficult climb located in the disputed region of Kashmir on the Pakistan-India border. He wants to wave to the inaugural flight of his new airline as it flies by the summit. I did like the timely use of location, however, as the ongoing India-Pakistan territorial guerrilla war still rages.Despite the possibility of poor weather, they make their ascent and everyone's fears come to pass. Annie, Vaughn and the expedition leader fall into a crevasse at 23,000 feet and no one knows their exact location. Annie's brother Peter (yes Midnight Oil fans, his name is Peter Garrett), in the area to photograph mountain wildlife, organizes an ill-advised rescue mission. Only the craziest and most desperate enlist.   Leading them is Montgomery Wick (the Leathery One, Scott Glenn), who lost his wife to the billionaire's last attempt to reach K2's summit. At first he's not interested, even with only hours to spare before the lost get sick and start dying. But when he hears that Vaughn is among those alive and in need of rescue, he's all ears.The characters don't get any deeper than Hero, Heroine, Love Interest, Burly Mountain Man, Rich Jerk, Comic Relief and so on. But then, we don't expect much more from films such as this. Emotional events happen early, which add weight to events that happen later and that's why we care whether, say, that pickaxe holds the weight of the climber about to fall to his death.  The characters are icons, not people, so the backstory is all they are. As it happens, though, it's enough.Again, it's an action flick so no one expects deep characterization. I only mention this because some action films fail to provide interesting characters even at the most basic, symbolic level. Those that populate Vertical Limit are, at the very least, cute. It's easy to guess who's going to live and who's going to die. Not that Vertical Limit is the first big Hollywood film to be guilty of this, but the basic selection of who lives and who dies goes this way If you're pretty, you live. If you're ugly, sorry. Down the cliffside you go.Director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, The Mask of Zorro) compensates with some splendid (literally) white knuckle action. He truly takes you to a place where you can die slowly without even knowing it or die in a millisecond, doing something no more significant that setting your pack down for a drink of water. Nearly every deadly scenario you could think of happening on a climb happens here. Campbell's pulled off quite a technical achievement. Heck, most of the time, you can't even tell it's a set.All of this would have been enough, but the film's creators see fit to add explosives into the mix. The thing that's supposed to add excitement and energy to the story is ultimately what ruins it. I never believed for a second that they actually needed to bring nitroglycerine up there on the mission. Sending all three teams packing such a powerful, unstable explosive liquid seems to be way too self-defeating. To root for people this foolish proves difficult. What's most annoying is the inconsistencies in how they treat the stuff. Okay, it reacts to sunlight. But it also reacts to sudden movement. Yeah, I want that strapped to my back as I climb straight up a rock wall. That's what we're supposed to think, though. How can she do that? My point is, it's unnecessary. The mere fact that someone is climbing a rock wall in the first place is scary enough. I can see the production meeting now No, no no! We've all seen mountain climbing movies! It's such a delicate balance to begin with, so...what if we added explosives? At this point the money men start to drool. Someday they'll learn when they've overestimated the audience's built-in suspension of disbelief.Campbell is an able action director. He's rattled off three straight quality boom boom movies. But he's still not in the league of, say, Renny Harlin, whose Cliffhanger is still King of the climbing movie mountain.Grade C+  "},{"Title":"Vertical Limited","Date":"19 December 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  This movie had one problem after the next which means we get a whole lot of action.

So I am. People have complained about the scripting, the acting, the CGI, the other special effects, the climbing realism, and the plot, to name just a few of the major aspects of the film. Let me address these issues. Scripting/acting Do you realize that real people actually talk like this? If life were a movie, it would be what you naggers are calling badly scripted. People say sappy things occasionally, or dumb things. People get over-emotional. People get boring. Whatever it is that you're complaining about, it happens in the world around you. I don't know what you think is good scripting, but it doesn't happen in reality. People don't spout witty and appropriate dialogue all the time. CGI/special effects Of course they used blue screens! You thought they'd actually blow an actor off of a cliff with a rushing avalanche? You think any Hollywood actor (or stuntperson other than Jackie Chan) would let anything this dangerous happen to them on a movie set? Wow, you could tell it wasn't real. Bravo. I myself didn't notice. I was busy pushing my stomach back down into place because I was actually letting myself enjoy the movie. Why do you watch movies, anyway? Oh, the lighting was so bad on that one shot. Oh, the snow was so fake in that one shot. Oh, the eagle was so fake. Whine, whine, whine. I did notice the eagle, but what I noticed was that it was very well done and quite detailed. So you can tell it was CGI .. . big whoop. If you think you can do better, then go for it. It would be wise to refrain from criticizing that which you cannot improve. Realism Um, you do realize that this is a movie. It's all pretend, people. This is not a climbing documentary; it's an action thriller. At times, the characters are allowed to perform seemingly superhuman tasks in order to triumph. I'm guessing you don't complain about this in, say, James Bond movies. Oh, that's SO fake. He couldn't really do that in real life. OF COURSE NOT! Yes, many things that happen in Vertical Limit are highly, highly implausible, but if you can't enjoy that implausibility, then why do you go to movie theaters at all? Some people complained that the climbing was all wrong. Um, they had over fifty experienced climbers advising on this movie. If there were any inconsistencies with the reality of the climbing, that's called artistic license. It was done on purpose. Plot What the bleep is wrong with the plot? It's simple. It's potent. The egomaniac gets a climbing team trapped in the mountains. This could happen and probably has, many times. The brother will stop at nothing to rescue his sister. Don't you whiners have anybody in your life that you would risk your life for? There's even a twist regarding the Wise Old Climber's true purpose for going on the rescue mission. This enhances the plot, people. Makes it MORE interesting. And as for the nitro-glycerine, well, if you were the brother, what would you do? You need explosives. These are the only explosives available in the timeframe. Would you say, oh, let's not try it because it's SO cliched. Just let them all die. Do you think that the real K2 base camp just has lots of nice shaped charges sitting around? Pakistan is actually there. They actually have army bases. It's entirely likely that there are nitro dumps. I doubt the army would actually offer to let the climbing team borrow some of their live shells to MacGuyver up some other bombs. Since when was nitro a cliche, anyway? I can't even remember the last good nitro explosion in a big Hollywood movie. ) So anyway, that's my rant. This was an excellent, exciting movie. I thought the dialogue and acting were great. The special effects and suspense made my bowels tighten. The story was moving (those of you who have a sister will understand this). I loved it. You could too if you go to see the movie for what it actually is, not what you want it to be. If you want movies to be what you want them to be, then go make your own.

She's with a team including wealthy Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) and Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea). Peter is unwilling to go up with the team. When they are trapped by a storm and fall into a crevasse, Peter races to the rescue with loss-stricken expert Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), Kareem Nazir (Alexander Siddig), and Monique Aubertine (Izabella Scorupco).I can't comment on any accuracy debate since I'm not a climber. As for its movie aspect, this is such a simplistic story that there isn't any thrills in it. Yet the father's death sticks out like a sore thumb as a Hollywood contrivance to amp up the drama. The dialog is clunky and Scott Glenn's character is cheesy. The interior sets don't look very convincing. I understand that having real locations at times is impossible. However its artificial nature takes away much of the excitements of the stunts. The marrying of real and CGI doesn't look real enough either. The best thing about the movie is the outside location shoots. At least that is some unique fun, but I can't feel the tension in this.

Above 24,000, you're at the vertical limit, you're already dying. Look at you. You can hardly stand. If you think you can stop me, go ahead.A high-adrenaline tale of young climber Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell), who must launch a treacherous and extraordinary rescue effort up K2, the world's second highest peak. Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), and her summit team (Bill Paxton and Nicholas Lea) in a race against time. The team is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long. Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), to ascend the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to save her.This movie is the most boring, pretentious, uninteresting piece of sheet that I've ever laid my eyes on. The character development is almost non-existent, the acting is horrible especially that lead girl, talk about cardboard performances. The story had potential but its the execution that failed miserably. The awkward plot scenarios, appalling camera angles and ridiculous dialogue. Chris O' Donnell can pass off as a lead actor but always he stars in atrocious movies like this. Bill Paxton's role as the supposed villain/entrepreneur will just make you laugh unintentionally. His reason for climbing K2 is pretty stupid. They're calling it a publicity stunt in the film but I think its a stupid way to promote your airline company. There are some boundaries to such things.Towards the end of the film, I was almost half asleep, the supposed high wire tension just made me even more sleepy, at that time I just wanted it to be done and over with.I remember when I was a youngling when I saw this for the first time on VHS, I totally loved this film but now, its totally different.

They also seem somewhat unprepared; even if they had been prepared, many of the disasters that befall them couldn't have been avoided. The body count starts to mount, as do the soppy scenes, unrealistic disasters and crazy stunts.

It felt like a combination of my two biggest fears  heights and being frozen to death. Even though some of my favorite actors star in Vertical Limit, it took me quite long before I finally got the courage to watch it.The story of Vertical Limit is typical and there isn't anything original about it all. That's fine with me, I just considered it to be an old-fashioned adventure movie with good acting and stunning photography. Vertical Limit is the typical story of siblings who lost their father in a climbing accident. Ever since, the son ( Chris O'Donnel ) has stopped climbing. His sister ( Robin Tunney ) hasn't she's going to conquer K2 with the rich Texas guy Vaughn (Bill Paxton). Of course, this goes wrong and Chris has to set up a rescue missing to go and save his sister. A whole bunch of typical characters are introduced and everything that can possibly go wrong, does go wrong. The quality level of Vertical Limit is merely held up by the acting performances...and more specifically  Scott Glenn and Bill Paxton. Both these overtalented - yet underappreciated - actors are cast perfectly. Glenn is impressive as the mysterious loner Montgomery Wick who dwells around K2 and Paxton is the worst kind of bad guy a movie can have. He isn't really the villain but he's the arrogant business guy who quickly turns into a selfish, egocentric and mad person who's willing to sacrifice everything to survive. Terrific performance. All the other aspects you expect are there as well. A developing love story, funny one-liners and the oversentimental morality and happy ending. Mainstream stuff but certainly not bad.

During the opening credits one of my colleague said I bet this one'll fall into the <straight-to-video> territory.

And that was the way it went till the very end.Mountaineer (Robin Tunney) and millionaire (Bill Paxton) are bound to the top of K2, the second highest mountain in the world, and buried alive by an avalanche. While they are fighting for life, Tunney's cliffhanger brother (Chris O'Donnell) put together a rescue team of volunteers. And the climbing is getting started...Movie screens has lacked mountaineers since 1993's unsurpassable 'Alive' and no-brainer 'Cliffhanger'. So 'VM' is an example of perfect timing. In a survey managed by the Box Office Guru (Which December release are you looking forward the most?), contenders got cca. 200, while 'Vertical Limit' got more than 2000 (!) votes.The engine of the movie is director Martin Campbell's outstanding achievement. Though Robert King's ('Red Corner') and Terry Hayes's ('Dead Calm') screenplay has it tiny flaws (e.g. nitro-glycerine), Campbell cuts in time and never misses. He was the only good thing in 'Escape from Absolom/No Escape' and the one who once again infused life into the 'James Bond' series with 'Goldeneye'. Not to mention 'The Mask of Zorro', another surprise blockbuster from 1998.'Vertical Limit' has a typical disaster-movie casting no stars but recognizable faces. Here are Chris O'Donnell, whom Hollywood has almost buried alive after 'Batman and Robin', Bill Paxton, who plays small roles in big movies, Robin Tunney ('End of Days', 'Supernova'), whose performance could be a breakthrough for her, and last but not least Scott Glenn, whose part would probably be played by Sean Connery if 'VM' were an A-star vehicle.Will 'Vertical Limit' be a winter blockbuster despite lacking for A-listers?

Maybe Martin Campbell is just plain stupid; director of The Mask of Zorro, and No Escape, Vertical Limit is not Campbell's worst movie-that goes to the 1996 James Bond installment of Goldeneye. At least Vertical Limit has a theme don't make stupid mistakes like the characters in this film. However, Campbell believes his movie examines earnest human emotions. Forget the mountain, forget the snow, forget the conditions-&#145;Vertical Limit' is a drama that could be played out on flat land, and it would still be a fantastic movie about love, family and courage, he explains. I'd like to see him justify those words; take away the mountain, snow, and conditions, and you have no movie.	Within the 124 minutes of Vertical Limit the characters actually utter the following ludicrous dialogue Up there, you're not dying, you're dead, a thousand sperm and you were the fastest, and don't mind her. She's French-Canadian. Some days she's Canadian. Can be quite pleasant. Today she's obviously French. Lines like that just scream for attention; they are blunt, obvious, and unpleasant; they examine the true depths of this production-sea level at best. The difference between an actor a wannabe actor becomes clear here. When an actor portrays a character in a life or death situation, he really needs to display emotion, anxiety, and intensity. The filmmaker's make the mistake of casting Chris O'Donnell in the lead role. With quirky, zany movies like Batman & Robin and The Bachelor, he hasn't had to act dramatically. Here, when his character requires tension and depth, he fails to provide the movie with the necessary skill. Supporting actors Robin Tunney, Scott Glenn, Izabella Scorupco, and Bill Paxton deliver strong performances, but they can't accomplish much due to the lack of a solid leading character.	The film takes place several years after a climbing accident in which two siblings, Peter (O'Donnell), and Annie (Tunney), lost their father to a fatal fall. Peter now takes pictures of wildlife, Annie's a mountain guild. For the first time in several years, they meet at the base camp of K2, one of the world's most dangerous mountain regions. She will lead a wealthy Texas businessman, Elliot (Bill Paxton) and crew on an expedition to the top of the mountain, but dangerous weather approaches. Will the crew continue their journey, even though their lives are at risk?	It's an amazingly simple story, so simple that it becomes redundant in scene after scene of climbing and explosions. While the special effects dazzle us and we savor the sweeping, breathtaking views of mountainous terrain, the masterful technical aspects of the film do not make up for the lack of a sufficient script. The scenes that do induce audience participation and nail biting suspense last way too long. Take a scene where a helicopter releases passengers high on the mountain. At first, the scene proves noteworthy; the setting and potential for disaster ubiquitous. But it tests our patience; it lasts way too long and throws too many complications in the bundle. It's like the film knows the scene is effective, so milks it for every minute it is worth. Why must movies like this always be so detached to reality and filled with stubborn characters? Isn't it increasingly obvious that the weather will not cooperate with the mountain expedition? But because of simple stupidity, they continue up the rugged terrain. The film provides the excuse that the characters are determined to achieve a self proclamation in life, but in reality, the script requires several of the character to get stuck in a situation in which they will need rescuing. We've seen this so many times before, Vertical Limit is simply too little too late.
