The prevalent theory - depressingly common among film goers and film-makers alike - seems to be that a good effect should stand out of a film and make the audience coo like a pigeon.  If you subscribe to that theory, fine, watch the Matrix and be happy.  If you think that a special effect is a means to an end, a way to portray a fictional vista as a believable realism, then watch eXistenZ and marvel at how a grotesque and visceral world can be made so engrossingly real and intriguing.  This film has its fair share of effects, but they are so well grafted into the ethos the film evokes that you just won't notice them on first viewing.  And in contrast with the current trend towards computer-generated effects, Cronenburg knows the value of his tactile world; the physical creativity involved in the gristle-gun building scene is a fantastic example.Okay, so virtual reality has been used many times as a concept - and by films that actually came BEFORE the Matrix too - but the totality with which this film portrays its own organic brand of VR is truly engrossing.  Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are utterly watch-able and the chemistry between them is the perfect vehicle to lead an audience through the admittedly gruesome situations the film describes.There is an element of old-fashioned escapist fantasy in this film that manages to be strangely endearing despite the gore and I suggest that this is where the film triumphs - a triumph that can be attributed to clever writing, intelligent acting and characterisation, a compelling story, charismatic leads, a vivid and disciplined imagination and the discerning use of effects and visual style.If the Matrix is an `oooh, aaah' sort of film, then this is more an `oooh, eeugh' movie - but don't allow the glare of the Matrix to dull your senses to the darker appeal of eXistenZ.

But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in.  The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in.  Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about reality or any such deep concept.  It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her scripted line.  It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story.  This is made even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game.  I sympathize completely with the realist philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence.  Living in the game is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth.  As Allegra comments about the real world, there's nothing going on here.  Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting.  (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.)Upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended.  But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) I've realized how much deeper it goes.  Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.

A director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death, is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. He proved this with films as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and more recently, Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. Living out fantasies is something people always dream of, but how far can you go into it, before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? Those are the themes touched in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly, reality itself.The story and directing are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s linked to stories such as this. The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually low-key in the gore department in comparison to Cronenbergs other work. The shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and pretty confused.The acting gets two thumbs up as well. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities. The dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect Cronenberg was going for, to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease. Supporting actors as Ian Holm, Don McKellar and an especially creepy Willem Dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances.This movie takes some getting used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, blood-curdeling imagery and existentially warping story, you'll love it.

That is, your reaction to this marvellous movie will depend whether you are S.F. literate and familiar with Cronenberg's oeuvre, or a 'Matrix'-loving, Johnny-come-lately. Now I enjoy 'The Matrix' as a superior action movie, but no movie in recent years has been so overrated, and grossly exaggerated as intellectual fare! 'eXistenZ' and Alex Proyas' similarly overlooked 'Dark City' are everything 'The Matrix' claims to be - intelligent, thought provoking, CHALLENGING S.F. This movie is almost a summary of all the themes and motifs that Cronenberg has been obsessed about for the last 25 years or so. Especially the Burroughsian biological horror and the Phildickian questioning of reality. While it echoes many of his previous movies, it especially evokes his masterpiece 'Videodrome'. It may not reach the hallucinogenic heights of that movie - very few have - but it certainly takes you to places most contemporary S.F. and horror movies don't even try to reach.However this movie isn't just Cronenberg rehashing his greatest hits. There are more than enough new and interesting touches, especially the Rushdie-like Fatwah theme, the odd sexual symbolism, and the witty touches such as the bone guns that fire teeth. Helping all this along is the interesting, carefully chosen cast. All are good, but I especially like Willem Dafoe's creepy garage mechanic, and it was also great to see Canadian cult star Don McKellar ('Highway 61', 'Twitch City',etc) as the enigmatic Russian Yevgeny.'Videodrome' has taken many years to find its real audience, and maybe 'eXistenz' will too. But I believe eventually it will be recognised for what it is - a work of great imagination and flair.

The story cannot easily be summarized in a small review without spoiling the movie completely, so you'll have to see it for yourself.The special effects are well done, but thankfully not overdone. The film relies mainly on the chemistry between Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, who plug in and out of the game throughout the movie, and what is actually the real world become less clear as the movie goes on. The violence and carnage, which Cronenberg has become famous for, certainly catches you off guard at times. In fact, some scenes will send a shiver up your spine. The acting is superb, with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing a convincing hero, while Jude Law is excellent as the uneasy, often unwilling participant in her mind-boggling game. Willem Dafoe is, as always, a treat to watch as the mysterious, intimidating, and off-the-wall characters he is so good at playing.eXistenZ is the most unusual Cronenberg film to date, and that is saying something when comparing to his earlier movies like Shivers, Scanners, and Videodrome. It has a great script, great direction, and the idea behind the film is pure gold. Cronenberg is definitely one of the most daring and original directors of our time.  "},{"Title":"hyper-reality shocks!","Date":"14 July 2003","Score":"61 out of 93 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief who is a well known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like telephone is an extention of the ear, television is an extention of the eye, telegram is an extention of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their game-urges. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of Simulacra and Simulation, which all power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious. While you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappers. For Baudrillard, `.simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real.' Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation, `.now feels, and, for all intents and purposes is, more real than what we call the real world.' (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game which can basically be called 'experience' is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. As existentialists say that, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is absurd too. Cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For instance, in the game, the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes, the exposed absurdity really shocks.The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. The essence.Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. `Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.' Perhaps I should mention, `eXistenZ' deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. You achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. If you don't than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. So, you begin to interrogate the game, your existence rather than your essence. You suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. Well as a last word, eXistenZ is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.

Existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. David Cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some works of genius too (Videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favourites. I can't remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means I can watch it again. Or perhaps I never watched this film at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it 'really' happened to me. I don't know. At any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and I'm glad.

Some bits are quite icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'GAS STATION' and a Chinese restaurant is called 'CHINESE RESTAURANT.'The film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie.You can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once.The main actors are Jude Law who is OK and Jennifer Jason Leigh who is great.

(Looks great in a short black skirt too.) There are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a Howard Shore score complements the film very well.

"},{"Title":"Welcome To The Desert of the Real Part 2","Date":"8 May 2009","Score":"20 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" All reality is virtual. It's collaborative. It's invented. &#x96; David Cronenberg.In retrospect, Existenz is part of a group of films released between 1998 and 2001, all of which examine the fragile lines separating an illusory reality from a supposedly more authentic Real. These films, which include The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Eyes Wide Shut, Dark City, Existenz, Mulholland Drive, The Truman Show, Fight Club and A History of Violence, all portray reality as a hyper-real simulation in possession of a dark and violent underside.But what separates Existenz from its big budget counterparts are it's biomechanical themes. Marshall McLuhan famously asserted that all technological advancements are merely extensions of the human body; clothing an extension of our skin, binoculars of our eyes, cars of our legs, media of our minds and desires. McLuhan believed that as media builds upon itself, it grows further and further away from our human skin until the limits of our bodies becomes less and less definable.This bodily alienation is highlighted in Existenz. The film establishes a series of layered hyper-realities for the players of a virtual reality game to connect to. In order to enter each new layer of the game, the players must literally plug in using organic looking spinal grafts. These grafts let the players enter the computer generated landscape of the game whilst leaving their physical bodies behind. They are, essentially, wilfully disembodied from their physical reality.The irony of the film is apparent at the end, when we discover that the film's reality only exists when the characters decide to enter another reality (at the moment of plugging in). Since the movie begins at the second plugging in, without referencing the first, Cronenberg suspends all reality to imply that no reality is grounded. In other words, the audience's act of playing the film was the first plug in to an alternate reality. In this way, Cronenberg engages the disembodiment that technology offers and threatens us with. The audience embodies media because media becomes an escape from the body through its prosthetic extensions. These plug in extensions are themselves sexualised, implying that man's virtual escapes are themselves pleasure centric activities, man hiding in fantasy by mind humping his machines. (Importantly, the film's machines become less organic and more mechanical and rigid as we get closer to reality.)But though McLuhan suggests a re-fragmentation of the Self through extensions into media realities, other thinkers suggest less pessimistic models. For example, though our instruments have become detachable organs, they need not displace us entirely. Isn't it possible that our senses, no longer limited to our physical bodies, now become receptors to a wider variety of stimuli and perceptions? Cronenberg acknowledges this, but highlights the complications in returning to our real bodies. Recalibration to a pure reality is becoming increasingly impossible. One can imagine future generations thinking of their own brains as organic computers and not computers as imitations of the brain. In other words, the machine becomes something that our body aspires to or increasingly enjoys being with.On yet another level, Existenz portrays a war between a group of game players and rebels known as The Realists. The Realists want all game designers and games destroyed. They want the simulation to end, and all of humanity to re-enter reality. The great joke (which only Cronenberg and Kubrick seem to acknowledge) is that these Realists who delight in such demystification are operating under the most lamentable and unsupportable of assumptions the idea that you can strip away all fantasy. The reality they defend is, in fact, the ontology of a depressive, shabbily empirical, nothing ever adding up to more than the sum of its parts, nothing worth getting worked up about, nothing connecting with nothing, existence. IE- post modern hyper-real hell. They're defending simply another fantasy level in a game, unable to face the fact that The Real is itself a cosmic ateleological event, completely without design. The Real is purposiveness without purpose. Think the giant conversation at the end of Eyes Wide Shut, Tom Cruise standing over a pool board as everything is explained but nothing actually adds up.Cronenberg is thus a kind of ontological existentialist, believing that the very nature of reality itself, the individual choices of subjects, is radically open. Watch how he has his lead character (played by Jude Law), confront the existential horror of abandonment and despair when he complains to the game designer (who is herself a mere player and not the actual game designer) that the game is without final purpose and that they are forever being assaulted by malevolent forces intent upon destroying them. It's a game that would be hard to market, he moans. And yet, as she smartly replies, it's a game that everyone is already playing.The Realists, however, want to defend their comfortable self-delusions. They want to believe that the particular world in which they find themselves, a mere consensual hallucination, is fixed and determined. What guarantees such pre-determination is of course the functioning of a transcended game designer whose role is basically a metaphor for God.Finally, Existenz makes a distinction between players who are capable of making choices and preprogrammed drones who are nevertheless also players. Unable to act unless triggered by specific lines of dialogue, these drones are reminiscent of so many interactions with real human beings in late Capitalism robot announcers, telemarketers, call centre employees etc. These days, professionalization means becoming as much like a bureaucratically controlled drone as is humanly possible, man losing all signs of autonomy, unable to sensitively engage with situations or people around him.8.9/10 &#x96; This film has aged well. Briskly told, Existenz has an elegance and sexiness which lifts it above its big budget, more action oriented, brothers.

However,the marketing trainee of Antenna Research Ted Pikul (Jude Law) saves Allegra and flees with her in his car. When Allegra awakes, she requests Ted to let her connect in his bio-port to check the damage in her pod with the original version of eXistenZ.

When the game merges in the real life, Ted and Allegra question whether they are still playing the game or whether the game has been transported to the real world. eXistenz is another bizarre and original film by David Cronenberg, with a weird and gruesome concept of virtual reality. The twisted story has similarities with Matrix, entwining virtual world with reality, but both were made in the same year (1999); therefore it seems that there is no plagiarization of the idea. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law show a great chemistry and the plot has many twists. Surprisingly, eXistenz has not been released in Brasil neither on DVD nor in blu-ray.

If you were scared rather than amused by Oliver Reed and those kids in red parkas, you may like eXistenZ -- but the rest of us will squirm in embarrassment at the setting (a world in which everyone plays computer games which plug directly into their spinal cord) and the self-importance of much of the dialogue. Where the movie should work as horror, it often comes off as farce; and where Cronenberg may be attempting social commentary, he slides into solipsism and pretension.The film's design will persuade some Cronenberg fans of its merit. The game console designed by Jennifer Jason Leigh is an alarming mix of Playstation and kidney, complete with nipple start-button and throbbing (or should that be force-feedback?) game action. The sets are bizarre, especially the 'trout farm' (nope, they sure ain't trout) in which many of the movie's scenes are set. However, none of this weirdness can really compel in the face of some terrible casting (poor Jude Law is really out of his depth; ditto Ian Holm, who's given the year's least plausible eastern European accent) and a wonky script.The movie's biggest problem is that we're never drawn into this other world because it seems so heavy-handedly projected from the opening scenes. Leigh's new game gets its first public try-out in a church (materialism and false idols, geddit?), and that level of inventiveness pretty much characterises the movie from then onward. The tension of the later stages is dependent on our own uncertainty about whether what we're watching is real or part of the game Law and Leigh are playing -- but even this trick fails to grab.The final scenes (assuming they're not re-arranged for the theatrical release) fall apart as Cronenberg tries to have it both ways, to suggest that nothing's really happened and that the world's coming to an end. In sum, it's just a muddle -- and a real shame, given that Cronenberg on top form is one of the most interesting directors working today. With eXistenZ, he's managed to persuade a studio to bankroll his efforts -- it's a real shame, then, that this effort to cultivate a bigger audience should showcase more of his weaknesses than his strengths as a moviemaker.

The story that is shown is certainly different, and after you have seen it, you will say it is movie that is definitely different in almost every aspect. Of course, I am talking about the 2000 sci-fi thriller, 'eXistenZ', which shows that going into the world of 'virtual reality', can be weird and dangerous. 'eXistenZ' also proves that virtual reality' can be a world that one cannot be sure of being in or out of.During the first closed-door demonstration of an amazing new virtual reality game - called 'eXistenZ' - the system's brilliant designer, Allegra Geller, is violently attacked by a crazed assassin intent on killing her and destroying her creation. Forced to flee into hiding, Allegra enlists the help of young marketing trainee, Ted Pikul, to help her test the damaged system, by convincing him to join her inside a game of eXistenZ. The action then explodes as their world's real-life dangers begin to merge with the fantasy of the game.This film has a most unique and unusual story, but in a good way. I have read on the internet, that eXistenZ 'makes the Matrix look like child's play', and I would have to agree. What I will say about this film's story, is that it gives the impression that its audience will understand where it actually is, and that they will believe who someone is, is truly that person, and that they are on a level par. I guess that is what is most inventive about the film, to make what is seemingly so true, to be actually not true at all. The writer/director of eXistenZ, David Cronenberg (from 'the Fly'), wrote a most inventive screenplay, that I am sure you will not see in along time.This movies lead actors are Allegra Gellar (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Ted Pikul (Jude Law). The pair share a most unique chemistry onscreen, as we see their game characters doing some very weird and wacky things as they keep going deeper and deeper into the game of 'eXistenZ' they are playing. I love the way that both Leigh and Law turn this movie into a very erotic kind of an experience to watch. Allegra says this is all part of the game and that the pair should not give into any of these so called 'bits'. I must mention that Jude Law suits this kind of movie genre. Law has also been a part of the Steven Spielberg movie 'AI', which was another unique movie that I did not mind.The supporting cast of this film was also good. I like how we get to meet the guy at the gas station who affectionately known as Gas (Willem Defoe). The role that he took on in this film suits him down to the ground. However, I thought that his role of the 'Green Goblin' in the 2002 blockbuster 'Spiderman' was ordinary to say the least. Other supporting cast members include Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm), the strange man at the trout factory Yevgeny Nourish (Don McKellar) and the Chinese waiter (Oscar Hsu).I also like the way this movie looks. The 'virtual reality' world created for  'eXistenZ' looks so weird and wonderful, that part of me feels that I might be tempted to play the game. Then the creation of the funny creatures in the movie, the funny pods that are used to play the game and the surprise in the 'special' Chinese meal are interesting to see as we go further and further into the film. Then take the great parts of the film. I like how this movie starts, as it is one thing that needs to be looked at carefully, or you could misread what is happening for the entire movie. When the lead pair then start to play eXistenZ the movie becomes all the more interesting, as this is the part where you can start to realise that not everything is what it seems.But here is a clue for you out there that are a little confused by the whole reality vs. virtual-reality parts of the film. The film does point out very subtle clues as to what mode both Allegra and Ted are actually in. However, if you are one person who is clever enough to work out the movie's entire plot, then you are one lucky person, as even I am still thinking up questions that I want to know the answers to (such as was the entire movie just a game? What does the end of the film actually mean? Did those mean streaks that happened in the supposed 'game', turn out just to be glitches in the real life 'virtual reality' game? What should you make of the two lead characters after the end of the film?) I am sure I will think of more questions, but whether I find out there answers is another thing.The whole world of 'virtual reality', is becoming realer and closer in the world that we live in. We can enter into many different aspects of virtual reality at the drop of the hat, thanks to technologies such as computers (the internet) computer games and the movies that we watch. However whether the whole idea of 'virtual reality' is good, that I am unsure of. My opinion is if we enter into a world that is outside of our reality, than we could be giving something of ourselves that we don't actually know we are giving, and could turn us into people that we might not normally be.

Having seen almost all of his films (excluding Dead Zone, The Fly and M.Butterfly), I have this somewhat rare opinion that eXistenZ is one of his masterpieces. It seems to me that this film was hugely misunderstood, culminating with the stupid idea of comparing this film to Matrix, a rather worthless and meaningless piece of nonsense. Here in eXistenZ, we have instead a very dense and deep meditation on the mystery of reality, of our inability to apprehend where do things come from. The characters appear and disappear as if moved by some mysterious agent, which remains inhapreenshible. Being Cronenberg a professed atheist, we can only arrive at the conclusion that each world which is presented to us and to the main characters comes from their own mind, which, nevertheless, only constitutes a part of the human body (it is now hazard that the characters have access to the game by means of something - a game pod - which is implanted into their bodies). Cronenberg stated many years ago that all reality is virtual; so, in this film, the use of the plot-device of virtual reality is a huge metaphor to the virtually of reality, as our director sees it.

After Videodrome and Naked Lunch, this is now his third movie featuring different levels of reality which gradually mix with each other until at the end, you don't know any more what reality is. Nowadays, you cannot say any more that this is a novel concept and, in addition, eXistenZ is much tamer, much more mainstream, and much weaker than Naked Lunch and, especially, Cronenberg's masterpiece Videodrome.  There simply isn't anything new which Cronenberg has to add to the subject.Moreover, the fact that the movie deals with computer gaming is misleading. First, the subject was probably chosen to attract a new audience (which isn't familiar with his previous movies). Second, Cronenberg's visions aren't very much based on what modern computer gaming really is, except, maybe, for adventure games. In Cronenberg's movie, the computer game allows you to enter another reality which, however, looks very much  like the reality you know, except that there seem to be other rules. Modern computer gaming, in turn, has already created a new reality which differs in its very characteristics from the world we know. This world is aggressive, fast paced, and the player as individual is reduced to its capability of reacting as fast as possible (this aspect is indeed captured much more appropriately in the - much weaker movie - The Matrix). Thus, Cronenberg's movie is more a surrealist dream than a serious discussion of the dangers of computer gaming. Of course, this is prefectly legal. The game console is a means of changing into another reality, just like the drugs were in Naked Lunch and video tapes were in Videodrome. At other times, the console appears more like a sexual fetish.eXistenZ has some interesting and remarkable scenes such as the whole part in the Trout Farm and the Chinese restaurant, but there are also involuntarily ridicolous scenes such as the character being stuck in a game loop. Overall, the images which Cronenberg chooses do not have the strength and impact of his older movies The central element, the organic console, just looks like what it is a piece of rubber. It is directly hooked up to the spinal chord, an unpleasant idea, but how much more impressive was the scene when James Woods inserted the video tape into his own stomach in Videodrome. All in all, eXistenZ is another trip into the weird world of David Cronenberg but into the more civilized regions which doesn't give you many surprises.

This time, from his weird and darkly prolific mind, comes a completely twisted version of a computed reality. Allegra Galler is a professional computer game designer, working for a huge company - Antenna Research. Her latest advanced software was named Existenz, probably because it allows the player to have total freedom INSIDE the game! So it was time to publish it, and nothing better to make it sell than a real demonstration of it in front of the public, and so it is done! However, to play Existenz, a Bioport is required. And you ask me &#150; What the hell is a Bioport anyway?. Well, have you ever heard of a hole in the base of your spine? No? Me neither, until I knew this wicked game! Only Antenna is legally authorized to implant a Bioport in every player who wants to be upgraded with the new invented interface, linking a person's body to the game and giving anyone a better and more realistic playability!In the presentation of Existenz, a few people have been selected to try the game and play it for the first time, along with the critically acclaimed Allegra Galler itself! And that's right here that the movie really starts, diving us into a strange world of a new reality, similar to a dream inside another dream! Confunsing? If you think so, wait until you see the movie! Inside the game the player can do everything in mind &#150; talk to characters, kill them, pick up objects, use them and lots of other things. However, as the game goes far and far, we start doubting reality itself, since lots of apparently nonsense begin to happen. Is all this just a game, or is this a dream about an unreal game? Something is wrong with Existenz. Can it be a game bug or are the players true assassins and crazy characters forever lost inside a stupid software? - This was the idea David Cronenberg wanted to give us. A truly confusing and twisted vision of how dangerous can a computer game be. The film constantly takes us back to reality every time the game is paused, but by the way... where is the game, the REAL life and time? Creepy, isn't it? Now add some computed character representations and you'll then doubt of everything else!In my opinion, this is another disturbing cinematographic creation, with a fantastic resemblance to the characteristics of a computer game. The movie ends apparently in a normal way, but is it a real Game Over, or just the start of a New Game? - If you're interested in a weird ride to a computer game world, then give this film a try. Otherwise, forget it to avoid serious brain damages!

Some real world exists which creates a synthetic world which in turn creates another synthetic world and so on. More in this film, conspiracies blend levels, reversing and folding roles. This is the stuff of Phil Dick, not the Matrix, or The One, or any of that other juvenile stuff.But there is a more fundamental difference Films like the matrix start with a story concept, then work to tell the story by whatever visual vocabulary is current. Cronenberg starts with a specific strong vision and hangs a story on it. Clearly, his vision here is for artificially living sexual paraphernalia. These have highly erotic exteriors but disgusting, reptilian interiors. The whole film is built around this notion prurient fiction, repellent pudenda.And the whole thing self-referentially encompasses the audience with the final level because the film clearly shows itself to be a creation in the same mold as Allegra's. I love this stuff, if only as an intellectual construction.But what puzzles me is Cronenberg's meekness. He knows he's a cult filmmaker, so why pander to a bunch of kids who will go to `The One' instead? Jennifer has the guts to do whatever is required.

In here, though, it is a video game; its creator, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is targeted by a anti-virtual reality activist group and, with the help of Ted Pikul (Jude Law), they have to get into the game to unravel a conspiracy.But what is real, and what is virtual? Never before was David Cronenberg's organic-like effects so well employed, serving not only to unnerve and gross the viewer but also as an excellent contrast to the sci-fi theme at the story's center. The organic guns, as well as the organic video game and how it connects to the user, are a surprisingly original, interesting and well developed idea.The film is tense, playing the way thrillers are supposed to be. The twists are very good, we are always left guessing what is going to happen next with anticipation, and overall it is all accentuated by Cronenberg's unnervingly gross visual style and well-oriented directing. The casting is excellent Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are very good by themselves, and have a surprising chemistry when together. The supporting actors, which includes Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm, are very good too.Though often overlooked thanks to the similarly-themed but more action packaged 'The Matrix', 'eXistenZ' is an excellent horror-inclined take on the reality questioning sci-fi subgenre and, to me, Cronenberg's best work (and I'm a fan of his).

After the test-run ends with an assassination attempt on Allegra's life (through the use of a teeth-shooting bone-gun), she and marketing trainee Ted Pikul (Jude Law) escape. Afraid that her baby, her game, may have been corrupted during the attack she decides to play with the the aide of Ted....Almost like an end of an era for Cronenberg, who recaptures many motives used in previous outings, especially in Videodrome (featuring similar techno-organic mind-warping TV becomes reality themes) and then moves on to different subject matter. On some level that proves to be the downfall of eXistenZ, which is incapable of providing the same fresh outlook as in prior works and is on every level inferior to the thematically identical Videodrome. The multi-layered reality can provide an interesting plot conundrum, deciphering what the game is and what it represents adding enjoyment (pure Philip K. Dick stuff) and a sense of satisfaction. However the point of virtual life transgressing into reality rings hollow and unconvincing, albeit the vision portrayed by Cronenberg becomes a striking reality. People now hooked to their eBook's, iPad, iPhone, seem terrifyingly similar to the premise of the movie - gamers connected through an umbilical cord to technological advancement, with the gadgets almost becoming a bodily extension.Interestingly the whole world of eXistenZ, one based on such technological wonders as VR, is crude, rundown, filthy and grimy, full of decrepit petrol stations, shadowy back-alleys, unhygienic chop shops (where organic game-pads are produced) and sleazy operating rooms. Advancement as regress? Instead of bettering out lives the technology makes it more worthless and ugly? Other interesting moments include Allegra and Ted leaving one 'reality' and entering another. Not entirely certain whether they are still in 'virtual' (just another level of it) or back into 'real reality', Allegra laughingly kills a former friend while the mountain hills burn on the horizons, stating It's only a game, isn't it?. No more rules? You can always reload the game, can't you? eXistenZ is almost unanimously frigid in acting and emotion, at times bordering on wooden and outdated (almost as if homaging B-horror performances of the 1980s). The essential problem stems however from uncertainty whether this is a deliberate ploy or a mishit utilisation of talented actors. A scene where Allegra criticises the woodenness of characters in the game suggests the former, but the crass acting proves detrimental to viewing. And that is the base problem with Cronenberg's movie, which is too indulged into the gimmicks spread throughout, that he fails to touch real depth. More focus is placed on slimy constructs and the concept of techno-organic post-reality that context seems to be taken for a ride.

I came out of this film feeling really dispirited and depressed, primarily because none of my expectations for a Cronenburg film were fulfilled.As soon as I saw the organic game pods, I laughed and was pleased, but the kind of development I was expecting of that idea did not materialise.  The gore and the organic props were simply displayed to us, as if that was enough to create a visceral response.  I'm afraid I found the scene in the Chinese Restaurant no more disturbing than actually eating chicken's feet for real.Too many of the action and plot points were set up in advance (such as the bony gun), leading to a lack of suspense.I think the worst aspect of the film is that there was no emotional involvement at any level.  Nothing was done to make us feel empathy with the characters.  The fact that we are in a game, and that game dialogue is trite and inane, is no excuse to use trite and inane dialogue throughout the film. The performances suffered as a result, and I was most disappointed in Jennifer Jason Leigh, who appeared to be sleepwalking through the whole movie.  The love scene seemed to be put in gratuitously just to show us some kissing.  Also Jude Law was completely miscast - his role should have gone to Christopher Ecclestone who, for our American friends who may not have seen him, is one of the most intense and powerful screen actors around. Law failed to convince that he was really scared or worried by developments.  One minute he is phobic about having his body penetrated, the next he is consenting to a spinal operation with scarcely a shrug.  Of course, if he's playing a game, he wouldn't be worried, no more than I am by playing Doom.  But a film has to use fear and uncertainty as a dramatic device to draw the audience into the story, and this is where eXistenZ failed completely.I think Cronenburg likes to think that the world he creates in his movies is existentialist and unemotional, but the fact remains that his best films, specifically The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers (I haven't seen M. Butterfly), all work because of their emotional power.  The musical scores for these films (all by Howard Shore) all serve to underline the emotional undercurrent, but in eXistenZ the score is simply trying to create a response which isn't provided by the film, and gives the same impression of hack-work which the rest of the film provokes.  Furthermore, if we take the example of The Fly, the theme of physical transformation is very clearly expressed and deeply explored.  In eXistenZ, I could see from the plot that Cronenburg's theme involved the nature of reality, but I found no deep exploration of this theme, unlike in, say, Videodrome.The whole film suffers very badly from having a small budget.  The various game worlds we are shown are all very small-scale and cramped - not even up to the standard of modern role-playing games.  Also the props and the special effects looked cheap, with only the bio-port in the characters' backs remotely convincing.  I feel that Cronenburg should have made some other film for the money he had, and to wait until he could raise enough money to make eXistenZ on a much larger canvas.  This also affected the ending of the film, which came too quickly, and seemed quite perfunctory. The fact that the world of reality was one in which there is a battle between gameplayers and realists, and that the world of the game was a world in which there was a battle between gameplayers and realists, and so on ad infinitum, seemed to indicate a distinct lack of imagination on Cronenburg's part, and undoubtedly gave away the ending, at least for me.When the film was coming to it's (for want of a better word) climax, I couldn't believe it - nothing had happened yet!  Even when the final twist happened, nothing major was at stake.  I didn't care whether we were still playing a game or whether this was the real reality.  We never found out enough about reality to know if the conflict between gameplayers and Realists was meaningful.  In the end, the entire film could have been made as one of the less intriguing episodes of the Outer Limits (the Twilight Zone has already been cited), and certainly the so-called twist-in-the-tail ending was every bit as predictable as one from one of those programmes.I feel that Cronenburg should avoid writing his films from now on.  In the early days of Scanners, The Brood and Videodrome (similarly emotionless in tone), the films were worth watching because nothing like them had been seen before.  As his career developed, the films were worth watching because he combined visceral imagery with strong emotionality.  Now we are back to just strong images with no emotional involvement, and in 1999 the imagery simply isn't strong enough to excite interest any more.  These same problems afflicted Crash, his last film.  For me, Dead Ringers remains his best film.The film is worth seeing, if you have never watched any of Cronenburg's past stuff, and you have had no exposure to science fiction.  Otherwise, there's nothing new or provocative in this film to make it worth watching.

What follows can only be described as a complete mind-f*!k!Ted and Allegra become increasingly disorientated as they play the game, their characters within eXistenZ plugging into virtual pods that take them into games within games. Eventually, neither they, nor the audience, can tell what is real and what is game-play, and even at the end of the film where events finally seem to make sense, the film's final line of dialogue sows seeds of doubt into the viewer's mind.Gorehounds might be a little disappointed with the level of splatter in this particular Cronenberg effort, with the only gruesome effects being a few bullet hits (some admittedly nasty ones to the face of one poor sap, mind you) and the juicy internal workings of a game pod, but with an excellent cast that includes Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm, and loads of weirdness, anyone who loves intelligent, thought provoking sci-fi with a surreal twist should have a blast.Oh, and Jennifer Jason Leigh still looks fabulous; I'd let her plug me into her meta-flesh pod any day!

This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic. A number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg urge to transcend reality-- and philosophical allusions such as the title's to Heidegger, along with existential questions i.e., the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate, and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game. One character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. Likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don't know what will happen next and you're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules. A virtual game within the game is titled TranscendenZ. Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. They don't like it but it is thrilling and part of the game, which then they fear is real. The game creator, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we've just witnessed-- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is real but the point is clear (to me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence.Nevertheless, while Cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the Reality ... underground name of terrorist group portrayed in the film both in the game and in the 'real' level. Seems that Cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film, though his impressive education comes through. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who's trying to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clich√©d bourgeois modernist credo-- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (My impression here might be due to one limited interview.) Still, Cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form (here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them, but a critique that is unable to transcend the same form) probably because he actually thinks that it is imaginative and radical. Yet the film's imaginative world is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-too-real world. It remains trapped in the computer game worldview.

This fact is actually somewhat down heartening when you consider how fantastically original those two and his earlier body-horror films are. Cronenberg is a superb director of course and many of his other films are excellent works but I do think that it's the ones where he takes full control of the screenplay as well as direction that are on the whole the most satisfying. The comparison between eXistenZ and Videodrome goes beyond this though, not only do they both incorporate bio-mechanical sci-fi like the bone gun that shoots teeth for bullets but they also both explore the ideas of technology physically shaping human beings in dark psychological ways. The former used the then contemporary technology of video; eXistenZ uses newer virtual reality video games as a means of fusing the director's ideas.Set some time in the near future, a group of people play a new game called eXistenZ. It's a virtual reality game that is organic. It works by accessing the central nervous system of the player and is powered by it. The person plugged into eXistenZ shapes the game itself.Cronenberg seems to be having some fun with this one. Realities fold over into other realities and because we all know that what we are experiencing is not supposed to be real this allows Cronenberg to really go for it and not worry about believability. It allows him to create perhaps his most surreal film yet. The world in eXistenZ is always a little off in some way and this is simply because we are in a game world and films rarely immerse themselves in such. Sometimes the strangeness is because of obvious things such as bizarre characters and strange awkward dialogue or the very odd setting like the trout farm where game consoles are made. But a lot of the other times, it's the less obvious details that create a feeling that something isn't right. The way background characters move and act, the way that places have game-like generic names like 'Country Gas Station' or 'Chinese Restaurant' and also the fact that people wear clothes with flat colours and designs with no intricate details (i.e. more game-like and easier for a computer to generate). So the attention to detail is really excellent. The participants also comment of aspects of the plot or game characters that don't work well &#x96; which was a nice detail and quite comical. The difficulty in distinguishing between fantasy and reality in a convincing virtual reality world is one of the key themes.Because of its reality-bending nature and the way the story arc pans out, eXistenZ is a film that invites repeat viewings. Many of the details only become apparent later on and re-watching it works well. It's not a film that tends to be mentioned much in discussions about the best films in Cronenberg's filmography but for me this is one of his most interesting and original.

It's `eXistenZ,' written and directed by Cronenberg; a mind-bender that will have you meeting yourself coming and going, and not knowing which is which before it's all over.  But that's the nature of the game, and there is, in fact, a very real possibility that you're actually not even reading this page right now-- I mean, how can you tell for certain?  And that gives you an idea of where this film is about to take you.Video game maven and designer extraordinaire Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has created the ultimate virtual reality video game, eXistenZ (pronounced EGs-ah-stenz), and a control group has been assembled to test it out, with Allegra herself as the guide and game-master.  This is not your typical video game, however, not by a longshot; to play, in fact, the participants have to be fitted with a `bio-port,' which is implanted in the base of the spine, and into which the game is hooked up via a connection that looks like an umbilical cord.  The game module itself is like nothing you've ever seen, either.  A kind of erotic-looking latex affair on the outside, the components are actually organic in composition.  From all appearances, this is going to be one wild ride of game, which is exactly what Allegra and her company is promising.The night of the test is ill-omened, however, in light of the fact that rival companies are out to either steal or stifle the realization of eXistenZ.  There have even been death threats, and an assassination attempt on Allegra's life at this juncture is clearly within the realm of possibility; and accordingly, a bodyguard, Ted Pikul (Jude Law) has been assigned to protect Allegra, and most importantly, the game-- the prototype of which is the only one in existence.  And it is in Allegra's personal game module.  And so the festivities begin, with the promise of excitement that just may transcend even all that eXistenZ has to offer.Reminiscent of a couple of his earlier films, `Videodrome' and `Scanners,' Cronenberg has crafted and delivered a thought provoking film, the message of which he presents (as he did with his aforementioned films) in fairly graphic terms.  He plants the seeds of disconcerting shadows in your imagination, then waters them with visual stimuli that encompasses myriad forms of all things creepy and crawly.  In addition, he weighs in heavily on the fear factor, relying on the effects blood, slime and things that ooze will have upon his audience.  And it's all very effective.  He sets a good pace and attempts to balance out story and F/X, but he does enjoy things that gurgle and spill out, and more often than not the F/X tend to take precedence over the story.  But this is Cronenberg's style, and it works well for him in most instances.Having such a definite visual style, however, does not necessarily lend strength to character development, and Cronenberg (it would seem) relies upon the creativity and initiative of his actors to find the tone that will most effectively convey their respective characterizations most accurately and efficiently.  Essentially, the characters are a secondary consideration, if fact, so any depth that may have added considerably to the emotional involvement or impact of this film is absent.  Cronenberg is too intent on suggesting the effects of all of this on `people,' and as such, the individual gets lost in the shuffle of goo.Given Cronenberg's priorities, it's no surprise then that the performances suffer somewhat from it.  Jennifer Jason Leigh looks terrific in this one, and she's certainly convincing to a point, but Cronenberg has written a one-note symphony, and that is precisely what he extracts from his actors-- nothing more and nothing less.  There's just not enough `shock value' to be derived from detail and nuance of portrayal, so Cronenberg simply doesn't bother with it.  Jude Law also succumbs to the maestros style of conducting, but he plays the note he's given as well as can be expected.As Kiri Vinokur, Ian Holm's talents are wasted in a role better suited to the likes of Vincent Schiavelli or Dick Miller.  Furthermore, Shciavelli would have been perfect in the role of Gas, as well, which in the film is played convincingly enough by Willem Dafoe.  But again, for Cronenberg's needs it was a phone-in; certainly not a stretch, by any means, for Dafoe. In fact, it would have been an interesting casting twist to have Schiavelli play both parts (and it would have saved on the budget-- two birds with one stone!).  Also slipping into the portrayal Straits of the Individual Lost are Sarah Polley (Merle) and Christopher Eccleston (Levi).The supporting cast includes Don McKellar (Yevgeny), Callum Keith Rennie (Hugo), Oscar Hsu (Chinese Waiter) and Kris Lemche (Noel).  In retrospect, Cronenberg's film is something of a study in contradictions; while it has a concept that is intellectually stimulating, the presentation is designed for a target audience that will inherently lack the capacity or experience to appreciate the more profound aspects of it.  Interestingly enough, this same year (1999) the Wachowski Brothers explored similar territory, thematically, in the resoundingly successful `The Matrix,' which not only has superior F/X, but pays close attention to characterization, through which a sense of autonomy-- even among the masses-- emerges effectively.  And it is precisely that lack of consideration of the individual human element that makes `eXistenZ' less than satisfying.  Cronenberg has a terrific idea here, at the heart of which is a cautionary tale with a significant moral; and it's a shame that that is not the film he made.  Instead, he delivers a film that is entertaining on a very base and basic level, but which, in the final analysis, limits itself unnecessarily.  6/10.

The idea of getting lost in pseudo realities is also very old, for example Videodrome. I also found a lot of the effects in this film very similar to videodrome, such as 'The Gun' In fact the effects were fairly basic and even poor at some points, eg sitting in a car with a moving background. I know this can all be classed as David Cronenberg's Stylish view on things, but something bugs me about a film depicting the future of gaming without using any of the modern abilities of computer effects. Is it a clever view of todays world or is it just cheap? A similar film would be The Matrix, which I found to be the better movie with plenty of modern 'cyberpunk' style of it's own. eXistenZ is worth watching for the storyline but I wouldn't get over excited and after watching it, watch The Matrix and see how computer effects can be used for more than just laser beams.

While it is not a bad film in the whole sense, anyone that has seen Crash knows that Mr.Cronenberg can be more subtle in the middle of shocking and gross sequences and possesses the talent not to insult the audience by giving them the plot on a silver plate. The plot isn't even that different or original or complex..it is nothing that we have never seen before in order for him to prepare us so much to digest(specially the ending which came out as an easy way out of a dead-end in which he probably found himself while writing the film). The performances lacked humanity and the script wasn't really helping the actors (how can anyone believe that the designer of the game was on a same level as the newbie played by Jude Law all the way...it was so stupid that there had to be something there to explain..something as stupidly convincing as what we get to know really happened in the ending).

It flew mostly over my head in what it was conveying thematically, though I still thought it was pretty cool- not enough to immediately re-watch, however, leaving it on my VHS shelf to dust. Cut to eight years later, and having seen most of the director's films it seemed appropriate to re-visit this little science fiction oddity, which did (as many critics at the time noted) get underrated thanks to the Matrix. While the Wachowski's made the better movie, it is of note though that Cronenberg probably carries just as much weight with psychology and philosophy in his worlds, if not more so the former for sure. Plus- as was an unintended bonus having waited this long to re-visit the film- getting into Philip K. Dick works didn't hurt either in appreciating the bizarre but palpable world Cronenberg's created here.It's not just the Three Stigmata book, but also A Maze of Death, that could be called into comparison. Cronenberg's characters are either wise to the fact that the world they inhabit, a kind of futuristic time where it seems more like an alternate reality of the present, or they're closed off from it. The basic gist of the plot reads like pure pulpy PKD a video-game designer, the best in the world named Allegra (Leigh) is on the lam after nearly getting killed at the unveiling of her new system of the movie's title, and Ted (Jude Law, at first annoyingly whiny, but it's something one gets used to as he is a good actor above all else), a PR man, follows along to do what he can. Problem is, he doesn't have a portal for the gaming system to go through, as it's all a bunch of intestinal-type tubes and plugs into the base of the spine. Soon they find safe haven to play the game, but are they *really* playing it? Are they suddenly thrown back into reality at a moment's notice? There is even a twist ending, and then a catch on that ending, that has that great sensation of being jolted back, as Dick could do, but in a more visceral manner as only Cronenberg can handle.eXistenZ is crafty as a thriller, and inventive with the special effects it's not without some notice that because of the devices and means of teleportation that there's comparison to the Matrix. But there's also a tendency to overlook how stark Cronenberg is in dealing with the violence- where the Matrix is slick and full of technical innovations to match its alternate universe, eXistenZ is shot and cut in a style that isn't too different from other Cronenberg movies, and in and of itself is probably even more graphic than anything Hollywood could easily cook up. This goes without saying, of course, that either film could, and has been, easy fodder for a philosopher like Slavoj Zizek to deconstruct what is it to suddenly replace what is programed with reality, with free-will, with energy from one's own body (or, as he says, libido) into a new construct? And as Maze of Death also suggested, quite chillingly, how far is the capacity for murder and mayhem and destruction and betrayal when all bets are off? There's a moment when Allegra keeps saying, chuckling about it as the ski-lodge burns down and there's a tense moment between her and Ted, that 'it's only a game.' Is that all? It deserves to make comparisons to these other works not simply to add some puffed-up weight to this review. Cronenberg's film, albeit a little flawed (it's a little tough to get into the flow of the two leads, who don't seem to have chemistry at first, and only as the game goes on does it start to gel completely), has the questions to raise to make it as potent a work as anything Dick could come up with, or at least following along on the path previously treaded. And, on top of this, he makes it a fun and wicked ride, with a great couple of scenes for Willem Dafoe (is it in the script?), a fascinating amphibian mutant, and a guessing game that isn't cheaply manipulative. Taking another look at it all years later, in fact, it's probably one of the better films to come out in 1999.

His films are always emotional, but not in the sense of a tear-jerker or a melodrama. His emotion comes from a vivid portrayal of the more sensual, sensitive, mood-oriented perspective of life, perhaps like life in a dream. eXistenZ explores two people entering a virtual reality game and feeling it like one would a dream if one could remember every nuance of a dream like one can with conscious life. But mysteriously, every scene feels warmly insulated, like there is no such thing as life outside of a particular interior setting or like the characters in the scene are the only ones in the world as far as we are concerned. Cronenberg thrives on extreme sensitivity, and eXistenZ is a perfectly tailored fit for a filmmaker like him.The film avoids every dull clich√© of the technological thriller, as even the mechanisms and objects involving playing the game, even guns, are all somehow living. They are made of flesh, they pulsate. The music by Howard Shore, as you can expect from any Cronenberg film, is intensely moving, the personification of moving under dark water. You see, the way I'm describing my thoughts on this film are the only way I can think of to truly communicate what I mean. The film's effect is so deeply inherent and invertedly emotional that one cannot truly do it justice without talking about it as if one were writing prose.Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are wonderful as the two lead characters, mustering every ounce of duplicity they're capable of to successfully portray the affected archs of their characters in the story.

It's a complex film & I could easily see many viewers getting bored or frustrated with it & losing interest but I was glued to it & it really engrossed me.

The character's are good, the dialogue not overly complex or full of technical jargon so most will be able to follow it easily & I also thought eXistenZ contained that one element which many films & they're makers have forgotten about, originality.

Maybe a bit of all four, it felt fresh & different & I must admit I liked the abrupt 'you decide what happened' ending.Director Cronenberg is a class act all day long, he loves his bizarre imagery & complex stories doesn't he? He's made some cracking films over the years & I think eXistenZ is up there with the best of them like Videodrome (1983), The Fly (1986) & Dead Ringers (1988) all of which come highly recommended by me. He films with style & there's plenty of memorable scenes here. The gore levels aren't as high as in some of Cronenberg's other films so don't expect buckets of blood although someone has the side of their face shot off.Technically eXistenZ is top notch, the look of the film, the locations, the special effects & production values are great. I got the feeling that everything in eXistenZ was carefully thought through & deliberate. The acting was good although I thought Jude Law was a bit flat.eXistenZ is a great film which I liked immensely, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Well worth watch for those who want something a bit different, Cronenberg fans & those who like sci-fi/horror. Definitely recommended.

The early schlockfests with local actors in Montreal and Toronto gave way to more thoughtful fantasy films like The Fly, Naked Lunch and Dead Ringers. Now we see Cronenberg desperately cannibalizing his earlier work through repetition of imagery. The organic gun refers to the surgical instruments of Dead Ringers, the bio-port to the stomach-vagina of Videodrome or the anus-typewriter of Naked Lunch (still my favorite of his films). Where are the funny parts for the actors? Jude Law is terrible in a badly written role, Jennifer Jason Leigh should be sluttishly sexy but is just tiresome instead. I thought Don McKellar was going to choke on his hair, or on his fake Russian accent.Cronenberg has used up his capital as an artist.

Perhaps Cronenberg played such a game once and lost, and this movie is his 'revenge'?

But the movie seemed to descend into grossness for the sake of grossness, and that got tiresome quickly.The ending (if it can be called that) was unsatisfying, and provides no closure for the viewer...it leaves you guessing at what the movie was all about, and what the POINT of this 90 minute mish-mash was...Cronenberg has directed _FAR_BETTER_ films...'Scanners', and 'Videodrome' come to mind.  At least those films had actual beginnings, middles, and ends.  eXistenZ was a confused, circular, gross, mess all the way thru, with the characters having no discernable goals, and no discernable changes. The only thing learned in this movie is that Cronenberg's writing and directing skills have gone far downhill, and subsequent movies he works on should be avoided.

I was lured into the movie theater by the statement that eXistenZ was similar to The Matrix. Having seen both movies, though, I wonder why anybody would compare eXistenZ to The Matrix, because the only sane conclusion one might arrive at is that The Matrix is by an order of magnitude better than eXistenz. In fact, I can not think of many movies that are not by an order of magnitude better than eXistenZ.The idea eXistenZ is trying to convey is that if you had a virtual computer reality that would be indistinguishable from reality, then you could not distinguish between reality and virtual reality.While this is without a doubt an idea of inherent truth and beauty, it is not very much to fill ninety minutes -- at least if you're trying to get along without any good actors and any recognizable story line.If the two main characters do not slaughter any bizarre life forms, petrol station employees, or each other, they stumble around so pathetically that you immediately realize why Jennifer Jason Leigh never became much more than a B-movie actress. Her display of acting skills in this film is limited to being shy and just being there.Similarly, her partner Jude Law restricts himself to expressing confusion and not knowing what is going on, which is at least consistent with his role as a marketing trainee being confronted with a new technology without second level support staff available.Together, they experience a set of surprising twists and turns in the plot, which surprise the audience not because the plot is clever and unexpected, but because the events are totally incoherent and without the slightest relation to each other or anything else.The most memorable scene is when the two protagonists go down on each other for no apparent reason. As it turns out, there is no reason why they do it. The game just wants them to warm up emotionally for the next scene. Incredible.The problem with this movie is not that it is bad. The problem is that the movie is just totally irrelevant. Weren't it for the time and money I wasted to see it, I would simply have forgotten it existed at all. If you're in the mood for having your concept of reality shaken, I recommend you watch The 13th Floor (which is not a very good movie either, but still much better than eXistenZ) or even better go and watch The Matrix (which is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing motion pictures of the year).

This film broke those rules by not having either.The film circled around the 'are we/aren't we in the game' scenario that has occurred at least once in every sci-fi series in the past 12 years, which ordinarily you wouldn't mind except that Cronenberg did nothing new with it. There was no depth to the plot, in fact I would go as far as to say there was no plot. By the end of the film the story hadn't gone anywhere. That is if you call the last part of the film an ending, the whole thing stopped dead as if there was a power cut while Cronenberg was writing and he couldn't be bothered to reboot and complete the story.As for the film as a whole, it was boring and predictable. In fact because of the unoriginality of the story I could guess the ending almost before the opening credits had finished. The special effects would have looked tacky 10 years ago, I've seen car tires which look more organic that those game pods did. And what was the deal with that tooth gun, I know this is sci-fi, but there's no way anything like that could exist, the very fact that it did should have been a good indication that they were in a game.Then there's the acting. The majority of the characters were two dimensional and poorly written, and that scene at the beginning where the dying man is saying to Jude Law Trust no one you just sit there and wait for him to finish the sentence Mr. Mulder. The best thing about the whole film was Jude Law's character who seemed to change in each new environment so you got the idea that he's not all he appears.

The movie features a fascination and well thought out concept, which gets greatly executed by director David Cronenberg.eXistenZ is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. You just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.The movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. They have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.The movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over-the-top with either one. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events, dialogs and unusual environments.The movie is not only just weird though. I was actually surprised to see that Videodrome has an higher rating on here, thought it's a far more inaccessible and 'odd' movie. The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. It doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies.The movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look, that also provides the movie with a certain required 'gaming' feeling.The movie is well cast, with Jude Law in a role you don't too often see him in, that of a shy insecure person. It once more shows how actually versatile Law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh also was a great female lead. She hasn't really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star. The movie also features some other well known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe.An highly original movie that is well worth watching, especially if you have seen Videodrome previously.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"You have to WATCH the movie, to find out WHY you're watching the movie.","Date":"15 June 2006","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? Let's consider this movie as 'A History Of Violence' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now. Everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details  The nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote In The Days of Perky Pat) by creating a 'Perky Pat' fast-food restaurant. The nod to Stanley Kubrick by using 2001's naming pattern ; as IBM became HAL (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in eXistenZ 'classic lubricant spray' WD-40 becomes XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra cleans up Pikul's port. The nod to David Cronenberg by using Videodrome's witty kind of formula ('Death to...' & 'Long Live'..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in Videodrome, Video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you penetrated a TV set. In 1999, you're penetrated by a game. Welcome to Canada!)The nod to good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, Howard Shore's music and Ronald Sanders's editing (a team that wins). For everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. Enough with the nods. The plot ? Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players' minds as we can see on the movie main details page. That's the story in the story. To me, this picture is about a 'reality demonstrators' young couple infiltrating the 'brand new virtual game' presentation session to destroy its programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there's such thing as reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie IS the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, 'Cronenbergy realistic' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there's a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays eXistenZ's genius programmer and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegra's game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about her pod's health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and Pikul in then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, TranscendenZ programmer.Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the 'reality demonstrator' turns into Allegra, a 'virtuality goddess').What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? To be truly engaged in the world ?And what about Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what ? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, The Mecanic -) ??? Yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; eXistenZ's discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. And we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.

In order to get to the bottom of events, they must actually play the game, and beat it.eXistenZ was directed by the fine, Canadian-bred film auteur David Cronenberg and as you would expect, there's a lot more going on in this existence than you think. But first things first I have to say that if it weren't for its gross-out, reality-bending effects, Cronenberg would be registered somewhere by the MPAA as Public Enemy #1. For this latest effort, which bears a few shades of his previous mass-media indictment Videodrome (1983), Cronenberg dissects reality, virtual reality, and the corporate video-gaming universe.Allegra has spent the last five years of her life developing eXistenZ, its internal programming happening to be composed of the parts of mutant amphibians (which are also made out to be a nutritional delicacy in some quarters). She hugs the device as if it were her baby, and for some reason we're not led to believe that she's faking it when she treats as if it were so. eXistenZ was made to test the boundaries of human perceptions of reality and this it seems, she was successful at doing, since as the film progresses, it becomes harder and harder to decipher if they are playing the game or not.This is what Cronenberg specializes in with this picture, and getting great mileage out of the confusion of the protagonists as they nor we are aware of our surroundings anymore. After the first bizarre sequence of the picture, Allegra and Ted retreat to the relative safety of the countryside, where the bio-port-phobic Ted has one installed by nut-so mechanic Gas (Willem Dafoe) at the Country Gas Station and the two uncover a confusing plot about pro-reality rebels trying to assassinate the pro-virtual reality Allegra. And with help of supporting oddball regulars such as Ian Holm and Don McKellar aligned with them, they seek to beat eXistenZ and the rebels out to get them.It was released a few months after The Matrix in 1999, a similar film about the redefinition of reality and those caught in a battle to destroy it. But while that great, milestone action film is more interested in popcorn effects rather than deep philosophy and questions about reality, eXistenZ goes the extra mile by making sure we are never sure of our perceptions of the picture as a whole. Is the film, eXistenZ, some warped fantasy game, made by an insane genius? Are assassins really on the trail of an innocent programmer? Do flesh & bone guns that fire human teeth really exist (and which can otherwise very easily get past any metal detector)?It's questions like these that make eXistenZ such a fascinating film from a storyteller who knows his stuff. But you know you're in trouble when video games start to spill into your waking hours and consume every aspect of your natural life and making YOU wreak havoc.

Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real one.Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.The problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. Yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. I have once heard someone state that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.But what for? It criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.So whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.In a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. It'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there's nothing I can really do with it. I do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused I don't know if that was Cronenberg's flaw or Cronenberg's point, and I don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"BoredZzz, capital B and capital Z","Date":"25 December 2010","Score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Here do you get from a nice idea for a movie to a terrible film?

After an assassination attempt is made on her during a volunteer participant game launch, she and Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a meek PR agent who has been assigned as her body guard, find themselves on the run in the countryside, where reality and the virtual world of eXistenZ coalesce as they plug themselves in in order to salvage the game.It had been years since I'd originally seen this film, and I recently re-watched it as an adult with some extra years in me, and the film was in some ways stranger (and in others more logical) than I had remembered it. eXistenZ is a magnificently surreal exploration of virtual reality with notes of Cronenberg's signature body horror and all the makings of a trippy sci-fi exploitation flick.Fans of science fiction, head trip horror, and Cronenbergian splatter will find plenty of enjoyment to be had here. The film's ominous opening frames the surrealistic, ambiguous shifts in and out of reality that make up the last two third of the movie. I feel that some of the disappointment audiences had with the film (both upon its original release and over the ensuing years) has been due to mismatched expectations; for as much of a sci-fi thriller as this is, it's also extremely talky and dialogue-driven. This gives room for some very interesting and nuanced performances, specifically from Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose acting is calculated and simultaneously free-flowing. In retrospect, Jude Law seems miscast here to me to some degree, although he does succeed in drawing out the beta-male elements of his character that evolve into moments of legitimate confrontation as the film progresses.The special effects here are not over the top, and actually are rather minimal; most of the fantastical whimsy of the film comes from its labyrinthine distortions of events, virtual gameplay, and performativity of the self in both tangible reality and the matrix that is eXistenZ. The finale of the film is understated and shockingly macabre, and, though not as inventive as you may expect, is cleverly constructed and in many ways remarkably dour and nihilistic.Overall, my revisiting of this film was quite an experience; for first-time viewers, it is likely to be even more so. Jennifer Jason Leigh's nuanced performance is reason enough to give the film a viewing, but there is plenty more in way of thematic material, surrealism and hyper-realism, and maddening existential questions that Cronenberg frames through a matrix of science fiction and utter weirdness. The film has held up surprisingly well over the years, and is as engrossing today as it was nearly twenty years ago. 8/10.

With the prototype of the new game in their possession, the pair must enter the game's realm to unlock the various puzzles and threats that now confounds and stalks them.With Cronenberg back to writing something solely from his own head, eXistenZ finds the Canadian auteur happy to be back making a truer piece of work for his kinked visions. Unfortunately the advent of such virtual reality fare and various realist themes was well in filmic swing come the time eXistenZ was released, rendering it in some eyes as a band wagon jumper. That's unfair, because it's still a unique film, as Cronenberg blends body horror with visual invention to create a mind warp of gaming possibilities, a thrum thrum of futuristic verve. He gets top performances out of Leigh (great hair as well) and Law, while the narrative is constantly tricky enough to demand the viewer pays attention whilst being prepared to, perhaps, be surprised.Not prime Cronenberg, but still smart and funky, twisty and nutty, scary and oblique.

The writers have no concept of what a game is and apparently did no research into gaming community. The confusion which was probably intentional, does not help the constant plot twists and double crossing. While an argument could be made that the confusion, plot twists and complete lack of logic was attributable to the minds of the killers, this does not excuse an over poorly written film. It is possible to tell a story like this without loosing your audiences interest or empathy for the characters. The final 5 mins of the film, which is the only part of the film to occur outside the actual game, does make sense now. Given that the deranged killers are out of the decision making process, this makes sense, to the movies credit, but many will see the final twist coming.The plot is a mess, the characters all over the place and visuals, while intensionally disturbing are not amazing but simply adequate. That said, elements of the film are very well done. The fact that I came away hating the protagonists is understandable given that in reality they were the antagonists. The disjointed plot, and constant illogical decisions of the characters, as well as the constant backstabbing are all explainable by the psyche's of the killers. Despite this eXistenZ is probably a film you will only watch once, which is a pity because it is also the type of film that reveals more of itself with more viewings.

I despise it when a director does the same style or theme a thousand times and no one is more guilty of it than he(except for maybe Tim Burton). It gets repetitive though I understand why some might like his type of work. I watched another film of his-Video Drome-and hated it. I thought it was like someone trying to throw every type of food they liked into a blender put forgot to put the top on-a complete mess in other words. EXistenZ though takes all those foods and manages to create an exquisite- though somewhat disgusting-cuisine. The story is about a game designer in a future where game systems are biologically engineered. A bounty is put out on her head and now she must team up with a PR guy to stay alive. But it gets a thousand times more complicated from there. The movies goes through so many twists and turns that it actually almost became disorienting. Yet it stays fixed on the same idea is this reality? Video Drome had a similar set up but an awful pay off unlike what he did with this picture. My only complain is just how graphic and foul mouthed he got. Are ten f-bombs seriously needed for this picture? Still the atmosphere and story are actually strong enough to make me want to watch it again sometime.

The acting was sub- par, it wasn't not bad, but it definitely was not good. Some bits just felt really fake and unbelievable, a lot of the actors reactions to situations, especially in the last scenes, just felt very unreal, as if they weren't really trying, and the director wasn't being firm enough with the actors about how he wanted them to be.The second point was the script, some parts of it just seemed really strange, or unnecessary. The sexual-tension between the two characters made the movie feel comedic and silly at some points. Obviously having two attractive young main characters, there is going to be sexual tension, but the way it played out seemed unrealistic. I think the director did intend for some parts to be comedic, but it really distracted me from what I think the director made me want to feel.The last point is the game devices, it was just plain weird. I don't understand why the director couldn't have made it an electronic device. It was another one of those things that just made it feel strange, strange can be good, but this was just an unnecessary strange.Now for the good parts. This movie really makes you think, and it grabs you from the start. It makes you question how real is this reality we are living in, could it just be a game? Are we just actors in a simulation, playing our role for this lifetime? When a director can make an audience think things life this, I love it.The way the movie takes you through the whole story is really interesting, it takes random turns, it confuses you, makes you wonder what the hell is going, on. But in the end, it all comes together.Honestly, it's hard for me to say much more without spoiling anything. I highly recommend this to anyone into existential themes in movies. Try to ignore the flaws, and let the movie take you on it's journey. "},{"Title":"This is possibly one of the best movies I've seen.

Full of surprise and shock associated with its director David Cronenberg. Very similar to one of his earlier films, Videodrome, which also dealt with reality and fantasy within technology. Detailed storytelling leaving questions in its conclusion. Jennifer Jason Leigh is excellent as the game creator with a price on her life after a public demonstration concludes with a shootout. Jude Law serves as her protector who goes through the painstaking operation of bio-pod in order to play the game. Willem Dafoe plays Gas the mechanic who can perform bio-pod operations yet he also has a sinister side that is costly. Ian Holm operates on Leigh's pod when it is damaged. He factors in and out leaving viewers guessing as to whether he is friend or foe. Don McKellar plays another strange contact within the game who provides information. In the end it really doesn't matter because the destructive nature of the game seems to rule out. While it doesn't always make sense, it does succeed as superb effects driven entertainment. It is a mind-blowing visual thriller about video games and marketing that is worth plugging into.

Jude Law is usually an incredible actor, and his performance in this is serviceable, but he is god-awful at doing an American accent. Just about every aspect of this film doesn't reach it's potential. The performances are OK, but not great, the directing is OK, but not great, and the script was... not very good. A few plot holes, and by the climax of the film I was not invested in what was happening at all. Also, I've now figured out that David Cronenberg has a strange tentacle/foot fetish. There were a few serious moments involving tentacles that made me laugh out loud. The only upside to the film was the puppetry, some of these puppets/special effects were very realistic looking and pretty gross at that. But other than that, the film was a complete mess.

"},{"Title":"Contains some familiar ideas but is well-executed and thought-provoking","Date":"11 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" The ending left me with goosebumps. I had a strong feeling of d√©j√† vu and felt like the movie had actually stopped to ask me a question directly. It was like an electrical jolt that left me sitting there reflecting on the ideas still floating around in my mind. A nice feeling, exactly what you want from a sci-fi thriller.Much of the movie revolves around the simple question of how do you know if this is reality you're in right now? Maybe you're in a game. You could even be in a game within a game. How can you ever tell for sure? By itself, that question can be a bit dull. A pointless unanswerable question, only asked for the sake of sounding clever. But in the right context, it has a much deeper relevance and can be unsettling.Do violent video games make us violent? Or do we create and play violent video games because we are violent? Or can they be a healthy outlet for us with things we would never do in real life? Can we separate reality and games?In eXistenZ, the characters play games. Games that look and feel extremely real. Jude Law's character is new to them, like us. And naturally, he is a bit uncomfortable at first. It is unnerving how real the game is. I personally find many technologies far too invasive or user-friendly (dumbed down so I don't know what's really going on behind the scenes) for my liking. I prefer transparency and control. So I would probably hate a video-game that was too real. I like to see the pixels, I like to be able to pause and get a drink. If something's going to look real, it may as well be real.Anyway, violence occurs in the games of eXistenZ. I guess it may as well. I mean, if you're in a virtual world, why not do all the things you can't do in real life? Explore weird personal sexual and violent fantasies, or just try things out. What does it feel like to kill someone? For me, this is just a bottomless pit that I have no interest in going down. You have to stay connected to reality. You can always imagine things, think about stuff, read books or watch movies. I love video games but as a form of art. A story told with words, music, images and gameplay. Like a movie but interactive which makes them more dream-like, flexible and personal. I want to always be actively thinking and reacting, not in a trance.Back to the story. What happens when you wake up from the game? How do you know if you've really woken up? You might still be in the game, it could be tricking you. You might start doing some daily chores or work and then come out of the game later realising that all that time and energy you had spent was wasted on a virtual world.Or later you might be in the real world but fall into game habits. Eventually you might think you're actually in the game. What if something bad or dangerous happens and you ignore it because you think you're playing? Or you casually do something violent because you think there are no consequences? Or you gradually find you *need* a regular fix of violence and one day you can't login to the game?Allegra (Jennifer Jason Leigh) herself seems somewhat addicted to the game she has created. She compares it to the boredom of real life. She often seems drowsy, like her real body is getting weak from spending too much time playing (lying down) rather than living. It may sound trite but if you find real life boring, it's probably you that is boring.The ending is very interesting and ironic. It's funny to reflect on the way the movie itself is like a virtual reality game. The actors are the players and the writer/director is the game designer. It also raises the issue of protest and censorship. Does censoring something really achieve anything? Can you ban something just because you think it's bad for people? Or is that simply presumptuous destruction, is it hypocritical? If a game's popular, does that make it valuable, something that should be left alone? The issue is alive and well in 2015 GTA5 was recently taken off certain shelves in Australia which provoked a (semi-sarcastic) petition for Target to change its name.eXistenZ has an effective and fairly unique tone. Most of the movie is in close-ups, we can't escape the characters or their situations. We're in their minds the whole time. The music is suitably moody, a bit ambiguous but generally ominous. Like slow, slushy oceans of thoughts and unexplored worlds. Cronenberg once again shows off a strange imagination - there's a cute little dragon thing, gross food, a creepy futuristic organic gun and ports at the base of people's spines (similar to The Matrix). The acting is good, we feel what the characters feel but often have no idea of their motivations. We start suspecting everyone.There are interesting similarities to Inception, The Matrix and even The Wizard of Oz. Inception is much more ambitious and emotionally richer. The Matrix is more of an action film with some simple philosophical ideas that aren't really explored properly (they conveniently never question the reality of the world outside The Matrix). eXistenZ is more claustrophobic. We're stuck in the minds of two characters as they play a strange dream-like game which we don't know the rules or purpose of (like in real life). By the end, I was subtly blown away. It's both simpler and more complex than what I had anticipated.

I felt that all actors did an excellent job, especially portraying the changeable personalities necessary to the plot, including the ambiguities that make the audience question whether they are observing a character or a player.I do think the script and plot were flawed. There were holes in the plot that could not always be taken as hints to what is real and what is not.In conclusion, this is an entertaining movie. I would class it as pretty good, but not great.

I wasn't completely wowed by the film when I first saw it in college and I would go on to say that it wasn't my favorite David Cronenberg film I've seen but I wanted to see it my tastes have changed and see if time has made me think differently about the film.It did&#x85;a little bit.The story I always felt was a little strange because the organic pods that were the gaming systems in the movie were a little too far-fetched for me to believe&#x97;considering our next gen systems are really just improving the graphics by a barely noticeable fraction and raising the prices of the systems to levels that are hard for you, your heart, and your bank account to not notice, the idea of organic systems that plug directly into your spine felt like the ideas of a person who has never played a video game in their life. This time around, I was a little more forgiving of the story and the organic pods didn't really grate on me. I think this has to do with the fact that I've seen pretty much all of Cronenberg's work since the first time I saw it and I'm a little more used to his unique body horrors style that is mixed with a hint of uncomfortable sexuality.One thing I really latched onto with my revisit has to be the more subtle aspects that Cronenberg threw in the film that alerts the viewer about what reality the main characters are existing in. I never caught this the first time but this time around I was able to catch it and it even made me pay closer attention to try and find all the clues.The one thing I didn't enjoy the first time and ended up still not getting into on the second viewing was the performances. It's strange seeing Jude Law in this film considering how he acts now but he was passable at best&#x97;I didn't really find him distracting or amazing the first time I watched this. However, like on my initial voyage with this film, I just couldn't get into Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. I found her to be too hammy and overdoing it in her role as game developer Allegra Geller.While I found myself appreciate the film a little deeper than I did the first time, it wasn't a very noticeable change in depth. The film is still one of my least favorite Cronenberg films and it doesn't feel like it has the same ambition as his other works but it is still a decent film that tells an odd story and gets the old noodle thinking when the credits hit.Greetings, reader!

The game within a game theme is very predictable but leads to the excellent question at the end. Are they still in a game? The answer almost has to be yes. The biggest proof of this is a mixture of the stiff acting that tends to accompany games in the movie and in life as well as the reaction of the patrons in the Chinese restaurant when the waiter was shot compared with the reactions of the participants when the two people at the end were shot. In a real life event people would be running and screaming, not looking on with almost bored looks on their faces. Another question is, are any of the people real or all they all just players? If anyone is real it's the Chinese waiter because at the end he's the only one who questions if it's still a game. Game characters would not question Am I in a game?

His last film 'Crash' about people with a fetish for car accidents fell short but 'eXistenZ' finds him right at the top of his game.We are sometime in the future and a game designer named Allegra Geller (ever-reliable Jennifer Jason Leigh) has created a virtual reality game named eXistenZ. This is some game. It runs off of a cord, which hooks, into a bio-port that is implanted into the base of the player's spine. The player squeezes a strange pod (at the other end of the cord) that looks like strangely like a fetus.The game is being marketed by Antenna Research and one of the game's test subjects is a trainee named Ted (Jude Law). Suddenly an assassin steps up and shoots Allegra in the shoulder. What comes out is not a bullet but a piece of bone.Allegra and Ted are by now sure that they are inside the game. Allegra realizes later that she is not only inside the game but can't get out of it. Ted receives instructions that he is to go to a certain Chinese restaurant and order the special. The plate consists of a lot of bone and when put together make up &#x96; you guessed it &#x96; a gun.The rest I have to leave up to you. The movie becomes a clever cat-and-mouse game that gets more and more terminally weird as it goes along.There are twists and turns and more bizarre developments in this movie until you aren't sure if Allegra and Ted are playing the game or not. Sometimes they think they are in the game and sometimes we aren't sure but it keeps you guessing and afterwards my friend and I had a long discussion over the ending, which comes as a complete shock.I saw this movie a few days after I saw 'The Matrix' which is also about the reality of unreality but I found 'eXistenZ' to be the superior film. Both are good but I found the world of this film to be a little more depraved, a little more grotesque and oddly, a little more appealing. The Matrix comes out of the special effects department, eXistenZ comes out of the theater of the bizarre It is difficult to talk about this movie without giving anything away. eXistenZ will not appeal to everyone. It is a strange experience but a strikingly original one. It takes a strong stomach at time, this is after all a world in which the line between organic matter and inorganic matter is at times crossed. If you can't take it on a surreal level you will find it as captivating and involving as I did. And if you have a dead solid theory on the ending, please e-mail me.

This quirky thriller concerns a virtual reality game and the woman who designed it. The surreal action occurs in the near future, but everything looks contemporary until you get to the video game that our heroine has created and the way that it is played. Allegra (Jennifer Jason Leigh of Single White Female) is the world's greatest game designer. She is developing her latest game that her company named Antenna Research has spent $38 million on. The theme of illusion versus reality plays a major part in this thriller.eXistenZ unfolds in a small, backwoods, folksy church where a crowd has gathered to take part in the first test. The Seminar Leader (Christopher Eccleston of Jude) welcomes the spectators to the seminar and appreciates their willingness to participate in testing the game. Although he supervises these seminars, the Seminar Leader explains that Allegra will lead them through the first test. Afterward, the Seminar Leader selects twelve people to serve as testers. A public relations trainee, Ted Pikul (Jude Law of Side Effects), sits by the door to screen spectators so nobody enters the premises with a recording device. After the group has assembled and ported in the system, Allegra addresses them. Now, I'll warn you, it's going to be a wild ride, but don't panic. No matter what happens. Before everything is over with in eXistenZ, you may panic. Allegra's words basically sum up everything that is going to follow when she tells her testers. Existenz' is not just a game, she informs them. It's an entirely new game system. And it involves a whole lot of new toys. Indeed, it does involve 'new toys.' Instead of electronic game consoles, they are using organic, fleshy-looking game pods. The pods themselves resemble human body parts squished together like a trio of nipples attached to an umbilical cord that is inserted in each tester's back in a bio-port at the basic of the spine. The game ports appear to squirm when they are in use. The players are zoned out as they use these game ports. Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche of Final Destination 3) was the last person to enter, and he attempts to kill Allegra with an exotic organic gun. Actually, Noel's gun is made of flesh & blood body parts, and the bullets are teeth. The assassin has concealed his weapon in game pod. Noel hits Allegra in the right shoulder, but the tooth doesn't kill her. Noel shoots the Seminar Leader and kills him. Allegra's bodyguards Merle (Sarah Polley of Spice) and shoot Noel to ribbons. Meantime, the Seminar Leader exhorts Ted to get Allegra off the premises because somebody at Antenna is trying to sabotage the new game. While everybody else is fleeing from the church, Ted helps up and takes her to a vehicle outside. Indeed, this imaginative thriller keeps you off balance throughout its tantalizing 97 minutes. You never really know what is going to happen. Cronenberg wrote and directed this R-rated release with several twists and turns.

The Sunday Times reviewer, whose name escapes me (it should), thought it was more of a philosophy lesson than a film and tells us that Cronenberg forgot to make the film interesting. Are these people nuts? In a word, yes. One it would destroy the whole purpose of the film if the VR was any weirder; two there is more to interest and challenge the viewer in this film than all the other Hollywood fodder produced in the last decade put together. That's how nuts they are.So, everyone has a bioport where you jack in the game console (itself a bio-whatsit). Jennifer Jason Leigh is probably the games designer and Jude Law is probably her reluctant bodyguard. Everyone else is possibly who they appear to be. Leigh and Law have to play the game to see if it has been damaged. Along the way they and everyone else in the film has to try and figure out what is real and what is not real and who is or is not who they appear to be. Your role, constant viewer, is also to figure out what is real and what isn't. Good luck.JJ Leigh, usually the least expressive actress of her generation, is utterly compelling here. Either she just learned how to act or she was so baffled by what was going on that Cronenberg tricked her into this performance. Jude Law is effective in his role but I'm not affected by his boyish good looks like girly cinema-goers might be. There is good support from Willem Dafoe and Ian Holme and, as you would expect in a Cronenberg film, various and sundry twisted body parts and icky gooey things and creatures.Cronenberg lives up to his reputation of being obsessed with the flesh. Not of course with good healthy pink stuff but with internal organs, blood and pus and undeniably sexy bioports which get a good fingering and sucking by all in this film. But he excels in what he is best at &#x96; making the ordinary look menacing and frightening and unbelievably grimy and, well, real. That is why the film does not need a bagfull of CGI effects or flashy set pieces. The scariest VR you could create would have to be one where you are not sure whether it is real or whether everything in that reality is real or whether some characters are real, some events are real, you are really yourself. And how do you know when you have really returned to reality? Now that would be the game of a lifetime and that's what he has given us in eXistenZ.If you have ever enjoyed playing computer games (as opposed to just shoot-em-ups) then I am sure you will love this film. If you have a brain and have ever wondered about the nature of reality you will love this film. If you are sick of seeing yet more Hollywood product and want to see real independent film making you'll love this film. Only people who have failed to arrive in the later part of the 20th century and film critics who ought to be literary critics instead of film critics (that's most of them) will fail to get it.

She flees with a young marketing trainee, Ted Pikul, who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard.Unfortunately, her pod, an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game program, is damaged.To inspect it, she talks Ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her.The events leading up to this, and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure where reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective....When I first saw this movie in the cinema, I loved it. Considering the year had some truly dire movies released in that summer, this was a nice tonic, as it seemed very clever and really original.Thirteen years later, I still enjoy it, but have recognised many flaws in the film, is the acting really that bad, or is it some kind of in game thing going on, and the other one is, I really can't believe that this is still a 15 certificate here in the UK. it's very extreme in its ways.More like videodrome than any other of his movies, Cronrnberg appears to have sort of re-imagined that classic for the DVD/Fight Club generation, and succeeds on varying levels.Law is fine in one of his first Hollywood leading roles, and looks comfortable with other big screen behemoths.The story is paced well, and although the film is confusing at times, Cronenbrg does get his 'Brave new world' message across. And he was right.Thirteen years later there are more on line gamers, people walking down the street attached to Ipods/pads/phones than ever before.Cronenberg tried to warn us that we are becoming xenophobic to the earth.Maybe he is right. "},{"Title":"The reality of the flesh","Date":"26 January 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" eXistenZ is another in the line of movies that question the entire nature of existence. Like the Martrix, Dark City, and News from the Good Lord, this movie asks us the question of what is real. Reality isn't something that we believe is around us and thus things only exists because we believe that they exist, rather reality is a construct by some external force that we are immersed in.eXistenZ is a computer game and it is accessed though a meta-flesh game pod (more on the nature of the flesh later). When one has entered the game, the users entire reality changes to that of the game. To the user, the game in fact seems to be more real than reality itself. Thus through this comes the plot a group of radicals, known as the realists, are attempting to destroy the games and their creator Allegra Gellar.As with similar movies, I cannot go too deep into it as it will destroy the twists and the plots, but what I will explore here is the nature of reality, the malubility of flesh, and then point out a few interesting things.Basically reality in this film seems to be the place you inhabit when you are not inhabiting the game. The whole idea of reality seems to become warped and twisted as one descends into and out of the gaming environment, with Gellar bodyguard, Ted Pikul, not knowing the difference between reality and fantasy upon exiting the game. His comment is this no longer seems real to me. I guess the thing that we are seeing here is the whole idea of immersing ourselves into a fantasy world taken to the extreme.At this time, we have movies, novels, computer and roleplaying games in which we immerse ourselves into to escape from our reality. This movie takes this further where we enter into a completely different reality to escape our reality. But is there a limit on how far we can go before we loose track of our reality? Some people who descend into the realities that we create now have difficulty escaping from them, especially when the reality in which we live just doesn't seem to be all that pleasant. So why not escape into a reality where we are kings and lords and can squash those who upset us? But, there is a time when we should leave and face our realities. If some people cannot differentiate fantasy from reality now, what happens when the technology reaches a level where we can completely escape? I guess that is where we come to eXistenZ.Now there is the idea of the flesh. The flesh is a common element in horror type movies. This is because our flesh defines who we are and to violate one's flesh is the greatest violation that one can perform. When we look at somebody we look at their flesh, and that is how we define who they are. Thus when our flesh ceases to be our defining quality then that is when problems arise. This occurs when somebody betrays us, because the person that we thought we knew is not actually that person anymore.In this movie all of the technology is created from flesh. As such there is a some sort of sickening feeling as we watch these constructs, knowing that they form a part of the human body. The bioport, the hole through which the gamepod is attached, upsets Ted Pikul because he sees it placement as a violation of his body. The further we go into the movie, the more disturbing scenes we see, including the factory where the gamepods are made. Yet by the end we seem to be able to handle it much better. Finally, a few things that I should point out. First of all, notice how sensual Allegra Gellar is towards Ted Pikul. Remember that he is a complete stranger, but she throws a lot of signals towards him. Secondly note the dog.

His movies fit like a glove on my personal tastes; they are usually complex, intricate and esoteric science-fictions, with tragic and grotesque characteristics, which are all (in a sense) present in his 99' work eXistenZ. And yet I cannot help but feeling disappointed with the result, irritated by its frugality and frustrated with the outcome.For starters, the ''grotesqueries'' apparently only exist for the sake of exist; they are basically the consoles organic vivacity and one disgusting meal served for the insipid character of Jude Law, nothing that would make any difference if removed from the plot. There is no meaning behind it, no mystery associated and, quite frankly, these moments are not even loathsome enough to at least make an impression. Another aspect worth mentioning is the apparent poverty of scenarios. One could imagine that a sci-fi film dealing with a virtual reality game would provide more than mundane scenarios resembling clumsy sets from comedy sitcoms, the last scenes particularly were responsible for this unpleasant sensation.Nothing, however, could be more frustrating than the final revelation. Leaving aside all the obvious defects, there is always hope that Cronenberg will come up with an overwhelming surprise, or at least some ambiguous ironic denouement that rescues the story from the abominable ostracism. Turns out, the ''game inside a game'' exposure did not prove to be much of puzzle for our humble minds. It was tasteless, predictable and of course, due to that, severely boring.That was probably the most significant disillusion on my pseudo-''film critic'' enterprise. Nothing that could drop Cronenberg from the pedestal I created in my mind, but definitely a vigorous vacillation. eXistenZ is not terrible and not even close to unwatchable, although I can't imagine any sci-fi enthusiast that would totally approve it, let alone the rest of the world.

What I am going to do is discuss a few of the reasons that I enjoyed this film and also some of the reasons I felt it was, in part a let down.Firstly lets get a few things straight, this film was designed to confuse the viewer from the outset and attempts to keep them confused until towards the very end of the movie.  From reading the reviews on this site it appears to have done this pretty well as I think 50% of 'reviewers' missed this point totally by stating 'the plot was confusing'.  This was done deliberately to try and keep you guessing about the conclusion of the film, lets face it how many boring films have you watched where you might as well have cut out 110 mins from the middle and just left 5 mins at the beginning to introduce the players and 5 mins at the end to confirm the inevitable, eXistenZ is NOT like this you actually have to watch it and not fall asleep.The way that in game characters were made to react to keywords and phrases in order to keep players inside the realms of the program was a nice touch as even though the game hardware and software was meant to be advanced it emphasised that even total immersion gaming would still contain rules.A lot of criticism has been thrown at the special effects that you 'can't see them', I personally think that this is much to the films credit as I can assure you that effects were used in this film on a regular basis but are so well crafted into the fabric of the game world as to be believable in the unbelievable context of the film. Effects for Effects sake are more or less totally absent allowing for more subtle props to be used the 'bone gun' being a classic example.  Everything wriggled and squirmed and made the whole film feel 'organic' the only exception to this believability is the two headed lizard type creature which did look fake but again this might have been deliberate.The downsides are in some of the set design, a lot of it was well thought out and well crafted but a few pieces just didn't quite cut it.  And the ending, well there are endings that leave you set up for sequels and this is one of them. It reminded me very much of the 'sequel imminent' feeling i got at the end of Species 1 but this time it also left me feeling a little empty and that so much more could have been achieved with a more definite finale.The acting was first class from all concerned, Jude Law being outstanding. (JJL's performance was meant to be 'dizzy' to give the impression that her character was detached from too many years spent game designing).Overall a first class techno film although not in the classic league.

They mostly bypass whatever lies in between - both rational and emotional - to bring you metaphysical speculation and physical disgust in pure, raw forms.  eXistenZ is a foray into the nature of reality and how we disguise it from ourselves; as ever, it's the reality of the disgusting things that go on in (and between) our own bodies - sex, childbirth, food, disease, anything that requires or affects our innards - as much as the more abstract external reality that he's scrutinizing.The other point I want to make can't be made without a general, vague sort of SPOILER which is at the end of this paragraph.  (See the movie, then come back here!)  I'm writing this a couple of weeks after the release of Peter Molyneux's Black and White (2001), a computer game that offers more than the traditional pleasures of the 'God game' genre it promises to reveal who you really are through the choices you make; a sort of ethical simulator.  Rather than there being a clear dichotomy between game worlds and real worlds, the implication is, our realities are all games, and the worlds of our imagination are real.  Responsibility is as real (or as nugatory) whatever realm you're operating in. This isn't really news - it's over half a century since Huizinga redefined Homo sapiens as Homo ludens. And the most interesting feature of the plot of eXistenZ (THIS IS THE SPOILER!), is that the people who are most radically opposed to the reality-warping power of the game are precisely the people who are best at playing it.

'The Matrix' is an amazing effects demo and I love it, but it's little more than that. 'eXistenZ' is the first movie I've seen which really addresses the nature of reality in the same way that Philip K Dick's novels were doing years ago; there isn't just one level of virtual reality here, but so many levels that you can never be sure what's real and what's the game... or even whether the distinction between 'real' and 'unreal' is a useful one. I thought I'd figured out the point where they entered the game early on... and was pleasantly surprised to discover I was wrong.All in all, it's a brilliant movie for gamers and game developers; whereas people who don't live with these kind of issues every day will probably find it confusing, to say the least. But, like it or not, they're going to have to deal with them sooner or later as real games move closer to the realism of the 'eXistenZ' game in the movie; I wonder how long it will be before Realist terrorists begin to appear in our reality?Now excuse me, I have to go watch the DVD again 8-).

When one of her newest games, &#132;eXistenZ`, is about to be tried out, a man assassinates her with a strange organic gun and the situation gets out of control.It's not easy to describe how the story finds its beginning and how it developes; it's quite a confusing game. As the story and the game go on nobody, not even the viewer, can separate reality and fiction any more. Strange, static figures appear and disappear, the game is interrupted from time to time &#150; but is it really? What Cronenberg finally wants, is making us insecure whether the whole film is only a game or not. I suppose that's why the settings and figures reminded me more and more of real computer games.This is a nice movie, if you are able to think yourself into Cronenberg's virtual-virtual realities and unrealities. It's a demanding film but I'm sure Cronenberg didn't take it too seriously and he doesn't want the viewers to over-rate it.

First of all, quite early into the film, I was practically shouting at the screen about the continuity errors with Jennifer Jason Leigh's hair. The hotel room sequence in particular was really slack. I mean, she was upright beside Jude Law and had her little permed wave accents. Then, a split second later as she reclined, they were suddenly gone and she was simply straight-haired. The up again and back to the waves. And down again. Yeah, yeah...I know. What is my damage that I'm paying attention to her f-ing hairstyle. But really, it is quite glaring IMHO.The other thing that really ticked me off about this was it made me want to slap David Cronenberg across the face and shout at him, Alright, Dave...you've done this before! Move on! There were *SO* many familiar elements to this film. More than that even. The whole initial assassination sequence (no, I'm not really giving away anything plot-point-wise here) has been done (see 'Scanners'). In fact, the film referred to in that last parenthetical bit, namely 'Scanners,' made so much of this film redundant it really made me annoyed with Cronenberg's laziness. Come on. Is it so much to ask to at least attempt to come up with some new lines in your scripts?!? I mean really, some of the things that Jen or Jude had to say were so close to verbatim dupes of lines out of 'Scanners' that it really was disappointing.All that being said, if you HAVEN'T seen any Cronenberg flicks prior to watching this one, you might actually enjoy it. Ignoring the continuity gaffs, it's entertaining enough for a Cronenberg newbie. But anyone who's actually gone through even a minor section of his back catalog will find themselves feeling like they've already seen this before. Yeah, this one's got a bigger budget. Hot (cough) stars of the moment (or not). But all in all, been there, done that.So, once again...come on, Dave! Pick up the slack and move on to something new!

The second time I saw the film, though, nearly a year later, everything seemed better. The film's twisty, somewhat convoluted conclusion opens the door for a total rediscovery of the film. This comment will first discuss the film and then (after sufficient spoiler warnings) I'll go into more detail on the improvements of the film's second look.eXistenZ may have come out after The Matrix and Dark City and Strange Days, but the film hardly seems influenced by those earlier depictions on the potentially blurred lines between fantasy and reality. Instead, eXistenZ fits wonderfully within Cronenberg's body of work. For a director who has long been fascinated by the melding of technology and the human body, this film is perhaps the ultimate commentary.Set in an indeterminate future time, eXistenZ begins with the beta testing of the latest virtual game from Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's leading game designer. Instead of plastic and metal playstation consoles, eXistenZ (the name of the new game) requires biopods, pulsing living blobs which plug directly into portals in the spinal cords of the players. The game pods only contain the information, the human players provide the energy source. Anyway, just as the test group is about to enter the game, a crazed young man stands up and with a declaration of fatwah, he shoots Geller and several others.Geller is forced to go on the run with advertising trainee Ted Pikul (Jude Law, back before he was Oscar Nominee Jude Law). The two port into her game to see if any damage has been done, but before long, the game designer and the neophyte (Pikul doesn't even have a portal installed) begin to experience confusion about reality. That's all that will be said here.As with the best of Cronenberg's work, eXistenZ is a mood piece. With wonderful dark, brooding cinematography from Peter Suschitzky, the film doesn't attempt to create an exciting looking future. Instead, all of the action takes place in the gaming underground in the countryside outside some unnamed city. The game within the film is similarly minimalist. Working from his first original script since Videodrome (a very similar film in many ways, actually), Cronenberg's film has a wonderful internal logic that works well the first time you see it and only improves.eXistenZ is fairly gross, in a Cronenberg kind of way. As you might imagine, Cronenberg has a field day with the notion of the biopods, which are made from amphibian DNA and also from the portals themselves, little sphincters in the small of the the characters backs into which umbilical cords are inserted. When one character says that he was afraid to get a portal because he doesn't like to be penetrated in that way, you just know that Cronenberg is having a big laugh.(SPOILERS TIME. MASSIVE SPOILERS. STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)(NO. REALLY. STOP.)When the film gets to its end and it becomes clear that even the real life was just a game within a game and the various characters turn out to have just been players, a million things suddenly make sense. Ian Holm apologizes for his horrible accent, which was distracting until you know what it was. Jude Law begins to speak in his native British accent and the Canadian accent he'd previously been doing makes more sense. All of the settings and character interactions from the film's early scenes also take on a new meaning.  Frankly, the new depth is amazing.  It raises the appreciation of every performance and of the balancing act that Cronenberg is pulling off.eXistenZ is fun, frequently funny, and, like the best of Cronenberg, generally hypnotic. I think I may have given the film a 7/10 during a previous visit, but having just seen it again, I'm bumping it up to at least an 8.5/10. Good stuff.

Yes, the question is reality real? has been explored in films before, but in my opinion never this thoroughly, craftily or skillfully.  The film's originality lies not in the questions it asks, but in the way it asks them.With an incredible cast of characters, outstanding soundtrack and signature Cronenberg fleshiness, this film does for cinema what neon-colored gummy worms do for candy.  If you have an open, reasonably intelligent mind and don't mind facing the very REAL possibility that conscious existence is a sort of dream (something mysticism has been claiming since the beginning and physics has already pointed out -- that chair you're sitting in is NOT solid), don't miss this film.On second thought, don't miss this film no matter what.

Vastly superior to the very disappointing The Cell (2000), this is a fine first attempt (- as Matrix and Dark City restrict themselves to their premises of singular and dualistic science fictions of dualistic either/or realities -) to convey these complex and very difficult philosophical possibilities of (a) being thrown into matrices of a resonating  discovered/uncovered what which is at (role-)play in its conscious, gradually understanding, responses to a mutable ever-shifting undisclosed who.

Fortunately, some Canadian films are directed by the surrealistic David Cronenberg, who never met a gross-out he didn't love and who seems to be obsessed with piercing the body in new ways.The movie is about a computer game creator who is on the run from would-be assassins, and gets trapped in her own game--or does she?   Reading about this plot ahead of time made me think that Cronenberg would use some state-of-the-art, Matrix type special effects. I should have known better.  Cronenberg does use special effects, but with his own twisted signature.  Guns are made out of flesh and bones and shoot teeth.  There are twists and double crosses, and an entirely satisfying surprise ending.Cronenberg has wisely cast the wonderful Jennifer Jason Leigh as the star of the film.

That makes it a good story completion.  But the film itself shines with its unique viewpoint of taking away all the trappings of a sci-fi/alternate reality universe.  Cronenberg uses subtraction of icons, of machinery and special effects robotic dogs that fly and do your math homework and instead substitutes organic futurism.  If I was a little smarter, I would point to more of the subtraction throughout the film, but instead I will direct you to The Matrix (of course), The Thirteenth Floor (well-done, overshadowed), and the book Otherland (go Tad Williams).Enjoy what makes you happy.

As far as writing and philosophical sophistication go, however, this film is far superior to its Hollywood counterpart. _The Matrix_ drops the ball in its examination of the impossibility of externally verifying objective reality, shattering one reality but then assuming that the one that remains is the true one. _eXistenZ,_ however, explores the full consequences of this difficult philosophical concept, successfully blurring fantasy and reality and leaving the viewer delightfully off-balance. This is a thoughtful and surreally fragmented film -- not for those looking for a cheap two hours' entertainment. Nor is it for the weak of stomach. As always, Cronenburg's disturbingly organic special effects are truly haunting, imbuing this film with overtones that are both sinister and erotic. A must see for Cronenburg fans, and for anyone interested in the philosophical problems raised by the possibility of immersive virtual environments.

Now we have Reality itself is liquid, and can cause anything to freak out at any time.

I can tell by some of the comments on this board that there are some nervous systems immune to the Cronenberg virus. Too bad for them.

Fairly decent and enjoyable actually.  Not as impressive as Cronenberg's other films such as, say, Videodrome, but fairly good nonetheless. It fits quite well along the lines of the above-mentioned Videodrome and even Naked Lunch. The special effects are instantly recognizable, and are used sparingly, which, in my opinion, is a good thing.  Acting, while far from remarkable, works reasonably well. And yes, there is a plot, as simplistic as it may be.  The movie may just be too meditative and inward-looking for the action oriented folks, which brings us to this whole Matrix thing. Comparing eXistenZ to Matrix is COMPLETELY UNFAIR.  Of course all these people who were expecting a Matrix knock-off were dissappointed.  Matrix is a very well crafted sci-fi-cyber- action flick, but whose appeal rests entirely on the non-stop special effects, action sequences and ultra-hip characters. eXistenZ is not quite about that.  In fact, it is completely different. The only reason it was marketed as such by the studio is for commercial reasons.  I am sure it wasn't even Cronenberg's idea. eXistenZ is so much more phlegmatic and introspective, and action and special effects are only a supplement.  And no, this movie is not totally boring, unless all you are used to watching are movies like Matrix or Armageddon.  I guess I shouldn't even recommend directors like Lynch or Tarkovsky to this kind of people.   In any case, while far from great, eXistenZ is an enjoyable little movie.  Just don't expect it to be an action flick because it's not. It's more like a prolonged, modern day Twilight Zone episode focusing on alternate reality, and directed, of course, by Mr. Cronenberg, which should say something about the way it turned out.

I'm not a fan, but some of his movies are interesting.  He splurged on it in Videodrome (interesting, but OK), and then brought it up (although not as graphically) in Crash.  Crash, unfortunately, did not translate well to celluloid--you need to read the book to get a feel for the Croneberg theme rather than see it.So what does all of this have to do with eXistenZ?  Briefly, a software designer builds a new game and uses a biomechanical, almost living, device that hooks up in people's backs (via an umbilical cord) and puts them in a type of virtual reality.  Unfortunately, some people want to kill her.  The rest you have to see--it cannot be explained without giving too much away. What I enjoyed in this movie was not only the plot (which is interesting, with a cool ending, by the way), but a lot of the visual effects in it.  OK, they aren't the Matrix or Phantom Menace, but they will test your sense of nausea!  As for the plot, I think what Croneberg suggests is that people are getting too dependent on technology to live their lives; they are using it to create a new life, and this is not far from the truth.You will either like it or hate it.  I feel those who enjoyed Croneberg's previous works (especially The Naked Lunch, Videodrome, Scanners, and The Brood) will definitely enjoy this film.

Absolutely wrong. This is a Cronenberg film, so do not expect easily understandable, action heavy, state-of-the-art visuals. However if surrealism is in your book, treat yourself for a wild ride. Just like in the Naked Lunch some people are addicted to a certain mind-enhancer (this time VR-games instead of drugs) so the line between reality and imagination becomes more and more thinner. This is an ideal setup for Cronenberg, master of the bizarre, to do some surprising plot twists in the story.However, the main reason to watch this movie is the invention of cyber-bio-gadgets which is a wonderfully original idea. Having seen The Matrix's awesome techno-worlds to death it was surprisingly refreshing that someone can depict the surrealism of cyberspace without big-budget CGI effects. All you have to do is to replace the machines with some *really* bizarre equipment (ie a game controller, which looks like a giant out-of-this-world latex-vagina - and it wriggles too!). These gizmos are creating a very surreal world and they are just as memorable as the bug-typewriter in the Naked Lunch. This idea really works, and unfortunately this is the only aspect of the movie I really liked.The plot twists mentioned before are quickly becoming tiresome, and hard to follow. Everybody is hostile, even close friends are secret enemies, and so on... It seems to me that Cronenberg pushed the classic my friend is my worst enemy clich√© a little too far (even an actor has a remark at the end of the movie complaining about the plot twists). Paranoia in the Naked Lunch had a purpose, unfortunately it is only a plot device here which ends in a violent gun-fight every time.The actors are mixed bag Jennifer Jason Leigh decks into the VR like she was watching a hardcore porn-flick she moans, wriggles in the bed, and does some funny things with the weird-looking game terminal. She even talks to her terminal like to her secret sex-partner (while she is in extreme danger, of course). I understand that she invented the whole thing, but I think it should be more appropriate to emphasize the mother-baby relation instead of a horny woman and her best dildo scenario. Most supporting actors perform quite well (especially Ian Holm, and the wonderful Willem Dafoe), and Jude Law acts his confused role beliveably.It seems to me, that this time Cronenberg is too obsessive to his patent-pending bio-bizarre sets and props than his movie in a whole. It is a shame because this film should be the gold mine for original ideas, but unfortunately the banal plot (if you played serious computer adventures before you know that this plot is mediocre - even from the computer gamer's point of view), some questionable acting, and pointless action elements are sinking  the movie.If you liked Naked Lunch, you should go and see this film to see the evolution of hallucinogens from the 70s drug-inspired fantasies to the 90s cyber-escapism. Just do not expect for something so original.Rating 3.5 of 5  "},{"Title":"yeah umm","Date":"9 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I read some comment, where some dude said, get ready for a wild ride pfft!

Even though the ending is a bit mainstream, it doesn't matter too much.The film is well written, but it lacks a bit in the performance of Jennifer and Jude. It is clearly a low-budget movie, but this is not a bad thing.The special-effects are not over-done - they are instead well-done, something we don't see too much of these days.As You probably noticed, I have not included a summary for the film.

Like a virus, it invades our lives. We are powerless to stop its relentlessness - we succumb to its immediate pleasures like a shot of heroin. We are slaves to the quick-fix of video-violence. As before in The Fly and Videodrome, Cronenberg revels in the nightmare of technology gone wrong and machines that take us over and then eat us from the inside. His view of virtual reality is not one shared by the IT capitalists, rather a stern warning of what we might become in the future. He is a visionary and as such, is often misunderstood by those who only see the surface. I've never believed that Cronenberg's work is intended to shock. He's too clever for that. He simply wants us to appreciate the way he sees the world.

Why the weird spelling and pronunciation? Why not! The entire movie seems to scream We can't do that?! Watch us! From the loopy plot to the far-out premise, this film is joyous in its unabashed use of imagination.The movie stars Jennifer Jason Leigh as Allegra Geller (yes, her name is Allegra), a brilliant game designer who has created a virtual reality game in which the player must have their spinal cord punctured and insert a weird, fleshy tube into it to play. It is so popular that you can get it done at the mall, just like a piercing. Now, that alone is a bit wacky, but when you actually see the game device...well...let's just say that it looks like a Picasso fantasy come to life. The sexual overtones of the film are REALLY blatant and obvious. They have to be seen to be believed and will definitely make even the most edgy viewer smile or blush.The problem is that some people want Allegra dead. Now it is up to a dorky security guard (Jude Law) and many other characters to protect her...or is it? In this movie, NOTHING is what it seems. I absolutely won't reveal anything because that will spoil the fun, but expect to be surprised many times by the amazing plot twists. Just be sure you pay attention and can keep up!This is one of those movies that defies all logic. The characters live in a world that makes up its own rules. Some of the actions and events make NO sense...but that hardly matters because this is all a virtual-reality, anything goes realm. (Similar films that you may want to see are Strange Days and The Matrix)The third act does get a bit winded due to the constantly shifting plot, but it is all made up for by one of the best endings I've seen in a very long time.

Apart from the fact that the ever-fascinating David Cronenberg had directed it of course.Brilliant is the word that comes to mind right after having seen the film. I have to tell you that I found the experience of watching eXistenZ mind-blowing. I've always liked stories like this -- even as a child, stories where I don't know what's going on but am desperate to find out. It's a fascinating film to say the least -- like most other Cronenberg-films, though, it's not for everyone -- you are now warned, -).Jennifer Jason Leigh was very good in a very interesting role. But the one who impressed me the most was Jude Law, I knew he was good, but *this* good? Didn't know that. It's always a joy to see Sarah Polley in a film, unfortunately she's only in it for a few minutes (and I sincerely hope that the hair on her head is a wig), but she still manages to make something good out of those few minutes. Brilliant film with a brilliant ending, but also with a few flaws, but nothing too serious. I haven't decided whether I should give eXistenZ an 8 or a 9 here at IMDb -- have to watch it again to know for sure.And as for the comparisons with The Matrix -- don't listen to them. I don't find the films to be alike at all. The Matrix is a sci-fi action, while I consider eXistenZ to be a sci-fi thriller.

And I, for one, have no problem with this development as long as each movie has a distinctive take on the subject.  I enjoyed each of these movies although the ending of eXistenZ was more confusing than the others. Maybe that's not a bad thing, though.  A movie doesn't have to have a soothing or completely clear resolution.  Unfortunately, these movies will be hampered commercially for the same reason that they excite a cult following - they require a significant amount of attention and a desire to be challenged intellectually.

Fine story for his usually capable hands and features great actors, but all fall flat and fairly lifeless. The film amounts to a thriller minus the thrills, a roller-coaster ride that goes straight, flat, and slow.I do love Cronenberg and I think Existenz is a fine movie, but it needs a spark, a good slap in the face, in order to be a great film. The movie has a blankness in tone that worked with keen perfection in Crash but hampers any intrigue within Existenz. The acting by Leigh and Law reflects this. The two are absolutely wooden, too wooden to care about, and I get the feeling that Cronenberg might have been spoiled by the likes of actors (Irons, Spader, Hunter, Weller) that can translate what he desires much easier.Still, Cronenberg always offers a breathe of fresh air and a view film fans dont see in any other directors films. His films are always a welcome addition to a normally trite and obvious film world. At least with Cronenberg (even lackluster Cronenberg) we can find something different and worthwhile.

It lives on a smaller scale, which is by no means automatically bad.  Unlike Matrix, however, this is not truly an Action film, I'd say it's almost more like a Mystery than anything else. The movie was made on a less than infinite budget, that much is obvious, but it focused enough on the performances of its lead actor and actress to outshine any glaring flaws.Tolka's advice see it, and reserve a half-hour period afterwards to simply contemplate the movie's suggestion of our so-called reality.

I liked the performances of all the actors, especially Jude Law, who's been excellent in everything I've seen him in.  The theme of Existenz is virtually (no pun intended) the same as Videodrome.  Where people are caught up in another reality and in time can't distinguish between the two.  With factions trying to control the virtual world and others trying to prevent it's evolution.  Existenz takes a different approach where it tries to say that what actually is reality, reality is only what people choose to interpret as reality hence the name Existenz.Videodrome was excellent and even thought both films have similar endings, Videodrome's worked and Existenz didn't (in my opinion).  As I mentioned I thought the film started very well and created an excellent atmosphere, towards the end it really lost it's way.  I felt the war scene didn't really fit and the ending then made the film feel very flat.

The movie has some excellent performances by well-chosen actors, good dialogues and weird but strangely realistic situations - all in all it manages to create a wonderfully disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that the end could have been done better. Even though the twist to the story which is meant as a surprise for the viewer works at least partly (you will be likely to assume that you know what is going on at a very early stage of the film, but then there is more...), I was not too happy with the last couple of minutes of the movie. I understand the script writer's urge for explanation, but I have the impression that eXistenZ would have worked even better if it had remained more mysterious. Maybe a different, less revealing ending could have made this fine movie an eight point five or even a nine, the way it is it's only somewhere between a seven and an eight - still way above the crappy mainstream thrillers that get some people filthily rich but fail to satisfy their audiences. If you dig a weird story line with a slight sci-fi touch that is not an insult to your intelligence go watch this movie - you will enjoy the trip. If you're into fantasy role games, this is a must.

Secondly, I really enjoyed Cronenberg's latest sci-fi thriller.  So what if the 'car-scene' looked as if it was filmed against a backdrop screen?  Maybe that was the director's stylistic choice?  And to all those people who picked the film to bits and analysed it to the point of vomit, why can't you just enjoy it for what it is?  There's a reason why Cronenberg made it the way he did, and there's a reason why he has become the auteur he is over the past 25 years.  It's his vision, his script, his actors and his realisation - accept it for what it is, but don't try to say what it SHOULD have been like.  If you want to go out and make your own movie, go and apply to get a grant to have your own script developed.  Just don't mess with the masters.      Anyway, that aside, I found the film to be a fantastic wild-ride, with enough twists and turns to still keep me guessing until the very end.  Cronenberg's love of slimy mutant creatures and organic contraptions continues in this movie, as do the themes of fantasy vs. reality (see The Naked Lunch and Videodrome).

Well eXistenZ (sic) is no exception but it is sadly mired in its own pretensions. Apparently Cronenberg insisted that the cast  (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willen Dafoe, Ian Holm) read Kierkegard, Hegel and generally swotted up on their existentialist theory in preparation fot their parts. As we can see then, is indubitable that there are some pretty heavy themes behind the movie but, like the Levellers,  they just don't wash. He repeatedly bombards his viewers with The Point in some laughably contrived dialogue which further alienates an already confused average filmviewer (but then D.C.'s film never were targeted at the average viewer).All the classic Cronenberg trademarks are here as well; visceral body horror, oodles of sexual symbolism and the actors' utter conviction in even the most bizarre dialogue.  Sadly, unlike in the even more weird Videodrome, in Cronenberg's eXistenZ amidst its misplaced philosophical rambling and roundabout digs at our increasingly cyber-orientated age, these - usually exciting -  aspects of his work just appear..well....silly.Vaginal holes in people's spines, tiny mutnat amphibians, guns made out of bone that fire human teeth for bullets and lines such as  I have this fear about having my body penetrated...a bioport phobia are definitely original but ultimately just gimmicks that collapse on themselves because the movie just isn't strong enough to support their surreal silliness. At  least with earlier and better works such as Videodrome withs its flesh-gun or Rabid and its armpit penis/barb we have something of substance to uphold the craziness a world that can absorb such surreality. In eXistenZ all we have is a computer game  that, considering its hype, doesn't even look that interesting to play. Give me a text-adventure anyday.The twists and turns leading up to the end mean nothing because any inteeligent viewer knows we'll never get to reality. Cronenberg has absolute control and whip away what we think is real in an instant only to usurp with another version, and another ad infinitum. Oh yes, the themes, The POINT is there. We can hardly miss them because D.C. keeps forcing the Is it reality? What is reality? Is it a game? card down out throats, but surely his talent could have incorporated such red-hot potential into a better film.I have said that David Cronenberg had total control over his alternate reality (the film) at all time. This is true, for he is truly an auteur. Anyone else's creative input, especially a major studio's, would never have let the film get made, so maximum respect to D.C. for keeping it real......or not as the case maybe.  "},{"Title":"Oooh!

The strangest thing about Cronenberg is not his biotechnological fascinations or frequent sexual symbolism, but instead his inability to imbue his characters with any sense of empathy whatsoever. If you feel for a Cronenberg character then you must indeed be the new Florence Nightingale. eXistenZ isn't the best Cronenberg film around by a long shot. Nor is it the worst. But it is definitely the most mainstream of his original screenplays. And although it rehashes the overused cliche of is it fantasy or is it real life it still makes you think, and that is something in this day and age. There are nice touches of humour in there too, including a none too subtle dig at the oh so righteous who criticised 'Crash'. Even if Cronenberg has just remade Videodrome for the 90's here, and even if it is so detached that you cannot feel for the characters in it. It still stirs the mind, which is a refreshing change from the majority.

The idea of alternate realities in cyberspace was pretty seen by all people in 1999 with The Matrix which is a great movie, but Cronenberg's smaller scale, but no less fascinating film, tackles the same subject, albeit in a slightly different (read very different) way.Cronenberg devotees (like me) will instantly see all the visceral and fleshed out metaphors (pardon the pun) that have permeated his work since Shivers. With eXistenZ the idea of portraying the entry way to cyber-reality with a device that looks not like a bit of electronic equipment, but a working bodily organ that it connected right into the nervous system, the line between what real and what's real gets frighteningly thin. The interesting thing with Cronenberg that he invariably prefers clever shots and set pieces over obvious (if impressive) CGI like in The Matrix. The effects are not quite as grueling as in Cronenberg's previous film Videodrome, but for an effects heavy movie they work great with virtually no hint of excess. On the other hand, those not familiar with Cronenberg's style might find him a bit odd and like other non-mainstream directors he is very much an acquired taste for his visuals. However, as communicator of ideas he is in top form here and that ultimately makes this film work. --- 8/10Rated R for violence and gore.

Allegra narrowly escapes a would-be assassin with the help of an advertising newcomer Ted Pikul (Jude Law) during a demonstration of her newest video game eXistenZ. In this world, the video game systems are made from the harvested organs of mutated creatures and players interact by plugging the organ-like console into their bodies through an implanted bio-port or a hole at the bottom of their spine.eXistenZ is full of all the things that made the similarly themed sci-fi action film The Matrix such a success; alternate reality, themes about existence and free will, and special effects, although the effects in eXistenZ are unlike The Matrix in that they are not used to add style to an action scene, but make the virtual reality world more realistic, bizarre, and grotesque. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law are both excellent in their roles. Leigh plays a god-like celebrity game programmer who is actually very shy, and Jude Law's Ted Pikul is believably skeptical and paranoid about the video game world. The most memorable performance in the film comes from William Defoe in a small role near the beginning of the film as Gas, the owner of a Country Gas Station.Cronenberg has a style that is distinctly different from Andy and Larry Wachowski's in The Matrix which came out a month before eXistenZ and completely overshadowed it at the box-office. Instead of a slick, clean future Cronenberg creates a virtual reality where bone, flesh and grit are everywhere. The virtual reality world involves plants for the manufacturing of game consoles in which animals are cut open and dissected, guns made out of bones that shoot teeth, and Chinese restaurants that serve unusual and slimy specials. Cronenberg also addresses themes of reality and free will that are present in The Matrix, but his film (like Videodrome and Crash before it) is also fascinated with the strange sexual connections between technologies; in the game eXistenZ Allegra and Ted sometimes feel themselves saying and doing things that they cannot control (Allegra explains that this is because their video game characters need to do or say certain things to move the game's plot forward); the character's bio-ports are vaginal in nature and Ted even says he has this phobia about having my body penetrated surgically. eXistenZ is a highly underrated science fiction film that contains more ideas and inspiration than similar films and is one of David Cronenberg's most interesting and compelling. The main qualities that set eXistenZ apart from many of the look-alike science fictions films of the past few years is its willingness to disgust the viewer with uncomfortable images, ideas and situations and truly challenge the viewer to think about their choices, actions, and freedoms.

War itself has become mere entertainment, a bloody game discussed by Monday morning quarterbacks. And the biggest usage of the internet? To satisfy our most primal need, for sex. (Whatever happened to conversation, getting to know someone, sharing?) Cronenberg uses his own preferred technology--film--to raise these questions. While his films may not always seem coherently plotted, perhaps that's the point. In our world today, things change but nobody seems to be in charge, nobody seems to understand where we're going, yet we're going there all the same. To paraphrase an old poet, 'What strange beast lurches toward Bethlehem, waiting to be born.' Thanks to artists like Cronenberg who ask us to think about these things.

Dick. Philip K. Dick specialised in writing about people who were questioning the nature of reality or identity. Here Cronenburg takes us on a ride with two characters - Jenifer Jason Leigh & Jude Law. It ostensibly starts out as a meeting wherein a Virtual Reality game called eXistenZ is demonstrated, with Leigh playing the designer and Law a meek technophobic marketing executive. They plug themselves into this virtual world and then within that world plug themselves into a secondary virtual environment. There are numerous recurring themes throughout the movie - the gun, the dog and not least the characters. The one question that is posed throughout is What is reality? Midway through the film, Law in the hotel room is questioning whether the place that he inhabits is indeed real or in fact a game environment. This movie was released well before the fad/fashion for online virtual avatar style environments or MMORPG (Massivly Multipyer On-Line Role Playing Games) such as EverQuest or Virtual Life. This film is a multi-layered questioning of the perception of reality. Christof in The Truman Show put this very succinctly We accept the reality of the situation with which we are presented, it's as simple as that. When we get to a technological situation where people are more concerned with what is happening in their virtual lives than with their real ones - don't worry, be afraid - be very afraid. This film is excellent at distorting the viewer's perceptions of reality - it's just your in-game character, don't fight it (when Law shoots someone or eats visually disgusting food). Sensible people know where the boundaries between the real and the virtual are but when these boundaries do not exist it is cause for alarm.

I feel that is the main question at the heart of Cronenberg's bizarre little film about a video game designer(Jennifer Jason Leigh)who is the target of assassins from a regime desiring for the virtual reality phenomena to stop for they believe it's a breakdown of society and will do more harm to civilization than good. How dare someone create a game so real that we are active characters in it and that all things they see seem and feel so real. Instead of operating characters from your fingers on a joy-stick you have this hole throttled into your back where this amphibious wad sends an umbilical cord into your spine operating the game through your nervous system. Your brain will close to the real life around you as the fantasy takes over..but when this fantasy becomes so real how can you tell where that ends and reality begins again? Leigh's bodyguard is Jude Law, a PC man who has never experienced the game yet wishes to market this product to the world. It's an irony the film plays on as he is introduced to the unique world of eXistenZ. Willem Dafoe has a unique role as a gas station attendant who has the ability to open a bio-port(the opening orifice where the umbilical cord connects in your lower back)and does so for Law. Then once inside the game he has a hard time at first adjusting to how everything works and the way it feels so real to actual life. Something occurs however which creates a bad vibe to both Leigh and Law, the animosity that has surfaced regarding anti-virtual reality is starting to filter into the game's story-line. How is this possible? I really like this film despite it's flaws. It isn't necessarily a successful finished product as much as it has so many grotesque stylings that keep you eyes opened at Cronie's abilities to create that under-your-skin kind of bizarre feeling that can overwhelm. Unlike Videodrome(the films are similar with one film's theme about the allure of sadism and pornography being replaced by over-use of playing video games and virtual reality), this film seems to be an excuse for Cronie to play with his obsessions and this film based in virtual reality allows him that privilege.

Once considered a purveyor in gory schlock, he's now invited to Cannes to reveal his latest, often gooey masterpiece; his actors receive Academy Award nominations now. This would not have happened during his peak in the 1980s, when he made four consecutive and inarguable masterpieces (Videodrome, The Dead Zone, The Fly, and Dead Ringers). His track record since has been stellar as well with wonderful, though certainly more mature, films like Naked Lunch, Crash, Spider, and A History of Violence. He also made this little gem of a film. eXistenZ is science-fiction, set, as it is, in a near future of genetic mutations, bioports, and virtual hyperreality. Others have noted its similarities to The Matrix, which appeared in theatres around the same time. There's a crucial difference between the two--The Matrix is obvious and eXistenZ is more oblique. Guess which I prefer? The Matrix is not a bad movie; it's just very average. eXistenZ is not a great movie, but it is a stellar example of science fiction driven by interesting ideas. Throughout, I felt awkward, unsure if I stood on firm ground and definitely unsure of where I was headed. As we follow Ted and Allegra from real world to eXistenZ (the virtual reality game concocted by Allegra and not the movie), we lose sense of the narrative timeline and the sense of location. We become as dislocated as the characters in the film. It's a very strange feeling. I have seen films where I am unable to explain what's happening and why, but I don't know that I've come across anything that makes sense second by second and minute by minute but lacks sense on the whole. That isn't to say that this movie's incoherent or nonsensical--it's disorienting (something hard for a movie to achieve without making its audience walk out of a theatre). eXistenZ, as I said, tells the story of Ted Pikul and Allegra Geller, the woman responsible for creating a game that shares its name with the film. Some people want to kill her, so she and Ted go on the lam, eventually plugging into the game and spending much of the movie there. While in eXistenZ, Ted and Allegra uncover an anti-virtual reality sect and a trout farm that manufactures eXistenZ game pods from mutant amphibians and reptiles. Or something like that...There's intrigue, bone guns, and requisite amounts of gore for the icky-body style Cronenberg film. It's also darkly funny (the scenes with Willem Dafoe are hysterical). Like many of Cronenberg's films, eXistenZ reminds me of a comic book--garish and lurid yet remarkable intelligent. eXistenZ has a lot to say and a lot to do, though I feel it travels some of the same paths traveled by Vidoedrome, a vastly superior film. This movie is wonderful fun and it will make you scratch your head while a giant grin cracks across your face.

In many ways it is simply a remake of Videodrome, but I would argue it is an upgrade, an improvement on its 1982 predecessor. Although the story is essentially the same (although eXistenZ's focus is on virtual reality computer games rather than TV and video), eXistenZ is the superior film it has a sleek, more sophisticated look (Videodrome visually has not aged terribly well) and the plot is easier to follow, which enables the film's ideas to be conveyed with greater clarity.eXistenZ is the quintessential Cronenberg film.  It retains the clean but cold, almost metallic look which permeates most of his work.  But most of all, it brings to bear all of the key ideas which run through the whole of Cronenberg's body of work.  For instance, we see the continued emphasis on the breakdown of the division between man and machine.  The pods/consoles in eXistenZ are fleshy, organic, vaguely resembling female genitalia, a metaphor for the fusion of man and machine which characterises Cronenberg's view of modern life.  The chords from the pods into the players' 'bio-ports' resemble umbilical chords, again to further this continued metaphor of the man/machine fusion.  Of key importance in eXistenZ is not only the blurring of the man/machine distinction, but also the eroticisation of this distinction.  The 'bio-ports' on the players' lower backs have a distinctly 'vaginal' quality, much like the slot in James Woods' stomach in Videodrome, which is emphasised further by the groans of sexual pleasure Jennifer Jason Leigh utters when the chords are installed into the ports.  In this respect, eXistenZ deals with the same themes as Crash, but is done to better effect. Crash was, in my view, a profoundly underwhelming film, whereas eXistenZ is infinitely more exciting and intriguing.A further essential Cronenbergian theme in eXistenZ, indeed, the central theme of the film, is the implosion of reality and virtual reality, an idea which again mirrors those in Videodrome.  The main players are in a perpetual state of confusion as to whether they are still in eXistenZ, or have returned to reality.  This is brought to bear most clearly in the final sequence, which hammers home the notion that there is no longer a real to separate the simulated reality of eXistenZ reality and hyperreality have, in Cronenberg's world, imploded.eXistenZ, along with works such as Crash and Videodrome, is essentially an allegorical commentaries on the implosion of meaning in the (post) modern world.  It highlights the way in which we find it increasingly difficult to make sense of anything in a world in which the boundaries between man and machine, reality and virtual reality have imploded.  Cronenberg's world is grotesque, dizzying, schizophrenic and nonsensical, much like contemporary life in the capitalist West, and in this respect eXistenZ is Cronenberg's definitive statement of this.  Those familiar with the writings of Jean Baudrillard will love Cronenberg's work.

And more than a couple of times these gamers hailed it as a philosophical delve into a world where the line between games and reality blurs.  Considering the nature of this particular tech-savvy audience, some preferred the sci-fi leanings of eXistenZ over the stunt-laced, 15-minute plot revealer, CGI-heavy Matrix(**gag** Keanu Reaves was better suited for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure).  I wondered if this was the movie I was searching for, a mind-altering voyage twisting the perception of the viewer not only in regards to the interpretation of the movie itself, but also our own existence; one that mirrors the enigma of existence and forces us to accept it as bizarre as it may truly be. After a fairly recent rental, I can admit to you that it doesn't appear to be this no matter how much I wanted it to be.  I really appreciated a few of Cronenberg's previous works, especially Naked Lunch.  I also thought Videodrome had quite a bizarre appeal.  Probably what appeals to me most about Cronenberg is that he can be very repelling on several levels.  Not only is he disorienting, he relies on the combination of repulsive organic visuals, sexual themes that bend or transcend typical gender roles, and exaggerated technological integration, a marriage of sorts between Bradbury and Giger.  This film doesn't fail to meet this criteria, however it does fail to hit me with the same magic as Naked Lunch.  At most I considered the movie entertaining, and had not the desire, as I previously did with his films, to intensely decipher the confusion thrown onto the canvas.  That is not to say that it is completely the mindless piece that The Matrix is(enjoyable? yes, lasting effect? no).  I want to emphasize that I enjoyed watching this movie as certain moments stood out as classic Cronenberg, betraying convention and mocking our sensitivities to drippy, gooey, visuals(i.e. Chinese restaurant).  Recommended to hardcore fans of Cronenberg if only for some classic moments that have been a long time coming. To all others who have yet to appreciate one of his works, rent Naked Lunch.

In retrospect, it seems that if they were in the game, it makes sense that Allegra didn't make a backup copy of eXistenZ, but the problem therein lies with the viewer's interpretation. I simply thought it was stupid of her not to make a backup copy, especially her being the programmer.  If, somehow, her backups were destroyed at her company or on a network drive, this would make more sense.  Also, what programmer is clueless about how to play his or her own game?  Instead of being clues suggesting that they were on a different plane of existence than they had perceived, they just seemed like plot-holes.  Whether or not this could have been changed I suppose is debatable because the world which Cronenberg constructs is irrational for the very purpose of disorientation. It seems obvious to me that the ending is left up to the viewer to interpret whether or not they are still in the game.  Taking into account the statements of Allegra Geller, since the game is one that we are already playing, I assume that they are still in the game in some other dimension, but then again I may be wrong.Overall grade-C+ Decent acting, bizarro factor low compared to his other films.

Many who like this movie seem to heap scorn on the detractors for being seduced by the CG effects of The Matrix (and lately, Attack of the Clones). Personally, I dislike The Matrix to the same degree I dislike eXistenZ; they were both poorly conceived, although the Matrix obviously fools some people through its glamour and eXistenZ has not the budget to compete on that level.  Given that, in eXistenZ at least we might hope for superiority of plot, of character, of theme, of conception, of resolution... but we hope in vain.As for the actors - a waste of talent.  Jude Law, so fine in Gattaca, simply reads the script for much of it.  Willem Dafoe's character boxes in this fine actor.

As for Jennifer Jason Leigh - I think this is a lesson to casting agents; test your actor in an auditorium as well as in your office suite, and you'll see some actors simply don't have the range for some roles.  I felt sorry for her. Don't tell me she was acting the role of a non-actor - in that case, she should have been blatantly bad, and so should everyone else (which is another in a score of thematic problems I have with the movie - should these people be so seamlessly integrated into their roles?

Cronenberg places the characters in the least high-tec settings for the entire duration of the film, and instead uses objects  of a more organic nature to propel the story. As another iMDB critic stated, special effects are a waste of time if they do not compliment the rest of the film.  In this case they do.The game eXistenZ does not feel a part of the film until about midway through the movie, and when it is, it is not the Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil experience that you may expect.

The central plot gimmick here is lifted straight from Dick's THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH, with virtual reality substituted for psychedelic drugs -- and Cronenberg wittily acknowledges this with an inside joke (a bag of fast food from a restaurant called Perky Pat's gets several closeups).

The characters are interesting and the actors act well -- given the high caliber of the talent here, this is no real surprise.True, if you think Rabid or Naked Lunch or Crash were simply too off-putting to view comfortably, you probably won't be terribly impressed by eXistenZ. However, the grossness in this film is defused by an almost self-referential humour that is quite refreshing.  This is definitely Cronenberg, but Cronenberg clearly had fun making this film, and had fun poking fun at himself in a way that doesn't ever slip into self-parody.Also, there is none of the slow pace of Dead Ringers or Naked Lunch here, and this combined with the humour (black, yet not serious) will make for a very entertaining release.

Perhaps I missed something, but I found a lot of the stuff that happens in this film to be dull and not interesting even with it's twist and turns. The film relates with gaming with gaming stereotypes which I found to be somewhat cool cause I am a gamer myself, but that is practically where my interest in this movie ends. just about everything about this movie is awkward and not because it takes place in a game world either. Maybe it needs a second view for it to grow on me, but have zero interest of seeing it again. It's not one of those philosophical movies which tends to be for movies like this, but it's more about the fake world by virtual reality and how it consumes people. The gaming system is made of these organic live parts that connects to the human spine, and in order to play the game you have to inject something into the spine in order for the controller port to be attached to it. I am a gamer myself, but there is noway in hell I would play a game like that, especially with it's process and the organic live controller and all. If you actually pay attention you get the message of this film and I personally enjoyed how it can be sympathized or agreed from different sides. How gaming consuming a person's life by leaving reality to be wrong, since it ain't a life at all. To how some people that is really into gaming who can relate with it, since it has consumed most of the their life. Overall I didn't want to play, wasn't bad though. It's basically kinda like playing those video games that instantly go into the bargain bin and yet not that bad of a game. None of the character I could sympathize with nor probably majority of the audience and it has this weird B movie feel to it, without it being wacky and over the top.

A great Sci-Fi with a twist","Date":"23 January 2006","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" I always believed that a film that's plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but eXistenZ proved I couldn't have been more wrong. This film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. From start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. His fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. With regards to his earlier work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and a less violent Scanners, a pretty awesome combination. Setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. It was important that the film didn't become over confusing and Cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. Besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this.eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. Leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as Allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. The emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances. The cast of the film isn't huge but eXistenZ definitely has the 'quality is better than quantity' ethic which works very well.As well as being entertaining and thought provoking, eXistenZ touches social issues such as control and loss of self. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn't a huge Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste, those who like Cronenberg's work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film. It is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special.

In order to escape a mysterious faction set out to destroy Liegh's mind-submerging video games, she and Law must venture through several levels within the game eXistenZ, constantly wondering whether or not they are in the game, reality, or in a game within the game.This bending plot offers a lot to the filmmakers and the audience. The script permits odd discussions and actions that seemingly make no sense but offer insight into past events, future events, and character motivations. The look of the film isn't very dark, but it maintains a creepy, sometimes gut-wrenching atmosphere. The look of the game PODS themselves is enough to make one cringe. And Jude does such a good job conveying his character's discomfort with his body being prodded by the PODS hookups, that it's difficult to watch the tentacle enter his spine.This is all excellent however, in that it puts the audience perfectly in the characters shoes, serving to create a disorienting and frightening world, without actually confusing us to the point where we can't stand to watch.While The Matrix, the first in particular, could be considered a better Movie simply because it adds a more entertaining, more mainstream approach to the question of reality, eXistenZ actually does a better job examining and answering the question...without actually answering it. eXistenZ raises the question and in the end allows the audience member to make up their own mind, something the Matrix preached, and achieved, but had to do so through three films and more action and special effects than eXistenZ required.Simply put, if you like weird sci-fi with a point, and are in need of a breath of fresh air in the genre, look no further than eXistenZ.

It's definitely not a film for everyone, but then again this is David Cronenberg we're talking about.  `eXistenZ' doubles as the name of the movie and the name of Allegra Geller's game within the movie.Film's based on Games generally strike out, and film's about the gaming industry seems to have less material than the arcade rendition of Street Fighter 2 which answers the question, `Why aren't there any good films about how the game industry actually is?'  Why not make a movie about gamers by gamers who understand gaming issues?  As a gamer, I can honestly say . . . we'd rather be playing the game than watching a movie about it.  The closest thing we have are the likes of Tron and War Games and eXistenZ . . . and all show some twisted perversion of `what could be' versus what actually is.But you know, that's okay, because a film true to form about here and now gaming will probably not fly with audiences.  eXistenZ answers this by commenting how games are through a royally twisted and screwed up perspective (note that is not a complaint.)The thing that stuck out in my mind most is how accurately Cronenberg wrote the game characters and game dialogue (though I'm doubtful most gamers will admit it.)  Video game cutscenes and game-cinema-sequences and the like do seem a bit more elegant in their own homeland amidst polygon actors who can't quite get the basic gestures and timing of human expression down, voiced by people reading the script that pops up on screen, but if you were to strip away the limitations of a gaming platform and strip away the double standard reminder that `hey, it's just a game' and you're left with the eerie nightmarish tone of things that never quite click and b-performances from the actors in eXistenZ.Another common-denominator eXistenZ has with its subject, video-games, is the plot.  Like an RPG plot, the only true surprises eXistenZ has up its sleeve come with a roll of the eyes and a `what the insert profanity?!' phrase.  The gaming industry is plagued with writers who think that a plot with enough twists and turns, regardless of how out there/retarded/stupid is a good one, and usually the one good plot twist per game is ruined by the hours and hours of crap you end up playing.  eXinstenZ addresses this, playfully comments on it, then comments on itself for doing it.An amazing film at heart, a very fun film at heart, but not one for everyone.  The beauty of eXistenZ is that it knows what it is, and it knows what it's doing, and that's what gives the film it's sophistication.  It's quite funny and ironic since the film's subject matter, the gaming industry, is struggling to be taken seriously by non-gamers by introducing games with `sophisticated' subject matter, commenting on life, religion, relationships and other major issues and eXistenZ comes along and takes a step back and imitates its offspring.I consider cinema to be (more or less) the parent of the modern game industry, and even though eXistenZ pokes fun at the younger entertainment medium . . . it's never malicious.  It's more playful encouragement than condescending mockery (I mean, it's not like the film-industry is loaded with artistic integrity either).  eXistenZ is a nod to the cinematic quality the games are developing, and to the plots their already exploring.

Well, the storyline of this remarkable movie is basically the same, only there aren't any aliens involved here and the equipment moved with the times.

Through some sort of biological port is your spinal column, games are linked directly to the nerve system and you literally experience the virtual events. Oh yes, once again Cronenberg's world perspective is pretty messed up! eXistenZ is the name such a game and the plot handles about the female designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a random security guard (Jude Law) fleeing from and battling against the opponents of videogames whilst playing it. That's the synopsis is a nutshell, but I can assure you this film comes with a lot of bizarre & complex twists and red herrings. Naturally you have the confusing type of situations in which the protagonists can't tell whether it's reality or fiction, the double-crossing supportive characters and, of course, the various fake endings before the actual denouement (read the most predictable one) is revealed. Needless to say eXistenZ is a truly curious movie&#133; It's grim, depressing and extremely violent, but at the same time oddly fascinating and really full of ingenious elements. Some of Cronenberg's gimmicks are too insane for words, like for example the deadly gun compound of rotten Chinese food (!) and loaded with human teeth (!!).

This film was unnecessarily disgusting. So disgusting, in fact, that I almost vomited and was unable to eat for hours after I watched it.  The comment that there were strong performances from the actors is just flat out wrong.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, while I do like her for some reason, has always been a flat actress.  This was a good part for her because she is supposed to be fairly unfeeling anyway.  Jude Law is usually good but is nothing more than a caricature in this movie.

This wasn't.I wasn't really expecting it to be better than The Matrix, but I at least expected some good special effects and some semblance of a storyline. What I got instead were game pods that look and act like alien frog creatures and a virtual reality that seems suspiciously like a really boring, dreary version of our own world.  And when Allegra and her friend finally enter this magical game world, what do they do?  Why, they wander around aimlessly, of course!The plot, as far as I could figure out, had something to do with a group of anti-VR terrorists.  But after 45 minutes I was hopelessly confused.  I had no idea who was for Allegra, who was against Allegra, what exactly Allegra was fighting for, or even if I should have been rooting for her or not. And when the movie was over, I still didn't.

There was very little to to amuse the audience in Cronenberg's latest work. Luckily for us it was relatively early in the day and the volume was quite loud or I may well have dozed off before Law got his plug fitted. I haven't fallen asleep in the cinema since Super Mario Bros.Firstly, it broke the golden rule of cinema, which is to avoid mentioning the name of the film in corny circumstances if at all possible. It broke this one as soon as the shoddy (and boring) title sequence had ended. To exacerbate this already dire situation, the title was uttered by someone who desperately needed to blow their nose.Secondly, the heist pulled by the chap with the organic gun was as predictable as it was uninteresting. We all knew that something would happen, and when it did, it wasn't particularly exhilarating. It must also go down as one of the lamest assassination attempts in recent memory.Thirdly, after the excitement in the beginning we are treated to late night made-for-TV acting for at least half an hour before anything else happens. An empty car journey, filled with banal dialogue and some less-than-clever moves by Law's flawed character. We very nearly walked out. Which would have left the cinema empty.Oh, then eventually, after we are sick to death of these two sappy weaklings we get introduced to another character who seems to be based on a certain long running  playstation advert theme. Nothing original there. Oh, so in the future we go to garages in the middle of nowhere in the dead of night to get cattle prodded in the back by some meat head with a penchant for amateur surgery. Oh really. And meanwhile outside there are silly little bird type latex hybrid reptiles. Are these supposed to help us to become emersed in an imaginary world? I don't know, perhaps this film is just too clever for me.Finally, we get to the part of the film that this hectic introduction had been building up to. THE GAME. She doesn't know what it is, and she made it, he doesn't know what it is, and he's a moron, and we don't know what it is, and we don't care. Great, another computer game, but this one is the basis of a film that has had audiences across America baffled. They obviously never saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. They go into game A, get put into game B, they come out of that one and go into another, then they kill everyone and go into another game and win it by killing everyone else. But was that last one a game or real life? Neither, it is a film. And we were well aware of that, so we didn't much care whether they were in it or out of it because either way they were in a film. Something that we were made painfully aware of throughout. If you can't work out whether they were in a game or not is because you weren't supposed to be able to work it out because that was the aim of the film. This movie doesn't answer any questions, as has been suggested, it merely prompts another one why am i watching this?Put simply, this is the poor mans remake of CCBB but without the intrigue or the cunning story line, without any real empathy, or attempt to make an involving film leading up to a reality-questioning end. The parallels between the two films are many from the way it puts us into the fantasy world; the way it takes us out; the way that there is a moment of helplessness for the main characters as they are taken over; the way that characters and events from the supposed real beginning are reused in the make-believe world; and the way that we are shocked when we find out that what we witnessed may or may not be real.I was one of the first in England to see this film, and have actively voiced the following advice to friends ever since to avoid seeing it as it is merely a cheap and unconvincing attempt to fool the audience into caring about whether or not what they are seeing is inthe actual world. At the end of the day it is not real, and there has to be more point in seeing a film than to simply desipher whether or not the end is in an imaginary world.

The future of video gaming is apparently a particularly lame 1980s text adventure game controlled by a piece of 'fart putty with nipples'. No, I don't think so some how... Actors like Chris Ecclestone and Ian Holm are paraded and wasted, whilst Jude Law unfortunately seemed to be on autopilot - but can you blame the actors if they've been directed to act like 2d cutouts? Plot and story don't develop as instead we lurch from one smug set-piece to another. Like Jude Law I wished that I too could stand up shout eXistenZ is paused! and get the heck out of the theatre.Cronenberg should've realised that if you're going to make a film about peoples' terror at losing their lives and their personality, then you should write some actual characters and more to the point people that your audience can identify or even sympathise with, and contrast that with the gameworld. Personally I could quite understand why everyone else wanted to kill Jennifer Jason Leigh's 'character' and was willing them on to do it, and quickly. Oh, and the ending (if you're not unconscious and still paying any attention whatsoever by that point) is particularly predictable - I saw it with longstanding SF fans and we all expected so much more.

I wouldn't even buy her as a movie director, something far more mainstream. Goodlooking females are NEVER computer game designers, it's a universal invariant. Sci-fi doesn't need special effects to carry the plot, but when they are used, they should at least look good. The VR machines looked godawful, and the gore looked, well, like oily rubber guts from a cheap slasher movie. Special effects should be used to serve the plot. The only half-decent effect (that didn't make one think 'god, this is bad') was the cricket/dragon thing at the gas station. And what point did that effect serve? Not to mention the the scene following it, wasting Willem Dafoe completely. The pacing was horrible, and the so-called paranoia... You do not build paranoia by having a character state that they are being followed. Ooh, scary. This movie is an utter piece of crap, even The Matrix and about every other Star Trek episode has more to say than this movie, not to mention good science fiction. What if reality isn't reality?

The video games we play are virtual non-reality games where we control another character, rather than being the character. But in the world of eXistenZ virtual reality gaming is all the rage. eXistenZ is a film about a game designer named Allegra Geller who is on the run from fanatics who want to kill her. The only person she has to protect her is a lowly marketing trainee named Ted Pikul. In order to find out if the her game has been damaged, Allegra and Ted must play the game eXistenZ. In the world of the game it becomes more and more difficult to tell who is friendly and who is not and what is reality and what is not. Virtual reality melds with actual reality in this twisting sci-fi action flick from the always wacky David Cronenberg.eXistenZ is a film that you absolutely have to watch all the way through before you pass any judgement on it. You can't finely critique the film until you know everything and have absorbed the entire plot. The plot moves at a rapid pace and maintains a level of significance, never wasting time with subplots that don't build on the story. Every moment of the film is important, all the way up to the final line. What's even better about the film is its hidden ambiguity. You think you're keeping up and you think you understand everything that is going on. You may even think that you have outsmarted the film with your astute observations that really only scratch the surface of what this film entails. But the plot then thickens and throws you for a loop towards the end with events you will never see coming.eXistenZ has managed transcend conventional laws of storytelling and it has found a way to exploit the traditional methods of telling a mind bending story. This is a very plot twist heavy film and towards the end it gets a little ridiculous, but the film wraps up in such a way that the plot twists were completely necessary to what the film is actually about. It's hard to explain without seeing the movie, so watch this movie. eXistenZ is a truly ironic film. It hides very clever filmmaking under sub-par storytelling. The film is a cop out, but in a good way.The practical aspects of eXistenZ are all decent, like acting, script, direction, etc. But where the film really shines, and the only place it intends to shine, is the way the story develops and unfolds into something unexpectedly brilliant. It is a film that is very proud of its plot and this is very obvious in the last fifteen minutes of the film. Cronenberg indeed pulled a fast one on all of this and he's very happy about it. But I'm not complaining. I really enjoyed eXistenZ and I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. If you're looking for something to boggle your mind, I would watch this film.

Only Cronenberg could have made the fleshy game pods in this film as lifelike and revolting as they are (parallels could probably be made to Videodrome, but I will not try right now).This is not Cronenberg's best film, however, and almost seems like more a transition for him between his science and flesh phase of the 1980s and 1990s into his more action-oriented films of the 2000s. Likewise, this is not Leigh's best work, which is sad. More sad is her choice of being in this film rather than Eyes Wide Shut.

That gives a sort of interesting change to the film. While this is a horror film, it isn't strictly horror; I'd say it's more of a psychological thriller/horror film. Watch for some really weird things that only Cronenberg would ever think of such as the look of the bioports (think Videodrome), the weapon (very eco-friendly!), and the nifty new cell phones (bring those into a test and you'll never get caught!). When I was half way through watching this film I suddenly though, Hey I've seen a film like this before.... I realized, however, that this film had brought back the memory of an old nightmare of mine, forgotten for who knows how long.

Dick; R.I.P., you brilliant man... if you haven't read anything by him and what I just described sounds appealing to you, pick up a book of his immediately) and mechanical vs. organic(the game-pods are like living beings, and there is a clear sexual allusion with them penetrating your skin, being wired into your spine for you to play). Existentialism is an important part of this, and the fear of not being able to distinguish between fake and real, of losing touch(that takes precedence in this to the game rules seeming like ones from any game we know). We see a world where activities are all experienced through computers. This is layered and smartly written; it actually holds up to scrutiny, and provides food for thought without being obvious about it. The plot has several twists and turns, and you do have to pay attention... which really isn't difficult, because it's very engaging. This is creepy and, at times, bizarre and grotesque. It's also pretty funny when it wants to be. The acting is good, sometimes great. Characters are memorable and credible, if not all likable. The FX vary a bit; there are magnificent ones, but CGI tends to be underwhelming, if passable. They aren't the focus, though. The dialog is fitting(in other words, intentionally forced here and there). There is a lot of bloody violence and disturbing content, a little perverse stuff and occasional strong language in this. The DVD comes with three(!) interesting commentary tracks(director/writer, DOP, and Special Effects supervisor, respectively), a 53-minute featurette(The Invisible Art of Carol Spier, which I will review on its own page here on the site) and the US theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone that finds the concept compelling, and any fan of Cronenberg. 8/10 "},{"Title":"the  movie eXistenZ","Date":"9 July 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" when life imitates art or when art imitates life, then it is time to find out which one is really a reality. i find it kind of a way to let the living live and the others do what they do best. i guess u can guess what that is-they try to live for the rest of us not knowing that their living is different from the way we live. although i knowingly was not aware that such a thing existed, no play on the title, i do find myself in the middle of it and have the scars to prove it, both physically and technological. i have only one dominating emotion at this time which i rather keep to self. anyway i am aware that David Croneberg's is just a messenger in this display of entertainment, i do find that this goes beyond the concept of entertainment , much bigger than those who feel that it comes down to entertainment rather than another tool for the deviate minds of this century. the emotion is a sweet/bitter one , future expressions of what i do with this will tell just how emotional this can become. from non existing to r u NUts.

The dialog itself is not conventional and might upset some viewers who find it totally unrealistic and non-believable.  This is exactly the point.  eXistenZ is trying to persuade the viewer that this place, this time is totally adverse to ours and people are different and have different ideologies to us.  That is the whole subplot to the film, and is revealed in the end sequence.The storyline revolves around the game with the name eXistenZ which is as real virtual reality can get.

Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality. Despite the excessive use of&#133; weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying' (assuming that she was still in the game). But it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game. `eXistenZ' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways. Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream&#133; or was it' twist. It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. At only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too. In a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. But her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character. Jude Law on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through his perspective.`eXistenZ' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember. There's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what next? - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb rating 6.2/10.

All you need to know is that the film is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film almost seems to abandon its technology fearing point at the end, but then it throws in the final twist in the very last line of dialogue.There's also some very gross sexual imagery based around the 'bio-ports' in the protagonists backs, as well as some very gross acting from Jude Law. He manages to come off as naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can care to think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh comes off much better, and everyone else can be called a supporting character, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, if unspectacular, role as a money-crazed mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.

Unfortunately, besides the glowing thingy that Law pulled out of his pocket, there wasn't anything else.The problem that stuck out most to me was that all these futuristic elements are juxtaposed against a regular, redneck-country backdrop with barns, farmhouses, and crappy cars.  It was confusing and jarring.  My guess it that they didn't get much of a budget, or spent it all on the pods, so made do by location-shooting in one town for the entire time.  Many of the extras, expecially the people in the church during the testing, look like just a bunch of locals they hired.I would have been much more engrossed if they had taken the pains to make it a real futuristic society, with plot twists more dramatic than going to a chinese resturant.

This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.In this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system.  It is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget.  It is full of Cronenberg's slimy body works, dark foreboding scenery all populated by a great cast including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously.  These people will do what they can to figure out the game and then to win at it.  Like other movies of his there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat but like an auto-accident you don't look away.  If you liked any of the movies mentioned above then by all means go out and get this one.

The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law).  This movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film. The best thing about this film were the twists toward the end.

Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing.  eXistenZ is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, Jude Law, through the game's paces.  While in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the game's author knows. The movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about eXistenZ is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects, it's the story itself that propels the movie. Recommended for the Saturday night when science fiction is called for.

Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (P.R. nerd) to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth.  Director David Cronenberg has, well, used some bits from his earlier films (Videodrome, Scanners, The Fly, etc.) and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing.  Law and Leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist to it.  Dafoe is anything but devilish as Gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. One of the movie's best scenes is witnessing Ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to Allegra -  I can't help myself.  eXistenZ manages to show that he (Cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm.

I suppose it applies to film posters too, but the makers also did pretty well to produce a convincingly-deceiving trailer too.On the basis of The Fly, Videodrome, and to a (much) lesser extent Crash, I was expecting to at least be moderately entertained and generally intrigued by eXistenZ. Tragically, the smattering of lovely ideas and concepts within the film do little to make it any less of a chore to watch.Based around the release of a new 'Virtual Reality' (and this is the futuristic plug-in-to-your-brain type of VR we're talking about here) game, eXistenZ tries its best to be clever . There ARE some solid ideas there, such as the 'linearity' imposed on the game players that keeps their actions within the confines of the computer program, but these token intellectual gems simply serve to increase the disappointment felt at the end, when you realise that there were (literally) only 2 or 3 good points to the whole film.The effects in eXistenZ are nothing spectacular, but this in itself is not a problem. eXistenZ does, however, have another Achilles heel. A big, red, swollen Achilles heel with boils and eczema (or should that be eCzemA?). For every beautiful prop (e.g. the bone gun from the poster), and for every atmospheric set (the deliciously dark organic factory), there is a plethora of atrociously designed implements and dreary locations that litter the film. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that ANY device will EVER resemble the rubbery splodge that masquerades as the games machine.Jude Law puts in a worthy performance as the game-sceptic, but Jennifer Jason Leigh is utterly dire and (deliberately I'm sure) irritatingly stupid as the game creator. The dialogue is weak, even for a computer game, and the characters stumble through the whole film as if they don't even care what's going on around them.As for the ending, let's just say that Mr. Cronenberg should follow Ridley Scott's Blade Runner example and do a 'no idiots please' Director's Cut.

Still her role is the biggest waste of a good actor since Robin Williams in Branagh's Hamlet.The trademark Cronenberg creepiness is on full display in this film.

I think that's why it's so close to a real dream, by transforming little things from reality, and bringing us into a state we experience while we're sleeping, in which we are also characters without a will, playing out a script, not knowing why we're there and what are the rules of (dream)reality.

Such is the case with eXistenZ.  I can honestly say it was one of the most satisfying films I have seen since David Lynch's Lost Highway.   eXistenZ like the before mentioned Lost Highway needs time for reflection after the end and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  The reason for this is that it is more intelligent than most films. It is filled with the usual Cronenberg sexual symbolism (the characters have a hole in the base of their spines that look like a chocolate starfish).  The film has a brilliant linear yet non-linear narrative structure.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone but you will be surprised.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is looking the sexiest I have ever seen her and probably gave every bloke there a semi-on. Jude Law was convincing as a man who had to pretend to know nothing about what was going on, however Cronenberg could have just as easily cast someone more masculine looking it works either way.  Willem Dafoe as always is excellent as a country gas station attendant who will shoot something into your back (Ooh Eer Missus)for enough money.Original storyline aside the next best thing about the film is the great visual effects, I don't usually go out of my way for effects movies but this one actually made you feel sick at times and I have seen some sick films. Cronenberg hasn't made a better film since Videodrome and some of his past efforts have been absolute s***e (Crash, Naked Lunch) but this is a return to the Cronenberg we all know and love.

Firstly, it's a relief to see that he has gone back to writing his own original screenplays.  Secondly, it's a relief to see that he's gone back to his roots of science fiction (don't get me wrong, I do consider Dead Ringers and Naked Lunch two of his finest films).  Lastly, it's a relief to see that he has not thrown away some of his themes that we have all grown to love so very much technology and its influence on the body.There's no need to bore anyone with the details of the plot; it's best to see it yourself than for me to try and describe the events that take place on the screen.  After all, many of the elements of the film cannot be properly described with words; they must be seen to be fully appreciated (unless you can bring to life through words a hand-gun made from mutant bone and flesh, and a game pod which resembles a human organ that plugs into the players spine).For fans of Cronenberg, this film is a must.  It has all the gore you would come to expect, the intelligent dialogue that assumes the viewer actually has a brain in their head, and, of course, his ability to find the perfectly suited cast.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is perfect Allegra Gellar, the inventor of eXistenZ, and the supporting cast of Jude Law, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, and the countless others only add to the magic of the film.  Often times, Cronenberg has created characters that you cannot possibly sympathize with. Max Renn of Videodrome and Bill Lee of Naked Lunch are two perfect examples of characters who endure horrific circumstances, but are such cold, isolated people, it's hard for the viewer to feel sympathy for them. However, in this film all the characters seem authentic and, as a result, you cannot help but care for them and be interested in what happens to them along the way.To give away the ending of this film would be a tragedy, for it has one the best endings in Cronenberg's filmography.  As well, this film has one of the most light-hearted atmospheres to it, or at least in my opinion it does. Therefore, you'll just have to see it for yourself.  If you're not familiar with Cronenberg's past work, you should be warned that many of the images in the film will be shocking and completely unbelievable.  However, if you are familiar with Cronenberg, especially films such as Videodrome, there's nothing that comes as a huge shock; it's the same surrealist, bio-technological-sexuality that we have all grown to love.

The film takes us through all our fears of the evolving information and biotechnological age, throws them in a blender and serves the viewer a compelling tale that is both simplistic, yet all the more complex.Because so much of the story is exciting character development between Jennifer J. Leigh and Jude Law, it is hard to give a sure shot answer as to what makes this film so great. At one moment you are scared to your rational limits, only to find yourself laughing at Law's obsessive rationale clashing with the adventurous and sexy Leigh. Returning to what has become a signature theme for Cronenberg, free will is questioned over and over on levels of dialogue and plot.  This movie raises many fundamental questions.  It asks the viewer if it is presumed inevitable that we merge with the physical framework of technology.  Does evolution require the dismissal of what is left of our natural environment? Are we creating technology, or is it creating itself?  The story, as a whole, could be a metaphoric illusion. Also, take notice of Howard Shore's score (think Seven).

In these short reviews, I think they give away why they missed the point and didn't like the film.I thoroughly enjoyed eXistenZ, and found myself intellectually (if not emotionally) engaged from the beginning.  Maybe it's just prior experience with Cronenberg.  His modus operandi is to plant hints right in front of the audience all the way along, but never point them out.  It's the audience's job to pay attention, and put the pieces together along the way.Much has been made of a scene in the film wherein Jude Law eats a rather grotesque lunch, then constructs a gun out of the bones from the meal -- and this scene is exactly how the audience has got to watch the film.  Pick through the yucky parts, look at the structure beneath, then construct something meaningful from the pieces.  The question of what is reality and what is part of an elaborate video (cranial?) game is constant in the film, from the first frame to the last.  To Cronenberg's credit, he refuses to state the answer.  Speaking of credits, as with most of Cronenberg's films, even the design of the opening crawl presents the theme of the film.  In this case, we are presented with a multi-layered, constantly shifting combination of what seem to be vivid natural rock formations and forests (and which are probably artificial representations) interwoven with barely visible anatomical sketches; in other words, the artificial presented as real, and the real reduced to the artificial, with each piece obscuring and/or highlighting the other.  It's a quite remarkable job that far too many people won't pay attention to, because they'll still be yacking and munching their popcorn, waiting for the movie to start.  But, much like the game within the film, it starts before you really think it does...The only flaws in the film are Cronenberg's signature weaknesses as a writer; lack of development in Act II and an abrupt finale.  As with most of his movies (Videodrome and Crash being the most blatant examples) just when we get to the point that should be the middle of Act II, we suddenly leapfrog to Act III, blast through it in a scene, then hit the finish. You certainly can't say he lets his movies drag, but this foreshortening has left me feeling a little cheated in many of his previous films.  I didn't feel as cheated this time, because eXistenZ left so many little puzzles and enigmas to consider afterwards -- certainly enough to carry through conversation on the drive home and dinner afterwards.  And, to further bolster the well thought-out complexity of the script, these questions all connected back to possible answers, and brought up further questions, that fed back to other answers, and so on.Finally, I found all of the performances brilliant, especially considering the trick the actors had to face -- they knew when they were playing real or game, but had to portray their own reality without giving it away to us.  Jennifer Jason Leigh continues to be one of my favorite actresses, and a true chameleon.  She doesn't play a part, she lives it.  Also, Jude Law is a real find, displaying a wide range, from vulnerable wimp to hard-edged tough guy.  Willem DaFoe and Ian Holm turn up in what are basically cameos, but give their all to these small parts.In short, eXistenZ won't please the multiplex crowd, who only want big, loud commercial films that offer up everything in a nutshell, explained neatly on page 87 by a character who knows too much -- but it's perfect for people who like to let their movies make them think, who try to stay a step ahead, and who don't give up in frustration the instant they don't catch something.  It left me looking forward to Cronenberg's next effort.

In his flicks, we always see his characters go happily overboard in some pursuit. The pursuit in Existenz is to enter a virtual reality game, where the particulars are just as complicated as in real life, and try to do some good (or bad, as the case may be.) The logistics of the story development here are just dizzying at times, and as with most other Cronenberg films, you are happy he had the courage not to give very much away.The special effects wizardry is dazzling, and it is rare to find effects so sophisticated and at the same time very much played down. Since we have already suspended disbelief, the exotic things we see blend smoothly into the story.Not as resounding and gory as Videodrome or Scanners, Existenz is thankfully free of the tiresome lulls that plagued Crash and Dead Ringers. Like a lot of great movie makers, Cronenberg is a hit-and-miss director. I think he nailed it nicely with this one.

Even to the last moment, when characters played by Leigh and Law point their guns menacingly out into the audience, we have been interacting with the movie in very much the same way as the characters interact with the game.We have come to the theatre to witness a different version of reality, one that is by no means real, simply pictures run across lifeless celuloid. After we leave the movie, it takes us a while to readjust ourselves to reality.  And we pay to have this done to us.  What Cronenburg has done is to work deeper into this theme, developing layers of reality, weaving his way throughout them, and in the end, extending his picture into real life, in the same way that Leigh's character comments, a cheap mechanical method to heighten the level of arousal of the next sequence.Absolutely brilliant.

Cronenberg's Best","Date":"5 May 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Cronenberg really is a genius. This movie is less a story than a symbolic examination of the place of technology in our lives and our desensitization to even the most disturbing elements of our everyday lives. And as such it's smart, funny, entertaining, and engaging. I was totally blown away.This movie is a good double-feature with the Matrix, but it certainly goes a lot of areas The Matrix isn't prepared to go-- the only hint of this sort of thing in The Matrix is when the mirror crawls over Keanu's body until it slides down into his throat.It's also amazing that this film came out at the same time as the Littleton Massacre-- Cronenberg sees the place that violent and realistic video games play in real life violence. He also questions WHY reality isn't good enough for people, why they would want to live in a game. Cronenberg is SO far ahead of everyone in terms of thinking about these things.One of the most disturbing elements of the movie, which I think is an amplification of trends in our world, is the character's blase attitude toward the mutant amphibians that are everywhere through the film, and the LACK of concern or disgust toward machines made out of the body parts of these animals. I loved how mundane it was to stick an unbilical cord into your back. This was most disturbing to me during the scene when the two-headed lizard wanders out from behind the gas pump.One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is to set these fantastic creatures and events in settings that are NON-futuristic, ordinary, and dirty. Cronenberg, the man is a genius.I must also mention the INCREDIBLE opening credits sequence. It was just SO BEAUTIFUL. I have no idea what we were looking at (I was trying to figure it out), but whatever it is was so rich and gorgeous, it was really as if he was using the screen as a canvas. The score is also mournfully beautiful. I'm going to go buy it after work today.Don't believe anything negative you hear about the performances. They are, across the board, amazing. I think people don't understand that the movie KNOWS that these people are speaking dialogue-- we're not supposed to believe that these are real characters speaking real lines. Both leads are incredible-- Cronenberg was so smart to spot Jude Law's intensity in his other, smaller roles. The real challenge of these performances is for the actors to express emotions and states of mind that are completely out of sync with what is happening, and they pull it off incredibly.Also, I MUST say that Cronenberg is the ONLY director I know of who is really delving in a very deep way into homosexual themes (no, I am not saying he is gay, and I don't think that's the main focus of his films). Without being graphic, each of his films since Naked Lunch has explored the issues of being bodily penetrated, absorbing bodily fluids, the meshing of two bodies, etc., in a way that INCLUDES homosexual themes in a way other films shy away from. The bioport looks rather like, and is located rather close to, another hole on Jude Law's body, and you just can't deny that SOMETHING is going on when Jennifer smears vaseline all over it and then shoves her finger inside! I was lucky enough to see this film with a great audience, and there were several snickers when Jude Law say he doesn't like being penetrated. (This is also the only audience that snickers wickedly after the Partnership for a Drug-Free America PSA that preceded the film!).Cronenberg has always been interesting, but I've become acutely focused on him since he's headed into more artful films. This is the most focused and tightly themed film of his that I have ever seen. I think it's his very best, and I'm sad that there isn't more of a literate audience for him. He is one of those filmmaker's whom one is simply thankful for.

So, eXistenZ was a refreshing change from this disappointing scenario. The star of the film was the beautiful Jude Law, who played the vulnerable and easily led Ted Pikul extremely well. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also good as the rather strange computer games designer obsessed with her pod, which was an amalgamation of the human body. I loved the way that there were several layers of game play in the film, and the uncertain ending was excellent. The film played with your mind and made you question reality, and I asked several people after the film about how they felt when they were watching it, and most of them said that they all had a moment when they were suddenly unsure of reality. Another clever aspect of the film was that, unlike so many films set in the future, the scenario was not wildly unbelievable, and, although there is a large scientific leap between the kind of virtual reality we have today and eXistenZ, Cronenburg's world did not seem that far away. I liked the changes in the characters. Also, the appearance of the dog gave the film a good sense of continuity. I will definitely see the film a second time, as I thought it was amazing!

Yes, the dialogue does seem ludicrous at times, but as I've found with most of Cronenberg's work, it is only hammy because he intends it to be tongue in cheek. It is a film that demands your attention and you do need a brainwave to attend. But it is so worth the 110 minutes in the theater. It is beautifully shot and gives actors such as Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm a lot to do with small parts. It is a must for Cronenberg fans.

There was about ten of us in the theater. After the final credits started rolling I got up and began to walk out and eagerly began listening to people's comments. You can always hear people talking about the film right after it is over. Some people obviously loved it and others hated it. I suspect that people who criticize eXistenZ for being to weird and slow are the same people who criticize 2001 A Space Odyssey for the same reasons. I am amazed at how many people do not like 2001. I overheard one man saying that eXistenZ  was the worst film that he has seen. I don't think he has seen too many movies! It is very clear from audience reactions that David Cronenberg has a very definite and limited cult following of people who think that his work is ingenious. Those who have never liked Cronenberg, never will. He has a very bizarre and unique world-view that is displayed in all of his films, which will not change any time soon. Where do I stand? I am with Cronenberg all the way. He is one of the greatest auteurs in the film industry. eXistenZ is a fantastic addition to his collection of masterpieces.One of the things that fascinates me about David Cronenberg is how his view of technology evolves from film to film. It is evident in all of his films, but I will discuss it in terms of three of them. Beginning in The Fly, Cronenberg metaphorically depicts the unification of man and technology in Brundle's transformation into Brundlefly. In Crash, he went one step further and implied that human beings are so connected with technology that there is an allegorical sexual connection. Technology in itself is seen as being erotic. J.G. Ballard, author of the novel Crash which inspired the movie  states that, ...the ultimate purpose of Crash is cautionary, a warning against that brutal, erotic, and over lit realm that beckons more and more pervasively to us from the margins of the technological landscape.eXistenZ evolves even further beyond Crash in certain ways. In eXistenZ, technology no longer takes the form of mechanical machines. Technology is now depicted as a living entity, just as human beings are. The game pods that Allegra Gellar (Jennifer Jason Leigh) creates, are completely organic in nature. Allegra refers to her game pod containing eXistenZ as her baby. She nurtures it and caresses it, as if it were a child. In one scene, repairs to the pod are necessary. Normally what we would see is a &#145;computer geek' taking apart a computer and replacing or reconstructing various microchips, but in eXistenZ the procedure, conducted by Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm) takes the form of a surgical operation. What we see, looks quite similar to a dissection of a small animal in a biology class. Oozing fluids are everywhere in this film, as they are in most Cronenberg films. He seems to have a fetish with bodily fluids.It is quite likely that this film will be compared to Matrix another science fiction film that has its basis in the world of virtual reality. eXistenZ is miles beyond Matrix however. eXistenZ makes Matrix look like Wing Commander (one of the worst science fiction films, if you can even fairly call this science fiction). Matrix looks great on a technical level, but its ideas are simply an amalgamation of many existing trends in science fiction. Virtual reality is by no means an new concept, but the way it is conceptualized in eXistenZ is new. The organic game pods are plugged right into the human body by means of a bio-port at the base of the spine. This attachment between the living human and the living game pod further reinforces Cronenberg's theme of man uniting with technology. The film seems to be working toward the notion that man and machine are becoming the same thing, organically. In Blade Runner, man and machine are seen as one in the same in terms of consciousness, but in eXistenZ, man and machine  are seen as one in the same in terms of flesh and bone. Even one of the weapons is created from flesh and bone and shoots human teeth as bullets. Theoretically,  if man and the technology that he creates become the same thing, then they will be fully united.The games that Allegra creates are seem so real to the characters that they still feel like they are in the game when they are supposedly in reality. Then again, we have to question whether or not they actually are in reality. At one point Ted (Jude Law) pauses the game and feels as though real life is a game, and Allegra is just a character. Is this true? eXistenZ certainly presents this as a possibility. For all we know, everything that occurs in the film could be part of a game, at different levels of reality. Allegra and Ted enter different levels of reality after they enter eXistenZ. How are we to know that the events that take place before they enter eXistenZ are not just part of another game designed to get them that far? The games can endlessly build upon one another, just like the never ending links within the internet. David Cronenberg presents us with a world where we are never really sure of anything.**** out of ****  "},{"Title":"Excellent movie for Cronenburg fans","Date":"26 April 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  It seems that Cronenburg fans love this one, while others are (stupidly) comparing it to The Matrix, or just not getting it.

Leave it to David Cronenberg to put his psycho-sexual organic versus machine stamp on the genre.  Basically, think the MATRIX with a brain and a much sicker side even though a lot less violence (well...sort of).  It's full of gross-out moments, but not as cringe-worthy as CRASH or DEADRINGERS if only because the characters are in a game-world for most of the violence.  I like all of Cronenberg's films one way or another, because they have a point of view and they are always unique.  eXistenZ is no exception, and is surprisingly easy to watch.  CRASH was hard for me to watch the first time, but this one clips along at a good pace and has a great plot that will keep you on your toes and the edge of your seat. Smarter than the MATRIX, and kinky in its own way without ever being outright sexual.  Imagine a scene where somebody licks a small hole in the base of your spine that is actually a game-port, or a scene where they stick a vaselined finger in this mechanical orifice.  Sexual? Yes.  Sexy?  You decide for yourself.  Go see this movie with an open mind.  It's Cronenberg 100 %, but it is fun too.

How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...   Coming off the grossly underrated `Crash', Director David Cronenberg comes back with a haunting and gory, yet deeply layered satire/comedy/horror film that easily fits in with the rest of this director's amazingly diverse filmography. While not really meant to make a whole lot of sense, there are things in the awkwardly titled `eXistenZ' that you truly have to seen to be believed.  Things like  handguns made out of flesh and bone that fires human teeth bullets, fleshy metal pods that writhe to life, and the much talked about, anus looking bio-ports.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.  `eXistenZ' is filled with so much originality that it puts other films to shame.  Half the fun is just trying to figure out what you will see next.  Now what I described isn't too unusual for Cronenberg.  He's assembled a career out of the bizarre and symbolic.  But with every new film, it never seems like he's aping himself. Mr. Cronenberg is a real talent behind the camera (and he's proven some presence in front of it as well, but not in `eXistenZ'). I pray that the foreign financing that he clings to will never dry up. Jennifer Jason Leigh gets the chance to play a real sexpot here, and she ably fills the role.  At times she looks miscast, but when the film's over, she is remembered the most.  That's her asset.  Jude Law I'm not too fond of. He's a very handsome and a clean cut actor, but every time he's forced to show disbelief in this movie, I could think of a hundred other actors who would have been stronger. The rest of the cast is appropriately creepy, with Willem Dafoe returning to his usual bonkers self. Cronenberg's script runs into trouble near the end.  He digs himself a hole that I didn't believe anyone could get themselves out of.  The climax of the movie is very fitting, and I though unpredictable. It makes up for the dramatic flaws that flake off the film now and again. I enjoyed `eXistenZ' a whole bunch.  I doubt there could ever be another film like it. ---------- 8 "}{"Title":"If VR is identical to reality, how do you tell the difference?","Date":"25 April 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  The movie progressed rather slowly for my tastes, but the ending does provide some interesting twists.

Here, all your favorite Cronen-tropes--infection, mutation, mind-body confusions, the yearning towards jacking out of the human form as a poignant parody of transcendence--are elaborated, embroidered, raised to the dizzying nth power. It's as if in middle age (Cronenberg is now 56), the writer-director summoned the untrammeled, carefree imaginative powers of his heroes Nabokov and Burroughs. Images and themes that elsewhere have been used to warp motheaten genres now take on the impossibly dense and extroverted form of baroque music.The bottom line on Cronenberg is that he makes ideation as sensuous as Scorsese makes sensation, or David Lynch makes dreams and nightmares. Here, Cronenberg's two career agendas--taking the meta out of metaphysics, and making the world's greatest pulp art--come together with soaring rather than crashing force. Too bad Gwyneth Paltrow's two big advance men gave this movie the brushoff Cronenberg's grafting of reality-layers would have appealed to Joe Cybergeek and made this one of his all-too-rare hits.

Probably. In fact given the context of the question it could be considered to be just plain wrong. But the film is interesting in this sense, and rather rooted within the world of video gaming in its statements and explorations; this is more of a film about video games or about a specific fictional video game, an all but self reflective piece that at times doubles up as an adaptation of itself and its own video game it contains within this fictitious universe. eXistenZ explores the nature of what video games mean to those that play them, the film exploring the essence of escape they bring to those that play them. At one point, a character is in desperate trouble and running for their life whilst holed up in a motel their answer to unwind from this terrifying premise? Why, play video games of course. If the film struggled to garner much of a crowd on release then it'll have been because The Matrix was occupying people with its action sequences, tauter drama and similar ideas of alternate realities and identities further still within as a simultaneous deconstruction of its own reality played out; I liked The Matrix more, but this is not to say eXistenZ is in any way grossly inferior.The film opens with a large gathering of people at a church somewhere in America, at an unspecified point in the future. Glamorous video gaming expert Allegra (Leigh) has pioneered a new type of gaming which lends its name to the film's title; a game slightly set away from your more bog-standard 7ft arcade machine or household based console entertainment system, and one that allows physical movement and interaction in and around a fully functional universe of buildings; towns; vehicles and persons whom are both other gamers and artificial intelligence. The gathering at the church is symbolic of how the fans of this franchise and the rather attractive for a video gaming pioneer Allegra connect they worship the item; the film situating the drooling audience in the pews watching on as those that sit at the front of the building, as if issuing a sermon, around which the alter is more commonly placed, are observed. Amongst these minions is casual onlooking security guard Ted (Law), virginal to the gaming community he is witnessing getting all excited and later brought into proceedings much more when an attempt on Allegra's life transpires. What follows is a taut and engaging thriller-come-detective story revolving around why it is what happened, happened; with Ted and Allegra at the core of it. There are those that, it would seem, reject the gaming world and the gamers that exist within it. But the film is not a petty dehumanising or demonisation of these people who are quite clearly looking 'in' on a community alien to them. The world of eXistenZ sees a relatively realistic and familiar, if low key, world given to us but with the simplest of everyday objects such as telephones; firearms and games controllers given a gross overhaul in appearance. Here, they resemble something you might dig out of the sewer; as if someone has gone to painstaking length to craft, for a big budget science fiction film, what all walks of life may resemble on a distant alien planet right down to the slugs and bugs that occupy the undergrowth of said planet. Most everyday objects in eXistenZ resemble the bugs and grubs of the undergrowth. In providing us with Ted, eXistenZ invites us to see the world of the film through unspoilt and ill-attributed eyes to the universe the film unfolds within. A point is made that Ted has avoided Allegra's video games, something you need a surgical procedure of sorts done to you if you are to join in; at one point, having had the procedure and able to indulge in eXistenZ's world because duty has called for him to do so, going so far as to quote that everything here's so dirty, absurd and grotesque perfectly capturing our own reaction to what's going on around everyone. But Cronenberg's ability in being able to tie in the absurd; the grotesque and the ugly into his film and linger on them without a sense that the film is coming across as exploitative is a skill that's prominent in most of his films. This inclusion in eXistenZ might be the man veering off down a tangent that sees him commentating on how easy, indeed needless, it is for gross and absurd content to worm its way into a video game which is built around a certain grounded sense of realism, and are lingered on. Ted's very gradual realisation that he is indeed someone and something else in the alternate reality as he adopts a different persona is effortlessly blended into the film as the chase thriller shenanigans Allegra's strand additionally spawns; his study broadly hinted at earlier on in a petrol station attendant's verbal confirmation that in reality he's a nobody pump puller but within the world of the game, he's God. I like to think eXistenZ's plunge into spy territory and tales of double agents, Russian mobsters plus corrupt trout breeding centres as characters with important sounding roles come and go without making much on an impact is the point it's complicated, convoluted and a stark alternate reality they inhabit in which everything's a little bit rubbish. As is, in an original film running on one man's vision, the only way to advance proceedings is to state dull and expositional dialogue to robotic drones doing what their told. Regardless, eXistenZ is an interesting, exciting and smart science fiction; the kind that runs on a nourishing amount of substance in tandem with its room for varying ideas, the likes of which ought to be embraced.

In fact, Cronenberg played a character in Don McKellar's 1998 film, Last Night, which also starred McKellar, Rennie, and Polley, not to mention Sandra Oh. I liked the way some of the characters in the Virtual Reality did not respond unless they were fed the correct line. That was brilliant, and I have not seen that done anywhere before or since. I also liked the gun made out of a jawbone that fired teeth for bullets. Cronenberg is brilliant. Take a pop over the Amazon's sister site, IMDb.com, and look at Cronenberg's filmography. There isn't a bad apple in the bunch, and you would do well to watch them all. Naked Lunch and Dead Ringers are just two out of many that would stand out if you liked eXistenZ.

He nicely captures the primarily nerdy character Ted and how he evolves with the progression of the game. Willem Dafoe does a very good short role too. But I didn't know why Jennifer Jason Leigh is casted. She is a good actress and she was extremely good in films such as The Hudsucker Proxy etc but here her performance was bland and artificial.

However it fails miserably to deliver for a number of reasons, not least of which is a poor script.As a filmmaker myself, I know all too well how much hard work goes into these things. You only have to look at the extras and watch all the work that goes into production design to realize this (which does happen to be the best contribution to eXistenZ, by the way). But just because a lot of hard work goes into something doesn't make it good.Some comments on here marvel at Jude Law's performance in this, but I've seen a lot of his work and this is by far his most wooden. I almost had to cover my eyes when he stepped into the virtual reality world for the first time. He, with co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh, stumble around and converse like a couple of school kids. I grant Mr Law a reprieve solely due to the material he had to work with.I can also deal with blood and gore reasonably well, I have no problem with it. But this movie seemed to relish in gore for gore's sake. I also found the many saliva-lubricated-fingers-into-bioports a bit sexually charged for this type of movie, particularly since Mr Law's tongue also gets a bit of action (and said bioport is only three or four inches above... Well, you can guess).Perhaps it was a mistake watching this in the same evening as Pier Paolo Pasolini's Mamma Roma because I found eXistenZ somewhat lacking in that which draws me to a movie... Having a soul. eXistenZ appears to fumble along with no real aim or directive and there was nothing of substance about it because we didn't care about what happened to the characters in the VR world.

Before I reveal spoilers, below, let me say to all. If you don't watch the entire film, and see the revelations in the last scene, then you don't know anything about the story. It is one of those kinds of films, that uses a gimmick at the end to explain everything. Many reviewers didn't watch the whole film, so thier comments are ridiculous.SPOILERS - Do not read any further if you have not seen the film yet. The film starts with what appears to be a command performance by new virtual reality game inventor Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is going to personally bioport a group of 12 volunteers into her new game.  When she walks the very first time, we see what appears to be jerky movements, our first clue that we may not be watching reality. Then, an audience member has smuggled in a gun, made of bone and gristle, and that shoots teeth. Second indication that we may not be watching reality. And, when Ted Pikul (Jude Law, in a pickle?) carries and drives away Allegra after she is shot, they meet a man named Gas (Willem Dafoe) at a station and see a two-headed creature crawl up the gas pump, and we now are positive that what we are seeing is not supposed to represent reality. That Gas installs Ted's new bioport with a dirty mechanic's tool is just to further convince the duller viewers that they are already in the virtual reality game.In the end, we see that Allegra was not really a game inventor, simply a participant, as was her accomplist, Ted. We see that the biopods were inventions of their imagination, they are wearing more conventional plastic and electrical gaming appliances. We learn conclusively that at the start of the film, we see participants after they had already begun the game. The bioports, the gristle guns, the strange creatures, were all creations of their imaginations within the game. When it ends, Allegra and Ted really do shoot the real game inventor.An interesting film, but it has to use the gimmick. If we had known for sure who was who at the beginning, it would have been a pretty dull movie. The only interesting part is that it makes us guess what is going on. And, if Ted and Allegra really wanted to kill the game inventor, did they really have to experience the game first? I think not, but it would have been a 5-minute film otherwise.Conclusion - an interesting experiment, and fairly entertaining, but nowhere near as innovative as Sci-Fi films like Back To The Future or The Matrix, just to name a couple.

The newest of these games is called eXistenZ. The twist in eXistenZ is that the story of the game involves a highly popular immersive virtual game which almost perfectly simulates reality, and whose existence is opposed by violent reactionaries who believe that it distorts reality.Cronenberg essentially creates simulations inside of simualtions, and lets us feel the mounting paranoia of not knowing where the real world ends. The transitions between various levels of reality in the film are so frought with uncertainty that our trust in the fake world versus the real world completely dissolves... we feel more comfortable seeing the characters in the game-world, because there, at least, we know for sure that their surroundings are simulated. That Cronenberg can make us distrust the real world by dint of its authenticity speaks volumes he is trying to mess with our heads, and it is working wonderfully.The usual wonderful Cronenberg stylistic touches are here, most notably his characteristic love of biomechanical items the video game system which is itself a living thing, the cell phone that looks like a glowworm, the gun that shoots teeth. Jennifer Jason Leigh is magnificent in her perverse repulsion from the real; Jude Law is excellent as the clueless little real-world man out of his depth; Willem DaFoe, as always, has freaky teeth.The close of the movie is one that is both wonderfully haunting and gleefully tricksterish.

I haven't seen much of his other stuff, however (I've seen *The Fly* and *Crash*, but I was unable to give either of them my full attention at the time, and one or two of his acting gigs, if these count), and thus came into this with relatively few expectations or preconceptions.The verdict I was entirely unimpressed with eXistenZ. It came across as uninspired, tedious, unremarkable. I remember it as a generic, monotonous little B-grade sci-fi picture with nothing much to recommend it.Now I like to think I have more than a little affinity for odd little films meant to make you think. I used to read science fiction/speculative fiction voraciously in my teens, and the basic question driving this film -- *the* epistemological quandary -- how do we know what is real, and how well do we know -- has always held some fascination for me, as I expect it does a great many people. The ramifications for technology in accentuating alienation in human society are also, normally good, fertile ground for intriguing drama. I'd have thought prior to seeing this work that you couldn't easily make a film on either subject (let alone both) and not leave me with *something* about it I appreciated.eXistenZ demonstrated otherwise.It's partly, I'm supposing, the rather cold, kinetic style of the thing. It's really one long chase scene, and you never really get to know the two central characters. Beyond this, their interplay is workmanlike, unremarkable, unrevealing. I found it pretty hard to believe the actors in their respective roles, so it's hard to care at any point what happens to them.The writing was flat, uninteresting. Excessive reliance on the same, rather overused devices; yes, we get it, it's hard to tell in this virtual reality world what's real, what isn't. Oh look, a plot twist, based on this conundrum. I'm pretty sure I've seen that one once or twice before. Oh, and another plot twist. I think I've seen that one too -- and actually all of five minutes ago, in this very movie. The attempts at dark humour aren't entirely unfunny, but seem to labour under pretense; they sound forced. The denouement is worse than merely cliche; I literally groaned (yes, out loud) at the last line.If I'm allowed a little dimestore psychoanalysis, I rather wonder if it was something about Cronenberg's awareness that the concept was getting a bit overused/overdone that lead to the real trouble here. At some point, Cronenberg got to thinking, okay, this story's been done a few times. How can I give it a twist, keep it interesting? So he twists, and he twists, and he twists, and it all just winds up... well, really kinda shapeless.I'm suspending judgement for now on Cronenberg himself, for lack of having really properly watched any of his better-known pictures as yet, but as to eXistenZ, my vote is skip this one.

I put thriller in quotes because this movie is not very thrilling at all.The film focuses on Alegra Gellar, an ace game designer, and Ted Pikul, her nerd-turned-bodyguard due to recent attempts on her life. The film deals with a subject that was also dealt with in another film that came out in the same year, The Matrix-namely, alternate/virtual reality vs real life. Alegra and Ted decide to port into her new video game(whose pod looks like a stomach with five nipples) to see if it has been damaged. What follows is a journey that is as confusing as it is useless.The theme is prevalent throughout the film. The characters, especially Pikul, are nervous about integrating themselves into the game. The game is essentially a glorified version of The Sims, only with adaptation capabilities. The game is so realistic, however, that it's hard to distinguish real life from the game. There is little semblance of plot throughout the film, however, because the plot of the game is a non-plot. As Allegra says it, You have to play the game to realize what your playing for, or something like that. The two just meander around doing what they suppose the game is directing them to do.I suppose this is an idea film. All the film does is state an idea, and add some sci-fi gloss, and try to pass it off as cinema. It's boring and tedious, with little action or thrilling moments. Essentially, the film is one of those pictures that is a picture of a picture. Then that picture also has a picture, and so on and so on. The whole film is the equivalent of some guy sitting in his room wondering if life is real.Cronenberg could have had a gem here, only if he had gone past the idea stage and put more effort into a larger scale plot and character development. Much like Shyamalan's The Village, all this movie is wasted potential.

I was fascinated how it went great lengths to create grotesque creatures and environments, although it could be repulsive, it's still a fun adventure, like playing with worms with your friend as a kid. Strictly speaking, the film is a computer game satire, but to me, I love this film because it's like a study of dream landscape and the appeal of nightmares. Really frightening, embarassingly erotic, ridiculous, and unable to wake up---a complete nightmare.  I guess i was dissapointed at the ending when I was first watching it because I expected a grand and awesome resolution, possibly positive, but I forgive it now.

It's 'Alice in Wonderland' with guns.This is your only spoiler warning...If Cronenberg had the same budget allowance of the simple-minded Wachowskis then eXistenZ could have been the science fiction piece of the 90s.

There is the reality => tranCendenZ reality => eXistenZ reality => micropod reality and it almost gets to a fifth concrete level of the diseased pod, but halts before that can happen.Granted, part of the story is 'Total Recall', but the pacing and reality is more efficient than Verhoeven's adolescent load of bullets and blood.  The characters can't control themselves and are bound to scripts and code words.  Glitches abound.

I don't know whether I make myself clear, but he was more of an actor in this movie than the character he was supposed to play.

While many filmgoers of that year were in awe over the special effects, action and inconsistencies of The Matrix, another, more personal (and interesting) exploration of virtual worlds took place in Cronenberg's eXistenZ. While there is some familiar ground that he had explored in Videodrome Cronenberg creates a wonderful companion piece.  In the same era of computers that are designed to look more organic and softer (see the iMac of that year) Cronenberg's eXistenZ game system looks like a cross between a Playstation and genitalia, mobile phones that resemble seed pods, and a true umbilical cord between the game system and a users spine.  Although a substantial part of the story takes place in a virtual realm, Cronenberg also comments on the zealousness of the software industry and shifting allegiances that ignore authorship.  While the grotesquerie that makes up a lot of Cronenberg's imagery may turn some away keep in mind that this film was made with the same deliberation that it asks of its audience.

In an earlier time, this theme usually developed along the lines of dream vs. conscious reality, wherein characters would become caught in dreams within dreams with the hapless victim ultimately left in a state of perpetual confusion and desperation.  Now, this theme has moved into the realm of cyber reality (i.e. The Matrix) but the essential question still remains - only now the issue is a more complex one because, unlike dreams which exist beyond the control of the dreamer, cyber reality is a conscious outgrowth of mankind's quest for ever increasing technology, employed in the purpose of achieving more leisure time gratification.  Soon, novels and movies will become passe as ordinary citizens take on the virtual reality roles of daredevil adventurers or irresistable romantic heroes.  In many ways, this theme was touched upon as long ago as 1983 in the film Brainstorm, which, in retrospect, seems to become more and more prescient in its view of a world laying just a few decades down the road.Unfortunately, eXistenZ works mostly in retrospect itself.  Too much of the film borders on the ludicrous and incomprehensible and Cronenberg needs to begin to shed his junior high level obsession with goop and gore. However, when the reality of the film is finally revealled, much of what has occured previously begins to seem justified and the audience does leave the film with some food for thought.  Also, Cronenberg continues to explore the motif of bizarre sexuality he exploited to the full in his last film, Crash.  Here, sex is as simulated as all other virtual reality activities, with the computer game plug-ins and receptors functioning as substitutes for the more traditional sexual organs.eXistenZ may provoke more giggles than gasps during much of its running time, but it is a film worth sticking with to its rewarding conclusion.

I agree that Willem Dafoe gives one of the better performances, but you cannot hang a movie around one role, and one that is effectively a cameo at that. The sexual innuendo is puerile and lends the whole thing the air of a grubby schoolboy fantasy, somewhat like the Bored of the Rings spoof computer role playing game in the 80s. That seems to be the best explanation for JJL and Jude Law's sudden outbreak of lust during the film; that they satisfy some pubescent urge, rather than adding to or advancing the film and its narrative. The film is not misleading or confusing; it's simply very badly structured and the ending predictable and unsatisfying. It doesn't challenge the intellect; rather it insults it.I've seen a lot of Cronenberg's earlier work and at times this seems like a pastiche, when I had expected considerably better things of him.The themes of technology, reality versus fantasy and the loss of identity are rich for exploration in film (perhaps the most efficient warping of reality), and the subject of many a paranoia, but they have not been well served by this film.Dark City was dark and twisted but that managed not to alienate and irritate its audience. Even The Truman Show managed a better stab at the topic than our Canadian auteur. For a better consideration of these themes then I would suggest consulting the works of Philip K. Dick and for a better directed version than The Matrix, which has just opened in the UK. Oh, and if I choose to use the term 'suckfest' then it is because I consider that the movie deserves such a low colloquialism.

The results have been disappointing ever since.eXistenZ has all the trademarks of Cronenberg's oeuvre a script which alternates between cliche and non sequitur; a jerky narrative which never plays fair with the viewer (does anyone else remember how atrociously edited 'Scanners' is?); English actors doing funny voices (particularly badly on this occasion); less than wonderful SFX; dreary sets; and emetic content, which seems designed purely for the sake of being emetic.Jude Law performs very well in this one, giving his character a rounded dimension which the film doesn't deserve.

After seeing the film - I can say that I have no clue what my friend was talking about.  The closest this movie gets to The Matrix is on the front of the box of the movie - which says 'makes The Matrix look like child's play'.  This is laughable at best.  If whoever said that was talking about the special effects then they are somewhat misguided as the effects in existenz are nowhere near as nice as those in The Matrix.  If they are talking about the story - then they are still wrong - I'll just say that there is a reason why people are not rating eXistenZ as highly as The Matrix.A better description of this movie would be that it is a cross between The Game and The Thirteenth Floor, however, both of these movies are much better than eXistenZ.  Why?  Well - the ending of eXistenZ is horrible and predictable.  If you've seen the other three movies I've mentioned - then the story and ending will not be a big surprise at all.I'm not saying that this movie is awful because it is similar to two other good movies (it is not very similar to the matrix), but rather is bad because it raises expectations that it is similar to a great movie - it is a let down as soon as you come to the understanding that it is not what it makes itself out to be.On the acting - Jude Law does a great job by duping you pretty much the entire movie.  William Dafoe did a great job as Gas the mechanic- probably the best character in the movie although he was in perhaps only 10 minutes, but if you want to see a great movie with William DeFoe doing another great acting job - then rent the Boondock Saints.  Not much to be said about anyone else in the movie - just mediocre acting for the most part.Just one last thing to say about the movie - if the last line was left out of the movie - it would have made the movie tens times better than what it was - but could they leave it out?  No - they had to ruin an otherwise decent movie.

Cronenberg's films often provoke many different reactions but boredom isn't usually one.The pic's narrative features two main characters played by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law as players of a futuristic virtual reality game.  The plot, such as it is, quickly turns into the tired and predictable `are we still in the game scenario'.  Each new plot twist is more likely to provoke a yawn rather than a gasp from the audience.  This is despite the gratuitous gore that is a common thread throughout most of the film.Jason Leigh and Law do as well as they can with the script.  Apart from the two leads, the other actors are used sparingly and are only required to speak with terrible accents and get shot.  In view of this it seems stretching credibility when they all announce `what a great game' it was at the pic's end.  In their shoes I think I would have much preferred a nice game of snakes and ladders.The film climaxes in its all too predictable `surprise ending' which you just knew was coming.

At that price and with a cast that included Sarah Polley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Ian Holm I figured, why not experiment? Unlike most of my video experiments I fell immediately into the story and really enjoyed the film. It is easy to watch and while Polley and Holm have small parts, Leigh is one screen for almost the entire film. Which is probably why she elected to do this instead of Eyes Wide Shut. Her co-star is Jude Law in what I would rate his all-time best performance.Although I was very impressed I don't recommend eXistenZ for everyone. It could be described as an anti-Matrix. Not in an intentional sense since they were being made at the same time, but rather in their respective target audiences. So if you seek it out because you really liked The Matrix, you may be disappointed.It has a fairly narrow target audience and because of this it was not aggressively distributed in the U.S. and did much better in Europe. Generally those who really connected to The Matrix will find it insufficiently manipulative (requiring too much viewer self-analysis and participation) while those who hated The Matrix will hate it for being too manipulative. So if you found Matrix generally intriguing but did not go ga-gah over it, you should make it a point to check out eXistenZ.It is not really sci-fi or action adventure but a psychological thriller (just as The Hole is not a horror film but a psychological thriller). It places Kurt Vonnegut's theme you are what you pretend to be so be careful what you pretend to be into an allegorical tale of shifting reality. Do we ever actually exercise free will? Does escaping from reality contribute to reality getting worse, in actuality or in our perception? You are meant to internalize this theme and to ask yourself these questions.My only real complaint is that the final twist (unlike the earlier twists) does not click into place when you first see in or later as you work backwards to find clues and foreshadowing elements that support this element. Without these the twist is silly and unnecessary. While it does not ruin all that has gone before it does seem like just a lame attempt to prepare the way for a sequel.

IN FACT, TAKE SOME TUMS IN ADVANCE.","Date":"12 June 2004","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  ExistenZ is an exercise in bad taste combined with a reasonable budget, which was acquired despite an almost total absence of any sort of interesting story. Actually, before I go that far I should say that the story is, in fact, fairly complex and operates on several levels, but it is executed so badly and downright grotesquely that the story is often completely irrelevant, as though each scene is trying to outdo the last in distracting the viewer from what the whole movie is about in the first place.Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the part of Allegra Geller, a star video game programmer who is just about to come out with the most technologically advanced video game ever created. Evidently, the game is able to tap into players' minds so that they actually LIVE the video game in virtual reality. Needless to say, that fine line between reality and virtual reality becomes more and more blurred until all sorts of crazy havoc ensues. The danger of the game is first hinted at in an early scene where Allegra is conducting a closed-door demonstration of her new game and some nutcase attacks her with an alarmingly ORGANIC weapon (for lack of the NEED for a better word, as it turns out), which initially seems like some crazed weirdo raised by video games but, after a moment's thought, is probably more likely someone who has had contact with the game. Sort of like Vincent Grey in the Sixth Sense.At any rate, I would say that the movie takes it's first precipitous plunge when we see the video game controllers which, like the weapon that nutcase used to try to kill Allegra, are not only disturbingly organic to the point that they are more like creatures than controllers, but they are operated through the use of equally disturbing fondling motions, as though the players compete with each other by trying to pleasure their controller better than their opponents. And don't even get me started on the bio-ports. Very few times have I ever seen such things in a movie, although it's not necessarily new from director David Cronenburg, who has a history of putting weird sexual things in his movies (see Crash, which he directed just before taking on eXistenZ). In my personal opinion, a lot of things in eXistenZ were unappealing simply because they were not necessarily offensive, but simply distasteful in a pretty literal sense. Consider, for example, the scene where our heroes, Allegra and Ted Pikul (another great performance from Jude Law) are eating in a suspicious restaurant, and Pikul gradually discovers that the hideous piece of meat that he is eating can be assembled into a greasy gun much like the one used to attack Allegra near the beginning of the movie. Maybe I was just completely put off by that scene because I was eating barbecued chicken while I was watching it. I was absolutely horrified, I almost had to turn the movie off. Interestingly enough, the video game plot is complex and simplistic at the same time. It reveals either a deep understanding of Allegra, the main character, or an excessively weak script, or both. Maybe the former was a lucky byproduct of the latter. While inside the game (which gradually becomes increasingly difficult to determine), they follow a rather childish path, following cues that sound like something a little kid would make up while writing a story for a homework assignment. A creepy country gas station attendant named Gas tells them to look for a Chinese restaurant in the forest, and order the special, while turning down such immensely appetizing dishes as mutants and reptiles. But then, of course, we have scenes like the one where Ted performs cunnilingus on Allegra's bio-port. I think it's safe to say such things don't turn up in many homework assignments. Clearly, the movie's message is mostly about the dangers of extensive video gaming and the addictive nature of the way they detach us from reality. Movies do the same thing, but good movies cause you to use your mind, to think about things (much like good video games, and both are unfortunately rare). So this is not a new idea, but where the movie really suffers, aside from a lot of its stomach-turning imagery, is in the fact that it is lost in the wake of the massively superior Wachowski brothers film The Matrix, released the same month. Big movies have a tendency to arrive in pairs, and one always seems to be hugely superior to the other. Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact (the latter being the vastly superior, obviously), Antz and A Bug's Life, Volcano and Dante's Peak, etc. There was a big difference in likability between Antz and A Bug's Life rather than in quality, but in this case, while it has been hailed by many critics and fans alike, I found eXistenZ to push the envelope of bad taste past the breaking point and into the realm of weirdness with its often revolting mixture of ham-handed, graphic sexual imagery and what Roger Ebert described as showing `characters eating things that surgeons handle with gloves on.'

Unfortunately, I was given a video that was poorly structured, if not completely unstructured from the beginning.The basic idea behind the plot presents promise, but the execution was fundamentally flawed. I must say that most any high school kid with a camera could have made a more riveting presentation than the one that was thrust upon me via this film.Plot circles and confusion was the most prominent element of the show which didn't leave me with a big 'reveal' at the end of the film, but another corner around which nothing substantial could be found.I'm sorry Robert Lantos, you failed me.

But suddenly the test is interrupted by audience member that draws an odd looking gun and fires at the game designer Allegra Geller. She survives and along with assistant Ted Pikul flees out into the countryside. They can trust no one, and a contract on her head makes every stranger a possible murderer. Is the answer in the game? Comments Apparently a try for a movie that tries to be mysterious, deep and with several layers. Unfortunately the story is a complete failure, illogical, irregular and sketchy. Events happen without cause and as characters enters games within games; the plot does not become deeper, not more mysterious, and absolutely not better. Instead it becomes almost incomprehensible. When scenes don't connect to each other it is very hard to become interested and engaged in the movie, and I was not. And it does not get better when I sometimes felt that the movie was just an excuse to show blood and gore. Not from humans, no, but i form of living game pods. And I find it peculiar that a movie that sometimes show really good effects sometimes show some really bad, for example the pods.As for the cast, I think that they do their best, but when their characters change between themselves and forced game characters with it is hard to get some continuity and character development, or for that matter any unique identity.A movie that reached for the stars, but never left ground.3/10 "},{"Title":"Yuck","Date":"25 March 1999","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  Even for David Cronenberg, this one is off the charts.

It's not a comedy, though. In fact, it wants to be taken very seriously. I wanted to take it seriously, but I couldn't. I just couldn't. If you watch eXistenZ, you'll know why, and if you don't know why, then you should.First of all, let me be fair and start out by saying that the opening credits sequence is very cool. It may even fool you into thinking that you're watching a decent movie. Appearances by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe. Music by Howard Shore. Directed by the vaguely familiar name of David Cronenberg. Then the action begins, and you're ready for something cool to happen.But it doesn't. Okay, maybe there are a few scenes that hold your attention and that remind you that you're supposed to be watching a mind-bending thriller, and not a repeat from the first season of Farscape. From the very beginning, the viewer understands that there's nothing hip or stylish about this film at all. Instead, the new technology in the film involves mutated reptile body parts. Sounds funny, right? Oh, it is.The plot of the film involves a newly created virtual reality game that must be injected by some kind of umbilical cord-like mechanism into one's own back. The game cost millions of dollars to make, and the first testing begins, only to interrupted by an attempt to kill the game's creator, who also is at the game's first testing. The plot to kill the creator goes awry, a technician becomes the creator's protector, and the pair must enter the game to save the creator's disabled pod, a mechanism through which one enters the game. In other words, there is no plot. Then, after a short (thankfully) 90-some minutes, the film ends, and the ending tries to cover up any holes left in the plot.The acting is poor from the first scene to the last, with only a few scenes where any talent is displayed whatsoever. The talent is mostly provided by Jude Law, but his acting inexperience is obvious. Reactions seem forced, and every scene is either under-acted or over-acted with hardly anything in between. The screenplay is on the same level. There are formulaic lines like, trust no one, corny lines like, I like your script, and downright horrible lines like that's my pink phone. Add then some demented sexual double entendres, bad accents, and characters with no depth, and you have the essence of eXistenZ.As for those who would defend such a film, they would perhaps look at the concept of the thin line between virtual reality and reality, and would hold up Cronenberg's statement regarding the consequences of blurring that line. These things are interesting to me as well, but if only they could've been examined with more intelligence and finesse.It is quite funny, though, and if you're able to take science fiction TV shows seriously, then try this one on for size.Final Grade D.

This movie might be interesting if you are part of the video game culture, but if you are simply looking for an interesting movie to entertain you for an hour or so, Do Not watch eXistenZ. I frequently browse the shelves and find movies that I've never heard of which turn out to be fairly good entertainment. Two recent examples are Even Money, with Forest Whitaker and Northfork, with Nick Nolte. I'm sure these two movies must have been promoted and hyped in their day, but when I saw them on the store shelf, they did not ring a bell. They both turned out to be good for a short period of entertainment, but not life-changing experiences. The mention of the Matrix on the cover of eXistenZ is very misleading. I loved the original Matrix, but the sequels were disappointing. WARNING eXistenZ is not for casual entertainment.

I consider myself very versed in Sci Fi and Fantasy stories, and this by far was the worst in all aspects. The story just continually loops. The premise is interesting enough but is executed with flaw. It's as if Croneneberg wrote himself in to a corner he couldn't escape. Beyond the story the acting was horrific. You would think with the likes of William DeFoe there would be a single ray of sunshine. His character is so minute that it makes no difference. Jude Law barely covers his accent and Jennifer Jason Leigh is the typical conflicted mumbling character she always plays. I'm assuming this is some sort of 'indie' attempt at a Science Fiction movie. But I've seen home movies with better special effects. In fact I would rather watch a classic B movie such as Plan 9 from Outerspace or Buckeroo Bonzi in the 4th Dimension than have to sit through this snoozer again. If you really enjoy SciFi stay away from this one. If you can't resist this movie, watch it late at night on cable or let your buddy rent it. Don't waste your OWN money!

Oddball virtual reality game inventor Jennifer Jason Leigh goes on the lam with bodyguard Jude Law when she becomes the target of a band of killers hoping to sabotage her and her game. This leads to numerous sequences of watching the mopey Leigh express concern over and lovingly caress the fleshy organic unit which houses her game. Right from the set-up the film makes it clear that anything we see may not even be real. During the course of what we do see, Leigh and Law hook-up and enter her game once, and then apparently hook-up and enter her game AGAIN while already within the game - so it does not take much of a leap to figure that they may already be in the game prior to the start of the action the viewer witnesses. The film is dark, grungy, ugly to watch and contains not one sympathetic character with which to elicit your support. Even worse, this game that everyone seems so obsessed with is virtually incomprehensible, without a recognizable goal and one has a hard time believing anyone would want to play it, much less kill for it. If there were resistance fighters struggling to suppress it, all they would have to do is let a few gamers actually play it and they would walk away from it forever due to chronic boredom and confusion. And just in case anyone did not get Cronenberg's sledgehammer message of reality and fantasy being blurred, he makes sure that the last line in the film is of a bystander frantically questioning whether he is in the game or reality.

Seriously, I came to IMDb to read other user's reviews about this film. I was amazed that the user reviews claimed this movie was better than the Matrix. I decided to watch the movie and I regretted every moment of that decision. This film looks like a low budget movie from the 70's and that is actually giving it too high a mark. Some reviewer talked about special effects. Where? When? Should I have put on some 3D glasses or something? Because if you think this movie has special effects, then the only thing special here is you. This movie isn't even worth a free rental. If you really hate someone, buy them this movie as a gift for Christmas. "}]
