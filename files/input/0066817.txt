The actors are all wonderful, and Angela Lansbury, to me, will always be Miss Price. David Tomlinson is also wonderful as Professor Browne. The children are also great, with the standout being the youngest one, Paul. He has so many funny moments in this movie.Again, the Sherman Brothers lend their creative song-writing talents to this film with excellent results. The Age of Not Believing is wonderful, as is Eglantine, The Beautiful Briny and the superb Portobello Road number. The animation scenes are also great and imaginative.This is certainly an enjoyable film on many counts, and should be remembered just as so many of the other Disney classics. It should also be seen in the recently restored version, which runs over two hours. The story is more fluent in that version, and the songs are intact, for the most part. A great movie.

The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional. I adored the cyclical rendition of 'The old home guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which, though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of the Second World War worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.An often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!

Although it was already an old movie by the time I was able to watch it, Bedknobs and Broomsticks completely enchanted me.  People here who say that the movie would not hold the attention of a young child are mistaken. I must have watched this movie dozens of times between the ages of 1 and 10 and every time I watched it all the way though, intensely engrossed through every scene.  There are a handful of movies that hold very fond places in my childhood memories, this is one of them. It is a wonderful movie, and even now I still find the story charming. Angela Lansbury stars as Miss Price, a widow who is studying witchcraft through a correspondence course during World War II. She grumpily agrees to let three children board at her home in the country to keep them safe from the air raids going on in London. After the three children discover that Miss Price is an apprentice witch, they are swept up into a magical adventure on a traveling bed along with Miss Price and Professor Brown, the headmaster of the College of Witchcraft. The thing I like best about this movie, is that the magic never stops as the children along with the two adults journey to London, the Island of Naboomboo, Naboomboo Lagoon and Portabello Road. The children are treated to a marvelous adventure, flying through the skies on a bed, swimming underwater in a tropical lagoon, watching a football game played by animals and finally helping out in the war when Miss Price enchants a museum full of ancient suits of armor with the magic words, Traguna, Macoities, Tracorum Satis De.  The songs in the movie may be your typical musical-stock, but I challenge anyone to not tap their toes during Portabello Road, or to not get Englentine stuck in their head. They just add another element of fun and enjoyment to an already delightful movie. The movie is well worth watching, and suitable for any child. Even today's children will find delight in the cartoon/human relations and the spectacular ending sequence were empty suits of armor are brought to life to fight for the good guys. I consider this movie a timeless classic that shouldn't be passed up.

Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun.The special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids don't care too much about these things, so long as they are entertained. And entertained, they will be. With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect, and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.And besides, any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a 'Flash' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me.

The songs, by the Shermans, are in the main memorable - 'The Age of Not Believing', 'Portobello Road', 'Eglantine', and 'The Beautiful Briny'. Sterling support from David Tomlinson (who was also Mr Banks in 'Mary Poppins') and a trio of Cockney kids round off the movie.Miss Price - who has a scene-stealing cat who can put across disdain and embarrassment better than any human! - finds that the 'spells' she has received from Mr Brown's college of witchcraft actually work, much to his amazement when she speeds down to London to tell him so (on a bed, naturally - that's where 'The Age of Not Believing' comes in with great charm). She takes in Charlie, Carrie and cute little Paul as evacuees and win them over with her magic dabbling. Her goal is to find the spell for locomotion and this takes them to the evocative flea market of Portobello Road and on to the magical island where the cartoon part of the movie kicks in.The cartoons are inventive as always, although lacking the quality of the studio when Disney himself was in charge - there's a ballroom where the fish dance in various styles to a swing band and some jazzy singers (and are upstaged by the live action adults who win the dancing cup); then there is a great football match between creatures like hippos, elephants, ostriches, and the like with hapless Mr Brown as the referee. Special effects come into their own when inaminate objects start to have a life of their own (shades of 'Mary Poppins'), especially in the final sequences where an ancient army of knights and heralds take on the Nazis.'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' drags at times but when it is in full flow, it is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for kids of all ages, and all those Disney devotees out there.  "},{"Title":"Good Film. But Various Different Edits Taint its Enjoyment","Date":"5 December 2009","Score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Bedknobs and Broomsticks is often compared to Mary Poppins and rightfully so as both films have a similar story line. A magical nanny is sent to look after children, both have the same leading protagonist (David Tomlinson,) both feature live film and animation, with songs by the Sherman brothers, and both came out of the Walt Disney studio.Bedknobs and Broomsticks involves an apprentice witch who wants to complete her correspondence course in beginning witchcraft, but to do this, she has to search for a magical spell called Subsitutiary Locomotion which will complete her training. The story involves Angela Lansbury, playing the witch, who flies on a magical bed with Tomlinson and her three caretakers, to an animated land attempting to retrieve the spell. In addition, the film is set in World War II, where a mixture of live Nazi's and animated creatures both try to help and hinder Lansbury, Tomlinson, and the children on their adventures. The five characters control the bed through a magical bedknob that transports them from a reality world to a fantasy world and back again.Years ago, I had a record that had the Songs From Bedknobs and Broomsticks on it and loved it! However, when I saw the film on Turner Classic Movies and later researched it, sadly I learned that this film, which could have been a classic, suffers badly because of editing and failed restoration work.The original release of the film played in limited areas and ran about two and a half hours. Disney decided to make its first cuts to the film several months later when it went into wide release. The wide release version is what I saw on Turner Classic Movies. While this film was trimmed by over twenty minutes, most likely to cater to the shorter attention spans of children at the time of wide release, you can easily spot the edits. The Eglantine number is shortened, only a few words of With a Flair remain, The Old Home Guard seems to start in the middle of the second verse of the song, and the wonderful perhaps best song in the film A Step in The Right Direction is not there. However, you can hear the instances of the instrumental on the soundtrack.In 1979, the film was re-released again and ludicrously cut even more to about ninety five minutes. For years this is what was played on Standard Cable and Broadcast TV. Only two songs remain in this version. In 1996, Disney attempted to reconstruct the film, but were successful only in spots. About twenty minutes of footage was found and added back into the movie. However, the song A Step in the Right Direction was mysteriously not found and remains Lost. The audio track for the song was recovered, and you can hear this on the Special Edition DVD, with still shots from the film showing what the scenes looked like as the song was song.However, the discarded footage soundtrack was not recoverable, because it had been damaged or lost. Many actors were too old or had passed away and could not re-do their speaking and singing parts, so Disney had to hire extras to dub their voices over the restored footage. The dubbing is horribly bad, especially for the voice-over of one of the children, Charlie, and the voice-over for David Tomlinson, sounds nothing like him! You would think Disney could have at least found actors with voices that resembled the tones, accents, and pitches of the original dialog. It is great that several songs were recovered, but without Step in the Right Direction, restored back to the film, which is such an uplifting and encouraging song, and the terrible dubbing, the film will be a mixed bag.Why Disney cut Step in the Right Direction is criminal! I think Disney should have taken more time to look for it when they did the film restoration project for the 1996 DVD. What SHOULD have been shortened is the animated soccer match, which remains a sequence that does not help the film at all. The With A Flair song, as well as Eglantine are at their full lengths on the restored DVD, as is the Portobello Road dance sequence. However, some critics feel that the extended version of Portobello Road is too long. The restored DVD has a new song called Nobody's Problems For Me. My vote would be a choice of versions on a double-sided DVD for future release. Side 1 would contain the widespread DVD release that Turner Classic Movies plays. Side 2 would be the extended version, but WITH the originally undubbed dialog found and remastered with A Step in the Right Direction added in if it is ever found! The loss of Step in the Right Direction and the bad dubbing in the extended version hurts what could have been a great film. Bedknobs and Broomsticks has the important plot of searching for a missing spell. Tragically ironic that Disney took out bits and pieces of this film that may never be recovered. It is sad to think what this film could have been if the limited release had been LEFT ALONE!

BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS. That film too was a big success, and an Oscar winner (Best Actress for Julie Andrews). Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it, in a role wherein he learns about parenting. It is a fine mixture of live action and animation. It is set in a past period of British history (if not the Edwardian - Georgian world of 1912 London, it is England's coastline during the Dunkirk Summer of 1940). It even has old Reginald Owen in it, here as a General in the Home Guard, whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS. Ironically it was Owen's final role.The Home Guard sequences (not too many in the film) reminds one of the British series DAD'S ARMY, dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war. The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London. And (in typical Disney fashion) in the musical number Portobello Road different members of the British Army (including soldiers from India and the Caribbean (complete with metal drums yet!)) appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume.All of which, surprisingly, is a plus. But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury, her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it her sole real musical film lead. In a noteworthy acting career, Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did. She had been in singing parts (in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS, and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD, and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA, AND THE SANTA FE). But only here does she play the female lead. So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside.The rest of the cast is pretty good, Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure. The three children (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Weighill) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS (Weighill in particular, as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch). The only surprising waste (possibly due to cutting of scenes) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film. With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part. Also of note is John Ericson, as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film, only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside, and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking. As for the animation, the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon, and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view, with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee, and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages. As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studio's best work.

A woman, Eglentine Price, comes into the village to pick up a rather secret package and is stuck with the kids. They chug home on her motorbike.Miss Price's house is in the countryside. It looks like an ordinary old boring place to live. But one night, Miss Price opens that big package she got. It was a broomstick. She is taking a correspondance witchcraft course. Flying a broom is not the easiest thing in the world. I'm sure we've all tried. The children witness her flying and the four come to an agreement. Kind of a deal to seal a pact the honesty system.Miss Price would give the kids something valuable to hold because they're holding her secret and if they told, they'd have to give back the object. She uses a Traveling Spell on a bedknob that when it's placed on its bed, it can take one anywhere. Miss Price receives a telegram saying her witchcraft school is closing and will not be sending her the final spell for substitutionary locomotion. So she wants to go to London and find her instructor, Emelius Browne.          They go on the bed and soon arrive at their destination. They meet Emelius who's now a street magician. Miss Price explains what's up and must have that spell. Mr. Browne invites them to his new townhouse for supper and there, while Paul finds a book about the Isle of Naboombu, Miss Price and Mr. Browne find half of the spell book in the library. They try to find the other half at Portabellow Road, and run into conmen The Bookman and his assistant, the knife brandishing Swinburne. Bookman has the other half of the book. He's also looking for the spell. It's in neither book. Bookman tells the tale about the wizard who wrote the book Astroth. The tale tells about animals who act human and hold the five mystic words to the spell. So Ms. Price, Mr. Browne and the kids escape from the bad guys on the bed, and fly to the Isle of Naboombu. They have some musical fun in the lagoon and are fished out by a bear. They go to see the king, who's a lion with a bad temper and is wearing Astroth's star! The King chooses Mr. Browne to be his referee in a soccer game, because Mr. Browne bragged about being an excellent player of the sport. The animated animals played soccer like football! (In England, soccer is football). After the game, Mr. Browne cleverly snatches the star and return to home.          They try the substitutionary locomotion spell and things go flying around the room. Mr. Browne soon takes off. He claims he had things to do, but he was actually too much of a coward to actually make a commitment. That night, the Nazis attack and take Miss Price and the kids hostage. Mr. Browne returns and convinces Miss Price to try the spell out on a museum of medieval and colonial weaponry. It works! The empty suits and weapons make short-work of the German soldiers and they retreat.                   This is a good Disney movie, though I think it was aimed more at older audiences, despite it has a G rating. I mean, the content of this movie proves it was aimed at older audiences, like when Sam Jaffe and Bruce Forsythe are brandishing big knives at Miss Price and the others, and the cartoon animals were quite aggressive, when in other Disney movies, they're not. Plus there's gun play and the war topic. Other than that, it's okay. There's even a big animated bear, so the question here is where's Phil Harris?

In an attempt to be nice I got it for her a few years ago to watch at Christmas time but it sat unwatched until a miserable Bank Holiday Monday produced the urge to nest and just watch a couple of easy movies. As far as first impressions go, the film doesn't seem to feel any pressure to make a good one and if I'm honest I wondered if the opening credit sequence would ever end (a sequence that only has context once you have watched the film till the end). The titles rolls for at least five minutes without much to recommend them for and the film opens in much the same vein. Although there are some amusing moments and a bit of fantasy in the opening 20 or so minutes, it is slow and takes a while to get going. It doesn't help that the plot is a little vague and messy so that at one point I was neither sure why they were doing what they were doing, nor sure I particularly cared why they were doing it. This is a bit harsh perhaps &#x96; but I was thinking what children (not the most patient demographic) would be doing during this &#x96; in particular I was trying to think of any child I know who would be entranced by the Portobello Road song and dance number!It is still OK at this stage though and the good news is that it gets better with plenty of action, fun, invention and wit moving forward. The plotting is still a little bit hmm but it gets to where it is going thanks to the timely mini-invasion. The soccer match, the underwater musical number and of course the battle at the end are all great fun and I imagine children will enjoy them as much as I did (well, moreso probably). The old-fashioned feel is nice and I did like the sense of good clean family fun which the whole film had &#x96; although I'm not sure why the script calls for Paul to expressly refer to his knob so often; it is too deliberate and scripted to be merely something cynical modern ears pick up on. The pacing of the film is generally good as well but it is a little slower than it needed to be and I think being honest they could have had 15 minutes out of this without too much bother and it would have been a better film for it; not to say it is bad for the length, just that it doesn't always seem to need it.The cast are quite fun and all buy into the family tone. Lansbury in particular sells the role and works very well with Tomlinson in the adult roles. The children are a little annoying until you get used to them having the cockney turned up to 11 throughout; odd that neither of the boys ever did acting after this considering I liked them better than O'Callaghan's Carrie, who has less to do. Regardless they all work well and even when the animated sections turn up, the humans don't get lost in the fantasy but remain solid characters.Bedknobs and Broomsticks isn't brilliant but it is a solidly fun Disney family film. The majority of the musical numbers could have been better, the plot could have been stronger and the pacing/length trimmed to be slicker but it does all work, albeit not as well as it could have done. Enjoyable nonetheless with good wit and imagination &#x96; off-target Disney is still good after all.

That's probably because Walt was still alive and supervising the project when it was started in the early '60s. But there was a lot of work done on the project after his death, which probably explains why this attempt to recapture the Mary Poppins magic doesn't quite reach it.I saw the restored, 140 minute version. While I usually approve of restorations, I have to wonder if the 30 or so restored minutes really helped. For one thing, there is not much story in this long version, and frequently the little story there is comes to a screeching halt. Younger kids may also not understand the war theme that runs through the movie. There is also a curious matter-of-fact feeling to much of the movie, which means the feeling of magic is diminished. And what's up with the opening credits, that spoil what happens in the last part of the movie? Still, the acting is good, even with the child actors. There are some songs by the Sherman brothers that are pleasant to listen to, even if they don't match the greatness of the songs in Mary Poppins. And there are some good special effects, some of which are amazing even in this age of computer animation. But if you watch this movie, I suggest that you divide it up in chunks and take a break between chunks, so you won't get figety in your seat.

Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty apparent. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two Disney films.Like The Chronicles of Narnia it involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis the Rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. No retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the Pevensie kids.No heavy duty philosophy here from Walt Disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. She carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney couldn't top. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film.Two performers made their farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. And that grand character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Theme from Shaft. Personally though I do like David Tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of London streets, Portabello Road.Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years.

Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins.David Tomlinson, though he had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. Blustering, prim and proper Englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice.The dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture. I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can.Bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea.

The goal is to save England from the Nazis during World War II with the invention of a magic spell that will win the war--at least that's what the plot boils down to.When the rascally Cockney kids (three of them) discover that Eglantine Price (ANGELA LANSBURY, their house mother) is a Witch, they're interested in staying with her rather than running away. Like Mary Poppins, she leads them in a series of adventures over land and under the sea (The Beautiful Briny is one of the better animated underwater numbers with live action and animation combined seamlessly), but, and this is most unfortunate for a musical, none of the songs by the Sherman brothers have the lasting appeal of those in MARY POPPINS.Enjoyable fun for kids, but a bit overlong with some dull stretches.

I think the form of transportation they use is pretty original, traveling on a bed, and there is even a final battle, between Nazis and suits of armor led by Lansbury(no wonder the movie won best visual effects).

Miss Price is a more appealing character than the rather taciturn Mary Poppins, and although the subject matter is somewhat weighty - preventing a WWII German invasion - it is treated in a manner which should not alarm any small child at all.For children today, who are brought up on cartoon marvels like `Toy Story' and `A Bug's Life', the sequences melding cartoon and live action are still thoroughly convincing. There are a number of very hummable songs which deserve to be every bit as well known as `A Spoonful of Sugar' and the like.It's a terrible shame that the two young actors who play Charlie and his younger brother Paul do not seem to have done anything other than this film.

Thinking this footage was included as bonus material, I was dismayed to find out upon viewing the disc that these scenes had actually been edited back into the movie! While seeing the movie in this re-edited form was a curious novelty, once was enough. Not only did the footage make the already overlong story drag, but it did nothing to enhance the movie. To top it off, as the original soundtrack for these cuts was purportedly damaged or otherwise unavailable, the majority of the dialog in these scenes was redubbed by different actors (understandably - the movie IS over 25 years old). However, the dubbing is not only glaringly obvious (the voices don't even come close to matching those of the original actors) but poorly synced. So what was the point? This ruined the viewing experience for me totally. I feel these scenes should have been included as bonus material just as other DVDs include deleted scenes in segments separate from the main film. If the original footage had had its original audio intact, eliminating the need for dubbing, this new version would've been just a little more acceptable.

While I wouldn't want to see it shorter personally, it *is* true that the Portabello Road sequence goes on far too long, so much so that the kids grew antsy and were about to walk out on the film before that section finally finished.

Three children are placed out of harm's way in the country house of Eglantine Price. What they don't know is that Price is taking mail-order courses in witchcraft. Only, her lessons are cancelled before they are through and she has to find the professor (David Tomlinson, from Mary Poppins) and get the final spell in her training. This casts them on a journey for the missing part of the spell-book, an amulet with the words of the spell, and finally the necessity of using witchcraft in an attempt to foil a German invasion.Compared to Mary Poppins, B&B is weak. Standing alone, it fares much better. If you're one of those people who finds Angela Lansbury invariably shrill and annoying no matter what part she plays (as I do) your nerves won't settle soon because this is one of her most annoying performances. Even without comparison with Mary Poppins, the children in B&B are not charming; in fact, to a large extent, they are unnecessary. Three children is certainly overkill. David Tomlinson, who gave a memorable performance as Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins, here looks tired, but game. In a small part, the typically wonderful Sam Jaffe somehow breathes no life into the role of Mr. Bookman. The animation is good. The FX may perhaps have been good for 1971 (and for children) but they're hopelessly antiquated these days, especially the bed sequences.The music is iffy, with a sound imitative of Mary Poppins. The best number, Portobello Road, has the feel of the Sherman Bros. trying to duplicate their success with Chim-chim-che-ree, but its tune is quite good without the comparison. The second-best song was apparently a Poppins cast-off, and sounds like it.For people who found Mary Poppins episodic, B&B has a cohesive, scavenger-hunt plot with plenty of suspense as the characters blunder from thing they need to achieve to the next. The story seems to have little correlation to the source book, which I read many times as a child, but it does hold together. As a Mary Poppins wannabe, B&B is an utter failure. On its own merits, it does have enough to recommend it to keep the children occupied for a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon. But only if they can stomach Angela Lansbury that long.

Thus, I was plunged into a movie I'd seen in bits and pieces many times but never all the way through. It felt like catching up with a school colleague you never much cared for after many years. Despite desperately trying to recreate the runaway success of Mary Poppins, this film is drab by comparison and uninteresting for the most part and it only really comes to life towards the end.Somewhere along the south coast of England in 1940, three children are evacuated from London to the relative safety of the countryside. Eldest Charlie (Ian Weighill), sister Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan) and youngest Paul (Roy Snart) find themselves temporarily living with the unusual Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) who turns out to be an apprentice witch working on a secret spell for the war effort. But after her magic correspondence course is cancelled due to the war, she and the children make off after Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson) back in London, who is revealed to be a charlatan trickster. So when nefarious forces conspire to acquire the spell before Miss Price, the four of them must work together to complete the spell and fight off the incoming forces of Nazi Germany.For the longest time, Bedknobs and Broomsticks feels like an unusual trip through the history books. Aside from the trippy effects of the magic, the film appears drained of colour and mostly shot at night. Children's films are meant to be bright, noisy and fun but this is anything but. And although the song-and-dance routines are performed with plenty of gusto, the acting is very one-dimensional. All the child actors seem to have learnt their accents from the Dick Van Dyke School of Cockney (Cor blimey, guv'nor!, Stone the bleeding crows!, that sort of shtick) while Lansbury and Tomlinson perform with a certain resigned attitude. It's only when they travel to the island of Naboomba and the film introduces its animated section that things improve dramatically. It becomes genuinely funny, almost jarringly bright and is much more imaginative and creative than anything else in the movie. Technically, the film is a triumph of effects and animation as Tomlinson's character ends up refereeing a 'soccer' game (whatever that is) between the islands anthropomorphic inhabitants.But all too quickly, the scene ends and we return to the perpetual night of sleepy England where the Nazi's - almost completely ignored by the film up to this point - turn up for the unlikely climax. It's unfair to call the film a disappointment because it isn't - the songs are first class (I was still singing The Beautiful Briny at work the next day!) and the animation sequence is one of Disney's very best and most comical. But it is inevitably compared to the aforementioned Mary Poppins and that is like sending a gerbil to battle against a pack of hungry lions. Indeed, it's no stretch of the imagination to picture Julie Andrews sailing into the air on a broomstick instead of Angela Lansbury, especially with Tomlinson in the movie. On its own merits, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an entertaining (if somewhat slow) movie for kids who will find their attention wandering before the cartoon section pulls them back in. But in an ironic twist, this movie about a trainee witch sorely lacks the magic and energy of Mary Poppins and should have proved to Disney that lightning doesn't always strike twice.

By the late 60s Disney had refined the formula of epic family film to the point of perfection, and Bedknobs and Broomsticks emerges as the pinnacle of that particular style of filmmaking, while having another foot firmly planted in the later, more progressive part of the century.Angela Lansbury is stellar in the lead role, vulnerable yet charismatic, she grounds this whimsical film in reality. Tomlinson too is superb, as a suave hack with a heart of gold, and his chemistry with Lansbury, along with some crafty writing, makes for some surprising reversal of gender expectations. The film skips from one crafty set-piece to another, and while the tension between adult characters and the mature context to the plot will keep adults enthralled, the mad animated segment Island of Nabumboo will have the younger crowd hooked. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is often compared to the earlier Disney hit Mary Poppins, and at first glance the similarities are quite obvious. Live action mixed with animation? Check. Incredibly quotable and memorable musical numbers? Check. British setting? Check. David Tomlinson? Check. By now you might have decided that it's hardly worth investing in the former if you've experienced the latter, more highly esteemed classic that it is. And yet...Decades have been less kind than one might think to Mary Poppins, hampered as it is with a rushed third act, overly long chimney-sweep set-piece and an unbearable performance from Dick van Dike. Bedknobs... emerges as the more sophisticated and narratively polished of the two with more grounded and likable heroes. Is it worth your time? Yes, and then some! "}{"Title":"A Mary Poppins like classic","Date":"7 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Frequently compared to Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is in many ways similar. Robert Stevenson directs once more, David Tomlinson is back, the tone is in the same vein and animation plus live-action is blended at times. I did have reservations going in that it would attempt to copy the magic of Mary Poppins instead of making its own style. But that is not to dismiss the film as a lesser copy of the classic, as it is easily one of Disney's best live-action pieces.The film is set in 1940, were three evacuees are sent to live with Eglantine Price who turns out to be an apprentice witch. When Miss Price receives a letter that her witchcraft college is closing down and not giving her the last key spell, she and the children head to London via her bed to find the headmaster. He claims that the spell is missing and the five of them have to set off to locate it in order to use it to help the war effort. The story itself is packed with fun and interest, it might seem a bit silly but it is played so serious that it forces you to take it that way. A lot of time is invested into making the storyline more gripping and I really like how they incorporate the war into events instead of just having it in the background as it becomes a centre part of the film.The film is definitely pushed further by its two leads who share an excellent chemistry and it is hard to find more likable actors. Angela Lansbury is absolutely wonderful as trainee witch Miss Price, bringing massive amounts of charm and touches of class to the role. She did a great job in making Miss Price stern but still very caring, she comes across as a very warm person and that makes her very easy to gravitate towards. David Tomlinson is equally brilliant as Mr. Browne. He clearly puts as much energy as he can into the role and he turns Browne from wayward conman into a very loving figure, whilst he also handles the physical and comedic elements of the role superbly. Simply put Tomlinson is just a joy to watch on screen. Once again the songs are very enjoyable thanks to the Sherman Brothers, and that it from someone who normally dislikes singing in films. The songs themselves are very well written and always catchy, with some fantastic vocal performances from the actors. I especially enjoyed the robust 'Portobello Road' and the very amusing 'The Beautiful Briny'. Even the more comical based songs are a lot of fun such as 'Eglantine'. The animation used also leads to a lot of fun moments. It doesn't take anything away from the films story and, again much like 'Mary Poppins', it feels like a real addition to the story by showing the audience the magical elements that lie below. The mixture of the two does look a bit dated now, but I believe that this only adds to the appeal and feels like a nice throw-back Disney's animated films of the time. The animated creations such as King Leonidas are a lot of fun and it all offers a great leeway in too some very funny physical comedy. The animation allows for some great slapstick and a lot of humorous little pieces, even managing to get David Tomlinson involved. Actually the humour in general is great, Miss Price's easily agitated cat is always worth a giggle and Mr. Browne's poor attempts at winning over an audience get a good laugh. There are some very memorable sequences and images in the film. The whole idea and image of the bed being used for transport is really clever, and though the effects look a bit dated it is an enchanting viewing experience. Two scenes do really stand-out to me. The football game involving the animated animals is brilliant, again it is bursting with energy and contains some really amusing slapstick moments. The whole climax is very well done too. The suits of armour coming to life is a really distinctive image and the build-up to this battle with the Nazis does surprisingly have a rather epic feel to it.Adding to this I think the film as a whole has a very strong charm to it, much in a way of its usually compared Mary Poppins. It is a film that is a lot of fun to watch and just let the magic carry you away. Location wise the film is also brilliant, the village used looked wonderfully authentic and the visit to the London streets allows for some really well-used imagery. Was there any weak points? It might just be me but I don't enjoy the three kids that much. They're okay and do their decent jobs with the roles but they are not as charming or memorable as other aspects of the film are. Roddy McDowall feels kind of wasted too seeing as he is only in two scenes and maybe you could say that the climax makes a mockery of the Nazis, but it is all in the name of fun so it doesn't harm the film too much.So on the whole Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an extremely well made and charmingly entertaining film from Disney. The comparisons to 'Mary Poppins' are very understandable, but thankfully the film doesn't cave in and become too much like that film as it feels like its own story. I still feel that the film is slightly under-appreciated in the Disney terms, it deserves more praise for what it does because what's good is really good. As said Lansbury and Tomlinson are superb leads, the story is very engaging, the songs are memorable and there's plenty of comic pieces thrown in too. It truly is a captivating and entertaining film. "},{"Title":"Somewhat magical and fun.","Date":"4 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" This movie has been compared to Mary Poppins as it features a nanny of some sorts who possesses magical powers and is assigned to babysit some children. However, I think it stands well on its own and it is somewhat more entertaining that Mary Poppins was. The plot is set in World War II England, where apprentice witch Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) journey, with orphans Charlie, Carrie and Paul, to meet Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), headmaster of the Correspondence College of Witchcraft. There, Miss Price tells Mr. Browne of a plan to find the magic words for a spell known as Substitutiary Locomotion, which brings inanimate objects to life.There are tons of songs in this movie, and my favorites include the solemn but meaningful Age of Not Believing, the mysterious Portebello Road, the whimsical and fun Beautiful Briny Sea and the catchy Substitutiary Locomotion. Angela Lansbury sang a large number of the songs and her beautiful singing voice made the music that much more enjoyable. I also enjoyed the combination of live action with animated sequences - cleverly done special effects, especially the under the ocean sequence.Unlike Mary Poppins, I thought the overall movie was somewhat more entertaining. While the film is saturated with songs, there are a lot more adventurous scenes such as the flying bed, royal court, the under the sea and climatic soldier battle sequences. The acting was more believable and less childishly annoying compared to Dick Van Dyle's character in Mary Poppins. And, Miss Price (Lansbury) took on a more nurturing role than Julie Andrews did with her Mary Poppins character and seemed to care for the children more. However, I do find the bratty Charlie character very teeth-cringing.Overall, this is a song-saturated movie and has its boring moments, but kept mostly pretty entertaining with the many uses of magic, good vs. evil aspects and imagination.Grade B- "},{"Title":"Not as good as 'Mary Poppins' but it still has top-notch music and animated sequences","Date":"4 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" I vaguely remember seeing bits of this film as a child and teenager, either in the film itself or in its trailer. Watching this in full for probably the first time today gave me the opportunity to write my first IMDb review of 2014 (the last review I wrote in 2013 was for 'Mary Poppins,' which this film has similar elements to) but most importantly to jot down some ideas for my written university assignment on how London has been portrayed in the history of film. Not a lot of this film takes place in or refers to London, just the children having evacuated from there and wanting to return, the Portobello Road scene and Professor Browne mentioning he used to play for Tottenham Hotspur, a popular London football team.Over to the film itself. I liked the medieval-style opening credit sequence (because I recently researched medieval art as part of another university assignment) and some of it reminded me of the Bayeux Tapestry. The technicolor cinematography is just as vivid as that in 'Mary Poppins' and the special effects are decent; however the backgrounds shown during the first bed flight were a little on the garish side despite some impressive uses of scanimation. The incidental music has the same nostalgic feel as that in 'Mary Poppins' with some whimsical and authentic hints although some parts of it sounded a bit like one of the instrumental arrangements of 'Spoonful of Sugar.' My favourite songs here are 'Portobello Road' and 'The Beautiful Briny Sea,' which lyrically reminded me of 'Under the Sea' from 'The Little Mermaid.' The other songs were pleasant if not as memorable as the two I've already mentioned. I liked the animated segments. Although they had that typical sketchy look of Disney animations from the 1960s to the 1980s, I recognised parts of the underwater scene from when they accompanied 'The Codfish Ball,' a song from 'Disney Sing-Along-Songs The Little Mermaid,' alongside clips from the classic Silly Symphonies cartoon 'Merbabies.' While I'm not particularly a fan of football, the football match was comical in spite of its elephant-afraid-of-mouse cliché. Some of the dialogue was over-familiar but some of it was funny albeit Paul's line It's got nothing to do with my knob' being unintentionally funny and easy to misinterpret although he was actually referring to the magical bedknob. Angela Lansbury was charming and witty as Miss Price while David Tomlinson, who I recognised as Mr. Banks from 'Mary Poppins,' was more fun-loving than he was in said title and the children provided some amusement and adventure to the story. If I could point out any other flaws, these would be the German soldiers' dialogue not being entirely subtitled and the climax being overlong despite the creativity of army uniforms and suits of armour moving. While one reviewer found the ending hard to understand at first, I believe Paul wanted more adventures on bed to again escape from boredom and the war. Although I have compared this to 'Mary Poppins' as did other reviewers, I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the former but the animation, funny moments and music made this film worthwhile. 8/10. "},{"Title":"From Portabello Road to the Beautiful Briny Sea, Angela will take you past the age of Not Believing.","Date":"28 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" There's more charm to this Disney musical than has been given credit for, even though a huge fan base obviously exists for it. The film was overshadowed by the memory of Disney's previous big movie musical where another British actress (Julie Andrews) shot to super-stardom playing a nanny with extraordinary powers. Here, Angela Lansbury is a wanna be witch who ends up in charge of three kids against her will and assists the British in fighting the Krauts of World War I with the help of her own magic powers.The same song-writing team of Robert and Richard Stevenson have created an equally engaging score, and I think it even tops the one for Mary Poppins. Lansbury wins your heart immediately when she berates her cranky charges for being past that Age of Not Believing then takes them onto a magical journey into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean and into a magical island with its own Lion King and a horde of eccentric soccer playing animals, all with the assistance of her witch professor phony David Tomlinson.More eccentric than his disciplining father from Mary Poppins, Tomlinson is more than welcomed back and a great co-star for Lansbury. He is hysterically funny in the partly animated soccer match where he is the referee and takes more than his share of abuse from this mythical animal kingdom. Fresh from her success as Broadway's Mame (with a few flops in between that have become cult classics thanks to her presence in them), Lansbury proves herself worthy of the movie musical, having been sadly dubbed most of the time when she was at MGM during their heyday.There's a bit of a Harry Potter and Wicked feeling to this story with quite the influence of the late 60's/early 70's Broadway feel in the live-action musical numbers. The lyrics are cleverly difficult to sing along with and may have you laughing as you try, especially the final number where Lansbury gets her witchcraft right in aiding a museum filled with ancient war artifacts to take on the German army.Another Mary Poppins veteran is back, Lansbury's old MGM co-star Reginald Owen, in one of his final appearances, and Roddy McDowall is amusingly effete as the British preacher who keeps popping in to check on the kiddies. Disney would obviously be influenced by this many years later when making their modern day musical classics such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast (by casting Lansbury in a key role) and The Lion King. "},{"Title":"Dated Fantasy Flick's Finale Too Fast","Date":"11 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" For myself as a boy, this movie's closing scenes with the ghostly army using nothing but Medieval weapons to battle and repulse an attempted Nazi landing in England during World War Two is one of the most lasting images in my mind. However, as an adult watching it today, it comes off as less magical with the horribly dated special effects. Overall, the movie has actually stood the test of time, still enchanting whole new generations of young children. Angela Lansbury as a young actress is charming and attractive, and David Tomlinson is a bit more animated and puckish that he was in Mary Poppins, which this movie seems to be riding. The notable parallels between the two movies are obvious, but then it is quite clear that the two movies share much of the same production team members. Mostly for laughs, the film has very few scary scenes, and the aforementioned scene does not much more than walk and march except for a select few swinging swords and maces. There's a decent horror movie here once the Disney ingredients are removed. The songs, as effervescent as they are, are not nearly as infectious as the tunes from Mary Poppins, and Roddy McDowell, who was quite a popular British actor for the time, sadly, gets very little to do in this movie. I don't get how destroying her research robs Lansbury's character of her mystical powers, but I just wish the movie had lasted just a bit longer to reveal the clean-up of the countryside to retrieve the museum artifacts and period costumes now mysteriously damaged and bullet-ridden and scattered through the woods. I mean, come on, how did they explain that? "},{"Title":"Aging Special Effects and Uneven Script","Date":"21 August 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" At the time, this dazzling display of live action and animation must of been quite a treat for its audience, receiving an Oscar award for best special effects. Alas time has not been kind to this heavily special effects dependent movie which is also weighed down by an uneven script. The director was able to balance this movie's genre or tone - was this to be a musical or just family comedy or drama. This movie appears to have ignored the director's own magical success of Mary Poppins (1964) released seven years earlier. Like Sean Penn directing Into the Wild (2007), director Robert Stevenson perhaps let success go to his head, or maybe insecurity by focusing so much on special effects and musical numbers that the story itself sometimes became secondary to the showing off the supposed brilliance of the animations. For example, Emelius fades almost into insignificance during the soccer game, or the primary characters are lost in the overly crowded and extended dance routine in the town. Even the television episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Once More, With Feeling (2001) displays how to both enhance the storyline and the characters with music instead of hiding them and ignoring the story. Cool World (1992), Jim Carrey's The Mask (1994), Monkey Bones (2001) all built on the break out live animation film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). But even back in 1964, Arthur Lubin known for televisions series Mr. Ed and The Addams Family directed a neat live animation mixture with Don Knott's in The Incredible Mr. Limpet. Overall, what once was a new and delightful children's film has aged and not well.

Even one of the actors, David Tomlinson, is borrowed from Poppins. Yet Disney's attempt to strike gold twice fails. The pacing is much slower, particularly on the restored DVD release in which 30 minutes of footage cut from the theatrical release are reinserted. The songs are bland affairs that Tomlinson and Angela Lansbury meander through without much energy. During the animation sequence, the live actors are sidelined for an interminable soccer match between lions, alligators, and bears. These animal drawings are templates lifted from Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), and they would be recycled again in the studio's Robin Hood (1973). The final act of Bedknobs, though it comes too late and lasts too long, does partly redeem it special effects steal the show as an army of English museum pieces, mainly empty suits of medieval armor, come to life and march against the most incompetent Nazi invasion force in screen history. It would be better to YouTube that sequence than to sit through the movie to get to it. "},{"Title":"Honestly runs better in the standard cut","Date":"17 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Though far from perfect, Bedknobs and Broomsticks has always been a favourite of mine since childhood. The plot may be a bit muddled in places, but the sheer joy and fun of the fantasy material makes up for it. The animated sequences in particular are a real joy, as is the comedy-action climax to the film. Some of the songs are underrated classics, in particular The Age of Not Believing and The Beautiful Briny. Also, the elaborate opening credit sequence is gorgeous to look at.That said, you may want to be careful which version of the film you see. The film premiered at around 135 minutes, but was cut down for general release to 117 minutes. This 117 minute version was the one I first saw as a child. In 1996, Disney restored the film to a length comparable to the premiere version, and this is what was released onto DVD. Ironically, I think the film does run better at a shorter length. Much of what is added are new or extended musical numbers, as well as the extension of a rather superfluous subplot involving a somewhat saucy vicar. I don't particularly find the new musical numbers that engaging, and the numbers that are extended aren't that great. Though there are some interesting extra verses in the extended Portobello Road number, the several dance scenes added to it renders it seemingly unending. Eglantine also goes on a bit too much for my liking. In addition some re-dubbing was required for some of the new scenes as the original mastertracks were not found. Angela Lansbury was able to come back and sounds fine, but many of the other actors weren't and the results are mixed.It would be nice if an inevitable Blu-Ray showed the film in either two of its versions, or if at least the original dialogue tapes were found for the extended scenes. I do believe that there are still ways to get hold of the 117 minute version. I have the first UK DVD release from around 2002, but I have read on Amazon that a later UK release has the film run at 117 minutes in order to align itself with some old European dubs on the disc, and I've also read online that TCM in the US sometimes shows the shorter version. In any case, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun, family classic and easily worthy of my recommendation.

Yes, war is a strong feature - but there are covert references to war and violence in a lot of children's films - Mulan? For me, this is an ideal children's film - there is such a sense of escapism involved, whilst at the same time there is no attempt made to conceal that bad things do happen in life.The moral of this story, in my opinion, is that in the face of adversity there is always hope, and in hope there is strength to face the enemy. Whatever form that enemy might take - kids have far superior imaginations than adults and I don't believe that they would take a negative message from a film like this.

Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer. It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again. Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing. The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality. The effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the home army. The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque.

It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of England.It also combines very well live-action and animation. The animation itself is, of course, pretty good. The animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film Robin Hood and the same can be said about the animated characters there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in Robin Hood. Besides, the King (a lion) seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear does look like Little John.This movie is often compared to Mary Poppins with a reason. Both combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and a magical woman. The kids (Carrie, Charlie and cute little Paul) are a bit like the Banks children. Both movies were directed by Robert Stevenson and both cast David Tomlinson. However, instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. With its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to Harry Potter's stories.The majority of the songs are good. The Age of Not Believing and The Beautiful Briny Sea are the very best. Portobello Road is nice too.David Tomlinson is great in this film once again. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a boy in «the age of not believing») and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul.I like the black cat. It's pretty cool. It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series Sabrina, the teenage witch. I find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love them! Even funnier is whenever Professor Emelius Browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he's transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache.Overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad. The first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. The ending, however, is weak. That's my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling.

Miss Price is an apprentice witch who was studying witchcraft by correspondence through a school, run by Emelius, but the last course can't be offered because half of the book is missing, and the part that's missing contains the most important spell of all. The idea is pretty good, but the movie unfortunately - in a whole lot of ways - just goes on to offer too much of a lot of things.First, this is really three movies in one in a sense. The first part I thought had the most promise. This deals with Miss Price's need to take the last course. She's sort of a witch without the ability to do everything she'd like to do. This was a pretty amusing family sort of comedy, with Miss Price playing a character similar to (but not as outrageous or as incompetent as) the character of Aunt Clara in Bewitched. The movie then becomes a sort of kiddie cartoon, though, and the magic bed on which the gang travels takes them to an animated fantasy land ruled by cartoon animals (the words for the spell Miss Price needs are on a necklace worn by the king of the animal land - whose name I forget, and I mean both the land and the king.) The live action/animation blend is pretty well done, but I didn't think this storyline fit well at all with either what came before or what comes after. The third part of the movie has Miss Price using her witchcraft (which she's now more adept at because she learned the spell) to help fight off a Nazi invasion of England (the movie is set in 1940.) This third part might have made an interesting more adult oriented comedy, perhaps in the nature of The Russians Are Coming ... but, again, it seemed disconnected from everything else in the movie.The other thing I noticed was that a few scenes were really overdone. The song and dance scene on Portobello Road comes to mind. I thought it would never end. Song and dance scenes in this kind of movie can work well (as in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for example) but they can also be overworked, and that was the case here. Then there was the soccer game with the animated animals. Cute for maybe 30 seconds but, again, it just never seemed to end, and the players just did the same things over and over again, so that what humour there was in it quickly faded away.As I said, Lansbury and Tomlinson were quite good, and all three separate stories had potential, but they just didn't fit together all that well. Woefully underused in the film was Roddy McDowall, by the way.5/10 "},{"Title":"Magic on the screen","Date":"9 August 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  A great movie.

And so I had a little trouble understanding, when I told my father that he might have enjoyed it if only he'd come with us, why my mother gave him a weary nod and told him maybe he didn't need to rush to the theater. Well, I just finished watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks again, 33 years later, and I think I know now how my mother felt. It was only out of a sense of duty that I stuck through it to the end. My two children were watching.If you're above the age of twelve or so, there must be a better way to spend your time. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a perfect example of everything that went wrong at the Disney studio in the late sixties and the early seventies, an incompetent piece of movie-making that seems to have been shot from a first draft of the script, before anyone had a chance to think about it. Some people seem to think that the problem is the Disney restoration -- the 139 minute version now available on DVD. This restoration adds 22 grueling minutes to the running time of the theatrical version. I have to think that it must have been excruciating to adults even in its shorter incarnation. It seemed to me that the movie could have been cut to half its length, and nothing would have been missed. Though no amount of cutting could have made it a good movie.The problem isn't just that the musical numbers seem to go on forever, though they do, especially the restored Portobello Road sequence. The problem is that the story really doesn't hang together, and the characters are poorly drawn. In the amount of time that David Tomlinson spends on screen, we might have gotten a deeper look at a man whose life really has had no meaning, and for whom the con provides the only thrill. (His opening musical number provides a hint of that idea, without really presenting it in a coherent way.) We might have gotten a sense of Angela Lansbury's loneliness, and the desire that led her to enroll in a correspondence course in witchcraft. These are the sorts of ideas that can be conveyed by a line or two, an odd facial expression -- in other words, the sort of subtext we expect a competent movie to deliver. But here there's not even a hint.The cartoon sequence halfway through the movie is utterly no fun whatever, and ultimately it makes no difference to the plot. A mystery is solved during the first 90 minutes or so of the movie, but this problem-solving element of the story is presented without any sense of mystery, and the solution arrives so perfunctorily that it makes the viewer think the last 60 minutes or so have been a waste.I'm not saying this is the worst of Disney's late-sixties, early-seventies product. When I was a kid, I never did get around to seeing The Boatniks or Superdad, not that I plan to seek out the opportunity at this late date. But I did see most, if not all of the rest of Disney's output during that period, and I can definitely say this one approaches the Pete's Dragon standard of wretchedness, without quite surpassing it. It definitely provides spirited competition for The Black Hole.The movie might be worth watching, I suppose, as an example of the depths to which the Disney studio sank in the fifteen years or so after Uncle Walt died. But remember -- the 139 minutes you spend with this movie are 139 minutes you'll never get back.

This adaptation of Mary Norton's book, which the studio hoped would emulate their Mary Poppins (with a touch of Oliver! tossed in), incorporates animation into the live action à la Poppins, but the film's messy structure, beleaguered narrative, poor songs and poor child actors hinder the results. Angela is in fine form playing a good-hearted apprentice witch in World War II England who helps defend her country against the invading Germans; her inherent persnickety charm is smoothed out here, and she's relaxed in a lower-key when its called for, even making some of the sugary songs tolerable. David Tomlinson (acting befuddled, like John McGiver's grandfather) is a weak love-interest for her however, and the orphans whom Angela takes in are the most cynical bunch of tots I've seen in some time (even after witnessing Lansbury's magic, they still can't register awe--only wisecracks).

This isn't a bad thing, though, considering most of Disney's other films are far superior to this overlong production. Lacking any excitement, or even laugh-worthy humor, Bedknobs And Broomsticks has little appeal to those over the age of 10, and even the youngest will likely be bored by the constant chatter and uninventive musical numbers. Three children named Carrie, Charlie and Paul are temporarily adopted by Eglantine Price, whom they discover to be a witch. Ms. Prince gives the children a traveling spell, in exchange for keeping her secret, which allows their bed to teleport to any given location. The four also snag Emelius Browne- Ms. Price's witch teacher- into the adventure as well. As one would expect, there are countless plot holes and silly things that are overlooked by the characters, but this is the least of the film's problems. Bedknobs And Broomsticks runs for a taxing two and a half hours. Had Bedknobs And Broomsticks been truly entertaining, this would not be a problem. Another Disney musical, Mary Poppins has a run time around the same length, and is loved and adored by all ages. Needless to say, Bedknobs And Broomsticks is no Mary Poppins. The content of this dull musical, does not justify the relentlessly long length. The number of songs in the film are not nearly as high as that of Mary Poppins, but they are far less inventive. Despite being penned by the Sherman brothers, the same duo that wrote the songs in Mary Poppins, each and every number is dull to limit. Occasionally, dancing takes place during these numbers, though the choreography is poor and uninspired. What's strange is that the beat of the music, often does not meet the beat of the dancing, which seems truly lazy. The score, also by the Sherman brothers isn't too shabby, and the bed traveling theme is relatively strong, but the score often sounds too similar to the Mary Poppins score (especially in the earlier segments). Also, if you hate bagpipes, you will definitely want to avoid this, as the aforementioned instruments make more than one appearance. Bedknobs And Broomsticks is specifically known for the Land of Naboombu, which is completely animated. It's always a marvel to see live-acted characters interact with animated ones. Alas, despite being showcased as the main attraction in Bedknobs And Broomsticks, the Land of Naboombu occupies a measly 30 minutes of the extensive run time. Talk about misleading! Special effects often look dated, and the strings that are used to suspend objects in midair are clearly visible most of the time. There are some decent effects though, make no mistake about it. But not all of the effects are as polished as others. The children are poorly acted, and most other actors fall into the unspectacular area. Only Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson stand out. Bedknobs And Broomsticks is wholly unspectacular. It lacks the humor and excitement it needed to translate into the fun adventure it fails to be. Add that with the overlong run time and the dull musical numbers, and you get a animated musical that is unlikely to leave anyone coming back for more.

Englantine Price (the lovely Angela Lansbury), a somewhat eccentric single woman who keeps to herself, is somewhat forced to temporarily house three orphaned siblings. They suspect that Ms. Price is up to something strange. And actually, she is. Ms. Price is studying to be a witch, oddly (and funny) enough through a correspondence school for withcraft, taught by Professor Emelius Brown (the wonderful David Tomilson). Ms. Price is determined to prove to the Rawlins kids (the orphans) that she is no hack, but really does know magic. When, Paul finds a lose knob on the bed, Ms. Price puts a spell on it, and the four travel through space (but not outer space, more like a depletion of matter in one place and then recovery of matter to another) to visit Professor Brown so that she can find the missing half of an ancient book of witchcraft which is necessary to complete her most valued spells.Professor Brown turns out to be something of a fraud, but offers to help Ms. Price find the missing part of the book. So, they travel with this bed all over the place looking for book, even getting threatened with death if they did not forfeit their half of the book to an old man who had the other half. Brown and Price are ready to give up, thinking it is hopeless to find this one very incredible spell with the other half of the book not yet recovered. Until they find the Island of Naboomboom, which is an animated island of animals who love football (these are some of the greatest scenes). The Lion, king of the jungle and the island, wears a priceless pendant around his neck that contains the spell. And both Price and Brown have to figure how they're finally going to get a hold of the spell and hang on to it for once. The importance of the spell why it's going to help the British fight the invading Nazi's and win the war! And wait till you see how it's done. Some really magnificent special effects for it's day as inanimate objects come to life. The story itself is a wonderful adventure, being able to magically travel just using a bed and a knob.

Some of the moments where Ms. Price tests her witchcraft skills is really funny. Younger children will likely appreciate it alone for the mixed live-action/animation sequences. And I think that all of the music in the film is fantastic as well. It really is one of the best family films Disney ever made. As others have commented, the remastered version does no justice to the original film. Though you do get extra music numbers, there are many remastered elements that befoul the movie. Most notably, the redubbed voices for Charlie and Professor Browne don't match. Charlie's redubbed lines sound like they were done a four year old kid while Tomilson's redubbed singing parts sound like Danny Elfman's exaggerated speaking manner from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Catch the film in its original form, if you can. It is still a highly enjoyable film nonetheless. (My vote of 8/10 stars is for the original version...I'd say 6/10 for the remastered).

Another one of those movies where if you didn't enjoy it, you didn't understand the plot because you were smoking bad drugs or you didn't pay much attention while washing the dishes because you thought this is a kids movie.  When producers get together and review a script to make sure it works well and is entertaining, and then cast together a great team of actors and actresses you understand where movie classics are made.  Bedknobs & Broomsticks falls along this category.  Bringing alive rich color and inventive animation(both in cartoon and animatronic) with a plot that truly invites imagination for all ages.  During the Nazi invasion of England, a group of orphans are dropped off by mistake to the custody of an amateur witch.  The children discover Ms. Price's secret and the excitement begins when she takes the children along to find out the missing final lesson to her correspondence witching course.  This final lesson helps them drive the German intruders back to the ocean.A musical and entertaining film for the whole family that will have children singing and dancing.  This is a wonderful addition to any movie collection. "},{"Title":"I liked it.

World War II may or may not have been the right decision, but do we need to keep bringing up past wars? especially where children are concerned. nobody wants World War III here. that would be madness.do i like this movie? of course i do. i grew up with this film and it's always been a Disney favorite of mine. it's beautifully handled by director Robert Stevenson, it's very clever, and has a charming musical score by Disney song writers, the Sherman Brothers. the film has many smart insights into history and sometimes i think this film may be more about children than anything else. but every time i get too sentimental and cozy about this film i wake up and think, oh God! THIS IS ABOUT WAR! nobody in their right brain wants a frick'in WAR!as far as the witchcraft element? i said what i think of that. there ain't no such thing and if you believe it's real YOU ARE STUPID. as a Christian does it scare me? oh sometimes i get superstitious and then i wake up. i used to follow astrology in the newspaper and read my horoscope everyday to see if i could find out anything. do you know what happened? absolutely nothing. half the time the stupid horoscope seemed like it was speaking to someone else. hardly any of the advice changed or helped my life in anyway. it just made me believe in silly things.but there are evil, stupid people out there with very little education who actually believe in magic. and it doesn't help that the witchcraft in 'Bedknobs' is far more real than the silly 'Harry Potter' films. i mean 'Astoroth' was a famous occultist and some of the incantation words (though not many) are actual words. does that scare me? of course not dummies. but it does scare some really stupid people who are evil enough to believe it's real. those people's children probably won't mix well with children who come from a more enlightened, intelligent and practical family that won't believe in such idiocy.so be careful with this movie. it could cause you some trouble if you bring it up in the wrong place. as far as my own feelings go, i find this film cute and charming and terribly funny. others might not be as amused. be careful. you are crossing the line with this film. when you endorse or recommend this film you are advocating war. you are also stating that you prefer to take a practical, scientific approach to this world and debunk superstition.for those of you who might read this and still believe witchcraft is real, YOU ARE STUPID. bottom line. keep repeating to yourself it's only a movie. it's only a movie. than seek therapy.for the families strong and smart enough to deal with this ticking time bomb of a film, take caution and enjoy. it's funny and fun.if you can handle it go for it.

I did find a serious problem with the first half and that was the yawn inducing character introduction and a plot that goes more or less nowhere . Things did pick up slightly with a song and dance number featuring Sihks , Jocks and a Jamaican steel band but the movie felt like an inferior remake of MARY POPPINS , something that wasn`t helped by the casting of David Tomlinson and everyone trying to emulate a Dick Van Dyke inspired cockney accent . At this point I seriously began to question if I`d got BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS mixed up with another movieThen about two thirds of the way through the movie takes off in a spectacular manner where the characters finally make a trip to  The bottom of the beautiful briney sea  where they meet animated characters and take part in a football match . They then go back to Britain in 1940 and use magic to hold back a dastardly German invasion . The final third of the movie is superb entertainment and this bitter cynical critic was totally enthralled by this part and knew right away why I enjoyed this movie as a child But I have to repeat that it`s the much latter part of the film that makes BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS so memorable and unfortunately tricks people into thinking that it`s a better film than it actually is since the first hour or so is very disappointing and slow . It`s not so much the memory that`s cheated - It`s the film itself that`s cheated the memoryHaving said that even the sub standard parts are far better than anything JK Rowling could be capable of writing  "},{"Title":"More Disney tosh about the UK","Date":"3 November 1999","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  Sometimes seen as the follow up to Mary Poppins this movie has none of the charm or grace. Instead it has all the usual Disney cliches about what life in the UK is supposed to be like and how the average Britain behaves. All a lot of old rubbish that has been churned out time and again by US film makers.Personally I cannot put up with Lansbury, the one expression actress, who bustles her way through this senseless and really pointless film. Tomlinson is not much better and totally overplays the professor character. No real direction here at all.As for the special effects - forget it - they had to be joking. It was, I think, another attempt to show what could be done with mixing cartoon with live action, something new at the time. Technically there isn't much wrong, it just that the effects are so embarrassingly bad to watch.Finally we have the Nazi army apparently put to flight by our intrepid heroes. The usual bungling German Nazis. There is nothing funny about Nazis, who, despite always being portrayed as such, were not bungling fools but a highly efficient killing machine. Nazi's aren't nice.If you like to squirm at an embarrassing plot and acting then this is the film for you, otherwise forget it.

Basically set during World War II, the three Rawlins children, Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan), Charlie (Ian Weighill) and Paul (Roy Snart) have been evacuated from London to the remote village of Pepperinge Eye. They are placed in the care of reclusive woman Eglantine Price (Golden Globe nominated Angela Lansbury), the children attempt to run away, but change their minds when they spot Miss Price flying a broomstick, they find out she is an apprentice witch. Miss Price explains that she is learning witchcraft to help the British war effort, she and the children make an agreement that they will remain silent about her secret with a spell she gives them, she casts a spell on a bedknob, found by the youngest child Paul, that will cause the bed to take them to any destination they want. Miss Price receives bad news from her teacher that the correspondence school has been forced due to the war to close down, this means she will not receive the final lesson she most wanted, so she convinces Paul to help her travel on the bed, find her teacher and help bring the war to an end. The enchanted bed spell is successful, they find Miss Price's teacher, Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), he is in fact a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book he found, he is surprised to find out the spells actually work for Miss Price. Mr. Browne gives Miss Price the old book, The Spells of Astaroth, but the final spell she is looking is missing, so the group travel to find the rest of the book in Portobello Road. Petty criminal Swinburne (Bruce Forsyth) overhears they are looking for the book, he takes them to his employer, a mysterious man called the Bookman (Sam Jaffe), who has the other half of the book, but the spell remains missing, it is only engraved on the star always worn by the sorcerer Astaroth. But the Bookman reveals Astaroth kept wild animals who were given human qualities by the sorcerer, they took the star and escaped to somewhere called the Isle of Naboombu, the Bookman has found no evidence the island exists, but Paul found a storybook confirming its existence, so the group escape the Bookman and Swinburne on the enchanted bed to find the island. The bed lands in the lagoon of the island, after swimming with the fish they are flung onto land, and brought before hot- tempered lion ruler King Leonidas, who is wearing the Star of Astaroth, but to get close to it Mr. Browne volunteers to act as referee for a chaotic soccer match, which ends with the king declaring himself the winner. Following the match Mr. Browne cleverly switches the Star of Astaroth with the referee whistle, examining the medallion Miss Price confirms it has the missing spell, Substitutiary Locomotion, Leonidas discovers the theft however and chases them, but Miss Price stops him with her spell that transforms her target into a white rabbit. Back home, Miss Price is ready to experiment with the spell, but the Star has vanished back into the fantasy world it came from, Paul reveals that the spell was in his storybook all the time, Miss Price and the others test the spell, to bring inanimate objects to life, they only end up bringing more than a pair of shoes to life. Local children's refuge supervisor Mrs. Jessica Jessie Hobday (Tessie O'Shea) informs Miss Price that the children can be taken in by another family, but she wants them to stay, and Mrs. Hobday is pleased when she sees they have found a father figure with Mr. Browne, he however is wary of commitment, and he says he must return to London. A platoon of Nazi soldiers land on the coast and invade Miss Price's house, imprisoning her and the children in the local museum, but Mr. Browne comes to their rescue, and they plan to use the Substitutiary Locomotion spell to defeat and scare away the enemy soldiers. In the end however the Nazis commandos destroy Miss Price's workshop, ending her career as a witch, she is happy however that she performed some small service, and realised some time ago she would never be a proper witch, because of her reaction to Poisoned Dragon's Liver, Mr. Browne enlists in the army and leaves escorted by the Home Guard, Paul reveals he still has the magical knob, so they can continue their adventures. Also starring Roddy McDowall as Mr. Jelk, John Ericson as Colonel Heller, Arthur Gould- Porter as Captain Greer, Reginald Owen as General Teagler. Lansbury is likable being dotty, Tomlinson is entertaining enough, and the three young newcomers are alright as the cockney evacuees, the story is easy to follow, and the songs by the Sherman brothers (who also worked on Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book) are fun to sing along to, particularly The Beautiful Briny and Substitutiary Locomotion, the highlights of the film are the animated underwater and jungle football game sequences, all in all it is a fun family part-animated fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Song for The Age of Not Believing and Best Music. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!

Jackson's character got sick of those (censored) snakes on that (censored) plane","Date":"25 October 2008","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" If you've read any of my reviews of musicals and Disney movies, then you'll know that I watch them only so that I can trash-talk them a la Mystery Science Theater 3000. Among my jeers to Bedknobs and Broomsticks were This is Ms. Price. - She wrote murder.One needs domesticity. - You need Martha Stewart for that.Money has nothing to do with it. - Haven't you been paying attention to the worldwide financial crisis?! A few things in the movie reminded me of Stephen King's novels. Aside from the fact that the girl is named Carrie, there was all the talk about making inanimate objects take on a life of their own. Inanimate objects came to life in The Shining, Maximum Overdrive and Christine. The underwater ballroom in fact looked a little bit like the ballroom in Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (which I consider the scariest movie ever made).The one part of this movie that I really liked was the soccer game (as Brits, they should have said football). As far as I could tell, the animals just made up the rules as they went, like Calvinball in Calvin and Hobbes.Above all, I find it inappropriate to use war as an excuse for a musical fantasy story (England got bombed terribly during WWII). To crown everything, this movie actually received an Oscar nomination (Best Original Song)! But to maintain its dignity, the Academy gave the award to Shaft; after all, who's da man? In fact, with my wacky mind, I from now on would like to think that Samuel L. Jackson's character in Snakes on a Plane got so angry that this movie came close to beating Shaft, that he many years later vented his anger on the title serpents with his famously unsavory line.Anything else to discuss in the movie? That nursery looked like Norman Bates's room. The whole story of Asteroth sounded like Dr. Moreau. The lagoon sounded like the one next to Gilligan's island. If they remake the movie with Sam Raimi as director and Bruce Campbell as the star, then they can call it Evil Dead-knobs and Boom-sticks (take that, you primitive screw-heads!).All in all, Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe all did better than this.
