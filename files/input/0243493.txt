(By American comedy, I'm speaking of movies like the better Coen Brothers or Woody Allen comedies and not mass-produced garbage like White Chicks.) Many times I completely forgot it was in French and that I was reading subtitles.Daniel Auteuil is great in this charming film. His sad-sack loser is reminiscent of William H. Macy's most famous roles, or perhaps Jack Lemmon in The Apartment.Everything goes wrong for Fran√ßois Mignon. Neither his wife, who left him two years before, nor his teenage son will have anything to do with him. He is ignored at work, and finds out through the grapevine that he has been fired.His next-door neighbor talks him out of suicide and comes up with a plan to save his job if Mignon pretends to be gay, the company will not want to look homophobic by firing him.This plan works perfectly, and Mignon is thrown into a number of increasingly ridiculous situations, now that he is reputed to be gay.The film wraps up quickly and ties together almost too neatly, but the ending fits the fast paced comic style of everything before it. Overall, this is an entertaining and heartwarming film.

It is very, very funny.  They avoid cheap queer jokes and cheap homophobe jokes even as they bluntly portray attitudes about homosexuals.  Even though they use very real language to illustrate the attitudes.  There is some great acting throughout.  Each of the characters is a study in itself.  The homophobic character (Depardieu) emerges as intriguing and sympathetic, where it could have been two dimensional.  The relationship between Auteil and Aumont almost brought me to tears.  The transformation of the lead character is believable, despite the improbable context that the film creates.  The final scene with his ex-wife is powerful.  Others have pointed out that the lead character never changes, the perceptions of others change.  This makes his actual transformation that much more effective.  This movie is a real find.

With that premise, the film is off to a wonderful series of misunderstandings and revelations as our hero discovers a great deal about life, people around him, and most of all, himself. The fact that all of this takes place is a very prim, high-tech condom factory makes the comedy all the more lively.I wasn't expecting the lift that the film gave me.

Auteuil plays an unassuming, rather colorless, 20-year employee of a condom factory.  When, one day, he is told that he will be let go due to corporate downsizing, he is suicidally despondent.  However, a caring neighbor (Aumont) devises a scheme that will possibly save Auteuil's job.  He decides to out Auteuil as gay so that the dismissal will look like discrimination, thus panicking the company into keeping him on staff.  This act sets into motion a number of comical complications, much of which involve the company macho man/bully (Depardieu) and Auteuil's boss Laroque.  The film is pretty superficial and doesn't really delve into all the ramifications of it's storyline situation, but it does provide some easy laughs and some strong performances throughout.  Auteuil is properly average, yet eventually ingratiating.  Depardieu shows why he's one of France's top actors with a right-on, finely nuanced portrayal.  His is probably one of the most complicated characters in the film and he handles it well.  Laroque is an attractive and solid presence as well.  Aside from a host of good actors, the film also boasts a gorgeous production design.  All of the costumes, sets and color schemes come together to create a distinctive and pleasing look.  The plot is almost paper thin and characters don't often act as real people would, but this is a farce and, as such,  it delivers some amusement and interest.  One disconcerting thing is the level of cruelty in some cases.  One character is savagely beaten and another has his life virtually destroyed all in the name of fun.  This could be due to a different perspective between a U.S. viewpoint and a French one.  It tarnishes the goodwill and fun of the film, but only slightly.  Mostly, it is a pretty and frothy concoction (complete with one of the most adorable kittens ever seen on screen) that shouldn't offend or upset any of it's target audience.

Hulot (Le Vacance de M. Hulot, the greatest comedy I've ever seen), in others of some of the best of the Alec Guiness comedies. Not for style but for quality. It's at their level. There were fine performances by all the main characters but I was fascinated by the unfolding of the plot. All the pieces fit together so intricately and well and so few liberties were taken of normal human reactions -- almost everything was within comfortable bonds of believability. Well, there were a couple of minor stretches -- the catalyzing role of a sexual encounter in finally transforming M. Pignon's personality was one, but wouldn't that be quaintly Gallic? And the transformation of his son was another, but then -- teenagers can sometimes be unpredictable, can't they? And it had only one broad sterotype, Mr. Santini (Gerard Depardieu). I left the theater amazed at how well the various facets of the plot fit so well together that it reminded me then of a Chinese wood block puzzle; now, a week later, that still seems most fitting.This is _not_ a movie about being gay; that's only the gas that fuels the car that takes the people on that trip. It _is_ an observant, droll film about office politics and the way people's views of others can be distorted by labels. I'm sure -- within a few years -- this will be considered a classic and deservedly so.

The acting of Auteil, Depardieu and Rocherfort above all is very amusing and good. I found Thierry Lhermitte's role in this film of less importance than in others, e.g. Le Diner de Cons and  Le P√®re No√´l es une Ordure. The situation (probleme of homosexuality being or not being used as a way of firing or not firing someone )relates very much to today and the average spectator will be able to relate to the scenes of the film especially if he or she works in an office. I found the film most amusing, much better than 'Diner de Cons' (which had a bitter side to it). I think this film should better stand the test of time like some of Veber's previous servings ( La Ch√®vre, Comp√®res Fugitifs ). The other thing is that is is not typically French and should be able to have a truly international appeal. Veber has this gift, I think of being able to be creative outside the French carcan and many of his works are remade internationally. Well worth seeing, wherever you come from and especially of you are feeling down in th mouth !!!!!

With redundancies on the way, he knows that, because he is not respected by his boss or colleagues, that he will be the first one out the door. After a discussion with his new neighbour, Pignon fabricates photographs that make himself look undeniably gay &#150; thus preventing his employers from sacking him without making it look like they did it due to his sexuality. When he 'comes out', the rumours start but his job is safe &#150; in fact, the management move to clamp down on the behaviour of one of the management team who is homophobic. Worried for his own job due to his warning, Felix Santini is convinced that, in order to fit with the company line on homosexuality, he must be especially nice to Pignon and show how modern he is. However this only serves to create more misunderstandings within the workplace.With the natural American remake surely only a matter of years away, I was glad that I had the chance to see this film before the remake rather that afterwards. Able to view it as an original piece of work without any other spin, I found it to be a rather charming little film &#150; slight and lacking real bite but still providing gentle laughs and subtle comment. The plot allows for the film to look at the way that homosexuality has changed over the decades to the point now where it is acceptable and yet still looked down upon (but not openly in public &#150; that is not PC!). It also manages to bring in other threads involving Felix's homophobia, a thread that starts out being very funny but later becomes quite touching and delicate. It never really gets very convincing as a serious plot or a real sharp commentary but it is a light comedy &#150; I didn't expect it to. A heavier plot would have spoilt the enjoyable light mood the film had which does manage to turn a little more serious towards the end without losing the comic spirit it had early on.Veber is a good comic direction and I have liked several of his films that I have seen. Here he brings together a good cast to build on his witty script. Auteuil is, as he often is, very good. A comic little fool that grows on the audience and develops as a person over the duration of the film, he plays it well and is nicely understated &#150; I hate to think how Hollywood will deal with a character pretending to be gay terrible camp clich√©s (Will & Grace, Birdcage) will be much more likely than anything else. Depardieu was a surprise find but he was also very good &#150; starting out in a very comic role at first but skilfully making more of it and making the changes to his character pretty convincing. Support from Lhermitte, Laroque, Aumont and others are all good but the film is easily stolen by Auteuil and Depardieu.Overall a very enjoyable little film that has a good comic tone as well as an interesting story. Never consistently hilarious or going too much the other way to be pointed and political, it judges the mood just right and has a bit of both, producing a balanced film that, despite being a little slight in several regards, is enjoyable and interesting &#150; I hope the inevitable remake can do it justice.

This is nothing brilliant, but it's the equal of lots of American comedies in creating a situation that is filled with built-in laughs. And the leading man, Daniel Auteuil, is funny and sympathetic.The setting for this all is an office of the most preposterous kind--a condom factory. This is meant to be funnier than it is, actually, but it's a colorful backdrop to the opening salvo--our leading man is not the best accountant and he gets fired. Back home, where his life has left him and his son has stopped talking to him, his neighbor stops him from jumping off the balcony to his death. And concocts a simple plan to keep his job pretend he is gay.The hook here is that by being openly gay the man would be able to claim he was fired by the gay bashers at the factory. This doesn't quite hold up, but the key basher is played with nice complexity by Gerard Depardieu, who himself begins to show some latent something or other. There is plenty of sympathy and warmth to go around here, and lots of appropriate laughs as you empathize with the main guy. Eventually, of course, people discover the ruse and that starts some new jokes. All in all enjoyable and fun, without a dull moment. And that's all you expect or need from this kind of movie.

So goes the old quote, but this picture examines that issue with some very surprising conclusions.Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is a very unhappy man. His wife, Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot), has left him. His son, Franck (Stanislas Crevillen), wants nothing to do with him. And while he is a competent accountant at a factory which produces condoms, he is as ignored at work as he is everywhere else, as evidenced by the fact that he is pushed out of the all staff picture when it is taken. In fact, almost all who know him consider him a dullard. So, when the factory staff needs to be downsized, he is, of course, first on the list. Distraught, and potentially suicidal over the loss of his job, he meets his new neighbor, Guillaume (Thierry Lhermitte), an old gay man, who has a few ideas as to how Francois may be able to hang onto his job. If it becomes known that Francois is gay, the factory won't fire him for fear of facing a discrimination suit. Francois uncomfortably agrees to go along with this in order to save his job, but he has no idea what is in store for him as he plays gay. At first, his deception merely saves his job, but does little to change things for him, but soon, he finds himself the grand marshal of a gay pride parade, his son begins to take an interest in spending time with him, and a homophobic co-worker (Gerard Depardieu) falls in love with him, leading to the co-worker's nervous breakdown. Francois' display of compassion in helping the man return to his job causes his boss, Mlle. Bertrand (Michele Laroque), to see him with new eyes, and to question whether or not he is really gay. Will she find out? What will happen to him if she does? This is a story told with considerable charm. Francois is very downtrodden at the beginning, but you can't help liking him. As his influence grows, he stays true to himself, and never takes unfair advantage of the situation. That integrity wins everyone over to him, and keeps you routing for him throughout the film. When he finally claims his power and tells off his ex-wife, you want to shout for joy at his liberation. Here is a man who has learned much by pretending to be what he is not, has found true happiness by claiming what he is, and has benefited from the experience.The acting is excellent. Daniel Auteuil turns in his usual masterful performance. Gerard Depardieu displays his genius for comedy in portraying Felix's disdain, and ultimate attraction to Francois, as well as his confusion over the whole incident. Michele Laroque does a wonderful job of portraying a woman who realizes that there is a lot more to this man she has dismissed as dullard than she thought, and in helping him realize this as well. The supporting performances are equally delightful.Overall, this movie is a gem, which should be viewed periodically simply for the joy of seeing it. It is guaranteed to uplift your spirits, and make you appreciate life.

This so-called fairy tale (sorry it was too easy) is about a boring accountant who is about to get fired from his job, was deserted by his wife, and ignored by his son because of his dull personality. In order for him to save his job and spice up his ways, his neighbor comes up with a head strong idea. He manipulates a photograph of 2 gay lovers with our main character superimposed as one of the gay guys in the picture and sends it over to the company he works for. Now all the employees think that our accountant is gay (even though he is not) and are intrigued by the pseudo revelation. In other words, they think he is more interesting because he has perceivably changed from being a drag to being a drag queen. However, our protagonist does not demonstrate a gayish personality to others. Star Daniel Auteuils was very good and did not blow it at all. Gerard Depardieu was hilarious as a homophobic employee who is forced to kiss up to our protagonist so he could keep his job. The screenwriters wrote up a very creative screenplay, and demonstrated they are not a bunch of closet cases in the act of film-writing. So do not get a case of closetphobia and have a gay old time at the movies and see `The Closet.' **** Good  "}{"Title":"Another great funny film by Veber","Date":"22 March 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Francis Veber is one of the best comedy director in the game.

Within the first 20 minutes of this movie, I realized that it probably couldn't be made in America.  It seems that American comedies tend to fall into two categories sickly sweet or crude and mean.  If The Closet were made in America, I have a feeling that it would quickly degenerate into a series of mindless and insulting stereotypes or hollow Hollywood platitudes.  The Closet satirizes without preaching, and it is sweet without making you want to puke.  Every three minutes the film introduces a hilarious new wrinkle as the main character's feigned homosexual orientation creates more complications in his life and in the life of his family and colleagues.

Pignon is an extremely ordinary and dull person, and no one can think of a good reason to keep him on.  Also, he is still in love with his ex-wife and tries to be a father to his estranged son, but neither of them return his affection.  Getting his pink slip sends Pignon into a short-lived depression, when his new neighbor hatches a scheme to help Pignon keep his job. Belone, the neighbor, doctors some photos of men in a gay bar--putting Pignon's face on one of the men--and sends them in an anonymous envelope to his employer.  He tells Pignon to not even worry about acting gay; just stay the same, he says, and everyone around you will alter *their* behavior.  The main objective is, of course, to scare a condom company out of firing a gay man, and as expected, all manner of hilarity ensues.Director and screenwriter Francis Veber's The Closet rides the wave of international success stirred by his 1998 film The Dinner Game without providing as well-structured or as consistent a story.  The first half of the film is every bit as funny as the setup to The Dinner Game, supplying nearly a dozen fascinating characters (all wonderfully acted by a superb ensemble cast), and promising much.  Part of concept of the film deals with shifting the focus from Pignon to the people around him.  Unfortunately, in a 80 minute film, Veber is unable to complete even a minimal story arc for each character--which leaves the film feeling somewhat disjointed in the end.Perhaps it is to Veber's detriment, in a film like this, that he writes such consistently fascinating characters; if the characters were less intriguing, the audience would not protest when one of them disappeared or suddenly and inexplicably turned into a simple caricature.  For example, Gerard Depardieu plays Santini, an office homophobe who must begin to play nice with Pignon or risk losing his own job.  For a while, this relationship promises the sort of intense character interaction at which Veber excels.  Soon, however, Santini undergoes a comic but inexplicable personality change and is marginalized from the film.  Santini's role in the story is replaced by a smattering of vignettes which show other office workers being alternately cruel and kind toward Pignon.Additionally, like Veber's previous film, The Closet obtains its comic premise from a social injustice.  This film, however, is slightly more blatant in its message-oriented nature.  In message films, an audience often has to endure forced dialogue--sometimes even entire forced scenes--which are not organic to the piece.  While The Closet is not as preachy as it might have been in the hands of another director, the occasional sermonizing does detract from the film.

Ironically, the maestro Wilder's very last film 'Buddy, Buddy', was based on Veber's own 'L'emmerdeur' and it laid a kingsize egg in translation/transposition. Veber even extends his homage to Wilder (as well he, or anyone, for that matter, might) to multiple use of a character name - in Wilder's case it was Sheldrake, used first by Fred Clarke in Sunset Boulevard and reprised by Fred McMurray in The Apartment. With Veber it is Francois Pignon - the commenter who thought that Daniel Auteuil in THIS movie was the same Francois Pignon played by Jacques Villeret in 'Diner du Cons' was mistaken, they are totally different people, as are Wilder's pair of Sheldrakes - though only Diner du Cons and Le Placard have had a wide release outside France. Now that Wilder is not here to write scripts about guys pretending to be gay to avoid redundancy at a condom factory, who better to step in than one of the most talented writer/directors in the business.

The Closet was his testimony and on the surface, the film has everything you'd expect from a Veber film. It has the wits, the mild-mannered average Joe, played by Daniel Auteuil portraying another Fran√ßois Pignon, AND the political and social commentary. What else could you expect? Unfortunately, what certainly looked promising on the paper didn't successfully pass the big-screen test, starting with the main character, Fran√ßois Pignon, a boring accountant (pleonasm?) in a rubber factory. The film opens with a very evocative photo where the poor Pignon is so meek and insignificant that he can't even get in the company picture. He's such a forgettable pawn, that it doesn't surprise us when we learn that he's to be fired. What's more, he's divorced and his son, a typical teenager, ignores him, just like his wife, played by Alexandra Vandernoot. This 'Fran√ßois Pignon' irritated me a little bit, I know he's supposed to be this way to become better at the end, but afterThe Dinner Game, no one could have played a more Pignon-esque character than Jacques Villeret, and any post-Dinner Pignon would pale in comparison. Pignons were all unwitting losers, and never lacked flamboyance and personality; the level of pathos injected in Auteuil's character was too big not to fall in the stereotypical trap.Naturally, it doesn't come as a surprise either that the man contemplates suicide; at that part, we still wait for some laughs to relax the atmosphere. Right before doing the big dive, he's approached by his neighbor who obviously sees a man in need for help. Michel Aumont, another Veber regular, is wonderfully natural and sympathetic and provides what I consider the greatest and most human scenes of the film. He comes up the next day, with THE idea, typically Veberian, to pass Pignon as a homosexual by sending an anonymous fake picture showing him in a gay club to the big boss, Mr. Kopel (Jean Rochefort). It would naturally serve as a warning, since the main product of the company is condoms. We accept the logic with even more enthusiasm that he's not supposed to act 'gay', it's all in the eyes of the employees. That was the cleverest touch of the film, but not a surprise, since Veber always respected the intelligence of the viewer.And it's remarkable how the reputation of one man precedes the perception, the first step succeeds as he's not fired, then he's seen in a different way, he's not dull anymore, but weird. His reluctance to be part of the rugby team becomes understandable, and any attempt to bully him can be a case of homophobia. The problem is that we can't go too far with that. Had the movie exaggerated a little bit, it would have been proved that being gay can somewhat help, which would have spoken a much wider statement about 'being part of a community'. And that's my problem with the film, while The Closet could have been a remarkable denunciation of the lobbying system, it remains a timid little comedy, a farce with no subtlety nonetheless especially when it tackles Fran√ßois' gay facade, homophobia-immune at work but not outside. It could have been more dramatic or more comedic, even if it flirted with the 'Birdcage' spirit (a much funnier film at the end, and no less written by Veber) As an attempt to compensate the shortness of the main story, Veber comes up with a rather unnecessary subplot involving Depardieu's character, Felix Santini, a guy who's warned by Thierry Lhermitte about his constant homophobic remarks. I know it was supposed to be funny, but it looked for me as a remake of the 'Dinner Game' where we're supposed to root for the plotters. I couldn't. When Felix was yelling racist remarks, I felt it was only Veber trying to make him look bad, and conveniently, when a black employee told Lhermitte that he was going too far with Felix, he changed his mind after learning about the racist remark. I still felt sorry for Felix, and I don't think it was a good idea to have Lhermitte, playing again a cunning mean-spirited guy (with the same bald sidekick). Felix is not a totally unlovable idiot but I wish the movie went farther with Pignon, rather than him.By the way, the presence of Lhermitte, Rochefort or other stars also annoyed me because they were not important enough to be important actors; even Lhermitte had nothing to do in the poster. It's like Veber wanted to exploit the commercial success of The Dinner Game for The Closet, but had it kept the same spirit, it would have worked. Not that the film is a failure, but it just can't be compared to its glorious predecessors if only in the characterization's department. Pignon gained more confidence but was it necessary to turn his wife into a sort of one-dimensional villain to make him feel good? Would the son be suddenly proud of him, just because he's in a gay pride? Apparently, being original is the key to popularity, although it's still guided by the others' perceptions, from his wife's shallowness to his son's superficiality, it seems that everything is guided by the way you're seen.The film could have been much better, had it had the guts to go further in its introspection, it's an interesting examination of the ways professional relationships are as undermined by general perceptions than in society, but it just lost too much time on the Depardieu-Lhermitte subplot to enrich the most interesting aspect in Pignon's life, making his metamorphosis too quick to be believable. A minor Veber film but still better than many comedies made today.

Without him, the film just wouldn't exist. Yes, Auteuil is also fine as a likable looser. When he squints like a gay, he really does something ... unusual. Like on a Rorschach test, it just takes an ambiguous image for us viewers to project who we really are. The envious co worker, the racist macho, the brainy one who plays with other people's feelings like if they were chess pieces, the bright beautiful competitive blonde which rightly suspects from the start, the boss who wields power but just doesn't want trouble, the bright African who also has mixed feelings about the white majority, his stunning but sour & selfish ex wife, their aloof frivolous teenager, in short, the human comedy. Balzac would be proud.Pignon, like his neighbour's kitten, is probably too grey to be distinguishable from most people we know. If there's something reassuring in this comedy that takes place at a fake condom factory is that we could all change. If only ...Veber, director of The dinner game and of lesser works, is at his best here.

All Fran√ßois has to do is allow his co-workers and boss to believe he is out of the closet. The plot itself is very humorous, but in a very clever way. It is not a film for audiences who expect comedies to revolve around outrageous situations that would normally never happen. Le Placard's humor lies in the silly, yet slightly understandable reactions of Fran√ßois' coworkers to his new identity. As a comedy, the film did its job and provides many laughs and snickers.

However, when I watched the movie the second time round I found it far less funny.I think the main problem for me was that I had to concentrate so much on reading the subtitles that a lot of the humour passed me by. Much of the dialogue is funny because it is spoken in an ironic way or because of the expressions on the faces of the actors as they speak, so you get the humour best if you can watch the actors at the same time as hearing the words. The actors were speaking their native French quickly (as expected!) and the English subtitles flashed before my eyes too fast for me to have sufficient pauses to enjoy the movie's humour.Maybe I'm just slow?

A divorc√© who pays an uncaring former wife alimony to support his estranged son, Pignon returns home contemplating suicide.

Belone suggests that the company would not fire Pignon if he was thought to be a homosexual, for fear of being labeled homophobic.

Belone tells him that HE doesn't have to change - the change will be in how his coworkers percieve him!  So it proves...The main problem with this film is that Pignon is every bit as boring and predictable as his acquaintances believe him to be, right down to his spaghetti basilique.  His rigid non-performance as the condom king in a gay pride parade is an example of a wasted opportunity for him to 'loosen up'.

With the wildly funny Dinner Game, he showed that he was able to weave hilarious situational comedy. Unfortunately, The Closet does not pick up where The Dinner Game left off. There's nothing awful about it, but in a failed attempt to put a new spin on Verber's creation Francois Pignon, The Closet never delivers.Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is considered an idiot by many who work with him at a condom factory and is on the verge of being fired. He gets word of this, and dismayed turns to his new neighbor Belone (Michel Aumont). Belone suggests a tricky scheme to save Pignon's job pretend that he is gay and the company will never fire him if they want to save their image. The scheme is working, and on the other side of the spectrum there is another prank being played. Homophobe Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu) is being pressured to act nice to Pignon to save his job, and unexpected things begin to happen. Francois Pignon is one of the funnier characters I have encountered in recent years. In Verber's previous film he was a flat-out idiot, meaning well but always saying the wrong things and the wrong times. In The Closet, everyone calls him an idiot, but I don't buy it. He seems perfectly intelligent to me. Pignon is translated here as a boring punch line without the setup. Much to my surprise, I found that I couldn't care less what happens to him over the course of the film. One of the most valuable pieces of advice I could give to Verber from an audience member's perspective is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Only partly because of Pignon's shortcomings does the film fall flat. Most of the jokes just aren't funny. They're the same sort of recycled gay jokes we get all the time in movies. The screenplay feels worn and tired, and what could've been a breath of fresh air becomes recycled and stale. Verber is merely taking an interesting idea and presenting the obvious What-ifs that immediately pop into one's mind when hearing a synopsis about the film.The acting was incredibly sub-par as well. Daniel Auteuil, who is on the whole a very good actor gives a performance as monotone and boring as Pignon is (see him in The Widow of Saint-Pierre if you really want to see what he's made of). Gerard Depardieu is fair, but doesn't show enough desperation that we are told Felix so obviously has. Michele Laroque breathes a little more life into her character Mlle Bertrand, Pignon's secretary; she is the highlight of an ensemble that is relatively uninteresting and never shows enough range. The Closet is a wasted opportunity. In situational comedy, we need to care about or at least understand the characters to a certain extent or it will be impossible to laugh when they get into trouble. While Verber seemed like he could handle that, in The Closet it doesn't seem he believes in his characters; as if he believes that the audience need only take them at face value. Unfortunately, The Closet ranks as one of the most disappointing ventures of the year. "},{"Title":"An hour and a half of my life I'll never get back and a whole lot of good anguish just vanished","Date":"20 February 2012","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In a couple hundred years, history books on the twentieth century will doubtless remark with unwarranted amazement at the fact that, in Western countries, homosexual acts in went from criminal in the middle of the century to protected, lauded and even officially ordained by the end. I say unwarranted because sexual liberation had already been unleashed with the Marquis de Sade, and needed only the socially atomizing effects of high-speed transportation and communication to make its way into the consciousness of the general populace.No, in actuality, what is far more interesting about this whole affair is that the prejudice remains. The majority of people, even those living in tolerant societies, do not particularly want to know the intimate details of others' homosexual relationships, particularly children of their parents'.Even so, Le Placard actually expects us to believe that Daniel's son suddenly respects a father who's a lousy provider and a social dud because the latter now has a cool and interesting aspect. Hogwash! Any teenaged male would flip at his least tolerant or shrug and say, My old man has plenty of other problems at his most tolerant. It is not that turning stereotypes around is never good or valid; it is that the homophobic teenaged male stereotype is in fact intimately grounded in reality, and the movie loses a lot of its plausibility by jettisoning it.All the same, Le Placard willingly succumbs to the most tired and predictable stereotypes whenever it suits the filmmakers' agenda. For example, the bumbling homophobic buffoon, suddenly forced to be nice to his supposedly queer colleague in order to avoid being read out for insensitivity, ends up questioning his own sexuality. (It is interesting that homosexual activists can think of no worse insult for homophobes than to insinuate that the latter are themselves closeted homosexuals. Are they admitting that the worst thing in the world is to be called a sexual pervert?) Then, of course, there is the gender-bending sexual harassment subplot, which forces Daniel to choose between integrity and practicality and rise to the occasion. In fact, he chooses practicality&#x85; and yet nothing happens. When everyone&#x97;including the woman Daniel loves&#x97;finds out he's been lying to them all along, he is not chastised, not punished. Life goes on much as it did, and any potentially bruised relationships are patched right up. But hey! So long as a film portrays alternate life-styles in a positive manner, honesty and integrity don't count.The film reaches into the past and shows us an older male who was fired for the same reason Daniel is getting to keep his job. On the surface this appears a cross-generational comparison of just how drastically and rapidly times have changed, an indictment of politically correct nonsense. In actuality, however, Le Placard contains absolutely nothing that would offend a modern bien pensant the moral beacons of the movie are those who take the most warmly to the falsified news of Daniel's manly needs. The message is obviously that we still have a long way to go, and in fact should continue on the path, so that homosexuality becomes universally accepted, there is no longer any closet to come out of&#x85; so that the wheels of commerce can continue as usual.No wonder Le Placard&#x97;an offering jam-packed with offensive subplots, incompetent actors and insipid jokes&#x97;could meet with such recognition it is about as morally subversive, politically correct and commercially viable (due to its facilit√©) as a film can get, exactly the sort of stuff the studios jump to finance and to promote. Avoid. "},{"Title":"Quite an overrated and somewhat homophobic film","Date":"18 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is a film with one laugh holding it up a straight man pretending to be gay. So, the film is not that funny to justify all its other problems and the plot ends up repeating the very homophobia that it allegedly seeks to decry. The clich√©s of gay men in cinema are numerous and Auteuil's interpretation of the camp gay man is just boring and problematic. Sure the actors are great, but this does not a good film make. What is troubling about films like this (ie. _Bird Cage_, _In and Out_, etc) are that they set up a premise of homosexuality between two men, place straight male actors in the role as if to show their versatility and ability to play gay (whatever this means?) and ultimately the intention of the film reifies gay identity as fixed, parodic and almost always funny. The comedy vehicle tends to sublate the seriousness of homophobia which goes far beyond the light, comic scenes here and ends up being a feel good movie for straight audiences around the world. Indeed comedy about gay men and women is possible, but it must be done with a sense of the community about which it deals, and this film is void of any real references to homosexuality that are not based on slap-stick humor and clich√©. Essentially, this film is rather offensive in that all sexuality is in word only, no visible affection between men and ultimately this reads as homophobic when the film itself self-censures in not exposing the audience to what is the only expression of any sexuality sex or any type of physical demonstration of affection. We are left with a film full of references to gay men, no demonstration of any form of homosexuality, and a humour built entirely around this imaginary sexuality that, were it shown in any kind of real way, would have turned off many of the members of the audience from writing reviews like one of the best films about this subject. It is easy to like this subject when you don't ever have to see it or honestly engage it outside of parody.

Thus the musical score you can hear as the credits are shown is as punchy as Georges Brassens' song 'Le temps ne fait rien √† l'affaire'. But what is shown behind the credits is the poor main filming location a condom factory built with prefabricated parts in the middle of nowhere. That really makes the movie cheap at first glance.No appetite for something after The Dinner GameThen every character is not that interesting. Daniel Auteuil is nowhere miscast for Fran√ßois Pignon. But you hardly feel sympathy for the loser embodied. Let alone identification. Supporting actors such as Gerard Depardieu, Thierry Lhermitte or Jean Rochefort only assume the minimum performance demanded by their roles. So that they never become interesting either. Even Pignon's neighbour played by Michel Aumont is not very convincing when trying to bring in emotion on the footage.For Le diner de cons the comical thread had been trained on stage. Here no situation becomes wild comedy. Everything is rather down to earth as if the movie was only a tasteless transcription of the script. Which is what you can usually say about a movie not well written and not well directed.Doing bad with good actorsEventually the overwhelming impression is that movie lacks ambition as the average French production. You can focus on details such as an ugly filming location and you think 'amateurs'. American movies might be a bunch of clich√©s most of the time but they are made by true professionals. Not people pleased with their condition of fake artists and satisfied once they've hired good actors. The weaknesses of the French cinema are all the more evident in Le Placard as the cast would be sufficient to claim it's a potential blockbuster. But potential is not all that engaging. "},{"Title":"Crazy Offensive","Date":"31 January 2010","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This movie had some funny moments but I just couldn't get over how incredibly OFFENSIVE it is.Basically a man is going to lose his job so in order to keep it, he pretend to be gay b/c apparently he won't get fired if he's gay b/c people will feel like if they fire him, it will look like it's because he's gay and to sell it, he acts stereotypically gay meaning as flamboyant as possible. There are also a bunch of characters that look down on him for being gay in a joking manner only it's never funny.Hmmm... what if instead of gay, we used black instead. Would that be funny or would this movie now magically be deemed racist. Hmm. a man is about to lose his job so he decides to pull the race card and pretend that he's 1/2 black or something and then in order to pull it off, 'acts black' to seal the deal. Heck, we could have a black man pretend to be his Father and of course this would save his job b/c a minority can't be fired! It will look like he's being fired for being a minority! Throw in racial slurs because he has to overcome adversity just like in the real movie, the fake gay character was met with gay jokes and gay offensive slurs...and we have a movie! I wonder how that would go over yet this movie seems to be a hit. Interesting... "}]
