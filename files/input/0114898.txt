Why do people hate Waterworld? Why was it instantly disregarded before it was even released? When you really think about it, how much different IS Waterworld from the more recent Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest? They are quite similar if you think about it. Waterworld also cost $75 million less than DMC. But because it has Johnny Depp in mascara the whole world loves it! Hypocrisy! With a lot of behind the scenes trouble (Reynolds walked off the film and Costner had to finish the final third of filming himself) and negative pre-release buzz, everyone expected Waterworld to fail. Boasting a budget of Â£175 million (the most expensive ever until Titanic 2 years later) it was sure to be a flop, especially with the snooty public and critics blasting it before its release. Then, the unthinkable happened. Upon release, Waterworld actually managed to prove critic expectation wrong and be a good movie, receiving good (albeit ignored) reviews and finally earning a grand total of $255 million at the Box Office. This is before video, laserdisc, TV, DVD, HD-DVD and Blu Ray sales as well as all of the merchandise. Does sound like a flop to you? The plot is far-fetched. Yes, but so are the POTC plots involving fish-men, giant squids and Orlando Bloom as anything remotely masculine. But you accepted that quite easily. So just, for a minute, believe that if the polar ice caps DID melt that the world WOULD be covered in water. Set hundreds of years after this particular cataclysm, Waterworld follows the journey of The Mariner (Kevin Costner, who is only referred to a few times but never actually named), a man who is one step beyond human as he has the ability to breathe underwater and has webbed feet.Early on in the movie, The Mariner comes across an Atoll, a floating small town complete with its own hill...er Waterbillies. When the Atoll is seized by crazed madman baddie boss Dennis Hopper as The Duke of the Deez (as in Exxon Valdeez), The Mariner escapes with Enola, a little girl who may hold the secret of Dryland and her guardian Helen (the totally gorgeous Jeanne Tripplehorn). Not happy with anyone leaving the party The Duke sends his army of filthy smokers to catch The Mariner and discover Dryland for himself.Waterworld has a lot going for it. It's everything an action/sci-fi movie should be. There is so much escapism in the stunning seascapes and tropical feel. James Newton Howard's exotic score (replacing a rejected score by Mark Isham) is breathtaking and I seriously recommend you hunt down the soundtrack CD. The action is almost entirely special effects and stunt-work and it's brilliantly done. The editing is also quite impressive as is the amazing sound design. Waterworld is far superior to many, more expensive action films but still carries this burden of negative, unfair public opinion.I have only ever seen the 136-minute cut of Waterworld that was released into cinemas and subsequent VHS etc. But a Director's Cut of 176 minutes has been shown on TV in America several times. This version apparently restores several scenes that tie up loose ends and answers a lot of questions about how the this particular watery future works as well as revealing that Dryland is actually Mount Everest. Other than TV airings, this version has never made available to the public. Which is quite annoying as there is a huge fanbase for it.Don't have prejudices against this movie. Think different and see for yourself how cool it is.

This is unfortunate, because it really is a good movie. Sure, it's borrowing a lot from Mad Max, but it's not like Mad Max was original fare to begin with. It's an interesting take on the genre, with some nice sets and costumes, a great soundtrack, and the coolest boat to ever appear on a movie screen. The script has thoughtfully and intricately worked out a new way of life in a post-apocalyptic world, and the supposed plot holes aren't as big as everyone makes them out to be (OK, we never really find out why dirt is so important in the future; so what? Is that enough to ruin the whole movie?).If anything brings it down, it's Kevin Costner's performance. The brooding, gloomy hero shtick works, but he's still far too serious for a movie like this. If he'd had the good sense to be a little more tongue-in-cheek, it would have helped a LOT. Still, it's not a bad movie by any means, and I really think all the negativity toward it is unnecessary. Enough with all the complaining... just sit back and enjoy it! 8/10 stars.

Costner's performance works on exactly the same level as the Connery/Moore/Brosnan portrayals of 007 and Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indy -- straightforward, grim, stoic, a little mean-spirited, a little cruel, unafraid of dirt, grime, death, or salt water.It's not perfect by any means. I'm sure Costner hacked it to pieces in order to accommodate the two-hour-running-time maxim imposed by the studio, so that corporate could get their investment back. Now is the time for the extended DVD version; maybe that will explain where all those cigarettes came from, and how the Smokers converted raw crude into gasoline.7 out of 10.

Ever since, there's been quite a bit of debate over whether the film earned money back on its huge production costs (naturally, the movie's detractors say no, while the fans say yes, and it was a hit overseas and on video).I'm actually surprised Waterworld bombed as it did in the U.S., given that audiences (myself included) have a predilection for big, dumb, blockbuster fun.  Hey, there's got to be an explanation for why Jerry Bruckheimer is cinema's most powerful producer.  And it's not as if though word-of-mouth after the premiere killed the movie (Waterworld actually showed very good legs at the box office, considering its somewhat meager opening weekend).I think part of the critical lashes stems from its budget, which led people to believe this movie would be a flop no matter what.  I've even heard plenty of complaints from people that never every buck appeared to be on-screen.  These days, you never hear such complaints because movies almost as expensive as Waterworld are becoming commonplace, which annoys me in that most blockbusters these days are packed with CGI as Waterworld was not, thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was (filmed on the water, sinking sets, tough conditions, it's a miracle the movie was even finished).As most everyone knows, Waterworld takes place sometime in the unspecified future where the Earth has been covered by water from the melted icecaps. Kevin Costner stars as the Mariner, a Mad Max-ish loner on the ocean who's boat boasts an impressive array of sails and devices.  An opening scene introduces us to the deadly lifestyle of the open sea, with pirates ready to plunder and murder to get what they want.The Mariner arrives at an atoll (a very large trading post) to trade, encounters some trouble when he refuses to stay behind and impregnate a young woman, and is thus imprisoned (and also discovered to be part fish, it turns out he's got gill slits behind his ears and he's got webbed feet). Just as he's to be executed, he's saved when pirates called the Smokers invade the atoll looking for a girl who apparently has a map tatooed on her back that leads the way to the mythical Dryland (whether or not such a myth existed before the girl is unknown).  So said girl and her foster mother (Jeanne Tripplehorn) save the Mariner, who promises to take them with him. But being a loner, he doesn't appreciate their company.  Meanwhile, the Smokers continue their hunt for the girl to continue the search for Dryland.Even though Waterworld has a great, if also entirely implausible, premise and a fun story, it's not driven by its script.  Written by David Twohy (the genius responsible for sci-fi greats The Arrival and Pitch Black), he shows none of the ear for dialogue he displayed in those aformentioned thrillers. Inconsistency abounds in the atoller's lifestyles, as well as their beliefs. No one (except for the Mariner) is aware that there's ground below the water, but they never seem to question where dirt-which is a rare commodity-comes from. The movie's got all sorts of little problems along those lines, but I don't think they're really worth mentioning.What makes the movie worth watching is the adventure.  The movie's all about the search for Dryland, and the journey for it is an exciting and thrilling one.  Spectacular action sequences abound, from large-scale battle sequences to boat chases.  In fact, the action is the movie's highlight.  Director Kevin Reynolds' has an eye for staging and filming fight scenes and gun battles, delivering all this action with plenty of high-energy flair and virtuoso stunts.  The attack on the atoll, an eleven-minute setpiece, was 1995's second most thrilling action sequence (right behind the Battle of Stirling Bridge in Braveheart).  Also equally thrilling is the climactic battle aboard the Smokers' tanker, which displays some of the largest pyrotechnics I've ever seen.To give the adventure an extra boost, the film gives a genuine attempt at character development and actually comes off not half-bad.  Kevin Costner's basically aping Mel Gibson with his own rendition of Mad Max, and while playing a part man/part fish is pretty ridiculous, I'd have to say he's quite sincere and convincing in the role.  I'm not the world's biggest Costner fan, but I'll be the first in line to say he's sorely underrated as an actor.  Tina Majorino is a bit annoying as the cute girl, and I find it rather baffling that her character has Chinese characters tattooed on her back, even though she's clearly caucasian.  Dennis Hopper is a hell of a lot of fun as the Deacon, head of the Smokers, playing his role as both villain and comic relief (he even gets in a priceless scene with a fake eye). But faring best of all is the gorgeous Jeanne Tripplehorn as the requisite love interest.  I've always been a big fan of hers, and while I wouldn't call this a great performance, she's full of energy and vitality as the tough, strong-willed heroine who doesn't give in to demands so easily.One of Waterworld's biggest flaws is the generally cheesy acting from the supporting cast.  Most everyone in this movie has a different accent (except for the leads, of course, who are distinctly American), which I assume was meant to give the flavoring of variety, but it makes the delivery of the already silly dialogue twice as silly.That problem aside, I found myself perfectly open to Waterworld's invigorating action and adventure.  There was a lengthier version shown on network TV in the film's broadcast premiere, which I thought made improvements on both plot and pacing (the theatrical release runs a fast-paced 136 minutes, and I think the network version is actually almost forty minutes longer).  Wish I'd taped it, but hopefully it'll end up as a special edition release on DVD.

I first watched it on TV, missing the big screen effect of seeing it in a theater. The cinematography was well done, considering all of the problems that are inherent is trying to film a futuristic story among only four sets, that are essentially minimal in design. As far as my personal objections go, there are only two. The film took far too long to handle a rather simplistic subject -- the search for the dry land that so eluded everyone concerned. The other major fault is one of attitude. Costner is good looking and, almost always, is shown as quite handsome in his various roles. But, Costner seems able to play just one role -- Costner. He is a one-dimensional actor who is incapable of carrying any kind of accent for more than a single short sentence. Why doesn't he regularly employ a dialog coach when the role calls for it? He also never gives up anything about himself or the role particular role he is playing, no hint of inner being which could make a connection with the audience. The result, at least in this particular story, is that I had a very hard time generating any sympathy for him at all. I simply couldn't have cared less whether or not he found his dry land at all. This made for a really boring time, and I had to force myself to stay tuned for the entire excessive length of a story about a character that never got to first base. Too bad, because I think this subject could have been handled much better than it was. Another Costner excessive epic was The Postman, made a year or so later, which felt much to me like just another telling of the Water World story on a dry land locale. Both were Luke warm at best and way too long in length. Even Dances With Wolves (1991) had the same feel, and was only saved by the performances of the Lakota Sioux warriors and the breathtaking camera shots of the scenery.I would recommend both movies for watching as rentals, but only if there are no other choices available and you have a lot of time to kill.

I mean, Road Warrior meets Pirates of the Caribbean, Jaws, etc. you can't go wrong with that can you? Well this movies answers that question right in the opening introduction to the setting. All you need is a semi-coherent plot, some well delivered lines, and lots of action and this couldn't even pull that off.Someone on here said that the plot holes in this films weren't that big. I say, 'compared to what?' That's like saying that a bomb isn't that loud.First of all, I had no idea about the $175 million budget until recently. My only question about that is what happened to the other $173 million? It certainly didn't go to special effects (there were no memorable effects to speak of), it certainly didn't go to a bunch of recognized actors in the cast. Maybe the total salaries of the directors that left is where the bulk of it went. But hey, I guess that happens.Anyway, I learned quite a bit from this film1. You can store helium on an artificial island or if that was hydrogen in that balloon, you can shoot a hydrogen balloon and it won't explode.2. Bullets and cigarettes will be usable a century or 2 after their manufacture date - AND in humid conditions.3. You can trade dirt for a pot with a tomato plant growing in almost as much dirt as you started with and STILL have enough change for an array of other supplies.4. Everyone knows about an island no one can find, despite the fact that it would be more visible from a greater distance than any of the atolls everyone knows about.5. You can refine crude oil right on the tanker and make gasoline and engine oil from it.6. If you get shot smack in the eye, an eye patch is all you need to keep going.7. Paper will be valuable long after any words written on them have lost all meaning.8. A man with gills has some need for a diving bell. And I forgot to mention he doesn't like guests. (What the heck?)9. Polar ice caps contain enough water to cover the globe.10. You can row an oil tanker. (You've GOT to be kidding with that one!)Another thing I will add is that they show Costner's character in his boat distilling his own urine to make drinkable water. Fine, if the backdrop would have been a desert like Road Warrior and not an OCEAN with a lot more water he could have used. Sure a lot of sci-fi films have some absurdities in their sequences like this, but this one's very PLOT involves a quest for an island using a map on a little girl who we find out is, get this - FROM said island. Okay, now that's convenient but how (and WHY) did she end up so far out to sea in the first place. I guess that detail is not important even though the whole story is due to it.I gave this film a 2 because even with all it's failings it's watchable on those Saturday afternoons when you have nothing else to do at the moment but to sit in front of the tube with some beers and barbecue.

The polar icecaps have melted, flooding the world, and land has become little more than a legend.  During his travels between the tiny man-made islands that comprise the remnants of civilization, the Mariner meets a woman named Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and a small girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) who claim to have knowledge -- or at least a cryptic map -- of where to find land.  Of course, a rowdy gang of pirates known as the Smokers also are aware of the fact that Helen and Enola have this knowledge; so, under the guidance of their mad leader Deacon (Dennis Hopper), the pirates try to hunt down the two.  Faced with his one slim chance of ever finding land falling into the hands of complete madmen, it's up to the Mariner to protect Helen and Enola -- and ultimately, to try and defeat the Smokers -- if he wants to keep his dreams and himself alive . . . .The premise of Waterworld is interesting enough; I like the fact that the film actually tries to show (at least in the opening scenes) how people would survive in a world flooded by salt water.  There's some cool flashes of originality in here regarding what the world would be like -- for example, the fact that ordinary dirt has become so valuable as to become the standard of currency -- but unfortunately, that originality gets ignored the second the action starts rolling halfway through the film.   Overall, the script isn't terrible -- however, it's quite predictable.  For example, the first part of the film is spent explaining painfully how there is no more land, and how it's just a myth . . . gee, wonder what our heroes will find towards the end of the film?  A couple of twists spring readily to mind (for example -- there genuinely is no more land, or dry land can be found far beneath the sea in domed cities, like some kind of Atlantis, perhaps) -- one such twist would've been nice to see.  While the story does have its good moments (particularly any scene involving Dennis Hopper), it's too formulaic to be called exciting.  Nice? Yes.  Exciting? No.  The few good scenes are very, very good, but there's a lot more average -- or even dull -- scenes spread out between the sparse fun.The most puzzling part about Waterworld, though, is the direction.  The film is loaded with action, and I'll give credit where credit is due -- nearly all of the action looks great, especially since all the fights and the action take place out on the water.  But for $200 million . . ?  It doesn't look THAT good.  I know a significant part of the film's budget was spent on floating sets out in the Pacific -- but the camera cuts and shot selections are usually so quick and tight, it's hard to notice the background.  There's no long, slow shots basking on the glory of these expensive sets.  Waterworld is filmed exactly like a typical action movie, which is okay, I guess, but it completely fails to take advantage of its resources.  Quite strange, to say the least.As for the cast . . . it's a mixed bag.  Kevin Costner does a very good job as the grizzled Mariner, playing against type as a hardened, almost amoral anti-hero.  It goes against the good-guy grain that Costner has typically played in most of his films, and Costner seems to relish the change.  Dennis Hopper is terrific as the villainous Deacon; the role is completely over-the-top and absolutely ludicrous at times . . . in short, the part is perfect for Hopper.  His lines simply drip with withering sarcasm, making him a quite memorable screen villain.  The rest of the cast . . . ehh.  Nobody does a horrible job, but nobody's particularly memorable, either.   Should Waterworld have been a $200 Million Dollar Dud?  Probably not.  In a perfect world, Waterworld would've been a $20 Million Dollar Sleeper, directed by John Carpenter and starring Rutger Hauer . . . or a $2 Million Dollar Cult Classic, directed by Roger Corman and starring Lorenzo Lamas.  However, this isn't a perfect world (as evidenced by the fact that Freddie Prinze, Jr. keeps making movies), so Waterworld is forever branded as the bad film with a runaway budget.  Too bad.  Waterworld is by no means a great movie, but it has some entertaining moments, enough to warrant at least a rental . . . and some frequent pushes of the fast forward button.

NOPE!","Date":"8 June 2001","Score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The first time I saw Waterworld was almost 5 years ago, and I thought the movie was too long and too dull.  My friend Chris disagreed, telling me I was being too judgemental.  I decided it was only fair to watch Waterworld one more time.  Much to my own surprise, I discovered that Waterworld is a truly amazing film.Let me break it down for you1.) The sets.  Chris has always been a big fan of the Atoll (the city near the beginning of the movie).  While the Atoll is impressive, I thought the oil tanker and Dryland were awesome sets too.  And the scenes on the water create a unique look for the film.  This movie broke new ground in creating a real world, and not a cheesy backlot shot sci-fi flick...which brings me to point two.2.) Waterworld creates a unique science fiction world.  While Star Wars and Star Trek set out to create their own realities, they are still heavily grounded in our own world.  Waterworld stands out be crafting an entire mindframe that comes about from living your whole life on the water.  The characterization and logic stems from there.  It is not just people in costumes overacting for two plus hours, there is a lot going on here, from the Drifter's policies to the Smoker's screwed up perspective on anti-conservationism.3.) The casting.  Kevin Costner brings a strong performance out of the Mariner character, creating a surly loner who manages to find his own heart. Jeanne Tripplehorm and Tina Majorino round out his ragtag family well. And the Smokers!  From Dennis Hopper's The Deacon down to the guy who played the human depth gauge (William Preston), the villians all seem to have motivation for their actions.  As wicked as he is, you never think Deacon is just a bad guy.  He's chasing the Mariner for a reason.   Even Battlefield Earth's own Kim Coates plays a strong role as a sex-crazed drifter.  But of course, BE gets an even worse rap (and even more undeserved bad rap) than Waterworld.4.) The action sequences.  From the Atoll battle to the Mariner's last stand on the oil tanker, the action scenes are brilliant.  High-paced and explosive without relying on the Matrix tricks every film maker uses as a crutch these days.  This is truly what effects work can be with a some subtle computer work and a maximum of imagination.5.) The story.  While on the surface, the plot is a simple Beauty and the Beast story, the characters and unique setting add depth and complexity to the story.  In the end, their search for Dryland and the relationships formed along the way are compelling.  The conflict between the Mariner/Atollers and the Smokers is between those who try to live with the world and those who want to squeeze it for every last drop of life.6.) The little touches.  Subtle tricks help add to the already unique look of the movie.  The Mariner wears a computer chip as a necklace, a Rolex watch as a wristband, and ski boots on his feet.  The oil tanker is labelled Exxon-Veldez.  All of this reminds the viewer that they are still on Earth, even if it is not completely recognizable.All in all, Waterworld is a terrific movie.  Sure, the budget was high, but the look and style of the movie shows every penny went up on the screen. Stories of overinflated budgets and luxuries are just made up by those with no real grasp of how the film industry really works.   And in the end, like most movies, Waterworld still managed to make a profit...thanks to the miracle of video and foreign distribution.Besides, without Waterworld, the film industry would have never dared to make films like Titanic or Pearl Harbor, neither of which I think deserves to share the same sea!

Admittedly, is a disappointment as an anticipated blockbuster, but it features plenty of action and an interesting premise.  Suspension of disbelief is a must, but, hey, its the movies, so let that slide and enjoy the fun.The interesting premise of a drowned world is a two-edged sword.  While thought-provoking the the context of the current debate on global warming, it leads to one of the movie's weak points it is visually dull.  Lots of open water and empty sky.  Not unusual for an ocean-based film, but those kinds of flicks (for example, the World War II Victory-At-Sea genre) need a powerful hook to keep the audience's attention.  Waterworld tries in various scenes of sea-based battles and encounters with other Drifters, but it isn't quite enough to distract the eye from the empty and seemingly endless stretches of ocean.Similarly, Costner's character as a partially-mutated man-fish replete with webbed feet and functional gills, while necessary for the story line, challenges the suspension of disbelief a bit.  Those familiar with evolution will know that something this fully developed doesn't occur in hundreds or even thousands of years, but more on the order of millions.The other characters add some spice.  Of course, Dennis Hopper's over-the-top portrayal of The Deacon leads the list, although I could have done without the gruesome empty eye socket routine.  Sure, we know he was wounded by the Mariner (Costner), but just leave it at that, no need to shove it in our faces in every other scene.  A tattered-looking Jeanne Tripplehorn gives a maternally-appealing performance as Enola's surrogate mother and protector.  And, to be honest, even a tattered-looking Trippy is enough to tickle a young man's fancy.Overall, a decent action-flick, somewhat of a water-based Mad Max, as others have noted, but that adds to the fun.

When you go to see a movie like this you shouldn't expect too much in the way of realism in some aspects (remember Armageddon?) but it was perhaps unfortunate that, at the time this movie came out, I was teaching SCUBA diving.As an instructor you learn certain basic facts of physics regarding the sea which perhaps took the edge off this film's impact. For a start, the opening sequence depicts the world completely flooding when the ice-caps melt - I don't think so. Then we had Kev Costner distilling fresh water out of his own urine? What's wrong with all that sea water he's floating on? No ammonia to get rid of there, for a start. A lot easier.Finally, we had him taking Jean Tripplehorn down into the murky depths to show her a drowned city. Someone obviously never told the writers that air compresses under pressure, so her little diving bell's supply would have been compressed down to a bubble probably not much bigger than her head. Not to mention that normal air becomes toxic beyond a certain depth. Ah well.Despite these negative comments, I still like this film and watch it occasionally.

These guys just got snookered, plus they made some heavy false economies by going outside the film industry for key elements of the marine sets.

He was perhaps the biggest star on Earth for a brief period in the early 90s. Then came Waterworld. Then his boring 1997 flop The Postman. Though he still gets plenty of work, his star dimmed considerably after the mid 90s. Its kind of a shame, too. Waterworld was one of those films already declared a flop even while still in production. Though it underperformed at the box office, there have likely been many worse flops recently. John Carter, anyone? Any Lone Ranger fans out there? I haven't seen either, so let's just focus on Waterworld for this evening. I just saw it again for the first time in some years. Truth be told, it isn't bad. Some elements of it are down right brilliant. But there are others that almost make you cringe. Dennis Hopper's mugging would come to mind. Waterworld is just the damnest of movies. So close to being an epic action film, but just cannot get out of its own way.The plot is something out of the Mad Max realm of films. We have a futuristic world in which all the land seems to be submerged. We are led to believe this would have happened due to global warming which was more of a 90s buzz-word as opposed to climate change of today. Anyway, instead of petrol being the most sought after commodity, now we have dirt as being the most precious thing. Small groups of people live together in floating atolls where there is some semblance of organized society. So much of this plot and production design seem completely lifted from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, that someone probably got sued. I believe both films used the same cinematographer (Dean Semler) too! Basically if you made Barter Town float you'd have the atoll from Waterworld. But like Mad Max 3, this film also lacks any true sense of menace. The villains play almost every scene for laughs. Though Costner as the anti-hero Mariner is tough and resourceful like Gibson's Max, he needed a more compelling adversary. Dennis Hopper in this film is hardly as evil as Tina Turner. The supporting cast doesn't offer that much, either. Look closely for Jack Black in an early role as a pilot(!).What Waterworld has going for it are some incredible set pieces and action scenes. How cool is Costner's boat?? The tricks he uses to take care of himself and keep one step ahead of Hopper's army are what makes this film more entertaining than not. This film could have also helped itself by being a little more subtle, especially when defining its villains. They're a bunch of dirty pirates known as smokers who apparently use former Exxon tanker Valdeez as their flagship and regard its disgraced former Captain Joseph Hazelwood as some sort of hero. Uh huh. Overall, Waterworld is not terrible entertainment, however. Its inconsistent tone, and awkward pace are typical of films that had major production issues, and too many script treatments floating around. You want to see something really terrific by director Kevin Reynolds? Find a copy of The Beast or The Beast of War, as its sometimes called. That film it technically sound, exciting, and packs the gritty tone that the PG-13 rated Waterworld cannot quite deliver. Six of ten stars.The Hound.

The futuristic atmosphere also worked and the look of the costumes, ships and supplies were all realistic and fun. The action scenes were also extremely well handled and especially the ending with all the explosions and fires. The battles at sea were really just things we had previously seen in pirate movies but they were still fun. Costner also turns in a good, not great, performance in the lead and he at least keeps you interested in everything going on.

It takes WAY too long to get anywhere or DO anything.

Way too much money is spent, and the viewer tries to look hard at where exactly the money was spent...nobody I've spoken to knows where it went to.The action sequences are pretty lame and the only good one surrounds Costner sliding down a line as a bi-plane takes off from a oil ship.  The stunt is fine, though I could have thought of a better way to do it.Perhaps if the film focused on the action and concntrated less on building meaningless relationships and characters I might be interested.  But in the end I don't think I'd ever be satisfied with this film.  Perhaps its the amount of money they spent?  Or perhaps as it stands, its just way too uninspiring and boring.Overall 1/10.

Evolution has already produced the next step, in an antisocial semi-human known only as the Mariner (Costner).  The Mariner makes a rare visit to a floating human atoll, where, through various misfortunes, he unwillingly becomes host to a woman and a young girl (Tripplehorn and Majorino), and gains the enmity of the leader (Hopper) of a band of pirates known as Smokers.  The Smokers want the girl, because on her body is tattooed a map to the mythical Dry Land.  The rest of the film follows the escalation of this conflict to its fiery conclusion, alongside the gradual humanization of the Mariner.Critics love to beat up on the big stars, and certainly Costner is an easy target.  The most persistent criticism of Waterworld, however, is how much money was wasted on it.  Is implication that if the producers lied, and claimed they spent $100 million less than they really did, this would somehow be perceived as a better film?It is true that Costner was the weakest part of this film, and complaints about the absurdity of the premise (water covering even the mountain tops) are absolutely correct.  But if you accept the film as the fantasy it is, and concentrate on what the film-makers did well, there is a lot to like. The effects and sets are pretty darn nifty, regardless of how much money was spent on them.  The supporting actors- including the minor roles- were colorful enough to balance Costner, and the action scenes were suitably intense.  It will win no awards, and is certainly unsuitable for young children, but otherwise, sit back with a bowl of popcorn, suspend disbelief, and enjoy the ride.

This version of a post-apocalyptic hero on a nearly-impossible quest has a foolish plot and boring characters.Why do the villains need to hold on to the girl, when all they have to do is copy the map on her back? Even though she seems to have picture-knowledge of all kinds of dry-land flora and fauna, there is no indication that her knowledge is of any use in finding this lost paradise.The plethora of incidents after the Dennis Hopper-lead attack on the atoll is mostly redundant. The whole of nearly 4 hours could easily be reduced to 90 minutes by simply dropping many of these confrontations between Hopper's goons and Costner's side. $175,000,000 is the budget estimate, but very little of this actually needed to have been spent on this paper thin story with a nickel's-worth of plot.In comparison, THE ROAD WARRIOR is a tightly plotted, directed and edited work with interesting characters and with each incident moving the plot forward without relying on spectacular visuals. The characters are far more interesting and the sugary sentimentalism of WATERWORLD is no where seen.The traditional passage of the hero who comes and goes is far more poignant in ROAD WARRIOR, because his heroic saving of the oil truck of sand means he actually did accomplish his mission, despite the fact that he was misled about what is he was guarding.And, of course, it was easy to guess that the land/mountain they find would be Everest. This is a pale analogy to the Statue of Liberty at the end of PLANET OF THE APES.

It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.It's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts........It was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is not the flop, nor bad film, that many believe it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Sadly for the fans, Waterworld is still only (officially) available in the 136 minute cut, thus denying many the chance to see the more cohesive 176 minute version.However, as it is, the 136 cut of the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart.If it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails on that score because the characterisations are bound by clichÃ© manacles. But collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good v evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Good or bad - I am not sure","Date":"3 April 2008","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Hmm, it seem s to me that this is a Love it or hate it-movie, which makes it difficult for me, because I am right in the middle.

This world especially, because it does not show a desert. dried out land but a flooded world, where only the highest mountains were left as dry, firm land. This idea is transformed superbly into on-screen pictures. The boats, the atoll civilisation, the living as a drifter...even the submerged city are very nice. I even took the liberty of picking the whole idea for some RPG-Sessions. Then you have the acting side. Costner is a lone, quiet hero; Hopper is an ego-maniacal villain, Jeanne Tripplehorn is just gorgeous...nothing new or especially noteworthy here, but solid acting fare with no weakness. So the acting may be average, but not disappointing. The disappointment comes with the story. Though a great concept (search for dryland) it seems to be rushed (due to cutting 30 mins of it, I would assume) and concerning itself only with the action scene between the Mariner and the Smokers at the end. I don't know how much of this was the studios demand, but I would have liked a slower, more detailed development, like Costner showed in The Postman or Open Range later. The discovery of Dryland is a bit anticlimactic, happening after the big battle against the villain. That could have been placed better.All in all the movie has great ideas and beginnings, but a weak execution of them. That is why it never created a hype like the PoC or other similar multi-bucks movies.

Both Waterworld and Mallrats flopped big time at the theaters, but I think time has vindicated both of them and myself. Mallrats is now considered a classic and has launched the careers of Jason Lee and Ben Affleck. Waterworld made its money back, and while people still are heard to say didn't that movie suck? I think many elements of the film entered popular culture. I still think George Romero's Land of the Dead has strong parallels to Waterworld... and this movie introduced everyone to Tina Majorino, now infamous for her role in Napoleon Dynamite and appearing in Veronica Mars... but let's give it a second viewing.Two hours later This film can retain its rank as the second best film ever (right ahead of Demolition Man). If anything, I appreciate the movie now more than ever. Some critics ask where did they get all that oil and those cigarettes? but after watching the film and actually paying attention to the dialogue, it explains itself pretty clearly (the oil is running out, and they're on an oil tanker). Soem scientists are all like if the ice caps melted, most of the world would not be underwater - such as Denver or the water would become so non-salty you could drink it. And I say unto them, dudes, you're over-analyzing the film. Just chill. Although I admit I was curious as to why Kevin Costerner had to filter his own urine but couldn't filter basic salt water.

There was the scene where Costner dives to show the woman a ski resort area that was dry land.  The highest ski resort may be at 6,000 feet, tops? So Costner dove 23,000 feet down and survived where the pressure at those depths would crush even the most advanced submarine?Apparently this movie is at least 500 years in the future since dry land is unheard of and not even stories of the way the world was were handed down thru the generations.  But, they still have functioning gasoline engines, an oil tanker, centuries old cigarettes and even a VCR/TV setup with a centuries old video tape that still works!

Waterworld might be the most under appreciated movie of all time, and is a very important contribution to sci- fi, for the amazing decor and infrastructures, the phenomenal music, the number of people hired to play in it... No other movie has bothered to tackle the same subject, because even with CGIs it requires a lot of effort and work, something Costner did. I don't think people understand how brilliant Costner matches this role so perfectly, which is very hard; If you don't get it, then you just don't get acting. This is not Rocky Balboa 'brrrruubbrrruruhuhughg lightheaded acting, it took Costner a lot of effort and energy to play a masked cold angered mariner and does a few stunts at age 40 (he had a stuntman surfer doing the others). The Media of course, deliberately trashed this movie for recreation instead of praising the fact that it's incredibly ahead of its time think about it, no one had ever come up with that concept before, but Costner did. And then there's the issue of forums what we call the trolls, those who tag along and criticize just to criticize. The Media demonstrated its immaturity and autoproclaimed right to unfairly bash without taking any responsibilities. Costner was scandalously trashed by the press coalition that destroyed his marriage, they slandered, insinuating he had an affair, they kept reporting it in the tabloids headlines, reporting there were multiple incidents on set (most of it because of natural hazards that sunk a set and stuck Costner up on the sail), just because Universal didn't pay them to go watch the movie. They even said Costner's hair line was CGI effects ! And of course a ton of people hopped on the bandwagon. The story itself is great, a future covered by water and only one hope remains that a dry land still floats. One girl shipped into a basket wears markings that are coordinates to dryland. Her guardian Helen and an inventor protect her from the Smokers who have heard about her tattoo thanks to a leak (the Nord spy). Along comes the Mariner who can swim under the very bottom of the ocean, to pick up dirt and trade it on atolls but he is captured by the habitants labeled as a threat and a spy. The Mariner is released from his cage by Helen and the three take off on his trimaran in the middle of the Smoker attack, but the Smokers are determined to run him down and recover the girl. The Mariner then realizes the girl's markings are key indications but only he knows that the world has sunk and been covered up by water. They are ambushed by the Smokers who blow up his boat and kidnap the girl. The Mariner and Helen survive thanks to Grigor who spotted them up from his gas balloon but the Mariner refuses to run after the Smokers and decides to return to his destructed boat to recover the few objects left and sees drawings of dry land that match his national-geographic magazines and understands she is indeed a native of dry land. The final showdown takes set on the Deacon's boat that is overrun by the Mariner and leaves in the company of Helen, Grigor and the sheriff of the atoll on their way to dry land that Grigor has finally figured out the coordinates.I understand that at the time people were bothered by questions and I will urge them to go watch the complete version for three hours, it's out there on DVD and internet, and I guarantee you will get the answers and enjoy the complete version. It makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE. It's pivotal for the development of the story and characters, especially the Mariner. You look at Costner's performance in Field of dreams, Bull Durham, Dances with Wolves and Waterworld, not one of them are similar but Waterworld definitively reaches another level. The cast around him is very good, there are mostly very good characters, Hopper is hysterical but criticized because he's not cruel enough and looks more like a prankster. Maybe heiq, but he blows up an entire atoll and the Mariner's boat so I think that's good proof he is cruel. The negative would be the CGI - it is true that if you know the basics of CGI, you can spot the anomalies - the explosions that are offsync, the leviathan that swallows up Costner, when Costner has his boots off and his bare foot and back to wearing boots several times.... those are the regular anomalies that make this wonderful production unprofessional. Laziness ? Perhaps. But it was 1995. It would be a shame if Waterworld is not played again on TV in the full extended cut because the fans and the younger generations or even those who never saw it at the time, would discover a fantastic movie.

With Waterworld, however, he submerged himself entirely and hasn't really been able to rise above the surface ever since. This 'Mad Max on water' cost an enormous amount of money, but gained only modest success. (Though it was still better received than Costner's next post-apocalyptic vision, The Postman, which he directed himself. That movie was an undeserved box office bomb and a critical failure, though I personally found it thoroughly engaging, and overall a much much better film than either Waterworld or any part of the Mad Max franchise.)The lukewarm reception of Waterworld might be attributed to several factors. The mutant hero with gills and webbed feet or the bleak (and wet) vision of the post-apocalyptic world were probably not attractive enough, and despite the huge sets and the multitude of extras, much of the film is devoted to the Big Blue. The ocean is beautiful, no doubt about that, but it is a bit monotonous for nearly two and a half hours. And the happy ending is not so happy either. Our heroes do discover the coveted land, but the Mariner, being half water creature, gets sick of it, so he leaves his prospective family on the shore, and returns to the sea, his real home.The plot and the Mariner's character are, however, decently developed. (The weakest point is the illogical final confrontation, as the one person our hero truly jeopardises there is the child he tries to save.) The costumes made of fish scales look great (the Mariner's earrings are especially memorable), and Dennis Hopper in the role of the main antagonist is as wacky as always. Life after the great flood, as presented in the movie, seems more or less plausible, and there are no major problems with the dramatic structure or the pacing of the film either.

He's character showed real love for the ocean & his boat.The horde of Smokers assaulting the water fortress was epic, a rusting barge with a Oerlikon 20 mm cannon punching holes through the corrugated metal fortress and into flesh and bone was brutal . The desperate fortress citizens fighting back with bows and harpoons.Dennis Hopper was perfect as the smart-ass Warlord taking out floating Islands like chess pieces one by one with his armada of Jet Skies and suicidal Mad Max type warriors ....really this world had as much eye candy & back story as the Star Wars Universe.

But, of course, Waterworld isn't just any movie. It's an odd experience to have a movie largely survived by its spin-off theme park show (welcome to the post-1990s, folks). Of course, the notoriety helps too &#x96; choose your favourite moniker the film that nearly bankrupted its studio amidst its budgetary folly; Kevin's gate; Cleopatra of the '90s, and so many more. We've heard them all. But the real twist? Twenty years down the road, and it's not actually as bad as all that. Surprising, embarrassing, whatever you want to call it, but Waterworld is a clumsy but reliably enjoyable sci-fi adventure romp. Most will gear up to mock-watch it, but don't be surprised if you find yourself having more fun than you ought to be. Okay, sure, the bloated running time belies a false sense of self-importance, and the script (which Joss Whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on) is still famously idiotic, pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters. These are to be expected, though. What's more irksome is, in light of its decently interesting premise (yes, Reverse Mad Max will do nicely too), how under-explored the world and its culture are. We get brief glimpses of the waterlogged former society, and whiffs of the fear culture of bandits and scroungers trading relics as currency, sadly fantasizing about rumours of dry land, but there's so much left unseen and untold. We're left to infer that the floating locals' distrust of Costner's Mariner mutate is due to inherent human xenophobia (although his gills and webbed feet make him the most ideally suited to the aquatic climate, and they should really beg for his seed more. Didn't you see him in those tight pants? COME ON!), and we get an amusingly heightened pirate battle over a lime plant, but culture and context are largely forgone in favour of lots of yelling and sea battles, which, although enjoyable, makes the film more shallow (ha.) than necessary. Even more curious this hydropopocalypse seems to have no fish in it, apart from one blink- and-you-miss-it CGI croc-shark behemoth, which leaves the world feeling strangely barren. There's at least one moment where a Costner vs. shark fight appears inexcusably cut, likely for budgetary reasons (teehee). Good filmmaking rule of thumb never cheap out on a shark fight scene. The campier the better. Trust me. In terms of aesthetic world-building, Waterworld isn't afraid to put its money where its mouth is. The sets &#x96; entirely functional, and built with practical effects, a myriad of ramshackle, apocalyptic steam-punk rafts and abandoned steamships (the film's reappropriation of the Exxon Valdez tanker crash allows the film a smarmy bit of political satire to boot) &#x96; are, in lack of a better world, awesome, and genuinely visionary. Similarly, the film's slew of sea battles, a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea-doo acrobatics, are thrilling and a ton of fun. Throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by James Newton Howard, and we've wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow. Sit back, popcorn in hand, and enjoy.Naturally, fine-tuned acting is a low priority here &#x96; this is WATERWORLD, after all. Dennis Hopper, likely still nursing a hangover from Super Mario Bros The Movie, is really the only performer who owns up to the film's inherent campiness, and his snarling, teeth-gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining. Yes, the irritating double- act of Jeanne Tripplehorn and Tina Majorino as the shoehorned in, perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours (who can't swim in Waterworld, for crying out loud?!), but a brief appearance by the delightful Michael Jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone's face, and 'spot the pre-fame Jack Black cameo' is always fun. And then there's K-Cost (as no one has ever called him ever). There's bound to be a particular adjective encapsulating 'stoic, feigned badassery so stone-faced it's both thoroughly silly while occasionally sneakily working its magic, and is either way enjoyable, ironically or otherwise', but whatever the word, Costner brings it in spades. Just remember if you start to find yourself too taken in by him and his pants, remind yourself that a good portion of the film's already stratospheric budget was devoted to CGI-ing him a lower hairline. Works every time. Inevitably, it all boils down to an overly hasty and somewhat falsely utopic ending where Costner gets to play western hero yet again. Still, as daft as it is, Waterworld is too inextinguishably enjoyable to even mock-watch without some genuine affection creeping in. And for those wondering 'Okay &#x96; so if the sets and aqua-action are the best bits, why not just watch the Universal Studios show, which is basically just those, but without all of the extraneous plot and bad script?', I have only four words Dennis Hopper, Peeing Costner.

If it is indeed set hundreds of years after the Polar ice caps have melted then how the hell are they still riding around on diesel powered jet skis and boats, smoking factory-made cigarettes and firing ammunition despite no land and therefore no raw materials or facilities to make them. I can accept all the rest. The script is pretty cheesy and so is the acting. Because it was big-budget they've obviously gone for the family market instead of being brave and aiming for a more mature market such as the Mad Max films. Even if they'd gone down the route they chose but announced at the start of the film that it was set a few decades after the mass flooding took place it would explain the quite simply preposterous suggestions that the survivors are still using equipment from the present day. It's just abysmal writing and poorly thought out. Completely ruins any aspect of it being remotely feasible. Anyway, no regrets about waiting 20 years to see it.

With a very overblown budget, people had very high expectations about this movie, aside from the fact that Kevin Costner not only stars, but was not credited for co-directing the movie (along with Kevin Reynolds). It seems that Costner finds himself type-cast in the same roles we've seen him in before and after Waterworld (Dances with Wolves, Field of Dreams and Message in the Bottle) as a drifter trying to find a meaning to life while struggling with the world he's living in currently. The final product results in nothing more but one big mess. Not an immensely messy movie, but still enough to leave one fully disapproved. The idea for this movie is actually quite original in its rather cynical look into an uncertain future. But what really let the film down was the writing. Hollywood has proved that just because the settings are remarkable and the performances were pretty good, a movie of this calibre cannot survive on just those credits alone. Our movie shows us an Earth that has been flooded after the effects of global warming has shifted to epic proportions. The surviving humans' only dry areas are makeshift boats, self-built islands and other assorted floating contraptions. The inhabitants have the feeling of no hope in the search of finding dry land. Suddenly a hybrid appears on the scene and kid with a drawing of dry land tattooed on her back become the ray of light in finding, the planet's last dry land area. As they try to save humankind, palm trees are grown and coconut is offered for these survivors to live off by. The details have quite a lot of unsatisfying results which I will gladly elucidate. While, they show us their means of survival in this landless society that dwells upon them, the concepts never go into full effect which makes makes us care very little about them which at times becomes quite laborious to the point where I start to get seasick. I find it shameful that the nameless Mariner (Costner) may have the natural talent of breathing underwater, which is a talent to good use in this flooded atmosphere, he continuously get condemned for being a freak by the other inhabitants, which shows that their world and our world is no different in judging people who have rather unorthodox traits. Then you have nasty, evil villains who have no motive as to why they are bad to begin with. And these bad guys so smoke, therefore an overlong ant-smoking campaign appears in this movie where it should not be. So, the way I see these unlikable bunch, you have one decent civilian who's ostracized for being different, but at the same time we have villains for the sake of being villains. Hard to point the less of two evils. No? Top that off with pop culture references and you have an awkwardly absurd movie. For an enormous budget of over $175 million, the settings and the cinematography was very impressive. However, I still don't see the necessity of having to spend so much money on a rather simplistic set. I can see the effort put into building a floating landscape, but I think it would have been more frugal if they just made a non-floating scenario with more carefully crafted camera angles put into the film just to make it more vivid complete with a smaller budget. The acting was overall very overcooked in many areas. Dennis Hopper who plays the top villain as the Deacon seems to have fun here, but his role falls flat in the long end. Kevin Costner meanwhile, lacks the charm or panache as the Mariner as we wonder if he's being heroic to the people or if he's doing it for himself. The real standouts for me comes from Tina Majorino as the adorable Enola and Jeanne Tripplehorn as the legal guardian for Enola, Helen. After that the supporting cast were pretty much bland.If you like to see a more quality version of this movie, I'd suggest you purchase the Extended Edition DVD that was released in 2008. Featured there includes the theatrical release along with the edited out scenes that make the movie all the more better, by approximately 40 minutes. Although Waterworld movie is not complete failure, it's not by any means a theatrical masterpiece.

After all, he'd been given all the signs that the only way to secure success at the Oscars was to appear in a huge sprawling epic that crowbars in social commentary. So it would stand to reason that he would invest so much - personally and financially - to see this sprawling epic onto the screen. Sadly, lightning doesn't appear to have struck twice. There's no doubt that the film looks good on screen and it's plain to see where the money went. However, despite everything looking OK on the surface, the film is as deep as a puddle in a car park with barely a single cohesive thought between its watery ears. It simply makes no sense but hey, at least it looks good! Right? Some time in the future, the Earth has disappeared beneath the waves after the polar ice caps have melted. Drifting on the vast high seas is The Mariner (Costner), a stranger who gets by alone by trading whatever he finds. Arriving at a floating atoll, he finds himself imprisoned by the citizens who quickly have to defend themselves from marauding pirates known as Smokers. Led by the charismatic Deacon (Dennis Hopper), they are searching for a child (Tina Majorino) with a tattoo on her back which apparently leads to dry land. In the chaos, the Mariner escapes with little Enola and her protector Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but does Enola really have a map to dry land and is The Mariner really all that he seems? There is plenty to give praise to Waterworld for, chiefly the look of the thing. From the Mariner's odd-looking trimaran to the huge floating sets, it's much more than Mad Max on water. The action is also first-class as jet-skis blast their way through the sets, explosions rip the screen apart and stunt work is of an exceptional standard. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the acting which is almost as wooden as the floating sets. Costner holds the same expression throughout while Hopper hams it up tremendously as the pantomime villain. The other issue I cannot ignore is the apparent lack of thought behind it. Take the apparent value in a few scraps of paper - if paper is that precious then why does Deacon smoke so much of it? There are other gaping gaps in logic like how did so many jet-skis survive such a cataclysmic event (and keep working after so many years). If Costner is trying to preach to us then why throw in little comic touches such as Deacon's ship being the extremely rusty Exxon Valdez? Why do guns simply not hit anything beyond point-blank range (and jam whenever it's least appropriate) but harpoons can hit everything at whatever range and target it's fired or thrown at? For a film set on the ocean waves, it's the lack of depth that sinks Waterworld before it gets a chance to leave port. On the surface, everything looks fine but if you stop to look at it for any longer than a few moments, the cracks are all too visible. Whether the story needed more work or Costner's influence behind the scenes needed curtailing, it's difficult to know exactly where it all began to go wrong. It's not a complete bust - it's big dumb fun that undemanding viewers can appreciate somewhat but the question that keeps popping back in my mind is was Waterworld really worth all that wonga? Frankly, it's nowhere near worth it - remember that this was the most expensive film ever made until Titanic. It's fair to say that Waterworld is certainly one film that will be remembered but not for the reasons Costner intended. It is a monstrous testament to the ego of Costner and his mistaken belief that because he has Oscars on his mantelpiece, he knows best. Dances With Wolves worked because it was different from most westerns seen at that time and it had something to say about racial differences. Waterworld is basically your average post-apocalyptic blaster but set on the waves instead of a desert somewhere. If you can separate the film from the tide of publicity about it then you'll get a kick out of a mindless but well-made action flick. But good luck - the negative press acts as an anchor to the film, dragging it down beneath the waves. Nice try but at least it's not as plodding as another post-apocalyptic epic, the incredibly dull The Postman.

The sets are complicated and look suitably post-apocalyptic. Though if I'm being completely honest, I could have dealt with less grime. Mad Max 2, for example, had this dusty desert look that still managed to look cool and western-like, whereas this one is more about slime and mold, which manages to look... unappetizing. It's realistic, I suppose, but not exactly fetching.Aside from that, I'd say that the reason why people seem to hate this film is the fact that it's rather bland. Costner as the protagonist Mariner is blandness incarnate, Dennis Hopper as the villain isn't much better - though at least he's overacting, which is better than being bland - and the rest are just meh. No one is bad, per se, not even the annoying little girl (Tina Majorino), the MacGuffin of this particular ordeal, though she's the closest to being genuinely bad.What I like most are the mechanics of the ships and ports. The Mariner's ship especially is full of exciting gizmos and whatchamacallits that are enjoyable to watch unfold. They're not enough to save the film from being disappointingly average, but they're something.And that's this film. It's about as average as you can get. The story isn't particularly inspired, the characters are rather boring, the plot is nothing new, but at least the film has some interesting design ideas and as a whole there's nothing particularly wrong about it.

A lot of critics canned the movie for it's over the top material. While some of the cheesy lines can be a bit over the top, it's a great adventure movie. It felt like Road Warrior on Jet Skis. Water world is a unique post-apocalyptic film in which the entire world has become enveloped in water. However, even after the ice caps have melted and flooded the earth, humans have survived. Society continues on man-made floating apparatuses created using pre-apocalyptic ruins. These dwellings can range in size from boats to entire floating fortified communities. No governments exist as we know them now and society has become primitive and brutal and survival is found in strength and numbers. The main character is an abrupt and highly resourceful introvert played by Kevin Costner call 'The Mariner'. A Clint Eastwood 'Man with no name' type of a character, quiet, gruff, eccentric stranger with a strong, but unorthodox sense of justice. He finds himself in conflict with Deacon (Dennis Hooper) the leader of an evil gang call 'Smokers'. They are call 'Smokers' due to the fact, they smoke cigarettes, and use combustion engines to move around while everyone else uses Eco friendly ships. The reason of this conflict is the search of a map to a utopia place call 'Dry Land' which happens to be on the back of annoying young child Enola (Tina Majorino) whom Mariner is taking care of, with her mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) because they help him from escaping from being 'recycled' (death sentence) for being an mutant (Half fish, half man). It's a tug of war between Deacon and the Mariner on whom will find Dry Land first. Much of the movie's entertainment factor is found in the well-choreographed action scenes being presented on exceptional sets, which have a strong and specific theme. The movie had beautiful wide shots of endless oceans, giving the movie its Lawrence in the Arabia moment of survivors living in a harsh environment. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing, its main theme sounds like a savage epic that can be confused with Jurassic Park. Check out the song 'swimming' I didn't expect it to be quite beautiful. 'Escaping the Smokers' has this cool exotic futuristic swashbuckling tone. I'm still puzzled as to why so many people slag this movie off, as people might think the Mariner was too much of an ass. Let's remember, he was a drifter with long periods of loneness, and trust issues way before the two women enter his life, and after they enter, he doesn't know how to deal with them. There is a redemptive arc to him, as he teaching Enola to swim, and end up protecting her from the Smokers. It is everything I would expect if the world flooded and the survivors had to survive. People would band together and yes, people will have the close mindedness to change (Hating mutations). The pedophilia which the term only exists because of modern day society, in post apocalypse with small numbers, girls would be traded off the moment to rebuild population numbers. It makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is in a world that has been covered by water for hundreds of years, how come people still have items from the 20th century and early 21th century only? Not late 21th century or 22 century? Another is the 177 minute director's cut, don't watch it. You're better off watching the theatric version as the movie is too long, and wear down its welcome. The reasons why fans hate it, because it was average for a blockbuster for the time. Plus, it was the most expensive movie ever made. Hence a colossal failure relative to expectations, which turned into the running joke. People that hate it, probably haven't watch the film. If you haven't saw it. You just need to approach it with an open mind, and don't listen to all the bad hype.

And the trouble is - it shows.The rather nihilistic post-apocalyptic scenario that starred Mel Gibson is reprised on the oceans by the thinking-man's Donald Duck Kevin Costner, who directed and starred in it. So much of what we see appears to have been lifted and marinised from the Mad Max franchise that I'm surprised Costner wasn't sued for plagiarism of intellectual copyright. Perhaps he bought them off. That said, it may be that the scenarios presented in either movie are a fairly accurate portrayal of how our species would behave.Whatever the case, I think the first half is extremely entertaining, with some very imaginative Heath-Robinson contrivances and gadgets. I particularly like the Mariner's trimaran. Costner's Mariner is an interesting character, more subtly played than Gibson's 'Max'. Whilst Dennis Hopper makes a humorously wicked Captain Hook-alike. The rest of the cast just come along for the sail.There's plenty of action and it's well choreographed. Incidental music is aptly chosen to accentuate the drama of the moment. Lighting, editing, camera-work and other technical issues are all up to snuff. But - something's missing.From about halfway through it begins to drag. The plot seems to lose focus. The conflict and tension don't build in the way that a good action thriller should. Maybe it's Costner himself. He just isn't the action man that he likes to present himself as. I thought he cocked-up his telling of Robin Hood in broadly the same way.Even so, this is a movie that deserves more credit than it got, I think. Despite its rather dull one-dimensional star, there's plenty going on for most of the ride that will entertain. I also think it would deserve a PG rating, there's little that would jar the sensibilities of younger children. Sex and swearing are almost non-existent. Basically it's a good family movie - Peter Pan, with an edge. As to the 'Waterworld' scenario; there isn't enough ice on the poles and all the mountains to sink the land-masses so completely as envisaged.

This will not satisfy everyone but it certainly improved the film for the people that I showed it to. It answers some of the questions created by slashing away in the editing room.One thing that is for sure, the Atoll was as impressive an engineering undertaking as I have ever seen and the full scale military assault on it while it was floating in the Pacific was spectacular not only in real life but also on screen.Finally, Kevin Reynolds and Dean Semler shot a beautiful film under some very extreme conditions.

Costner is a drifter who aligns himself with a woman and child as he prepares to thwart the evil, megalomaniacal Smoker leader Deacon (Hopper).

It had an oversized price tag, but that is just an excuse. The film itself isn't so bad - which is why the criticism quieted pretty quickly after the film opened. Short mindedness is the greatest enemy a movie critic can face, and it seems not many are up to the task.I give this movie 6 out of 10. It doesn't live up to the price tag and is wildly over ambitious - but it is extremely entertaining and feels very novel being set almost entirely at sea. That the bad guys, the Smokers, are more of a bunch of clumsy, kiddie matinee evil-but-stupid smokers (!) are more to the films credit than anything. Without Hoppers REALLY funny character, this film would have been way too serious to pull it all off. Waterworld is the kind of film that I like to watch again and again - it's catchy, funny, weird and at times absolutely brainless. The cost of the film is bewildering, since it is hard to spot just what would be so expensive - and somewhere along the road priorities must have slipped some of the special effects are just awkward. To exemplify, one of my favorite parts of the movie is when the Mariner takes Helen down to see the world that has been buried by water. The special effects here are really bad and the moment is almost lost because of it. The idea is haunting and scary - just not very well realized.The characters are, more or less strange, imaginative and, to be honest, simple - the one standing out is Costner himself, never smiling, very bitter and angry all the time and with good reasons. Helen and her daughter are the only normal characters in this unusual film. My favorite character? The guy sitting in the oil tanks of the giant tanker (the Smoker's home base).There is a plot hole in the story, of course - but it must be the largest one I've seen and accepted at once melting the polar ice caps would not raise the sea as much as is depicted in Waterworld.

All the money thrown at it did not churn out a great movie, but I kind of enjoyed it in spite of myself.  The filmmakers had ambition and if in the end, the movie doesn't completely live up to the hype, perhaps no movie about a world covered in water could.A voiceover at the beginning explains that rising temperatures due to global warming have melted the polar icecaps, flooding the world and apparently eliminating dry ground altogether.  The few humans left learned to survive on the ocean, living on boats and man-made atolls, constructed from scrap metal.  Things we used to take for granted, like plants and fresh water, are a precious commodity, and dirt is used as currency.  Costner plays the Mariner, a loner who lives aboard a makeshift catamaran, and I had to chuckle at the opening shot, where he urinates into a crude filtering device which churns out clean water.  Nice touch.The Mariner docks at one of the aforementioned atolls, where business becomes messy when the locals discover he is a muto, or mutant, because of the gills behind his ears and his webbed feet.  He is sentenced to be recycled, that is, deposited into the waste pit to decompose and replenish the supply of waste products to be used for energy, I guess, although I was disappointed that the filmmakers do not show us what they do with the stuff. There are a lot of these little details in the movie I would have liked them to elaborate on, as to how these people lived.The Mariner escapes, of course, when the atoll is attacked by the Smokers, a bandit horde that ride the waves in jet skis and communicate with semaphore.  They are led by Dennis Hopper, in a trademark lunatic performance.  He is the best thing about the movie, injecting life into what could have been just another villain.  His headquarters are aboard the rotting hulk of an oil tanker (which supplies one of the film's jokes near the end).Circumstances force the Mariner to take a woman and child along with him, and we know for a fact that although he wants to throw them overboard at first, they will grow on him to the point that he will brave even the Smokers wrath when the child needs rescuing.  She holds the key to dry land, or so it seems, through a map tatooed on her back.The movie runs too long for its own good, even with a good deal reportedly trimmed out.  There isn't enough details about everyday life on a world covered in water.  But I had to admire the filmmaker's creativity in set design and the work involved, and had a good time watching it.

No doubt about that. It's set at some unspecified point in the future on an earth that none of us would recognize. The basic story is that the polar ice caps have completely melted and there's no dry land left - well, except for a perhaps mythical place called - appropriately enough - Dryland. It's implausible (actually, impossible) right from the start. According to my research, even if the polar ice caps did melt the water levels would rise about 200 feet. That's a lot, but there are a lot of things in our world taller than 200 feet - some natural and some man made - so the earth wouldn't be immersed in water to quite this extent. But, hey, it's fiction. It doesn't have to make sense. It has to entertain.For a while, it does that. At first it's interesting enough just to try to get a sense of this world. What's it about? Who lives on it? What sort of culture has developed in these conditions? We find out about those things through the eyes of the Mariner (Kevin Costner) - a lone sailor with a pretty interesting boat that seems to have lots of gadgets. Through him we find out about the Smokers - basically pirates - and we discover the atoll - a floating community in the middle of the ocean (but then again, isn't everything in the middle of the ocean if there's only ocean?) where the Mariner comes to trade. Here, he discovers a little girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) and her sort of adoptive mother Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who want to escape the atoll and search for Dryland. The Mariner gets in trouble, is discovered to be a mutant (with gills and webbed feet) and is about to be killed, when the Smokers attack. They want Enola, because she has a map tattooed on her back that they believe is a map that will lead them to Dryland. Why she has the map tattooed on her back is a bit of a mystery.The first hour or so as we learned about all this was pretty interesting actually. Costner was good; so was Tripplehorn. But the story settled into little more than a routine action/adventure in the last hour or so. Once we had learned the basics about Waterworld, there was nothing more really interesting about it, and action/adventures are pretty commonplace. You need something more to hold the viewers' interest. Yes, there's the search for Dryland, but that really just serves as an excuse for the Smokers to kidnap Enola, and for the Mariner to set out to rescue her. It has all the standard stuff you'd see in any action movie, there's nothing especially dramatic about the end of the search for Dryland, and the plot is full of holes.The first hour isn't too bad; after that I thought this simply ran out of steam.

Who knows, but the reality is, this is a very enjoyable movie with lots of different elements that make it worth watching several times.OK, there are some fundamental flaws with the science involved. It's been proved that if all the worlds ice melted, Waterworld couldn't happen. It's also unlikely that melting would happen so suddenly and dramatically to leave mankind virtually incapable of doing something about it, instead of a few pockets of life here and there among a largely dystopian society controlled by the Deacon And yes the Exxon Valdez was renamed and it's even more unlikely that cans of Spam would still be edible and cigarettes would still be smokable. As for weapons, if there was a cache of guns and ammunition in one of the cargo crates on board ship, if you mindlessly fire a four-barreled turret gun at anything it would deplete your supply of bullets fairly quick.Waterworld was designed more in the style of comic book come to life, instead of a period piece, so scientific accuracy was never going to be at the forefront of most peoples minds.Despite all the anachronisms in the film, it still holds together pretty well. Sure you can pick it to pieces but you can do the same for any of the Star Wars or comic book superhero movies as well. I don't recall anyone saying that the amount of energy needed to destroy a planet would render the Death Star useless, and somehow being bitten by a radioactive spider won't kill you but also make you practically invincible is more believable than humans evolving gills on a world that's now all but devoid of dry land.If you've never watched this movie then it's worth giving it a go and deciding for yourself.

If the ice caps melted, the world would not be covered in water. The oceans would rise like five inches, maybe. That's pretty much it. Also, if the planet really were covered in water, it would very promptly freeze over; with no means for producing greenhouse gases, there'd be an ice age very quickly, and without trees to filter out carbon dioxide, the atmosphere would become poisonous. Also, people wouldn't evolve gills like that, especially not that quickly. We'd be far more likely to evolve an ability to digest saltwater before growing gills. But you can chalk all that up to creative license; it's a fantasy movie, so who cares? How does it fare on it's own terms?Pretty damn well, actually.

Kevin Costner's performance seems out of sync with the rest of the film, being deadly stoic while the rest of the cast seems to be having fun. The budding relationship between his and Jeanne Tripplehorn's characters seems forced, and the collision that ends the final action sequence was probably the most ridiculous moment in the entire film.Yet, the film has plenty of bright spots as well. The cinematography is quite beautiful--though I confess I agree with those who would have preferred a wider aspect ratio to better reflect the scale of the film. The production design is impressive, particularly the atoll in the first act; the fact that CGI was used at a bare minimum greatly increased the awe-factor for this viewer. The action sequences are, with the previously-noted exception, well-done, engaging the viewer on a visceral level as a good popcorn flick should. And Dennis Hopper's Deacon steals every scene he's in, adding a needed dash of comedic spice that keeps the movie entertaining.Is Waterworld a great film? No, and an argument could probably be made that the end result did not merit such an enormous budget. But it is still an entertaining piece of summer escapist fare and, in my opinion, well worth watching.

When I saw the movie again on the BBC service, I felt like checking it out over here and I was overly surprised to see that this movie is from 1995. I expected it to be from at least mid 80s. The movie feels a bit like Espace from New York. The characters and the props would fit in the same category. The movie is very up tempo, but maybe a bit too stretchy, it just keeps going and there is not much of a story line, just that this guy has this nice boat, he tries to find this piece of land, and weird looking pirates on water scooters fire at him. Anyways, this is a fun movie to watch, it has these 70 style stunt moves with flying water scooters and enormous over the top explosions and over the top type castings. Also the props feel very low budget and the script is one written on a big stash of pot in one evening. But this makes the movie a lot of fun, it has this B movie cult feeling to it, it is so bad, it makes you laugh and actually enjoy it. You keep wondering what ridiculous thing will happen next...and I can promise you, it'll be more surprising than you could think off.

The Universal logo is 'drowned', visually demonstrating where we're headed.** Quick reality check...** There isn't enough water frozen in the polar caps to inundate the earth in the manner we're expected to accept here.

We as a culture routinely accept that we can be entertained by 'movie reality'.Nor is this in any way original...the point of departure is 'Mad Max' cross-pollinated with the 'Man from Atlantis'...but originality is not so important either.I think what's really missing is a compelling hero. This is Kevin's star vehicle, delivered to him at the point in his career that he could have anything, ANYTHING, he wanted. But he had no idea how to play this any way but straight. Being taciturn is not the problem...in comparison, Mel's character was no less tight-lipped. But he knew how to deliver Max with a wink and a nod. In contrast, there's no fun here, just a scene-chewing competition with Hopper (Hopper wins without much of a fight).Worst of all, it suffocates in moralizing; the evil 'Smokers' smoke up the cigarette supply, there is the last voyage of the 'Valdez', the global warming message is placed at the level of 'the sky is falling', but taken in complete seriousness...it's quite amazing how many viewers drank this Kool-Aid.As in Dances With Wolves, the canvas is stronger than the star...at no point can Costner figure out how to elicit the vision that the co-creators had in mind...instead, the blue panorama wins.

They could have had the same effect by just filming off the coast and keeping the land out of the shots.Second was the complete absurdity of it all, even if every bit of ice on Earth melted it still wouldn't be enough to drown everything and leave Mount Everest as the only dry place on earth.  (We're talking almost five miles of water!)  Not to mention how people would realistically survive decades (or centuries as the plot says) on the ocean, with storms and heavy waves and all that.  Then there's how everything seems to be made out of metal, which would rust and corrode like crazy in salt water, or the smokers floating around on the Exxon Valdez (which was renamed and sank for real a few years after the movie came out.) Or finally, why everyone didn't cling onto the last bit of dry land and fight for it, not lose it and forget where it was.  (?!?)Okay, ignore all that and it's a fair action flick with some good stunts, (although the skiing kamikazes was a little much) and for all practical purposes it's an aquatic Road Warrior.  Matter of fact the role seems almost cut out for Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner comes across as a last minute replacement, even though the movie was his baby.It helps to watch the version with the missing scenes, as some things are explained a bit more, (such as dry land being Everest) and some of those scenes contradict the rest of the movie, that apparently the ocean going population was relatively new and was dying out within these people's lifetimes.Maybe at some level the movie was trying to make a statement about people who squander and destroy resources (like the Smokers) as compared to people who try to live more in harmony with things, like the Mariner.

And it did deserve to fail at the box office, simply because of the lack of effort put into the storyline and acting.  The film takes place sometime in the distant future, where the Earth is covered completely in water after the icecaps melted.  Man now fights to survive on the hostile environment, and they must rely on fishing and trade as their livelihood.  One such man, the Mariner (Kevin Costner), is a mutation, a cross between man and fish, for he is able to breathe underwater.  He's a loner, and dangerous, too.  He eventually gets involved in a battle between pirates and colonists living on an atoll, which could lead to the possibility of the discovery of dry land.Predictable, dumb, and even pretentious; these words describe the film's script, which is a mishmash of elements stolen directly from The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, two far better post-apocalyptic action films.  The dialogue in this film can be excruciatingly lame, and the delivery of the dialogue isn't much better.The acting is quite uninspired, with another flat performance from Kevin Costner, who proves capable of all the physical elements, but not all the thespian qualities required.  Sure, he's a much better actor than, say, Sylvester Stallone, but he still has yet to put more emotion into his performances.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is better as the love interest, but her character is poorly written, and there's even an obligatory nude scene that only serves as an excuse for the filmmakers to show some skin.  Dennis Hopper has some funny lines, but his performance is mostly overwrought.There are salvageable factors to the movie as a whole.  A couple of the action scenes are decent and the stunts are sometimes borderline amazing, but it's all for naught if there's little joy behind it all.  Plus, all the material in between the action scenes weigh the whole thing down.  This isn't as dull as Costner's other post-apocalyptic film, The Postman, but it's just as unintentionally campy.

He gives the part an eerie, inhuman aura; the Mariner is a mutant human who has gills and can breathe water.Dennis Hopper also has an excellent role he's Deacon, the leader and captain of a seagoing cult of pirates with whom The Mariner tangles, the Smokers.So forget all those wise-acre cocktail party jokes you heard about this movie.

If it hadn't been a rip-off of the Mad Max movies, the story would have deserved more credit as decent light fantasy.The best thing that could have been done with the story would have been to rewrite it into a romantic comedy in a science-fantasy setting -- that would have taken advantage of its better points, and reduced its failure to be a strong high seas remake of Road Warrior.

Dennis Hopper plays his usual heartless villain and his inability to make you hate him actually makes you laugh, but the action sequences were great, as was the suspense. The story is basically about the future after the polar ice caps have melted and covered the earth with water. Mariner (Costner) in exchange for his life and against his better judgment picks up a woman and a young girl and begins a search for a fabled land that survived being submerged in water. Along the way adventures abound as an evil man known as the Deacon (Hopper) stirs up trouble for our hero. Costner should be given credit for his ability to create a futuristic world emerging from a post apocalyptic war or natural disaster, he did the same thing in the Postman in 1997. I think these two films even rival The Road Warrior which is based on future worlds where food, gas and water are in short supply.

Mad Max created a world without water.  Waterworld creates just the opposite.  Between the two, a waterworld has a more dynamic feel to it than a desertworld.  My ONLY pick with the flick is Costner's line in the beginning Nothing's free in Waterworld! he yells to a fellow drifter.  I figure that if everybody has never been exposed to dry land, than it would be just the world rather than the waterworld because there's no alternative to water.  BOTTOM LINE  I give it an 8 because it is highly entertaining.               And always has been.

And I do mean from the very start - from the cannibalisation of the Universal globe to show the water rising worldwide from the melting of the polar icecaps (to a level, incidentally, which would require the Earth to be host to many times the amount of water which is actually here), to the Mariner's final departure back to sea, having found sanctuary for the small band of humans, the thing is a good natured, and unique, romp.It makes no sense at all scientifically, of course - notwithstanding the aforementioned excess of water, there are countless other questions to which there are no reasonable answers (how is a sustainable population maintained with this tiny isolated clumps of humans? How did the Mariner develop gills so quickly? How come no-one else developed gills?) but this is a minor quibble.It is a visual treat, from the aquatic wastes, to the Mariner's craft, to the atoll, to the submerged city (my personal favourite part), and it boasts some fun performances, of which Dennis Hopper's scenery-chewing Deacon has to be the best. In fact, the only person who doesn't seem to be having fun is Costner, who appears to be taking the whole thing as seriously as if he was playing Hamlet. Had he had his tongue even slightly in his cheek, then this film would have been brilliant.As it is, it is simply great fun.

It's not as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be; it's at least as plausible as a James Bond movie, and people generally like those. The premise is interesting scavengers surviving on a flooded earth. You can pick apart the science behind it all, but if you can't suspend disbelief once in a while, you shouldn't go to the movies in the first place. Of course, this doesn't work for dreck such as the laughably bad Battlefield Earth, which didn't have a single bright star to rise above the mediocrity, but in Waterworld the characterizations and dialogue are pretty good. Costner is surprisingly effective as the fish-man he's not an instantly likable character, he's cold, aloof, inhuman, self-centered. At the very least, this movie deserves credit for having the courage to create a main character who isn't like every other summer blockbuster character to march across the silver screen over the last twenty-five years. He throws the little girl into the ocean, for god's sake. He also sells Helen to the horny englishman for a few sheets of paper, after dropping the sails onto her and konking her over the head with an oar. It is refreshing to see such an abject protagonist, and one so ripe for redemption; the film doesn't disappoint in that respect, because he earns his stripes without the unimaginative treacle usually associated with a big-budget film. For instance, when he teaches the girl to swim it's believable without being sappy.I think it's a shame to dismiss this movie as a flop without appreciating the evident work that went into the detailed characters and how they dealt with each other. Perhaps it's best to watch the movie from that point of view instead of wondering where they got the fuel for the jet skis.

I say who cares how much it cost, it is not my money!Hundreds of years ago the Earth was covered in water when the Polar ice caps melted due to global warming.  The Universal studios opening logo is used to illustrate this, to spectacular effect.  This is the setup for the film.  At the heart of this tale is a search for humanity, and a new world the mythic dryland.The fantastic settings are unlike anything I have ever seen on film, and the action sequences are breathtaking.  By filming almost exclusively on water the costs were excessive, but the film would have looked far less spectacular if they cut corners.  An example is the Atoll set.  Sure they could have built this as a miniature, but it never would have been convincing.  Going for broke (quite literally) with the settings is what makes the films look so amazing.The performances in Waterworld far exceed those of most Sci Fi films. Kevin Costner as the Mariner is at his best, playing an animal bent on one thing survival.  Slowly he humanizes before our eyes thanks to the characters of Enola and Helen (played by Tina Majorino and Jeanne Tripplehorn). The love that develops between the three characters is believable, only because of the excellent performances. Dennis Hopper is at his psycho scene stealing best in Waterworld.  He brings to the character of The Deacon the humor that is inherent in all of his roles.  When he is on screen as the religous head of the motley band of Smokers the film is at its best.  The Deacon believes in Manifest destiny and wants to do nothing more than find dry land and knock down trees, and build a golf course in the name of progress.  Scenes between Tina Majorino as Enola and Hopper's Deacon are mind blowing.  Hopper plays these like a bad Uncle you would never entrust your child with.Some things are explained in better detail on the network television airing by ABC, which restores nearly 1 hour of material.  To have a complete understanding of the film and how great the story is, that version is a must.  Yet the theatrical version is  spectacular, with a wonderful heart that I fear is to often missed.

It made the world of `Waterworld' seem fairly solid - well, liquid and solid - in spite of many failures of forethought (a polite term for `idiocies').  I intend to list some of them.Kevin Costner has a device which, powered only by gravity, refines urine into clear, fresh water.  We see him urinating into it as the movie opens.  Did it occur to him that he's on a boat?  Why doesn't he try pouring seawater into his device, if he's so damned thirsty?  I know it sounds disgusting, but it's worth a try.Well, that's just the opening scene.  We get slapped with a few similar stupidities that Joss Wheedon ought to have noticed and removed while he getting paid thousands of dollars a day to sit in Hawaii and doctor the script - not that I blame him in particular.  But - well.  These are what we might call `scene-specific' flaws.  However stupid the urine processing machine is, it has no particular bearing on the movie as a whole.Other idiocies DO have an impact on the script as a whole.  The poor grasp Hollywood has on biology is painful - and this matters.  Kevin Costner, a `mutant', is presented as the first of the breed of the future, the amphibian who shall inherit the Earth.  (There's also a giant fish that ... oh, never mind.)  The view of evolution this entails is too wacky to contemplate.  -Well, let's take this out of the `science fiction' category and class it with fantasy.  This is a mark in its favour, if anything although the fact that it pretends to be science fiction so earnestly is a mark against it.  There's nothing wrong with honest fantasy.But alas still there are problems.  We never get a good view of the sociology of the floating world, which could have been fascinating; and we see altogether too much of an over-the-top bad guy, who was just dull.  (And why do villains always have to have a centralised power structure?)  The caricature of an Austrian inventor who comically fumbles with his balloon belongs in SOME kind of fantasy, to be sure (perhaps `The Wizard of Oz'), but not this kind.  The story disintegrated into inappropriate formula the further it progressed.  If you feel tempted to only watch the first two thirds, that would be a wise thing to do.Yet I can't find it in my heart to condemn too much.  There was a decent futuristic fantasy here, struggling to get out.  You can see its outlines through the gauze.  And the spectacle really is great.  We may never see its like again.  Digital floating cities, designed by people tapping away in front of a computer screen ten hours a day until they forget what anything else looks like, seem to be the way of the future.

At the time, Costner could really do no wrong - he had made some great (JFK, Field of Dreams, Dances with Wolves) and some extremely popular (Robin Hood, The Bodyguard) movies and was on something of a role. However, Waterworld cost over $200 million, and took ages to complete. And therein lies the problem - people's expectation.If you didn't know how much this cost, and provided you haven't seen Mad Max 2(Road Warrior), then this is probably a visually spectacular film that is fairly enjoyable. However, there are those people who can't see past the movies budget problems, and so take the opportunity to ridicule everybody involved with the film, when it really wasn't as bad as the critics made out - and actually made a fair bit of money world-wide.I managed to overlook the budget, but what I couldn't forgive was how much similar to Mad Max 2 this movie was - too similar I felt. Which is why for me, it really wasn't that enjoyable. I suggest that you watch this movie first, then go and seek out Mad Max 2 - you'll probably find that MM2 has more tension and better direction, unlike Waterworld, which only manages to contain a great opening battle and that's about it.4/10.

I then sat back and watched the rest of the movie, never once questioning the credibility of the events portrayed.  While watching Waterworld, I asked myself several questions throughout  If the world is covered in water, where does Dennis Hopper and his army get the tobacco for the cigarettes that they chain smoke?  For that matter, where do they get the paper in which they roll the tobacco, and where do they get the cotton to make the filters?  Oh yeah, and where do they get the dyes or whatever it is that cigarette companies use to color the paper brown around the filter?  Oh, and where do they get the lighter fluid and flints to operate their Zippos?What I suppose I'm trying to say here is that if Kevin Costner's search for Dryland had been as interesting as Inspector Gerard's pursuit of Dr. Richard Kimble, or Kimble's search for the one-armed man, I'd have been preoccupied with other matters, but Costner's pursuit from, and battles with, the Smokers never (ahem) caught fire.  Surrounded by so much water, how could it?  The most expensive movie of its time has some nice underwater photography, and some convincing heroics from Costner, but mainly what it offers is proof that Zippos, the world's most famous lighters, are apparently as durable as their makers have always claimed.  (By the way, the reference to The Fugitive is, I think, appropriate since David Thowy gets a writing credit for that film and for Waterworld.

A man known only as the Mariner (Kevin Costner) has some dry dirt to trade at a small floating community called The Atoll, the Mariner uses the dirt to buy a few things but gets into a row after being exposed as a mutation with webbed feet & gills behind his ears. The Mariner is sentenced to death but before it can be carried out a group of crazy thugs lead by the Deacon (Dennis Hopper) during which the Mariner manages to makes his escape but with a young woman named Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) & a young girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) who has a tattoo on her back that is supposed to lead the way to dry land & it was Enola that the Deacon was after. Now in a quest to find dry land Enola holds the key & the Deacon will do whatever it takes to get her...Directed by Kevin Reynolds this notorious giant misfire from Universal Studios has a very bad reputation amidst all the unsavory reports that were coming from the set during filming & of course it's at the time world record 175 million plus budget, while the whole production seemed like a sure fire disaster & while I doubt many look back on Waterworld as any sort of classic it's actually not that bad a film & if I might be as so bold as to venture an opinion I thought it was quite enjoyable. Available in both the regular theatrical cut & a extended TV version (but not a Director's Cut) with an extra 40 odd minutes edited back in I will be basing my comments on the original theatrical version. Despite the huge amounts spent on Waterwold it's nothing more than a Mad Max 2 (1981) rip-off, the similarities between the two films are striking with the only real difference being that Waterworld is set on water. There's tough uncompromising hero who's a loner & has his own souped up vehicle, there's an guy with a flying machine who saves the day on a few occasions, there's the befriending of a young child, there's the peaceful community who at first imprison our loner hero out of a sense of distrust but then he saves from from an attack by a bunch of crazy outlaws lead by a bald headed guy as they both look for a precious commodity, in Mad Max 2 it was petrol while here it's the way to dry land. As far as post apocalyptic rip-offs go Waterworld is quite good, there's plenty of action & spectacle here from fights to jet-ski stunts to exploding oil tankers to flying planes & the like, it's all done on a massive scale & you can see where the money went at least if nothing else I suppose. The character's are OK, the Mariner is a little stiff & doesn't have much personality & it is never addressed why he is or how he became a mutation but I can really relate to the Deacon since we have something in common. Early in the film he loses is right eye & I have been there as diabetes blinded me in right eye & I have to say he took it very well, I was devastated when I went blind in my right eye & still am (I haven't been the same person since) but he laughs it off as a joke which is odd but there you go. At over two hours long it didn't feel slow at all, in fact it moves along at a great pace & there's plenty of action & incident.The story isn't the only area where Waterworld is a Mad Max 2 rip-off as the costumes & rusty beat up look of the production design are very similar in appearance & tone. The action scenes offer plenty of bang for your money with huge explosions & some great stunts & there's even an underwater city scene although why the Mariner would have a home made diving bell since he can breathe underwater is another question. Considered a huge flop at the time one wonders how Unversial let it get so out of control (the original budget was $60 million but ended up being $175 million), I mean a 1,000 ton floating set that was a quarter of a mile wide, over 2,000 individual costumes & a script that apparently underwent 36 different drafts though six different writers. The dirty post apocalyptic look is there & it looks nice enough but does get a little repetitive by the end.The biggest budgeted film ever made at the time the money is on screen, filmed in Hawaii & in California. The acting isn't great, Kevin Costner is rather wooden while Dennis Hopper is fun as the main bad guy.Waterworld is nowhere near as bad as it's reputation suggests, as a Mad Max 2 rip-off set on water it's pretty good, just forget the baggage that the film comes with & enjoy it for what it is. It's safe to say there will never be any sequel although the Waterworld theme park attraction at Universal Stuidos is quite cool, I know I've been & seen it.

A futuristic tale based on the idea that the polar ice caps have melted, flooding the earth and forcing humans to take to ships and huge floating 'atolls', Waterworld is basically, as more than one critic noted at the time, Mad Max on waterskis, but nevertheless entertaining for all that. Costner is the dour 'Mariner', a mutant who - as the result of humanity's long exposure to the ocean - has developed gills. In short order he arrives at an atoll, is condemned to death by its populace for being a 'muto', but then is freed by the feisty Helen - played by the lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn - and her adopted daughter Enola, in order to help defend the floating town from an attack by the 'Smokers'. A band of ravening bandits who utilise fuel to drive their souped-up waterskis and powerboats, the Smokers are led by the evil Deacon - Dennis Hopper enjoying himself as a one-eyed madman - whose sole aim is to locate a young girl who carries on her back a tattoo; the map to find the fabled 'Dryland'. Needless to say, the young girl turns out to be Enola, and Mariner and Helen are soon engaged (the former somewhat reluctantly, to provide the requisite grizzled charm) in a mission to protect her from the unwonted attentions of Deacon while simultaneously trying to decode the mysterious tattoo on her back. So far, so dystopic, but the real pleasure of Waterworld is in its execution. It's a tightly made action movie with a lot of incidental humour and great attention to detail. The cinematography, by Aussie lenser Dean Seamler (who won the Oscar for shooting Costner's 'Dances with Wolves'... or should that be, 'who won the award for shooting Costner...?') is beautiful and the production design, sets and costumes fantastic. Writer David 'Pitch Black'  Twohy is on solid ground dealing with sci-fi themes, although the dialgoue sometimes clunks (I have sailed further than most men have dreamed! Kevin, was that one of yours?) The only real downside, in fact, is that Costner is obviously on an ego trip here, taking himself way too seriously. His 'Mariner' character is a grim, almost wordless assembly of tough guy mannerisms and poe-faced self-regard. It's compensated for by Tripplehorn and the great exuberance of newcomer Tina Majorino as the child Enola, who's habit of covering Mariner's boat with drawings soon drives him around the bend. Also, which would have played better as a straight, essentially light hearted romp, occasionally veers towards the dark side. Someone - presumably alleged director Kevin Reynolds - has tried to tilt the film as a whole towards a kind of high-camp action feature, so the odd injection of ultra-violence or woman-beating comes as something of a shock. On the whole, though, forget about the over-budget, over-schedule, director-wrangling hype (the film actually ended up making a hefty $300m for Universal) and give it a rent.

Okay, let me back up on that.  I would actually like to wait around two plus hours to see the whale.  As for Waterworld. . . nah!Let's get to the basic flaws.  We know it is a sort of Mad Max rip off, right?  Well the funny thing is that Dennis Hopper plays his bit as a big joke.  And he is damn funny.  I'm sure the Costner crowd was trying their mighty best to convince Hopper that Waterworld was serious social drama.  Hopper made them look the monkey's uncle.  I can only guess as to why Dennis Hopper made the Deacon into a cartoonish freak.  Well, my guess is that Hopper read the script and realized the whole concept was a freak.  I might add, there is nothing wrong with any of this.Unfortunately, Costner, and the rest of the cast continued to play their characters straight.  The Mariner remained tough, aloof, and above all, serious.  In fact, the Mariner's seriousness was often portrayed as nothing more than murderous cruelty.  I posit that the Deacon had more sense of purpose than the Mariner.  Although, the filmwriters, probably reaching the same conclusion, added comic lines for the Deacon near the end of the film when he describes why he wants to get to dry land.  Succinctly, it is to churn up land and chop down trees.  Please!  On the  contrary, what does our Mariner in fact do when he finds the paradise?  Well he pack up and leaves of course, back to the desolation of endless water.  Well by default, churning up land and chopping down trees is the wiser course.It should also be noted that the bad guys are smokers.  This cryptic title is reinforced by the fact that these folks constantly chainsmoke.  No, I am not making this up.  It seems, cigarettes and pure hydro are the barter items of choice.  Of course, with the bad guys (i.e. smokers) they just crave smokes.Another point of contention lies with the smokers' choice of vehicles.  They opt for mid '90's Jet Skis (imagine that), replete with combat paint that tries to makes them look like they are made of steel (they don't).  The Jet Skis' mother ship is the redoubtable, Exxon Valdez (isn't that clever), with the patron Saint of the smokers hanging prominently in the Deacon's cabin.  Who is it?  Why it is the Captain of the Exxon Valdez himself who was on duty when Alaska was wiped off the map in the worst ecological accident of all time.  Please note the hyperbole and sarcasm in the previous sentence.  Again, I ask you, is this clever or rather, environmental sentiment run amok.Fortunately for this film, Hopper's comic appearances save this wreck from the notorious rating of one out of ten.  Hopper really is funny in this one, and it must still crank Costner's Jet Ski that the production company cast him to give a non-comic preformance.  I could go on and on and on. . . but why.  This film rates a two out of ten.  This may improve with camp value.

However, no one is more absurd than the Smokers, the WATERWORLD equivalent of biker gangs who steal and plunder, use copious amounts of oil and, of course, smoke cigarettes...and often all at the same time. Dennis Hopper plays their leader and is yet another great over-the-top villain in his resume. My only quibble is that he's mostly absent for the middle part of the film. But even beyond that, even past the science, the script just isn't that good. It did a decent job of setting up this world, even if it does require major suspension of disbelief, but it resorts to too many clichÃ©s to drive it forward. The worst of these is using the child in peril trope as the major conflict to be resolved in the third act. Gene Siskel didn't care for it, and neither do I. Ultimately, when compared to other post-apocalyptic films, or even Kevin Costner's own work, WATERWORLD doesn't hold up too well. Still, it is an entertaining action flick as long as you check your brain at the door.

Well this is one of the strangest and most amazing films I've ever seen. And it's a hell of a lot better than Titanic. I'm confused as to exactly what I just watched, but I really enjoyed it. The cinematography is superb, there are beautiful sequences like Costner teaching the kid how to swim. But then on the other hand you have Costner throwing the kid into the ocean, collapsing a heavy sail on top of a woman, and almost pimping her and the kid out to some guy. When both women challenge his authority he cuts their hair short. I can't tell if this film was taking itself seriously, or being completely tongue-in-cheek; maybe both. Then to make things more confusing, you have Dennis Hopper, as Deacon, leader of the smokers, some kind of cult that's after dry land. His performance is absolutely hilarious. It does look like *beep* he says when someone puts some kind of eyeball in his eye socket after his eye was blown out. Dry land is not our destination, it is our destiny is another great one. There are a million others. Well I'll be damned, the gentleman puppy. He's like at turd that won't flush. I don't know, you have to see it to believe it. The little girl Enola (alone backwards) is some kind of chosen one who draw pictures of things from dry land when dry land wasn't underwater. Still with me? She has map to dry land tattooed on her for some reason and the smokers are after the map so they can find dry land, so Helen, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Costner's Mariner (a half human half fish thing) have to protect her from the smokers after they raid and destroy the sea-town. In one of the film's funniest moment, Enola antagonizes Deacon and he backhands her. That kid takes a lot of abuse in this film. Well what can I say, it's a must-see. As a fantasy film, it definitely holds up; hugely entertaining. The weird ships and contraptions are outlandish enough, and the photography good enough to make the film visually very pleasing. The performances are hilarious, not least because they were done seriously, although Hopper was definitely fooling around. I actually love this film now, it's a favourite. Highly recommended.

And this might be a weird thing to say, but I really liked what they did with the logo (the Universal logo becomes the flooded Earth of the future).Anyway, I thought the special effects and action scenes were good, especially for the mid-90s. The soundtrack was nice. I thought the acting was good as well (I'm really not too demanding when it comes to acting, though). Some may say Kevin Costner doesn't show much emotion but I thought that fit with the character. And I thought Jeanne Tripplehorn (Helen) was very beautiful and I thought she acted her role well. Dennis Hopper is great. And I thought Tina Majorino played Enola pretty well. And I was actually really interested in the world. Yes, the Earth wouldn't be completely flooded even if all the ice on it melted, as you can see here (sorry, I had to add some spaces in the URL because IMDb won't let me submit the review with a long word or something) http// ngm.nationalgeographic.com / 2013/09/ rising-seas /if-ice- melted-mapStill, I can suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the movie. The writers gave enough detail about the dystopian world of the future but not too much, so there was still kind of some mystery. I would really have liked to see more of the future dystopian Earth. And I thought the technology was kind of cool, especially the trimaran of the Mariner (Kevin Costner's character). It's definitely not a perfect movie. Some parts of the plot were a bit illogical, like the whole thing about Dryland and the tattoo on Enola's back. Actually, that's the main story. And Dennis Hopper's oil tanker galley is kind of strange. Umm...well, it's still a fun, if somewhat cheesy, movie.

Anyway, Waterworld is a story about a post-apocalyptic world where the water levels rose dramatically and there is one girl that may hold a key to a solution. In simpler terms, it is Mad Max 2 but on water. The story is interesting, even if a bit simple.It has awesome atmosphere though - arguably what this movie is all about. The feeling of drought and general lack of supplies in a waterworld is well transferred to the viewer. It shows how everyone except Kevin Costner's character does not belong in this new world and supports why, despite having adapted to survive, everybody desperately wants to get out.Kevin Costner and Dennis Hopper really make this movie work, the latter as the bad guy is especially entertaining to watch. The relationship between the various characters is also really good. The girls that require Kevin's protection had a good albeit odd chemistry with him.Does it have a few stupid moments? Well, that is like asking whether or not it is an action movie. Yes, yes it is. But it has good pacing, good funny moments, good human moments, good acting, great atmosphere and it just generally a well-rounded action-adventure movie.

Kevin Costner Damn. And I mean damn. This character is a gritty look at what could happen to someone who has been forced into a life of pure hardship because of his differences.

He really brings something to the performance that I don't think anybody else could have.Script It's kind of goofy and kid's movie-esque, but, it really brings to light the side of humanity that is still relatively unexplored.

But then again every homosap is rendered a marine mammal in a big wet world. Costner sails an awesome transformer trimaran that makes the Milleneum Falcon look like a piece of junk. Can the Millennium Falcon sail through space using a giant kite? No! Early in the film, Costner enters a floating junk heap where shark ribs are the meal of the day and dirt is not exactly dirt cheap. But tension rises like a high tide when Costner refuses to whore himself out to a family looking for a seed donor. The water reaches a boiling point when the atollers examine Kevin's ears. Turns out that flotilla folk don't think highly of fish fellas. When Kev has to escape, he gets caught in a particularly clingy relationship with Helen and an unwilling adoptive father of a tatted toddler who has the cutest tattoo you've ever seen. The odd trio find themselves caught between the Deacon and the deep blue sea. The Deacon is a charismatic redneck pirate played here by Dennis Hopper. Problem for Deac is that if Costner's around, these waters are a no smoking zone, so Deacon's Smokers have their waterwork cut out for them. In the eyes of Deacon Hopper, Costner is a turd that won't flush. That's because Costner is a turd that won't go down without a fight. He's a turd that kicks ass. If you're a fan of cute little girls with tattoos, but not in a creepy way, you should check out Waterworld and yes, that is Jack Black as the pilot of the skyboat.

The survivors are 'drifters' that wander the sea in boats surviving by trading and other groups of people living on 'atolls' - floating structures. The protagonist group - 'smokers' have an oil tanker as a base and survive by launching raiding parties on the others. Food and water are scarce and technology is primitive - mainly mechanical. Everything in Waterworld (clothing, equipment etc) has a rundown/recycled look.Kevin Costner plays the 'Mariner' - a drifter, who it turns out has evolved fish-like capabilities and does not quite fit in with the other people encountered. He plays the tough, survival hardened hero, that slowly softens over the course of the movie. The leader of the Smokers - the Deacon (Dennis Hopper) is played at times with comedic effect.The storyline revolves around character interplay and the quest to discover the mythical 'Dryland'.I didn't find the film overly long (135 minutes) as the evolving storyline/action kept my interest. The film at the time of release attracted controversy (cost over runs) losing money at the box office. The film is also not particularly politically correct - the 'Smokers' are literally, well, smokers. The treatment of women for a 1995 film, could be criticised.I enjoy post-apocalyptic films (Mad Max, Terminator Salvation etc). Interestingly Dean Semler was cinamatographer - also cinamatographer for Mad Max 2 and 3. Kevin Costner played the anti-hero well, I thought and the quality was high due to the big budget. With the at times comedic role played by Dennis Hopper, the film does not take itself too seriously. 8/10.

Most noteworthy are the attack at the atoll by the smoker, the airplane sequence, and the brief fishing part that stayed with me.2) I am surprise of how good the supporting characters are. Especially Michael Jeter, Kim Coates, and even the Jack Black brief appearance are very entertaining and interesting to watch. Not many people notice but Kim did a great job with his character.The GREAT PARTS 1) The music by James Newton Howard is one of the best I have heard in a movie. This is one of the two ONLY great aspects of the movie. My favorite are Swimming, and Deacon Speech. They've been used in countless movie trailers. Listen for yourself. It's great.2) I thought that Dennis Hopper performance was great. It's darkly humorous. His timing, gestures, and eye contact (yes eye contact) are very spot on and wonderful to watch.Extended Version There is an extended version out there that contains over 30 minutes of additional footage. Most of the extra scenes establishes the character more. Too bad that this extended version is rid of violence, cuss words, and nudity.Sequel It would be a dream come true for me to see another film made about Waterworld. The premise of water flooding the earth is silly but in an alternate universe this setting deserves more development. My hope would be a follow up story about the Mariner's child who is a mutant outcast in the village who sets sail in search of his father. I also do believe that it would even better if the sequel was in full hand drawn animation. It's more cost effective and the medium allows for more imaginative setting.Overall, I think this movie should be vindicated as an action movie on the same level as Indianana Jones, Mad Max, and the Westerns.

I really loved when I first bought it on VCR, and when I recently bought it on DVD with better sound and picture, and watched on my big flat TV with surround system, I got the idea of how it must have been when it was shown on cinema.

It is relatively mild with respect to violence. A kid could almost watch this movie, except for a couple of disturbing scenes.The worst aspect of the movie is that it fluctuates wildly between parts which are really well done, and parts which just caused me to roll my eyes. At one point, our hero dives to the bottom of the ocean with no special gear, and the women who goes with him seems not to require returning to the surface slowly to avoid the bends.There is any number of places in the movie where suspension of disbelief becomes rather laboured, due to incredible luck at being in the right place at the right time. One character is able to hit a plane with a harpoon at quit some distance while aiming straight it (rather than in front of it, to compensate for its motion during the time it takes for the projectile to hit it), to give another example of hard-to-believe scripting.I could go on for pages about things like this, or bad lines, or poorly choreographed action, or unsuitable mixing of humour and seriousness, or incredibly corny details of various kinds, but in the end, if you can accept that it is just a second-rate action-fantasy movie, you may have a fun time watching it.

You can say that this movie is like a Mad Max version of a post-apocalypse world, only set at sea. Only problem is; they made the story look about as least interesting as it can get.There are several issues with Waterworld and the directing and story are definitely two of it. The story itself had definitely potential but there are several problems with it. The concept was good but the story itself is for most part too simple and childish. Of course when one of the main characters of the movie is a child, the movie itself also very easily tends to become a childish one. This is definitely the case with Waterworld. The movie fails to focus on the good and interesting elements of the movie and it instead chooses to lay the emphasis of the story on the Mariner (Kevin Costner) and his building relationship with Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and Elona (Tina Majorino), which happens to be the least interesting aspect of the entire movie. It makes the movie more of a drama like one, rather than the cool action flick it could and should had been. It also seriously takes the pace out of the movie. The middle of the movie is especially too slow and filled with rather needless sequences and long boring shots of nothing but blue water and a boat. So it's not just a bad, simple, childish story but also bad storytelling and directing by Kevin Reynolds and Kevin Costner.The movie and the story could perhaps had worked if they had made out to be an interesting one. They firstly could had done this by creating a different main character. Having a character who rarely speaks and who also happens to be a mutant for reasons unexplained in the movie, just isn't a terribly interesting one. The fact that Kevin Costner plays the part also doesn't help much. Nothing wrong with his acting in this movie, after all he rarely says a thing, but its more that he doesn't have enough charisma to play a cool and interesting action hero.The storytelling feels completely incoherent at times. For instance the main villain of the movie, played by Dennis Hopper, basically only pops up at the beginning of the movie and later again toward the ending and finale of the movie. This happens with a lot of characters. The characters are also all extremely stereotyped and they are another reason why I regarded this movie is a quite childish one.The villains are definitely a good thing about this movie. The Smokers are a pretty cool bunch of modern pirates. Dennis Hopper is delicious villainous in his role as their leader. When he enters the screen the movie revives but like I mentioned before he is way underused in the movie, which makes his role also not as memorable as many of his others.After watching this movie you can conclude one thing; shooting at sea is expensive. Appereantly this movie cost $175,000,000 to make but his is nowhere to be seen in the movie. Yes sure there are some big and good action sequences but nowhere or anymore spectacular than any other, less expensive, action-flick from the '90's. To be perfectly honest the movie even looked quite amateur like to me at times but this may also be due to the at times childish story and way of storytelling.The early special effects are also not really quite convincing enough.The musical score by James Newton Howard on the other hand is surprisingly good, spectacular and uplifting. Every once in a while Howard delivers a brilliant score. Waterworld is one of those scores.When action occurs on the screen, its definitely a fun and entertaining movie to watch. The movie is just basically your average summer popcorn flick. The action is brought well to the screen and in those sequences the pace is also good and high. It helps to make the movie still worthwhile and also quite an entertaining one. Its too bad that the less interesting elements of the movie drag down the level of the entire movie.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A movie too dark","Date":"13 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" There are four basic reasons this movie failed at the box office.1) People don't like an unsympathetic 'hero.' The hero here is basically indistinguishable from the villain. Both of them are ready to kill the little girl on a whim. Both of them are survivors.That's just too dark to start with. But this movie, for all the laughable elements, really wanted to explore the darker side of a post apocalyptic world. And that meant reaching down into the heart of the human darkness.Which meant a protagonist as scarred and as hurtful as any movie villain you've ever seen.2) The genre is uneven I mentioned the funny elements, right? Basically, somebody imagined this as an action-comedy at some points. It's not a slapstick by any means, but it contains enough irony, sarcasm and generally humorous mayhem to fill a boat.And a lot of it is, again, dark. HAving a pirate operating dual machine guns start shooting at his own men because he can't hear them yelling at him to stop over his noisy machine guns? Pure corn.But it works, because of the darkness. It works as a garish, black sort of comedy--see point one. Audiences weren't ready for that kind of darkness. (Exhibit a Brazil, a much more cerebral movie, that also had this problem) And, finally, the third reason; A lot of very good stuff was left on the cutting floor. Until you've seen the uncut version (very hard to get hold of) you really are left thinking, boy, the Mariner changed his mind in a real hurry when he decided to go back and save the girl. Well, if you'd seen the long scene where he decides instead to abandon her, the whole thing begins to make sense... but it's darker. Go back to point 1.Point four. This one is the worst. The happy ending at the end? SPOILER!! The fish-man goes back to the ocean, leaving everyone else alone on the land.It's NOT a happy ending. Go back to point 1. It's a dark ending--but, it's an honest ending. Everything we know about him is that he's at home out there. He thrives out there, where nobody else can even survive. They gibber into madness and sink, an inch at a time.He loves it, and we can tell.And audiences at large couldn't handle an ending that brutally dark. Even if he saved the little girl, the idea that they really couldn't live happily ever after as a nuclear family was just too honest to the tone of the movie (the one they didn't like, remember?) And now, let me tell you what I REALLY think.Scientific honesty is all well and good, but what I'm really interested in from a movie is emotional honesty. I want a movie that will actually ask, how civilized are we really? And how human will we look to an outsider, a new species? This movie stays true to that dark thesis. Everything else--the garish, lurid humor, the ending--just supports that.

Films like 'Freddy Got Fingered' which are so unbelievably bad that you'd rather cut your genitals off with a rusty bread knife. Or films which have so much money put into them, that everyone then hits the roof when the film just isn't that good. The perfect example of this later case is 'Waterworld'. Starring Kevin Costner, 'Waterworld' has gone down as one of the most expensive mistakes of all time. It cost a fortune, and it delivered little in return. When people condemn it though, this fiscal aspect often negatively influences those comments. 'Waterworld' is a mess, there's little point denying that, but at times it is an entertaining mess. Partly saved by a hammed up performance by Dennis Hopper, it is one of those films that you would never dream of owning, but you'd happily sit and watch if it were on television.In the future, the world has flooded. With dry land now a myth, people live out their lives either as drifters or as part of a small community. One such drifter is the Mariner (Costner). When he finds himself in the company of Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and the mysteriously tattooed Enola (Tina Majorino), the Mariner finds that he is being chased by the pirate like 'Smokers' and their leader Deacon (Hopper).Brought up to date from the start, the opening of the film suitably informs us of the geographic state of the world. It is at this point though that we are brought speeding down to the water and straight into the action. Introduced to Costner's moody and rather annoying Mariner, we never really achieve the entertainment level of watching the world flood at the beginning. Whether it's the dumb humour, the occasional extreme violence, or the childish interaction between Costner and Majorino, the film never really evolves into any special.Ironic when talking about a film set entirely on a water based planet, many of the typical comments you could use are of a distinctive earthy nature. Whether you state that it never really breaks any ground, or it digs itself into a hole, so many lines are made redundant through the general situation of the story. In itself this is a shame, mainly because if your going to review such a mediocre film, the least you could do is sprout a list of ironic puns.If there is to be one saving grace for 'Waterworld' it is going to be your over the top, daft bad guy, and whilst Dennis Hopper is never quite the bad guy that you want him to be, he does provide you with the occasional piece of comedy worthy of mention. Hopper over acts throughout the entire film, and he makes no excuses for this. The actor is there to have fun, and who can blame him. He pushes the barrier between daft and pointless, but he never quite passes it. He isn't given a well written character, and this is a disappointment, but Hopper himself is a small comfort in this mediocre and turgid affair.'Waterworld' was a financial disaster, and more often than not this is used as an excuse to hate it. This is incredibly unfair. The film is a mediocre and often pointless event which never really looks like it has spent the money it is meant to have. Mostly thanks to the acting of Dennis Hopper in an extremely over played bad guy role though, the film does retain a little dignity and can be occasionally entertaining. It's not a film you'd dream of looking for in a shop, but you can't help but watch it when it features on television. Distinctively average.

The same black sense of humor and scrap-yard props can be found here. I enjoyed the first two Mad Max-movies (especially The Road Warrior) quite a lot, and maybe that's why i get a soft spot for this movie as well. Granted, this is no masterpiece and i still hold The Road Warrior a better movie, but as a Mad Max substitute this works.There was a lot of discussion surrounding this movie when it first came out. Most of it was about economics. The movie became catastrophically expensive before everything was said and done, and the ratings at the box-office were a great disappointment. But i felt too much focus was directed at this instead of at the movie itself. This is not too shabby actually. Costner is his usual boring self, but Dennis Hopper seems to enjoy himself immensely as the antagonist. Also most of the movie is well made technically with several nicely filmed action sequences.So if you can forget about plausibility, forget about studio politics and ignore Kevin Costners wooden acting, this is actually quite enjoyable.

These days, you never hear such complaints about the budgets because movies as expensive as Waterworld are becoming commonplace, and most blockbusters these days are packed with CGI as Waterworld was not, thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was (filmed on the water, sinking sets, tough conditions, it's a miracle the movie was even finished).Costner's performance works on exactly the same level as the Connery portrayals of 007 straightforward, grim, stoic, a little mean-spirited, a little cruel, unafraid of dirt, grime, death, or salt water.It's not perfect by any means. Costner hacked it to pieces in order to accommodate the two-hour-running-time maxim imposed by the studio, so that corporate could get their investment back. Now is the time for the extended DVD version; maybe that will explain where all those cigarettes came from, what happened to Mount Everest and how the Smokers converted raw crude into gasoline.Costner bashers should get over themselves and start giving George Lucas what he deserves.

I love this film and hope that maybe the next generation will appreciate it.Waterworld is a post-apocalyptic story in which the polar ice caps have melted and people are left out in a gigantic ocean that is Earth to fend for themselves. Anyone who doesn't recognize the genius of the manipulation of the Universal Studios logo to illustrate this in the beginning is nuts. Yet, Waterworld does not preach about global warming or the irresponsibility of past generations that probably led to this catastrophe&#151;it is a straightforward story of people searching for a myth called&#133; Dryland. Between interesting basic ideas (melted poles), amazing locations, incredible set designs (the trimaran boat that Costner has is awesome), fast-paced action, and well-delivered lines (cheesy one-liners are kept to a minimum)&#151;Waterworld is a fantastic adventure. Dennis Hopper is a total psycho as the one-eyed badass Deacon and Costner fits the part of a brooding, difficult man-fish hybrid.

It cost over a hundred million bucks to make. Small fries by todays standards, huh? Where Troy cost $200 million for no real apparent reason. CG films don't cost that damn much, and that's mostly what that was. But at the time, it was a big controversy. One could actually see people with the attitude that if it costs that much, it must really suck. It was also plagued with nasty rumors of going way over-budget, having a lengthy running time (just over two hours), and stories that Kevin Costner was in it. Well, he was, and this was before his reputation was heavily damaged with stuff like The Postman. He was still riding high on the success of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.This film takes place in the distant future, long after we modern humans have totally f*cked up the planet and global warming melted the ice caps and covered the world in a spiffy layer of one giant bottomless ocean. Humanity now lives on boats and floating villages in sparse little populations. Basically, humanity is on it's last legs. Costner is our hero--all action, little talk, gruff and selfish. The bad guys are called smokers and they're led by the ever entertaining Dennis Hopper as he uses rhetoric and cigarettes to keep his minions in line. They wander the globe on the crusty Exxon Valez oil tanker, which was apparently repaired just in time for the end of the world. And everyone's after one little girl who has a tattoo on her back leading to mythical dry land.Here's the breakdownThe Good--Impressive sets. The floating city called the Atoll is actually pretty impressive. More impressive yet is the fact that they actually built this thing for the movie and used it as a sort of floating crew quarters during filming.--Good acting all around. The little girl is one of the better child actors I've seen, and her character is portrayed quite realistically. Pretty much all of her actions are what you'd expect from a stubborn little kid.--Jeanne Tripplehorn's brief nudity!--Costner doing a lot of his own stunts, thinning hair and all!--Very nice musical score.--Tons of action to keep us entertained. Complete with rampant gun violence and explosions.--Dennis Hopper is extremely entertaining--the majority of the film's best dialog belongs to him.--Good atmosphere and decent cinematography throughout. A lot of underwater shots, as one would expect. A lot of tracking and action shots as well.--Interesting story, especially for being released theatrically. These days, this kind of stuff is now relegated to half-assed Sci-Fi Channel films.--Overall, good special effects and make-up. Costner's gills look good, but his webbed feet not quite as good--but we hardly see them.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--Despite the decent acting, the dialog is occasionally somewhat cumbersome and clumbsy. Not nearly as bad as something George Lucas would write, but not exactly perfect.--Some cheesiness here and there. In the writing, dialog, or characters. Granted, these futuristic humans don't have a whole helluva lot going for them, and a lot of them are getting pretty crazy.--A few shots containing CG elements which, while they don't look perfect, for some reason, they still look a lot better than some of our modern CG-laden films. *cough*vanhelsing*cough* One involved Costner fishing for a large sea creature for dinner, which I actually did not remember being in the film way back from my original viewing.--Decent compositing work on some underwater scenes. Nice visuals on the now ancient ruined cities beneath the waves.--Not exactly scientifically accurate about the realities of such a scenario--with the earth flooded over and all. (In reality, the atmosphere would likely be so dense with moisture that breathing would be next to impossible.)The Bad--Costner's ego, while somewhat under control, does creep into the foreground now and then.--Very cheesy action elements during the film's climax--including a bungee cord.The Ugly--Dennis Hopper's replacement eye!Memorable Scene--Seeing the ruined ancient city underwater. (Note the submarine inside the city.) Thankfully, it's not something clichÃ© like showing us New York City all ruined. That's been done to death in films of this nature.

The stunt sequences are simply too boring to even care about, and while Costner is one of the biggest movie stars of the past two decades, action man he ain't.Inexplicably, the direction team seems to have given Dennis Hopper a carte blanche to shamelessly overact whenever possible. While this style was disarmingly effective in some of his earlier movies (such as Blue Velvet), he is just laughable here producing an array of facial contortions complete with the frequent eye-bulging symptomatic of a drug addict. If this is supposed to be the point, it fails miserably, as Hopper's maniacal laughter and irrational gesturing made me want to personally set fire to his union membership forms. Costner is far more restrained (some have argued that Costner is never anything OTHER than restrained) as the mysterious boatman with the novelty earring, and he is somewhat believable in his role without ever really getting under the skin (gills?) of his character. The real problem lies in the the performance of Jeanne Tripplehorn, as the the maternal survivor of Hopper's plot to destroy their floating communal home. Quite simply, Tripplehorn is disastrous, on a par with Madonna in Swept Away and your choice of Affleck or Lopez in Gigli. I'm trying to think of terrible performances, and ultimately Tripplehorn shares the award with Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled. Suffice to say, she's not up to much.The romantic moments (usually a reliable facet of typical Costner films) have little or no chemistry due to the detailing of Costner's character as an emotionless iceman. But to be fair to him, I wouldn't have any romantic inclinations towards Jeanne Tripplehorn either.That said, Waterworld has its moments. The occasional action piece is well constructed, and the conclusion (whilst a sentimental cop out) is satisfactory.Overall, though, this is a blot on the careers of all involved.4/10 "},{"Title":"Pretty bad.","Date":"26 September 2005","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I was excited to see Waterworld when it came out back in 1995.

What did Costner see in the material? I don't know. Whatever it was, it seemed to put his career on hold for more than a few years. Even when he came back, he never really came back. It's interesting that Costner has made two disaster post-apocalypse movies...this and The Postman. You may be asking yourself why a man as well-adjusted as Costner has a fixation on destruction and chaos? Well, there's only one answer I have no idea.

I can imagine the polar ice caps melting and flooding the majority of the world.  Jesus, look at the Greenhouse Effect.  And has anyone else noticed how weird the seasons are anymore.  But this movie is true sci-fi.  First, you have the not so appealing cast.  Kevin Costner takes the lead, and does a great job.  He plays a mariner that has evolved from normal homosapiens.  He now has gills to help him live in this future world.  So it makes sense that he should have more street smarts and belongings than most.  But the Jeanne Tripplehorn character stank as bad as the fish in the water surrounding them.  I could see any actress cast in her spot.  She brought nothing to the movie.  Jesus, young Tina Majorino did a better job in this one.  And she is probably triple her age.  But the main star that made this movie what it is, would have to be Dennis Hopper, my favorite actor of all time.  He plays the ruthless, greedy, fearless tyrant, The Deacon of the 'deez.  Exxon Valdez that is.  He is the only one with a half a brain in this film, besides Costner.  He decides to take the helm and draft as many drifters as he can to be in his army.  And it is a race against time to find the greatest prize, dry land.  Full of great dialog and wonderful battle scenes, this movie should be viewed at least once.  I will admit that there are a few slow scenes, but shouldn't be skipped the first time around.  My friends and I based a shot game on this movie.  I have seen it twenty times easily.  So I guess you can sum up the movie by saying that it is a journey to find dry land, if it even exists.  And just like 98% of all movies, it does have a happy ending.  But Hopper doesn't go down without a fight.  I rate this movie 4/5 for the presence of Dennis Hopper and all the aquatic battle scenes.  I would at least rent this one if you aren't brave enough to buy it.  Of the record, Costner directed a few of the sequences in this one.  Probably the best Kevin Costner movie I have ever seen.

Fortunately, a gang who smokes and uses gas powered vehicles attacks and a woman and girl free the gill man (Costner) and they get away.  There is apparently a map on the girls back that gives directions to dry land and the rest of the film is them trying to find it and trying to rescue the girl who gets captured by the gang.

The visuals were lousy, the dialogue demented, the battle scenes limp-wristed, and the characters despicable, one and all.It really figures that Costner also served as a co-producer for this grate-on-your-nerves piece of junk.Not only was Costner paid $14 million to star as the Mariner, but he also raked in a percentage of Waterworld's gross profits, as well.

Mankind now exists within several key groups slavers, smokers, small communities and lone sailors who trade their way as they go. One such trader is the Mariner, a tough, lone man who mistrusts everyone &#150; a mistrust that is proved correct when a community spots he is also a mutant and sentences him to death. Before it can be carried out though, the Smokers attack and the Mariner is able to escape thanks to a woman and a little girl. However the little girl also happens to be the only existing map to dry land and the Mariner finds himself pursued by the Smokers.Everyone knows that the critics had buried this one before it even reached a single screen. It is rare for critics to see horrible movies &#150; few of these make it to the cinema &#150; so whenever they get the chance to write a scathing review, they tend to take it and run with it. However as the critics moved onto the bandwagons of other years, Waterworld has been left to stand for itself and be judged on its own merits. When you look at it as it actually is, the film just sits as an OK blockbuster, nothing more but certainly nothing less either. The plot is a cross between Mad Max on water and the standard tough guy coming to love little kid things that provides a plot driver and supposedly an emotional way in. In creating a good story, it doesn't really manage it because it is too full of holes and lacks a real sense of engaging motion and characters but then, isn't that something you could say of many blockbusters.The creation of its own future is pretty well done and it all looks good even if it does lack any sense of logic. Again, I don't understand why it got such a kicking because to my eye it looked pretty good considering the challenges of shooting on water. Too many lazy reviewers (professional and amateur alike) have jumped on the all at sea line when talking about the performances and, although few are that great, lazy joking is rather a critique. Costner goes for a dark hero but misses a bit and ends up just being a bit unrelatable until his predictable sea change (sorry) at the end. He is still OK but didn't help me get into the characters. Tripplehorn is basic and her character could have easily been played by anyone. Majorino is annoying of course but then she is a typical cute kid role and nothing more. Hopper at least has fun and he does add a bit of enjoyment to the film where the others are forced to treat the material a bit more seriously; the film's high points generally come when he is on screen. The rest of the cast fill the space but don't do a great deal else but then, like many blockbusters, this is not an actor's film.Overall then, critically mauled and great fun for critics of the time but in essence it is just another in a long line of average blockbuster movies. The cast aren't great, the story is so-so, the action is enjoyable and the design of it looks good (albeit a bit too much indebted to Mad Max). Nothing special about it and mostly memorable for the kicking it unjustly received but if you are looking for an apocalyptic summer blockbuster then there is no reason why this shouldn't do the job.

While spending money (or even without spending much), why not make a coherent, believable world?  Costner did the same thing he did in The Postman.  He took an interesting, fruitful premise and killed it with humorless acting, self-aggrandizement, and a need for too many action shots.  (The Postman, BTW, was originally a *wonderful* book by David Brin.  Now my memory of that book is tarnished by the memory of the movie.)How, we are left to wonder, could hardened mortals survive without the Mariner or the Postman to guide them?
