Jiminy Cricket goes about his large library, feeling fun and fancy free. He has a run-in with a giant cat, not to mention a doll and a teddy bear. He notices the bear and doll's expressions seem glum, so he decides to put a musical story on the phonograph (record player). The story is called Bongo, and is told and sung by Dinah Shore. It was about three bears, but no Goldilocks. These were different bears. The story revolves around a young circus bear named Bongo. Bongo was the star attraction at the circus. The fans simply loved him. But unfortunately, his keepers did not. After every show, they slapped the cuffs on him and threw him into his cage. This was no way to live. One day while the circus train was heading to the next town, Bongo heard this voice calling him. It was telling him to break free and live free. So Bongo successfully broke free from his cage and, on his unicycle, rode into the picturesque Bambi forest. He encounters squirrels, chipmunks, and all sorts of animals. At first, Bongo tries to climb a tree unsuccessfully, causing his new animal friends to laugh at him. Bongo didn't get much sleep that night due to a loud caterpillar. Well, Bongo found that the new free life was anything but pleasant. But that would all change the next day.         The next day, Bongo unsuccessfully tries to catch a fish, and then he sees HER. A cute little girl bear that Bongo instantly falls in love with. Her name was Lulubell. Things were going great for them until a large, giant, mean bear named Lumpjaw came along. He wanted Lulubell for himself, so he knocked Bongo about. But Lulubell came to his side and showed her love for him by giving him a slap. Bongo did not understand. Lumpjaw fell instantly in love when Lulubell accidentally slapped him instead. See, that is how bears express their love with a slap on the face. Well, now Bongo felt even worse than he did before. He decided to get Lulubell back. But Lumpjaw put up quite a fight, throwing boulders and swinging trees. But luckily he swung himself right down a water fall with Bongo in tow. Luckily Bongo was caught on a ledge, while Lumpjaw fell into the river below. He was carried away with the stream and was never seen again. Bongo was a hero. He and Lulubell lived happily ever after. Back to the present, Jiminy Cricket learns of a party being thrown by Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd, and Edgar Bergen- whom Jiminy had never heard of. So Jiminy decides to attend the party. Bergen, McCarthy and Snerd were entertaining a little girl, Luana. Edgar Bergen then tells them all the story of a place called Happy Valley. It was called that because everyone and everything that lived there was always very happy. This was all because of a magic harp who would sing a beautiful song everyday. But unfortunately, one fateful day, a dark shadow was cast over the land. The magic harp was stolen!         Well Happy Valley was no longer happy. Crops dried out, so did the river. And three local peasants, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy faced starvation. Donald could take no more and tried to butcher their only posession a cow. But Mickey thought it would be wiser to sell the cow in order to buy food. Unfortunately all Mickey got for the cow were some magic beans, which Donald instantly threw away. But that night, a large beanstalk began growing under the house which carried it and its three occupants up above the clouds. Mickey, Donald and Goofy awakened to see a giant castle in a giant land. But once they entered, they saw something that set their hearts aglow giant food! They dug in. But with all this giant stuff around, there had to be a giant PERSON that lived there. And sure enough, the giant came home! Willie the Giant had the magic power to turn himself into anything. Mickey decided to trick Willie into turning into a fly so they could swat him. But Willie was wise to them. He locked Donald and Goofy in a box, but luckily Mickey escaped and found the magic harp that had been stolen from the valley. So while she sang Willie to sleep, Mickey swiped the key to the box, and so Donald, Goofy and the harp made for the beanstalk. But Willie woke up then and tried to grab Mickey, who flew out on a champagne cork. They rushed down the beanstalk and began sawing it down. They did it! The beanstalk fell, and Willie the Giant fell...CRASH!! Back to the present, Mortimer Snerd was sad over the death of the giant, but Bergen explained that the giant was fictitious and wasn't real. Just then, Willie the Giant looked in and asked if anybody had seen Mickey. Bergen fainted.          And so ends Walt Disney's 9th animated masterpiece! I feel it was very well done, just like all their other brilliantly animated and live action features. This one features the celebrity talents of Edgar Bergen and Dinah Shore. And featuring the voices of Cliff Edwards as Jiminy, Clarence Nash as Donald Duck, Walt Disney as Mickey (for the last time), Pinto Colvig as Goofy, and Billy Gilbert as Willie. Sadly, nobody from this film are alive today, but I'm sure at the time they knew that had a true gem established. Seeing Mickey and the Beanstalk brought back alot of memories from when I used to watch it as a kid. So if you're in the mood for a funny, touching musical in the Disney tradition, then do see Fun and Fancy Free today! Back in the days when animation actually meant something! I recommend it!!

In it are a couple of wonderful and terrific stories Bongo, and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Again, this movie has everything that you would expect in a Disney classic. Also, look out for more great Disney friends, like Jiminy Cricket!!!!!One interesting fact did you know that Walt Disney, the man who created Mickey, was the voice of Mickey Mouse? In Mickey and the Beanstalk, Walt Disney himself voiced as Mickey Mouse, and that would end up being his last cartoon to do so.So, this shows that movies like this just aren't made anymore. (sniff) But still, watch this movie with your children, enjoy it, and have a whole lot of fun with Fun and Fancy Free!!!!! 10 out of 10 stars.

We have a musical number from Jiminy Cricket that was intended to be used in Pinocchio but was ultimately dropped. Then there's Bongo, a musical tale all about a circus bear who finds himself falling in love with a wild bear he meets in a forest. But he doesn't understand the meaning of her actions when she slaps him. And last, but by no means least, we have the superb Mickey And The Beanstalk - a Disney take on the classic tale that I have seen before, as a standalone cartoon (a much preferred way to view the thing, in my opinion).While most of the material here is enjoyable enough, it's not really the classic stuff that most fans feel everyone must see. The opening musical number by Jiminy Cricket is cute and enjoyable but it really just serves to link in to the story of Bongo, which is really a bit of a damp squib. The characters aren't endearing enough and the style veers between the good, the bad and the ugly (and, of course, the recycled).The second half is where everything picks up but even this is not without negatives, mainly the live-action framing device for the tale - a creepy bit of interaction between Edgar Bergen, two of his dummies and a young girl. It's unfunny, unnerving and ends up contributing to a narration to the animated fairytale adaptation that proves quite irritating.There were four directors on this one, and numerous writers, so it is yet another animated movie best left to be discussed based on what's on the screen. In that regard, this isn't a bad time-filler at all. It has a number of things dragging it down but still manages to pull itself to a position of just above average. "},{"Title":"A highly uneven and odd hodgepodge.","Date":"8 January 2011","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Family, Music","Review":" After WWII, the Walt Disney company released a couple feature films that were actually nothing more than a few long cartoons strung together to feature length. The result were movies like this one as well as Make Mine Music and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad which are essentially movies that seem a bit disjoint, as the theme that links the shorts is tenuous at best. Here, Fun and Fancy Free is a vague term and really has nothing to do with the cartoons. In addition, the quality of the two cartoons is quite different.The first cartoon, Bongo, frankly is awfully lame. Despite having some nice splashy colors, the story is weak and should have supported an 8-10 minute film--not a short running over a half hour. Plus, so much of the film seemed like filler--with LOTS and LOTS of singing from Dinah Shore and others. It's the story of a miserable circus bear who longs to be free. But, when a chance opportunity occurs and he escapes, life in the wild isn't as easy as he expected. Apart from a few cute characters (including a girl bear--you can tell because she has a flower growing out of her head), there isn't much to recommend it. I assume kids of the day really were bored by the cartoon and its watchability is not great. I'd score this one a 4---mostly because the animation is pretty good.The final cartoon is the one kids will love, as it features Mickey, Donald and Goofy. Oddly, however, unlike the first cartoon, this one features a lot of live-action--with Edgar Bergen and his puppets entertaining a cute little girl with a Disney-fied version of Jack and the Beanstalk. In this version, the three heroes take on the mean giant--wonderfully brought to life by the voice of Billy Gilbert. While it's clearly a variation of an earlier Disney film (The Brave Little Tailor), it still is very watchable and cute. Not a brilliant film, nevertheless it actually makes Fun and Fancy Free worth seeing. Plus, fans of Edgar Bergen will enjoy seeing him and his characters. I particularly enjoyed Charlie's 'Udder failure' comment. I'd give this one an 8.Overall, it's a highly uneven and odd hodgepodge that, frankly, is not especially great viewing. However, the accompanying documentary about this, The Story Behind Walt Disney's Fun & Fancy Free is a lot more interesting than the film itself--so if you get the DVD, be sure to watch this in the special features.

I did think the live action sequences were dated though, and the film is quite short. Out of all the characters, the only character I didn't care for that much was the puppet. Apart from the hilarious well she used to be a good milker, but now... she is an udder failure he didn't really make an impact on me. Maybe it was because the ventriloquism was rather substandard.However, I really enjoyed this on the whole. The introduction with Jiminy Cricket- voiced by the one and only Cliff Edwards- in the library was very effective, as was a vast majority of the script. The animation is stunning, and by far the best aspect of the movie, and I hope I am not the only person who found the songs beautiful and memorable, my favourite being My what a happy day.There are two mini-classics here, Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Both are wonderful gems, but I will admit I do prefer the latter. Bongo tells the rather simple story of the adorable Bongo and his endeavour into a world he has never known before, after being the star attraction of a circus. It is very sweet and well meaning, and the narration isn't so bad either. Mickey and the Beanstalk is a favourite of mine. Wonderful voice acting, terrific animation especially for the beanstalk and nice music made this memorable for me.Other things that impressed were one Jiminy Cricket of course, well how can he not impress, he is a classic character in the history of animation? Two, I thought Edgar Bergen was very entertaining in this film asides from the ventriloquism, and also child actress Luana Patten was impressive.All in all, one of Disney's lesser efforts, but has undeniable charm due to the animated segments and Cricket himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"tiny treasure","Date":"25 January 1999","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Family, Music","Review":"  This is a good combination of two animated stories/shorts Bongo and Micky and the Beanstalk.  while watching a mixture of stories and a mixture of animation and live action was a little awkward, Jiminy Cricket held it together.

With the exception of narrator Dinah Shore, the whole thing is dialog free and although it moves along at a leisurely pace, it is good enough for the kids but adults will most certainly squirm.The next segment is Mickey and the Beanstalk which has Bergan doing the narration of the classic fairy tale starring Mickey, Donald and Goofy as they face Willie the Giant (voiced amusingly by Billy Gilbert). Although the cartoon is cute and amusing, Bergen and his dummies along with the adorable Luana Patten provide the bulk of the laughs. I can't help but compare the approach in this segment to Mystery Science Theater 3000 because of the good-natured riffing done by Charlie and Mortimer. It makes you wish that Walt Disney had used this formula for other films like Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella. It goes without saying that Charlie's riffing on Bergen's storytelling is a particular highlight.I say see this film. It'll warm your heart and keep you amused.

I think it's fair to say that Fun and Fancy Free is exactly what it says on the tin. It opens with a lively chorus singing the title song and I love how when the animations begins to start up the song follows onto Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, died 1971, (I think) at 76) singing his own verses, a laid-back, cheerful happy fellow riding on a large leaf in what soon appears to be a vase. In order to cheer up a sad doll missing her mama and a moody teddy Jiminy puts on a vinyl record telling a story... BONGO The expressive, vivacious and energetic enthusiasm of narrator Dinah Shore is just unbelievable! Bongo, a former circus bear who had been mistreated by the ring-master, longs to be free and eventually gets his dream! He is befriended by all the forest animals and also falls in love - but will things go smoothly? Give you a clue; Every deer and every dove has a way of making love but a bear likes to say it with a SLAPMICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK Jiminy finds an invitation to a party across the way and here's who was there; Luana Patten (died 1996, just 57) the hilariously cheeky Charlie McCarthy, the dazed and absent-minded Mortimer Snerd and the man who threw the party Edgar Bergen (died 1978, 75). Edgar Bergen tries to tell a story (in spite of his frustration at Charlie's frequent interruptions and criticisms) of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy living in poverty leaving Mickey and Goofy miserable and Donald having some violent fits of psychotic rage. Bergen defends him to the end. What about the others? Mickey and Goofy went through it too and they didn't try to murder the family cow! The only way to bring happiness to their home is to fetch an enchanted harp from the castle of a selfish giant but it's an not easy mission because if you can fool Willie the giant you can fool anyone! Can they do it? Mortimer becomes upset at when finally became of the giant and as Edgar tries to comfort him the roof is suddenly torn off by... the giant. Not to eat them but to just pop in. This cartoon musical extravaganza truly did make history in animation; that eye-popping blend of art and live action has been done practically throughout the entire movie. And there's neither bad language nor sex scenes nor violence - just full of Fun and Fancy Free!

I was surprised when I heard a familiar singing voice. I thought «This voice sounds like Jiminy Cricket». And in the next moment, Jiminy Cricket appears, voiced by the same Cliff Edwards. Another interesting fact is that Jiminy Cricket is the narrator of the story in some parts. He introduces us the first of the two stories, Bongo it is the story of a little circus bear that runs away from the circus and discovers what it's like to be free.I liked the story of Bongo and the character itself. He's a cute and adorable little bear. This is, without a doubt, the best segment of this motion picture. It is, however, narrated by Dinah Shore.As for the second and final segment, Mickey and the Beanstalk, it is narrated by Edgar Bergen, but before that there are a few live-action scenes where Edgar Bergen is working as a ventriloquist and tells the tale to child actress Luana Patten. After the end of the story, there are a few more live-action scenes like this and Jiminy Cricket appears in both.As for the segment itself, needless to say it is based on Jack and the Beanstalk. It's not a bad segment, but honestly I found it nothing special. It features, however, well known cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy. It also features Willie, the famous temperamental giant from some Disney tales. Mickey Mouse is voiced by Walt Disney himself, while Donald Duck is voiced by the inimitable Clarence Nash.

A short film collection, like all the rest, though this time we only get a two segments and a framing story featuring Jiminy Cricket.Of these two segment, Bongo, the first one, is pure boredom. It's nothing but this circus bear escaping his confinement and gallivanting around in the forest. And you already know how it goes. At first he's thrilled, then the actual, you know, nature rears its ugly head, he meets other animals, gets into trouble, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. Granted, the animation is pretty good, some of physical stunts are pretty humorous and the music could be worse, but it's simply so uninteresting. Nothing of value happens, the main character barely has a personality and... boring! Mickey and the Beanstalk, on the other hand, is a born classic. This is an incredible segment, featuring Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck as medieval farmers living in an enchanted valley, ruled by a magic harp (it's not as weird as you think), who unfortunately has now gone missing and thus everyone hungers. And you know the story. Mickey goes to sell their cow, buys some magic beans, and the rest is story telling history. It's action-packed, the three make for a hilarious comedic trio, the animation is impressive, the story thrilling and it's just a great deal of fun.I also have to mention that the framing story is beyond creepy, especially the ending. Jiminy Cricket is fine, he's one of Disney's finest as always, but they decided to hire a famous ventriloquist Edgar Bergen to play himself in the framing story, and his puppets are simply put pure horror. Who decided this was appropriate for little kids? So yeah, Mickey and the Beanstalk is a really good segment, but it has since been re-released on its own so many times that there's really no reason to see its actual origins film.

The lead time for a full-length feature was much greater than that for a shorter film, so it was possible to put together a feature-length movie comprising several shorter pieces much more quickly than a single coherent story, hence the arrival of a number of films which were made up of two or more different elements.FAFF contains two animated sections, both of which are enjoyable without being exceptional, and an adequate linking section.

It was an OK cartoon without dialog, but I believe its pretty obscure to today's audiences.The more exciting story is the Mickey and the Beanstalk short, a cartoon based on the Jack and the Beanstalk fairytale and stars Mickey in the lead role. Other characters include the huge but somewhat clueless Giant and a beautiful singing Golden Harp; she sings a very soothing and serene song, typical of the 1940s era, but very comforting. Donald and Goofy join Mickey in this adventure, first starting off as starving farmers, then finding the magic beans that grow into a huge beanstalk. They climb it and it leads them to the Giant's castle, where they attempt to rescue the Golden Harp. It's non-stop fun you would expect in a cartoon from beginning to end.It is one of the more shorter in length Disney classics.

So instead, I will say that this was just an OK Disney film for the era which it came from.I do have a soft spot for Bongo, 'cause we could use a sweet story during times like these. The only downfall is that sometimes it gets so sweet, I need one of those OneTouch machines to keep track of my insulin levels. One such example (MINOR SPOILER) is when Bongo meets Lulubelle and they go into this whole sequence where just about every single love cliché/device/gimmick is being shown. Which begs me to wonder how much sugar the animators had in their coffee during the making of it. Otherwise, it's a cute story that goes beyond cute.Afterwards, The live action stuff with Edgar (Candace's Father) Bergen boosts the film a little. Albeit, it's filler when you stop to think about it. Also, not a lot of people this day and age knows who he and his dummy co-horts are unless you did a little researching. Apparently, they were huge back in the day.Enter Mickey & The Beanstalk and it's essentially the same story as the one we read as kids (CONTINUITY SPOILER). Only there's three heroes instead of just one, and A Golden Harp, but no goose that lays golden eggs. Other than that, nothing to write home about.All in all, it's a crowd pleaser at best.

Disney doesn't get more historically curious than this","Date":"10 October 2000","Score":"12 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Family, Music","Review":"  Bambi (1942) was the last REAL animated feature the Disney studio released in the 1940s.  Until 1950, there would only be shorts - which in general weren't as good either as the innovative ones made in the 1930s, or Jack Hannah's comic masterpieces of the 1950s - and compilation features The Reluctant Dragon (1941), Saludos Amigos (1943), The Three Caballeros (1945), Make Mine Music (1946), Fun and Fancy Free (1947), Melody Time (1948), The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949).  You're unlikely to have seen ANY of these.  All of them were stripped apart into their component pieces long ago, largely because, with the exception of The Three Caballeros, there's no reason to keep any of them in one piece.  (Fantasia is another exception, so much so that I've left it off the list altogether - it's a completely different kind of endeavour.)I say this even though The Three Caballeros is the only one I'VE seen.  I have seen most of the material that went into these movies, though, and trust me it's uneven, and there's no coherent way of gluing most of it together.  -Fun and Fancy Free, in any event, consists of just two extended shorts Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk.  I'm writing mainly to defend the latter.  People are much too hard on it.  There's a marked similarity between it and the winning short cartoon The Brave Little Tailor (1938), another fairytale with Disney characters taking the lead roles, and while Beanstalk lacks the earlier short's freshness, it has the advantage of having Donald and Goofy in it, two terribly under-rated cartoon stars who, although capable of sustaining shorts on their own, play off well against one another.  (That's why it's impossible to make a Mickey/Donald/Goofy cartoon that's a TOTAL failure.)  Mickey and the Beanstalk is one of the few post-war cartoons to recapture the spirit of Disney's depression-era stuff.Bongo is of almost no interest - a vapid, directionless account of a circus bear who must adapt to life in the wild, complete with songs.  People interested in the history of animation should see every Disney production they can get their eyes on; there's no other reason to see this one.  The sheer POINTLESSNESS of pairing Bongo with Mickey and the Beanstalk makes this Disney's most bizarre compilation feature of the decade.  -I wish I'd seen the linking segments.  They can't possibly JUSTIFY the film's arbitrary nature, but it might be entertaining to see them try.

The two stories are--Bongo about a circus bear escaping and his comic misadventures in the wilderness and Mickey and the Beanstalk with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy recreating Jack and the Beanstalk. The animation is great (that's why this gets three stars) but the stories are trite, padded and downright boring! They're also full of songs so unmemorable, bland and sweet that you'll be thinking cutting off your ears! To make matters unendurable Edgar Bergen has got to be the world's worst ventriloquist! His lips are plainly moving when his dummies talk. A sleep-inducing mess. VERY patient young kids might go for it. "}]
