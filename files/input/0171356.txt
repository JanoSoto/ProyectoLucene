He has too many things to worry about and all his problems affects his stomach functions producing funny noises at the worst moments. What's an undercover man to do? He gets involved more deeply into trying to do a decent job and in the process, he falls in love with the woman who understands what has to be done to relieve his symptoms.Erik Blakeney has written and directed a film that should have been seen by a wider audience, yet, this movie came and went without fanfare. It deserved a better fate because of the funny screen play Mr. Blakeney created and the wonderful cast that was gathered for the picture. The problem seems to have been in the marketing. This is clearly not a Sandra Bullock vehicle at all!Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt are about the best thing going for the movie. Liam Neeson's Charlie is one of the funniest roles he has done in his career. Mr. Neeson tends to gravitate toward more dramatic fare, but as Charlie, he proves he is an accomplished comedian. The same goes for Oliver Platt who plays a bad guy interested in domestic activities such as cleaning a messy kitchen, or even thinking about a life in Italy growing tomatoes.The minor roles are equally good. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers. Sandra Bullock doesn't get as many opportunities in the movie, but she is seen in the pivotal role of Judy. The group therapy sessions involving Charlie and other law enforcing people are fun to watch.Erik Blakeney shows he can do good work if only he could have the right studio people behind him.

Fortunately, for movie audiences around the world, his talent for acting on the big screen has superseded and today he is known as one of the finest thespians in show business. Take this film for instance, it's called  Gun Shy.  In this story, he plays Charles 'Charlie' Mayeaux (pronounced - MAYO) a field operative working for the D.E.A. His job is to take on the big drug cartels and put them out of business. However, a bad experience in his last encounter with the drug lords, got him so shook up, it left him with a confidence problem, which has created a noticeable fear of death. So much so, he has begun seeing a therapist. In the meantime, his job continues and he must go undercover to confront the Columbia drug cartel and the America mafia, which could get him killed. Oliver Platt, is a gangster with anger management issues, JosÃ© ZÃºÃ±iga and Michael DeLorenzo play Columbian operatives out for the big score or big hit, whichever comes first. If that were not enough, Charlie must also attend Group therapy with Richard Schiff and other problem oriented patients. Mitch Pileggi, interestingly plays Dexter Helvenshaw a corrupt agent. Although there are several parts of the film which exercise Neeson's great gifts for interaction, most of the movie scenes are hampered with too many issues and little cohesion and this makes for awkward moments. Still, it's a good and interesting film and one which makes for entertainment and isn't that what movie making is all about? *** "},{"Title":"Too much bathroom humor","Date":"12 July 2000","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  I love Liam Neeson--I've seen nearly every movie he's ever been in.

Also caught up in this mÃ©lange is the Mafia represented, however reluctantly, by Fulvio Nestra (Oliver Platt), a nerdy but vicious bungler whose temper is uncontrollable, partly due to his insipid belittling wife Gloria (Mary McCormack) whose father demands Fulvio's crime life importance. Charlie is a mess, meets a psychologist who introduces him to group therapy (where Charlie idiotically relates all the DEA secrets openly) and to gastroenterology where nurse Judy (Sandra Bullock) administers a barium enema then other more herbal-sided treatments while she and Charlie become bonded. People are maimed (gunshot castration), killed, made to look foolish, all to the end of supposedly belly laughs on the part of the audience.True, Neeson shows a flair for comedy and Platt manages to convey a breakthrough role for him, but the rest is a jumbled mess. Made in 2000 with the Twin Towers of New York frequently visible during talk against Arabs and the Middle East, it is easy to see why the timing of this 'yet another Mafia vs law' film contributed to its short theater run (how many have even heard of it?).

Many people have blasted the film as being a weak retread of the cliche-busting humour that found great success in Analyze This, Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sopranos.  While Gun Shy definitely does have some glaring weaknesses, it does have at least three things going for it in my mind  the performances of Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt, and some clever editing.I found that Neeson struck a terrific balance between presenting the steely, fearless undercover persona and the shell-shocked cop underneath.  The contrast is played up well, especially in the first scene at the psychiatrist's and the scenes where Charlie is caught between Fulvio and the Colombians.Oliver Platt is utterly hilarious as a sadistic leg-breaker with a heart of gold, and his portrayal steals the show.  I thought his portrayal of Fulvio had a great deal more realism and sympathy to him than DeNiro's Paul Viti. Platt's Life could be sweet speech is far more convincing than DeNiro's comical bawling.Finally, the editor did a terrific job, playing up Charlie's crumbling facade of fearlessness, constructing Fulvio's introduction as simultaneously menacing and absurd, and using an odd kind of show-and-tell technique in the bar scene towards the end.One little point I enjoyed was Charlie's discussion of the undercover lifestyle, which reminded me of how the movie Rounders offered an insider's angle on the psychology and tricks involved in gambling.  A minor element, but it contributed greatly to my enjoyment of both films.All that said, there are some things I could have lived without.  Take out the gastrointestinal problems (and the throwaway romantic subplot it leads into), and you would have a much improved film.  The essential concept *is* heavily reminiscent of the three aforementioned  flicks, and it could have used a bit more focus.  As it is, it tries hard to work in several comedic and dramatic angles, but only a few come off smoothly.  I would recommend it as a light diversion to watch with friends, as even a cursory analysis draws unwelcome comparisons to its more successful predecessors.  I went in with middling expectations and had a blast the first rental.  Surprisingly enough, I watched Gun Shy again with friends after watching Analyze This, and I still enjoyed it.  Give it a spin.

What makes the film its own is its blend of the out-of-sort comic elements of Charlie's high stressed work and the group therapy's oddball patients , especially Richard Schiff (best know as the human wishbone in 'The Lost World Jurassic Park' and currently on tv's dramedy 'The West Wing') who is so beyond frazzled at his workplace he has to resort to some bizarre tactics to avoid blurting out a Tourette's Syndromelike spurt of vitriol (at least until the film needs it as a closure).Maybe because of the unusual hybrid of comedy a la 'Analyze This' with the broad character of Platt's Fulvio and the somewhat sardonic tone of Neeson's Charlie does it mesh often on the mark. Yet the film suffers from trying to balance too much on its scales to begin with but comes across as a game effort with a fine ensemble and clever screenplay by new filmmaker Eric Blakeney.Give it an A for effort in attempting to make an original spin on a chestnut like the screwball comedy and fish out-of-water genre.

Something sleepy.","Date":"10 June 2005","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" I was very surprised by this film. I had overhead so many negative reviews of this feature that I think it had seeped to deeply into my mind when I chose to pick it up. I had already thought that it was going to be a poor excuse of a film when I placed it in my DVD player, but to my surprise (literally), this was actually a well developed, superbly acted film. Now, it wasn't the greatest movie that I have ever seen, but as far as entertainment goes, this film did lift an eyebrow. The script was loose, but well thought out, the acting was well above your average independent feature, and the tone was light. I think that is what I liked most about this film (outside of the acting) was that it never went too deep into itself, but instead kept it light and seemingly fluffy. In an era of over-zealous directors, Eric Blakeney proved to me that he could gather great actors, place them in a decent story, and produce amazing results. I wish other directors would take his lead and push more towards this than just giving up and relying on the name of the actor to sell their film.There are three elements that really caught my attention while watching this film, and I must begin with the acting. You had in this film some of Hollywood's most dramatic, comedic, and talented people doing their best work in this little film called Gun Shy. Liam Neeson represented his character so well, that I nearly forgot most of the time that he was Neeson from Schindler's List, but instead this neurotic agent with problems around every bend. The twitching of his hands, the ability to bring life to his words and his comedic timing was brilliant. He really was a shining light in this film. This rubbed off onto the others in this film causing greatness from everyone. Oliver Platt was hysterical playing off of every Italian stereotype that can be seen in such hits as The Sopranos and The Godfather, but he does it with so much originality and creativity that it feels and smells fresh. I found myself laughing at everything Platt did, and he played so well against Neeson that I am surprised that the two haven't made more films together. Then there was Sandra. While this wasn't the mightiest role for her, she was enjoyable to watch. She didn't overdo it, nor was she lacking. She was the only average character in the film, and I blame this in part to only having a few short scenes in the film (kinda underdeveloped). The rest of the cast was well above par. What was interesting about the characters and actors of Gun Shy is that I wanted to watch them. They, unlike some recent Hollywood blockbusters, brought life into the film and they had fun (a Hollywood curse word) with this production. You could tell, and it provided some enjoyable cinema.The next element was the story. Director/writer Eric Blakeney did a great job of complementing the actors with a simple script. This may sound like an insult, but so many times we watch films that have this overdeveloped story that causes are actors to get lost, our audience to get lost, and ultimately our film to get lost. By keeping the story simple, Blakeney was able to bring the best from the actors. I do believe that the script complimented the actors and pushed them to explore new possibilities of characters. It was a story that we had seen time and time again, but again, like the acting, it seemed original and fresh because it was simple and complete. My only gripes about the story is that it could have developed Bullock's character a bit more and sharpened the ending a bit, but that is all. Honestly, I thought the film worked the way the script was written, no changes were needed, but healthy constructive feedback is always welcomed.Finally, I would like to say that I loved the theme of this film. Perhaps it is where I am in my life that allowed it to hit me so hard, but for me it was sheer bliss. Here you have a story, which all the central characters hate, loathe, and dislike their lives. From Charlie's hatred and fear of getting killed by his job, to Fulvio's passion for a better life, to the Colombian's wanting to escape in love together, to even all of Charlie's friends in his group therapy that hate their lives as well, there is just this overwhelming sense of dislike for the world when this film begins. As we grow with our characters, they begin to see the brighter side of life and that we all need that moment of change to help us grow and develop ourselves. I thought this was a great theme to bring into a zany mob comedy, but it worked. So many times in Hollywood we see the happy family man who gets caught up in the mob mess, but never have we seen so many disillusioned people gathered in one film and still make it a comedy. It was very close to perfection.Overall, I enjoyed this film. I will say it again, it wasn't the best I have ever seen, but it did provide two hours of entertainment and sometimes that is all you can ask of a film (though lately it is becoming harder and harder). The acting is what pulled me into the picture, and the depressing beginning theme kept me glued to the screen. I surprise myself sometimes because this was not a crazy film. It was a generic story that allowed the actors and the director to be original and creative.

But when you watch a movie more than once, that's when you notice the little things; and the little things are what set a movie apart from every other run of the mill Hollywood manufacturing. This movie isn't supposed to be a typical action comedy. This movie is a lesson in taking control of your life and realizing that everyone else is at least as unhappy as you are, that also happens to be pretty funny.I think my favorite character is easily Fulvio. Fulvio will kill someone just for looking at him the wrong way, but all he really wants to do is grow tomatoes like his grandfather. He's about to cut the neighbor's hand off stealing his newspaper, but all he does when he comes home from a bad day is clean the kitchen.Personally, I think the movie is well done.

It actually starts out as an interesting post-traumatic stress special agent story. But it is at the climax when it gets hilarious.I was a big fan of the Alec Guinness comedies, including his crime films, The Lavender Hill Mob and The Ladykillers. The cinematic style is different but the understated humor is similar.Charlie Mayeaux (Liam Neeson) is an undercover agent suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. He is on a case involving an unpredictable psychotic killer, Fulvio (Oliver Platt). He is sure that he will die in this assignment. It's a follow up to an earlier assignment in which he was about to be killed when he was saved by his task force. All the bad guys were killed, except for one. The gangsters killed in that raid worked for Fulvio, and the DEA wants Charlie to renew his contact with Fulvio's people in the hope that Charlie will meet Fulvio (whom he has never seen except as imagined in his nightmares). They are less interested in catching Fulvio than having him lead them to the big drug cartel bosses.I agree with the critics who complain that the ending of the film doesn't fit with what came before, but by then we know not to take the story as a serious one anyhow.

'Charlie' Liam Neeson doesn't convince 'Fulvio's' Oliver Platt step-father to invest in the soy bean market, he just convinces him to put the money in up in order to double it, in which he takes out a little insurance with a crooked DEA agent to guarantee it and the bowel movements 'Charlie can't control' are no such thing. They have a tendency to turn up when he feels he's in danger or relief, of just scraping through another 'would be c*ck up', almost not going to plan. Think about it, your life isn't that eventful, but, take several and intertwine them and the events throughout the day, night and week would be non stop, even if you weren't on hand to witness each persons activities, that doesn't mean they don't happen, that's the point of the group therapy session, to paint a picture of their background menaces in which they all seem to find in the work place, 'Charlie' included. 'Charlie' thinks he's cracking up, beginning to doubt himself and thinks he's losing his edge, what he doesn't realise is, all he needs is a pat on the back and a push in the right direction, that's where 'Judy Tipp' (Sandra Bullock) comes in, she puts his life to one side (which is something he can't do) and focuses on the man and tells him you are still the man you always were. You got to understand,people aren't people, I mean they aren't themselves generally, some friends may think they know you and likewise, but, what they only know are your characteristics and your preferences, but, not the real you, therefore, there's YOU and then person the world sees. This is what 'Charlie' is trying to desperately to keep together and his bowel movements are the tightrope between the two, never letting him forget it. The only way any person will see the real you and the only way your going to show them and let go completely and allow them to do this is if you trust, (in his case) love and have 100% faith in them. That's what it's about faith. You need to have faith in your actions, decisions, the people you choose to be around you and yourself or nothing will ever work out. Fidel had faith in Estuvio, Estuvio had faith in Fidel, a lot of people had faith in Charlie (His boss, Fulvio,Fidel), Charlie had faith in Judy, Judy had faith in herself, Fulvio had faith in himself to get out of the lifestyle (that's why he grew his tomatoes), Helvenshaw had faith in the system (his intentions were crooked, but he still had faith), Fidel and Estuvio's dream was to be together, Charlie's was the ocean view, Judy's was to remain happy, Fulvio's was to be someone HE liked, Bennett's was to be wealthy and the therapy groups was to change the monotonous, predictable, soundtrack to their lives You see in order to have faith you need a dream or a plan to sustain it, not everyone, but most. Every critic is screaming from the rooftops, about how there's no plot, but that's just it, there is no plot to life, yet how it's fused is brilliant,everybody wants something, money, happiness, peace and quiet, but in order to get it, you got to have faith, that's the point, you want a plot go watch a bond movie.

Me?","Date":"16 October 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Liam Neeson is an undercover narc who is mediating an exchange between the Italian Mafia, represented by an ominous Oliver Platt, and the Colombian drug cartel. Neither side trusts the other. Neeson begs his superiors to bust them all before he gets found out and shot. He's so filled with anxiety that he has trouble with his bowels and is a nervous wreck.Neeson joins a psychiatrist's group therapy session and is referred to a doc who gives him a barium enema and eventually becomes his lover. That would be Sandra Bullock.It's a comedy and it has its moments. Neeson handles the ludic elements well, which is a bit of a surprise considering how much drama he's done. Example At the first meeting of the therapy group, Neeson listens barely interested while the others runs through their usual complaints. One patient has an impulse to do something improper in public so he deals with it by biting his hand. Another's wife always buys the flavor of ice cream that she KNOWS he hates because it has a chemical taste. Finally the leader says, We haven't heard from Charlie here. And Neeson matter-of-factly describes his feelings having a revolver shoved up his rear end while he's stretched out on a table like a Cornish rock hen. There is a moment of silence.And, later, when he meets Oliver Platt -- he of the ominous beard and barely contained anger, Platt does nothing but stare at him without blinking. Neeson, a neural shambles, has taken more tranquilizers than was wise, plus some booze on top of it, and he stares back, hardly able to keep awake. Even when Platt pulls an automatic and aims it at Neeson's face, his eyes half close and he drifts off. The monumental tranquility amazes and impresses Platt.It's a low-key comedy that aims mostly for smiles rather than laughs and it wants to charm the audience -- rather like Moonstruck and Analyze This did in the previous two years. The problem is that it doesn't have enough funny moments. And, while Neeson gets along okay, Sandra Bullock as the eccentric gastroenterologist drags the movie down. She does a character part well in Infamous, in which she was Harper Lee, but when left to her own devices she's not really very convincing.Part of whatever success the movie has, as comedy, is due to Liam Neeson's physical structure. He's six feet, four inches tall, and he's sinewy. His nose is monstrous. He looms in every shot. He's the last person you'd expect to be gobbling pills to quiet his nerves, while farting in public.

I completely expected the film itself to be total dross, the kind of unmemorable, bland comedy I associate (fairly or otherwise) with Sandra Bullock.Actually I have to say that Bullock felt a bit wedged in; they needed a love interest for Neeson's character, but she didn't need to be a big name - in fact, I think it might have been better if they'd taken on a relative unknown, as it would have saved this actually-quite-good comedy from being billed as a Sandra Bullock Romantic Comedy, thereby alienating a large proportion of the people who might otherwise have wanted to watch it.Bullock's character is very bland and does not seem to have required her to wake up at any point during filming - the kind of character film-makers would probably describe as kooky, but which the rest of us find moderately endearing to start with, edging towards slightly irritating by the end of the film. The only matter of real interest in Bullock's role lay in trying to work out what precisely was supposed to be so special about her - her unusual way of meeting Neeson's character could only carry her so far.Neeson, meanwhile, was far more entertaining. I am biased, but I've seen Neeson play some godawful parts (Clash of the Titans springs to mind) and this was a decent effort. A former golden-boy DEA agent who seeks psychiatric help and gets into group therapy because he's suffering from PTSD and acute intermittent flatulence had the potential to get pretty gimmicky, but he balances it well and saves Charles from becoming a mere caricature. I actually think Neeson doesn't get enough credit as a comic actor, and he and Oliver Platt (who comes as a bit of a surprise if the last thing you saw him in was Beethoven) bounce very well off each other.There's a few cheap laughs that feel a bit tacked on, like Columbian badass Fidel turning out to be in a relationship with his lisping, one- balled bodyguard, but fortunately the makers have had the sense not to labour these points and they remain just surprising and mildly amusing minor elements against the backdrop of a good cast and a decent comic premise.Worth seeing, just try to ignore Sandra Bullock as she's nowhere near as central as you'd expect and feels a bit unnecessary. The only comparison that springs to mind in terms of misguided marketing is Blow Dry - an excellent film with a fantastic cast that they tried to market off the back of its two weakest actors and the worst attempt at a Yorkshire accent in history.

Since she was the film's producer, I'd say that was a reasonable guide to what the filmmakers were aiming at. Certainly, somebody's a bit uncertain as to the film's genre. My local Blockbuster had the DVD in the Action section but, while it has two set-piece shootouts, one near the beginning and one at the end, this is not a film that has much in common with Face/Off or Die Hard.Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson) is an undercover DEA agent whose bosses are very keen that he should single-handedly close down a Colombian drug cartel. However, Charlie has been betrayed and has narrowly escaped being killed, and as a result has lost his nerve. He starts to attend a group therapy session, where he meets a number of unhappy business types. What they've all got in common is fear. Charlie's fear is of dying in a hail of bullets, but he is sympathetic to the other members of the group, who mostly fear losing status.There's a lot of bonding, revelation of true feelings and surprising reversals of expectation. Most of it's pretty unsubtle but strong performances from Neeson, Bullock and Oliver Platt help.The best things about the film are plot-related. The Colombian cartel has billions of dollars that it needs to launder. Platt plays Fulvio, the terrifying but incompetent son-in-law of a Mafia don who is providing unspecified services to facilitate the laundering, and taking a substantial cut in return. A scene that I particularly like cuts between three different meetings, one between Charlie and his bosses, another between Platt's character and his don and the third between the Colombians. While Charlie vainly insists that the deal has to be abandoned because he can't hold it together, Fulvio reassures his father-in-law that, despite the problems, Charlie can hold the deal together. Unfortunately, the plot is apparently of secondary importance to the writer/director who provides a perfunctory and unsatisfactory resolution. One funny plot development near the end is completely wasted.

He plays the part only moderately well, certainly not as well as would be expected when compared to some of his better movies, but nothing to complain about. Oliver Platt was wonderful; he played a loser killer, hopelessly desperate and hating himself. He was a mediocre bad guy, but he was supposed to be a mediocre bad guy.

Don't get me wrong; it is definitely not a great film, but it isn't as bad as its reputation.First of all, there are NO plot holes, but you definitely have to use your brain to get all of the plot.  This is not a movie for those who like to turn their brains off while watching.  Secondly, those who commented that the movie couldn't make up its mind whether it was serious or comedic were generally correct.  Once you decide that the movie is supposed to be funny (but not side-slapping), you can relax and enjoy it.  If you view it in that context, the dialogue is no longer silly, and the plot is no longer forced--it's exactly what it should be.Lastly, I do not see _Gun Shy_ as a rip-off of _Analyze This_ (or any other movie, for that matter).  The comedy is much more subtle, the drama is much more real, and the theme is very different.  Sure there are plot similarities, but that's kind of like saying _Star Wars_ is like _Alien_ because they both take place in outer space.  The therapy aspect of _Gun Shy_ is not even the main thread.The downsides are mostly technical.  I didn't see any boom mikes, but there were several shots where the background was so overwhelming that the actors were drowned out; surely a more experienced director would have noticed that.  And the plot, while interestingly presented in a non-linear fashion, is so predictable when you finally do figure it out that you wonder if it was worth it.Nonetheless, it's a moderately entertaining movie.  I personally thought it was a direct-to-video release, since it was out of the theaters so quickly I completely missed it.  Perhaps my consequently low expectations led to my positive take on it.

Does for James Bond what Strangelove did for the Doomsday Thriller. My advice, if you're the sort who appreciates intelligent satire and understands that pop culture garbage like How I Met Your Mother isn't at all funny; get a copy asap, make some popcorn, take the phone off the hook and put aside enough time to watch it twice (you will).

Eternal bit-parter Richard Schiff gets another prominent role, one of his first since Dr Dolittle and his big turn as Eddie Carr in The Lost World. He plays the same sort of character as usual in this one, a recessive nice guy and does not detract at all from the artiness of the film. Neeson certainly turns in a good performance as he always has done but the true standout is Oliver Platt.His best role remains Porthos the Pirate just in watchability but with an accent he brings some depth and realism to his role, departing from the comedy nice guy he usually plays and turning into a 100% believable leg breaker, he has an air of confidence but also in his dialogue scenes the vulnerability that fits right in, a gangster you end up rooting for. Bullock once again has to open up the up tight leading man, she has not yet really demonstrated diversity. Her best role is still Annie in speed, she does not reach prominence in this movie.This a creative, mostly realistic, once or twice unrealistic tale that speaks on human being and the thoughts behind our motivations, a very watchable and prominent acheivment.

Liam Neeson with an always sexy Sandra Bullock seemed more attractive, though not much; I should have got a book off the bookshelf... Too late now to feel sorry for myself, or even for Liam and Sandra.Any silly attempts at touches of humour were so badly done that they had the subtlety of walking into a cement wall at over 8kph (which is about 5mph for you lot over there).

If I had known I might have lent him a few pennies/pesetas/lira/cents, so that he could at least have thrown himself into Ms. Bullock's arms without the camera looking on. Then, I suppose, I would have been spared the torture of excrutiating belly-ache watching this total waste of time for everyone concerned in making it and afterwards watching it.When a few moments of pseudo-imitation Morricone-styled music turned up I almost threw a flower-pot of my wife's at the screen, but refrained from doing so for two very unquestionable motives one, my wife would not speak to me for weeks (which might just be a blessing in disguise), and two, given the present rate of Dollar-Euro, it would cost me nearly a thousand of either to replace it with a new set.Who said that watching the cathode tube was one of the most effortless of occupations?

Even though passed off as a comedy, I think I got more laughs out of 'Halloween' than I did this, it sets a new record for number of chuckles 1.Sandra Bullock is third billed, but only has a minute or two of actual screen time, disappointing considering I rented it because of her... Neeson is wasted here. Given an awful character, there is little he can do to save it, and ends up as a bore. Platt fares even worse. Oliver Platt as a menacing mafia killer!?! Don't think so. Most of the scenes he's in are laughable... though not enough to garner another coveted chuckle. The only bright spot among the cast was 'The West Wing's Richard Schiff, who displays that he can play characters other than his annoying, by-the-books Tobey...Avoid this flick as best you can. It has almost no redeeming qualities, and Disney's attempt to call it a comedy makes me think twice about them.1.5/10 "},{"Title":"I give it two stars, because one star means I walk out.","Date":"5 February 2000","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  I went to this showing only to hear a band that I like called, The Scabs.  Though they had their 30seconds (at most) of fame I felt like this movie overall a gip.  Though there were a few parts of the movie that I chuckled at, the whole though process of the movie was inconsistent.  First, and far most obvious, you had this fella that had an uncle (head of a columbian cartel), and a family with kids and pictures to prove it.  Later on the story he is gay...now what in the hell were the  producers-directors thinking.  Did they just simply forget the fact that this guy was strait, or was he married with children and gay?  Wait for this one to come out "},{"Title":"director should be shot","Date":"26 February 2006","Score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" I was half-enjoying this movie on cable TV until we got to the scene where Liam (who is apparently a chronic farter in the movie) is getting some kind of enema action from Sandra Bullock ... she has some squeeze-bulb action going on ... and the music playing is It's a Man's World by James Brown ... this is an abomination. It is blasphemy. It is a crime. What unbelievable bad taste. Imagine that, coming out of Hollywood.i don't have much more to say, but I guess IMDb doesn't allow short, succinct posts. so blah blah blah watched the Cockettes documentary today, found a great andy warhol superstar website, played with new kitties, cooked dinner ... this should fill it out enough ...and I hope the children of the man responsible for putting James Brown in a Sandra Bullock enema scene live in interesting times.

Wrong!","Date":"21 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  I rented this one because of Liam Neeson, Sandra Bullock, and Oliver Platt. Boy was I fooled.  Are they really that hard up for a paycheck?  This movie must be a dark comedy, as some have stated, because I couldn't see anything watchable about it.

Luckilly, some theatres brought Gun Shy back to gain from Sandra's presence in 28 Days, but...  Well, the movie is disappointing.  Not because of the writing, the acting, or the main plot.  For the most part these are all good.  Of course the slow transformation of one character's voice into ultra guy stereotype could have been written better, but it was oscar quality considering the filming style of the first 40min/hour.Maybe I saw a work print, and the projectionist was using the wrong lens, so the movie was out of focus for a while, but--> During the first 40min there were boom-mikes all over the place.  I was seriously laughing out loud because I had not seen them (so obtusely) in a film before.  Surprisingly, the mikes were not brushed out or anything and they were all over the place (from over the characters at a table (very top of screen) or to the blatently obvious, the entire mike (poll and all galavent in the background (about 5 min in and in the side view in the office building about 20 min in)).This was just terrible movie making and I'm surprised they did not take better pride in their work.After this the last half of the show was a gem, the focus was fixed and the boom mikes disappeared, but still very low on the vote scale here.   viewed in theatre with refund.
