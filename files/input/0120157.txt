But I liked Soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me.First, the art direction is tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all of their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role, but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.If you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner.

I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).So to the film itself, a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed.

They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever.  This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell.  The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from   preadolescence to adulthood.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier.  But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.  A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete.  What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life  Fear and discipline. 	Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts.  He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes.  This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.  And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype.  Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). 	Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction.  `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact.  It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.  Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.  I rate this one 7/10.

The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen to it in a long time.He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack Arnie one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.That's why this film did'nt do well.

Set on a garbage-dump planet, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the title character, an obsolete genetic soldier left for dead. The supporting cast of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis, is able. They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. With almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. It is almost a mime performance. When the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a superior genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from M*A*S*H as a weaselly commanding officer, and Gary Busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner--David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays.

Howzat?  Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped.  In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, Russell pulls off an incredible characterization.  His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints.  Great job!As usual, Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered.  Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous.  I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her.  Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited.  Much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses.  By the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction.

Filmmakers need to use other genres to fulfill their western fantasies. Just like Vampires with James Woods was a Western with vampires so Soldier is a Western in space. One man against many. You meet in a deserted town and settle it all. Like real men. High Noon. Soldiers deserve to fight other soldiers.This is a very simple movie. That's why it's good. Kurt Russell is the old soldier vs. the new and improved soldiers to see who is the king. #1. The Boss. He gets thrown away on a garbage planet because he became out of date. One day the new soldiers find his planet and come down to wipe out everyone. One of those amazing coincidences that Russell was there. Soon Kurt shows them who's in charge.There's a good beginning scene involving the competition between Russell and the new soldiers. Then there is a long, slow stretch where Russell assimilates to his new planet and people and then the final showdown scene. The middle part was a tad slow but once the fresh meat arrives the action picks up. It was a decent action flick. Russell was the new sheriff in town and booted out the bad guys. I liked it.

I disagree vehemently with the haters. I tend to be very hard on movies but just do not get why some people found this movie to be bad. One comment about not being a good plot I think is ludicrous. Kurt Russell was great (Connie was also excellent as always) as always transitioning from the unfeeling soldier to becoming more human. His demise and his rise from the ashes of the trash heap is stimulating and thought-provoking. And the action sequences are great, well-thought out and very clean. I never understand why crappy movies get good reviews and great movies get crappy reviews. I had a recent conversation with a very bright Harvard grad who spoke classical Greek, was a Latin scholar, among his other credentials and an avid movie goer. He trashed all the recent movies I liked and had wonderful things to say about movies that were terrible. I guess people look for different things in film as in other aspect s of life. I think the reason why I liked this movie so much is that in the end the jerks who were in command got what was coming to them and revealed themselves as inferior to the soldiers of both kinds (the new and the obsolete) because they were indeed heartless and lacked backbone.I suppose one could criticize the people command as being a bit too stereo-typical and predictable and one-dimensional. But their part of the movie is incidental to the plot. They are supposed to be heartless bureaucrats, people you love to hate. Another reason why I love this film is because just about every scene is memorable. There is nothing you need to fast forward over. I can list the scenes and every one is fun to watch and moves the plot forward. My point is that each scene has substance and makes one or more points for viewers to think about as the movie progresses toward its ultimate conclusion1. Opening scene with new soldiers compete with old 2. Kurt Russell (soldier) dumped on the junkyard planet 3. Kurt meets Connie and family and begins the process of shedding his motionlessness 4. Kurt saves ones of the settlers 5. Kurt lays groundwork for a new generation of settlers who learn how to better to defend themselves in difficult environments 5. Kurt cannot conform and is expelled 6. The troops arrive for maneuvers and attack the settlers 7. Retribution via Kurt 8. Redemption for himself, his fellow comrades in arms, and the settlers and a new life and a new family (Kurt gets the girl and becomes a father)It works for me. I know that there many who disagree. I did not realize that this director did Event Horizon, another great film. I like them both equally as well.

I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.The portrayal is spot on. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.Todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey's Church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU.

But he's too Stephen King, too much rote and not enough passion. But for this movie it works because the main characters, the soldiers, are supposed to be passionless. Connie Nielsen's character provides the humanity, not because of Anderson's direction, but because she's not only talented she's a professional and doesn't need to have her hand held throughout a scene by a director.Kurt Russell makes the movie though. From his intro to the very end he stays in character perfectly. I'm sure a lot of people hated the pace of the movie.

Todd is brainwashed so well that he would go into someplace to die without a flinch.  Now a new breed of soldiers looks to replace Todd and his older team.

Needless to say trouble follows. Russell brings his tough guy image into the movie, but also has excellent moments of sadness. Endless explosions, slow motion fights and tons of gunfire litter the film, but don't get tedious to the least.

The film clearly shows that the new batch while stronger, faster are also quite mentally challenged. Look at the fight at the beginning between Todd, his two old ones, and Caine. Caine allows Todd higher ground which he uses to drop on him and rip out one of his eyes. Everybody remember what Col. Mekum says to him? You know how much it cost to train you, you big moron? Yes, I agree if the new batch were not clearly mentally retarded, it would have been utterly silly. Anderson establishes clearly that the new ones are stupid. Second, it is very brutal, ugly and cruel. Hello? these are warriors you are not watching TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. Yes, the warrior ethos is hard cold and cruel.

If you would like to understand why soldiers coming home cannot fit back into society, this is the movie for you. The most beautiful scene in the movie is where Todd flees the party, he looks down through the window upon them with ineffable sadness at them. The life he desires more than anything but he can never enter for he is a danger to them. When he is training and the Matron looks disgustedly and fearfully at him, that is the simile for why this great film of Anderson's is relegated to the garbage can. If it had been made before the New Age Matriarchy where hate and anger are forbidden. Where war is a thing of the past, you know how we thought in the 1930's while Germany and Japan were quietly building up their militaries, the film is a quintessential anachronism. It is action packed, moves like lightning and has an excellent supporting cast including the always great Jason Isaacs, who steals the movie. Again, how does Todd defeat Caine? Caine clearly is about to defeat him due to his superior strength, Todd glances down at the scythe, Caine follows his glance which gives Todd the time to use the rotor blade to slice him open. Caine does not even figure out Todd is going to ram him until two seconds before. The traps Todd sets for them work because these ones are so dumb. My favorite scene, forgive me, is where the Matron tells them all to not worry she is going to go out there and talk it out with them. You know, think only good thoughts, and send them only positive energy. How did that go? Yes, well you see our future friends, never confuse decadent, soft weakness with progress; it is the exact opposite.If you want to see an action packed non stop exciting film, this is for you. It hardly stops to catch its breath, it is go go go. Russell shows why he is considered one of the most underrated actors of all time. Does it have flaws? Why three stars off? Yes, Gary Busey probably one of the most annoying gasbags in cinema. Unfortunately, Mekum does not put him out of our misery till the very end. Also, I enjoy looking at Connie Nielsen but she is not Meryl Streep. The acting is a little shaky among the supporting cast plus Gary Busey equals three stars off.

Physically he has also transformed himself into a fighting machine and is completely believable as a deadly Soldier with a lifetime of experience. Jason Scott Lee has metamorphosed himself from the lean Bruce Lee to a huge Schwarzenegger esquire figure. Soldier is action packed from start to finish. Upon release it was poorly received but I believe it to be underrated and that it is in fact a superior action movie. Whilst the movie does possess a pessimistic and violent view of the future it is also a story of a discipline and revenge and when all is said and done is quite uplifting. Kurt Russell illustrates his varied talents as an actor and is the decisive reason why the movie is not just another action flick. Many actors could play this action role but the depth of his expression and emotions bring credibility to the entire movie. Soldier is not a thoughtful war movie (Platoon, Thin Red Line) or a stylish vision of the future (Blade Runner). It is however a slick and well executed action packed 99 minutes that will be very entertaining for fans of the action movie genre.

Some viewers are only looking at the surface of the story, if you look past the bullets and blood the message of the film is somewhat rewarding.When Bladerunner opened in 1982, it was universally criticized by nearly everyone. That film was written by David Peoples as is this one, that film was not commercially successful as is this one, and both films have very simple story structures. Do not be surprised if Soldier becomes a cult movie. To me Soldier is one of the best science fiction movies of the past 5 years.

It features an award-caliber performance from Kurt Russell (himself an underrated actor,)a smart script and stylish direction.  Yet people insist it's a pile of cow pat.  This character-driven movie is certainly better than, say, The Matrix, which suffered from plot and logic holes, and had one of the worst endings ever.  Although, admittedly, Matrix was meant to be a Dumb film, while Soldier is smarter than you think.  The script never flinches, never compromises it's purpose or characters, and director Anderson (of Event Horizon, the best horror-in-space movie since Alien) shows sci-fi works better as a setting than a genre.  And as for Russell, he shows more emotion and character in his performance than most Oscar winners, being extremely sympathetic even when doing unsympathetic things.So I say ignore the gup about this being a bad movie.  If you are a real sci-fi film lover, throw out The Matrix and get Soldier instead.

It mentions a couple of details in passing which mark the connection. It is mainly notable, however, for being the follow-up of director Paul W.S. Anderson to the seminal Event Horizon.Anderson's career has become increasingly shaky, arguably deteriorating progressively from a high-water mark that was the eerie sci-fi horror film Event Horizon. Some of his output has veered dangerously close to outright B-movie fare.Soldier is, in some ways, a throwback to the 1980s, an era of bold, brash action movies with muscular male stars. It even has a couple of representatives of that period, in the form of star Kurt Russell and supporting player Gary Busey. They feed into a theme of old vs. new, mature vs. inexperienced, that I thought would be the entire backdrop to the story.It turns out that this was only a prelude. Russell's titular warrior loses heavily, and is cast out to survive in the wilderness, amongst poor scavengers. Here, it becomes clear that the skills and temperament that made him an excellent soldier, and indeed that were ruthlessly ground into him, are handicaps in any other context. This puts it in a field with the likes of All Quiet on the Western Front, Born on the Fourth of July, Full Metal Jacket, First Blood and right up to the much more recent American Sniper and Ender's Game. Admittedly, having said that, it is far from flattered by these comparisons, but it deserves some credit for tackling an issue, which is more than can be said for many of those dumb 80s actioners.Russell has always been a likable lead, and has only grown in experience. In Soldier, he needs every ounce of it, because his character is so laconic as to be practically mute. So much of his performance comes in the form of body language and facial expressions, constituting a hundred different gradations just of stoic determinedness and confusion/uncertainty. There's something... efficient about his performance that rather impressed me.Another thing that impressed me somewhat was the special effects. By today's standards, CGI from this period often looks very ropey. However, Anderson cleverly places these special effects shots in the background and doesn't draw attention to them, so that they enhance the far-future outer space setting without coming under excessive scrutiny.When it comes down to it, though, Soldier is first and foremost an action film. For all the other themes explored to a degree in the movie, by far the theme most explored is that of men fighting each other. But that certainly has its place, and has become Anderson's metier. I hear Pompeii is pleasingly daft and enjoyable, and if he is not going to go back to the tense, intense horror of Event Horizon, this will more than suffice.

Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee) wins a three on one combat but Todd is able to gouge out one of Caine's eye.

Todd's development is clunky at best. His relationship with Sandra and her husband Mace is somewhat of a mystery. I can't tell if the movie is trying to gin up a romance. It would be much better to concentrate on their son and Todd. Todd could be a Frankenstein monster to the boy. It would probably be easier to not make the mom so hot.

That said, there are also references to 'Nibian Moons', 'Antares Malestrom', and 'Perdition's Flames', which should strike a chord with Trekkies.Kurt Russell probably utters a total of 4 lines in the whole movie, but he is excellent as 'Todd', a man who has been bred to be the ultimate soldier, and now finds himself discarded, alone, knowing nothing else than soldiering. When he falls in with a group of survivors of a crashed ship on the garbage dumping planet he winds up on, a strong whiff of Shane comes into the picture.Predictably, the super-genetic soldiers that have replaced Todd and his men arrive for some target practice, and the film finally delivers some epic action thrills.

Todd represents to thine own self be true better than I have ever seen in another character.  He is what he has been made, but he is not stagnant; he can learn, he can grow.  Also, the film shows clearly that sometimes we must accept others who are frighteningly different from ourselves in order that we both may survive.Kurt Russell has successfully portrayed a character who does not use verbal communication the way we do.

However, I'm very glad that I did, now. It has become one of my favorites, primarily because of Kurt Russell's acting.Russell is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood and this film proves it.  With personal dialog of less than 100 words in the whole film, he managed to create a character with whom I had great sympathy and empathy. Rather than hiding behind a huge amount of dialog, he conveyed his character through his eyes, body positioning and movement and through extremely subtle movements of his head and features.  This is probably one of the hardest types of roles there are and he pulled it off beautifully. Part of the reason that I think the 'art' of what he has done is overlooked is because it is so subtle and so well done that it doesn't scream 'look at the technique' at you, and you are able to forget about it and slide into the character with him.The movie itself is good clean sci-fi.  Something you can take the whole family to.  The fight sequences are strong and exciting - very good choreography and execution. It has clear cut heroes and villains.  Subtle humor. And you find yourself really wanting him to triumph in the end, get the girl, and ride off into the sunset (or whatever passes for a sunset in deep space).

But what made him sign onto this project was beyond my comprehension. It's hard enough to accept that the story itself could be passed off as a cinema production, let alone this be a good movie. There was so much more director Paul W.S. Anderson could have done with this.Kurt Russell is Todd, a genetically altered human being, created to serve in the military. Todd is a muscular, silent, and deadly warrior. His skills are top notch and his killing is callous. He has no fear of anything. He is simply a human version of the T-800 endoskeleton from The Terminator (1984). That's cool stuff. However the character of Todd is another story. Todd is basically the equivalence of having a conversation with a rock. He has no social skills and his ability to communicate is through violence. That's not a fun character to watch when one is trying to understand them.But nothing lasts forever. Soon the people who bio-engineered Todd are able to create even more powerful human soldiers. It is to Todd's discretion that he is discharged and eliminated. What the higher command doesn't know is that Todd's not dead. And the planet that he was dumped on is now going to receive some unexpected help. Now it is up to Todd to protect a group of people from being annihilated and break them free from their universal prison. This is where he begins to gain the ability to be more human. But by the time this happens, the movie is dismally over. The reason the terminator is more amiable than Todd is how fast it is able to process information and become more human. Todd is not a computer and it takes him a long time to start being a likable character.The planet that these refugees hide in is dull. From background to front screen, everything is the same color; beige. Even the sky is beige. The ground is made up of a granular dirt and it's always windy. All this does is prevent the audience from having a clear image of what is going on in every scene, not to mention, everything is covered in sand. The plot lagged as well. This is supposed to be a sci-fi action film, not a drama. And that's all that kept getting pushed on me while I was watching this for more than half the time.It wasn't until the last few acts did I really enjoy this film. Why - because finally there was some action. The army that Todd once belonged to returns to the planet he was dropped into to exterminate the outcasts that he lived with. It's at this point that Russell finally puts those muscles to work, especially when it comes to that Gatling gun! It reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger too much but it was fun to remember. It's really cool how Todd was able to defy all odds and take on an entire army and come out with only a few scratches. However, this is all I can give it. The ending is nice too but in no way could I see Todd being anything but what he was brought up to be. Kurt Russell probably had fun but as for audiences go, the feeling may be the complete opposite.

This is a flick I'd recommend to the content guardians who are knee-jerk haters of violence. Soldier uses violence appropriately, intelligently. It is a film for grown-ups.

For those unaware, Peoples co-wrote Blade Runner and Twelve Monkeys, and scripted Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, among several other credits. The writer actually considers Soldier to be a spiritual cousin to Blade Runner, and a side-quel since it takes place in the same filmic universe. However, Soldier is also directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson), a director who likes to make trashy action flicks and who gets a lot of flack for his efforts. Hence, while Peoples' script might have been more substantive at some stage, the end result is merely an entertaining action film with a few nice ideas, and it works in that sense.To the credit of Peoples and Anderson, Soldier takes its time to build the characters and observe Todd as he struggles to ingratiate himself into a more peaceful culture. Peoples' script has a number of things on its mind, exploring if it's possible for a lifelong killing machine to assimilate themselves back into society.Anderson gets a lot of hate for his movies, but he knows how to construct fluid and exciting action scenes. The fight choreography here is solid, and the gun battles are bad-ass. When Todd cuts loose and sets out to eliminate his opponents, Soldier is insanely entertaining.Russell was handed a tough task in portraying Todd. Although the star is on-screen practically all the time, he only says about 100 words throughout the entire movie. Instead of using words to convey his character's feelings, Russell had to do all the heavy lifting with facial expressions and body language. And he pulls it off beautifully. It's a terrifically nuanced performance, showing that Russell is a better actor than he gets credit for. Also in the cast is Isaacs, who essentially plays a cartoonish, moustache-twirling villain. It's a cheesy role, but Isaacs seems to be in the right spirit. Gary Busey is here as well, showing us why every movie can benefit from a touch of Busey.unfortunately, the film was a box office disaster, grossing less than $15 million at the domestic box office and predominantly going straight-to-video in the rest of the world. The critics used it as a punching bag, as well. But it matters not. As long as you can accept the movie for what it is, it's a blast.

So we are given endless gory scenes of Russell in combat including a scene where he plunges his fingers in an opponents eye sockets. Story is unrealistic, predictable and totally dense. Director Paul Anderson should not be proud of this or his efforts involved. Russell's dialogue consists of words like, Duh. Jason Scott Lee makes more noise than most musicians. Other dull performances come from Connie Nielsen because the screenwriter obviously felt that a female lead or damsel is needed.

Sure it is exaggerated and simplistic, sure it is just another Rambo set in the future and a far away planet instead of a forest or jungle. As a kid, I watched it mainly for the action and Kurt Russell. I thought Kurt Russell was mesmerizing as Todd and I could really relate to his character. Nowadays it is mostly for its theme and still Kurt Russell that I watch the movie. (I'll get deeper into the theme). There is lots of action, but on the more naivé and simplistic side. With a Rambo-like character that can take on a whole army without getting a scratch, standard stuff for your average action movie. But although with the simple premise and approach, I still feel interest in this movie. It is not a groundbreaking movie. It is not the most well made movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good. With a subtle and convincing performance of Kurt Russell.Now to the real reason why I like this movie the theme. The theme has been explored many times before but I still find it interesting in this movie. The theme is dehumanization, it has been explored better and deeper, like in Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'. Also 'Full Metal Jacket' has a much more punching power than this movie. But in 'Soldier' it was quite touching with Todd's character development (Although I like Joker's character development better) and its exploration to its theme. Whilst in 'Full Metal Jacket', we get to see the consequences of dehumanization and its effects on mankind in the end, in 'Soldier' we head in the other direction where our main character begin to act more human and regain his humanity. Kind of like the other side of the coin. But I honestly prefer 'Full Metal Jacket', I feel it is more honest. But 'Soldier' is still an above average action movie even though it is quite simplistic. I honestly feel this movie is worth watching over and over again. Oh, also Kurt Russell doesn't spend half of his time on-screen spitting out cheesy one-liners like you would normally get in its genre, which I quite like.I give the movie 7/10 "},{"Title":"Kill em' all and let Kurt sort em' out","Date":"22 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Director Paul Anderson's Soldier is a really under rated and misunderstood action movie starring the legendary Kurt Russell. The screenplay was written by David Webb Peoples who is best known for penning classics like Blade Runner and Unforgiven. Set in a dystopian, futuristic sci fi setting. Kurt Russell is Sgt. Todd, a super soldier killing machine who has since birth only known fear and discipline. In this function, Todd excels. Todd was bred to be a soldier and by age 40 he has spent his entire life fighting and training. He ends up getting replaced by a new genetically engineered soldier that is faster and stronger. He is left for dead under high command and resides on a waste disposal planet in a community of outcasts. Todd has trouble coping with domestic life and throughout the course of the film finds some humanity. The new soldiers lack experience and end up on the waste disposal planet. The commander(Jason Issacs) has declared any survivors are hostiles and are to be used as target practice. What the military does not know is they are occupying Todd's new home and he has a score to settle. Soldier is mostly a straight up action movie, but there is a whole lot of subtext here that the critics of this film miss. As much as Todd excels at warfare, he can't function in normal civilian situations and has no idea how to function like a normal human being. Kurt embodies this character well and spent a year and a half training to prepare for the role. Most action actors are also dedicated to that part of the job. However, Kurt is equally effective in playing Todd's flaws as well. Todd is very effective in battle, but is very awkward and inept in a social setting. Kurt also conveys much of Todd's feelings with minimal dialogue, which Kurt makes look easy but is very difficult for most actors to do. This film bombed at the box office at the time of its release and probably has too much amped up testosterone for the wimpy 90's. Action fans however, should enjoy this.

Why I may ask?.The story is about are main character Todd who is an engineered military fighting machine, but after being left for dead on a remote planet he starts a new life. He must fight his very replacements to save his newly found friends. In every Paul W.S. Anderson movie that he direct's it always looks like it has a good budget to it like The Resident Evil film series, Mortal Kombat, Death Race and now this film, and just like some of his other films it always has the same results; a wasted opportunity of being good. I know Paul W.S. Anderson can be a good director, I found Alien Vs Predator to be my biggest guilty pleasure of all time and Mortal Kombat wasn't all that bad, so I know he can be good, but Soldier isn't one of them. The best way to possibly describe this nonsense of a film is be saying something like this Imagine you got all you're army action figures and you're small plastic gun figures together and simply set them on fire and throw them down the stairs and watch them go all over the place making has much noise as possible, then close your eyes and think to yourself God that was annoying and stupid, yeah that's this movie, that's this freaking movie!.Let's start off with the good Kurt Russell dose the best of what his got and that's saying a lot because of the blandness of his character. The action scenes are pretty well done if I must say and Gary Busey once again brings such a goofy performance but his so enjoyable to watch with the little screen time he got.Now for the bad and these a lot The movie is just bombarding with dull scenes and cardboard character's that the end of the day is a waste of time watching. Todd the main character of the film barely speaks a word through the film, yes he dose say a couple of lines but for most part his dead silent. Main character's barely not saying anything can be a big risk in movies but some films pulled it off really well like the movie Drive and it was all down to good writing, but this doesn't have good writing and the silent hero thing completely did not work at all and made the character less interesting to watch. The writing was pretty poor, the other character's I didn't really care about at all and I doubt that Kurt Russell has ever had less dialogue to work anywhere.

You can certainly see the appeal of it to an actor. The part requires a strict, almost entirely physical performance a la Tom Hanks' Castaway. It's a genuine challenge especially for an actor as passionate as Russell.It's no surprise then that Soldier was a kind of prequel to Scott's Blade Runner. Soldier may be a bit like the poor man's Blade Runner, and while it never achieves the mood of the aforementioned classic, it does have a strong sense of place and environment. Anderson transports us to other worlds. We appreciate this most about the filmmaker. Anderson's other strong suit is action. The use of colour, mattes and appropriately applied CGI is near perfect in generating a post-apocalyptic look a la Mad Max in space.Soldier is a satisfactory film for a variety of disparate moments and is one of Anderson's finest along with shopping , mortal combat , and event horizon.Soldier is actually an impressively mounted genre piece which offers its target audience ample value for money. And while writer Peoples' is not exactly at the height of his game here he wrote Blade Runner and Eastwood's Unforgiven, director Anderson , working with production designer David Snyder another Blade Runner veteran, has a enviable flair for the visual set-piece. By dint of his character, Russell's natural born killer may not have a lot to say, but action always did speak louder than words, and here he keeps it brisk and bloody. Soldier was a financial disaster costing 75 million, but only earned 15 million in return. Critics, as with most Anderson pictures were largely very unkind , but has since become a cult classic.The premise of Soldier is an interesting attempt at something different and oddly human especially for Anderson. But then something begins to happen, slowly, like the change within Sgt. Todd. It's small, but the transformation is enough that we feel something for this hardened man. Unfortunately, with emotion control at the core of this film, it's hard to know what to feel. Oddly enough, Anderson brings us one of his most human efforts or, like Todd, at least he tries.

As a result, when he is presumably killed in a fight with one of these enhanced soldiers the agency thinks nothing of dumping his body onto an uninhabited planet which is used for waste disposal. What his superiors don't realize is that not only is Todd 3465 not dead but that the planet isn't uninhabited. As a result, when they return a little later for a training exercise--with orders to kill anyone they might accidentally find on this planet--they don't factor Todd 3465 into this equation. Now, as far as the overall quality of this movie is concerned, allow me to say that while it combined an interesting plot with a plenty of action, I would have preferred that it contained a bit more depth. Be that as it may, I liked the performance of Kurt Russell. Likewise, I liked the presence of both Gary Busey (as Captain Church) and Connie Nielsen (Sandra).

A mindless soulless drone- like soldier who kills without question and its set in the future! how can that not be kick ass...*ahem*.So in the near future humans breed soldiers by taking them at birth and basically transforming them into hardened killers that obey without question with brutal military schooling, they only know the military way. Then along comes a smarmy greasy Colonel with a bunch of even better genetically engineered soldiers who were created from hand picked DNA to give maximum results in every human sense. Russell and his men are replaced and brushed aside.At its core this film is basically a revenge action thriller, but it does try for a warmer touch throughout. Russell's character 'Todd' is a merciless killer but after he is abandoned and left for dead on a garbage planet by his superiors he must learn to survive on his own. That is until he finds a human colony of scavengers who crashed on the planet years before. He is taken in and this is where the softer side comes in as the scavengers try to break his robotic military programming and make him more human again.This whole element isn't too bad and shows a good attempt at character building. We do get to see Todd slowly coming around as he is immersed in a more family orientated society. There are the obligatory ups and downs along the way and Todd has reoccurring nightmares which does feel rather clichéd but I guess its what you'd expect. It is good to see Todd becoming close with a young couples little boy, we never really get too much emotion from Todd, he barely says much for the entire film accept for yes Sir, no Sir and nods. I did find myself enjoying the simple story arch for Todd and the young family that take care of him, its basic sure but it works.Of course all that is filler simply for the big revenge action showdown at the end where Todd gets his chance to kill all the enhanced soldiers and their Colonel. Todd grows attached to the scavengers in his own way only so you feel more emotion when he must protect them in a whopping sci-fi shoot out. That shoot out being the main focus of the film and it doesn't disappoint if you ask me, its like 'Commando' on another planet with Russell taking down faceless futuristic soldiers with big guns, big knives and a few neck snaps.The one thing I find odd is why the Colonel and his soldiers do this 'security sweep' on this garbage planet. The planet seems to be known as a massive dumping ground for scrap with no known life on it, intelligent life anyway. So why on earth would they need to do a security sweep of it?? especially with all those huge armoured vehicles!. Well because the director needed a way to get the bad guys on the planet surface so Todd could kill them all that's why. Its just a shame that plot direction is so stupid.The film certainly looks slick considering it was made in 98. The planet looks pretty cool harsh and desolate, nice models, nice matte work, sets are decent and futuristic weapons/equipment look solid and authentic. I did get a feeling the film needed or wanted to be grander though, personally I wanted to see more of the planet, the military, it all felt a bit compressed and revolved around one area the entire time (the scavenger camp got a wee bit boring).I like the small Easter eggs though. The film was suppose to be set within the same universe as 'Blade Runner' (a sequel on the side) and there is a nod to that with the 'Battle at Tannhauser Gate' on Todd's service record. Plus Todd appears to have been decorated with the 'Plissken Patch'.I liked Russell's performance here, he comes across surprisingly well as a terminator-esque killbot and the lack of dialog also works surprisingly well. Visually the film is pleasing to the eye for any sci- fi buffs, the action is well directed and it is very satisfying to see Todd get his own back on Isaac's shitty Colonel character and his lackeys. The final battle between Russell and his uber opponent Jason Scott Lee is clichéd much like the rest of the film and felt like a typical JCVD fight sequence really. All in all I think Lee's character could have been left out really as he seemed too much of a daft predictable comicbook type bad guy. Overall this is definitely a guilty pleasure action film, you know its dumb but its also a good gritty ride.7/10 "},{"Title":"one of the best scifi in history","Date":"8 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Yes you got it right one of the best scifi movie in history.

The critics did not seem to like it much and other people's opinions ranged from it being good to it being really bad but it had good special effects. As such it is a movie that one should check out because you will probably be kicking yourself after missing it.The movie stars Kurt Russell as a soldier named Todd. Now the fact that Kurt Russell is in the movie means that I am automatically interested in it. Russell is one of my favourite actors, and his skill as an actor, in my opinion, has revealed itself to be more than I expected. Russell's character here is a very silent character and really communicates his feelings through expressions. It is not that he cannot act because movies like Big Trouble in Little China prove opposite. Rather this role would be a difficult role to play because one needs to be able to clearly express oneself through body language.Todd is a soldier who was raised as a fighting machine from birth. He is absolutely devoted to his superiors and never questions orders, as he has been ordered not to. Then he finds that he has been made obsolete by a better breed of soldiers and is dumped on a garbage planet after they believe him to be dead. On this planet is a group of colonists whose ship crashed and are stranded. They are a peaceful people who must fight against the elements, such as the sudden windstorms that rise up. The area in which they are living is considered to be uninhabited so when the soldiers are sent on a training mission there they expect it to be empty. Anybody that is in there shouldn't be and thus is automatically the enemy.Soldier has a very basic plot, but it is the themes that really makes the movie. The movie seems to critise the industrial military machine. These soldiers know nothing else other than to fight, and thus when they are put back into society they cannot offer any services. This is seen today, and is criticised in movies such as Major Payne. Moreso, the violence of the military machine is also attacked. It is the attitude that everybody is the enemy and it does not matter how many civilians die as long as peace is restored. The image that continues going through this movie is the woman carrying a baby who is shot because an enemy soldier is hiding behind her. In this movie human life is cheap and if you are not effectual then you are killed.The other theme in the movie is the idea of total annihilation of the enemy. One of the commanders says that the best way to remove insurgents is to bombard them with artillery. There is also the planet-buster which is designed to destroy the whole planet. It seems that everything here is cheap and if everything is destroyed just to remove one man then that is fine.I liked this movie and am glad that I went and saw it. It is not a deep movie with lots of twists and deceits, rather it is simple, straight forward, and creates a depth in a character that most people would expect would have none.

Soldier was written by David Peoples, who co-wrote the script for Blade Runner. By his own admission, he considers Soldier to be a sidequel/spiritual successor to Blade Runner. There are a lot of Easter eggs in the movie, homing tribute to Blade Runner. It also obliquely references various elements of stories written by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, on which Blade Runner is based), or film adaptations thereof. The film stars Kurt Russell as Sgt. Todd, a soldier trained from birth. The film also features Gary Busey, Jason Scott Lee, Jason Isaacs, Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and Michael Chiklis in supporting roles. In a futuristic society, some people are selected at birth to become soldiers, and trained in such a manner that they become inhuman killing machines. One of the best of these soldiers (Russell) gets pitted against a new breed of soldiers, and after the confrontation is believed to be dead. His body is left behind in a semi-abandoned colonial planet, where everything is peaceful, and he is taught about the other aspects of life. But eventually he has to fight the new breed of soldiers again, this time to defend his new home. 'Soldier ' definitely has a lot going for it, an interesting take on the future of warfare, a solid cast led by Kurt Russell, above average artistic vision, memorable lines, and well thought out action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. Personally, Kurt Russell s performance as Sgt. Todd is just not that good-just because you were born and bred to be a soldier doesn't mean you are going to walk around like a terminator shooting everyone instead of hiding and ducking behind cover like any rational human. It's hard to sympathize with a ruthless killer, just because he gets replaced by better killers? He slowly becomes more human as the film goes along when he finally somewhat gains a family in a community. Then the corporation hunting down towns attacks and he decides to defend it and get even. Still not strong enough, as it's clearly hard to figure out his humanity. It felt like one dimensional acting, yes I know he was made with one purpose, to be soldier. So yeah he's supposed to be a one dimensional guy. In this movie obviously it requires minimal dialogue&#x97;for such character. As the movie progresses and he spends more time with the family he shows more feelings and emotions&#x97;but still Kurt Russell's character is like a bored dog staring at you when it's not biting the mailman. The main premise of this movie is that old Sun Tzu saying (paraph) One man defending his family is worth 10 hired men attacking him. Todd is a better warrior because he gets something worth fighting for. Nice visuals and stuff as there were some weak CG in a couple scenes. The movie did a fine job of raising important questions. Example if you aren't fighting to protect civilians, what is your purpose? It brings into focus the whole issue of a state versus its citizenry, possibly the dominant problem of the 21st century. Then there is the ethical issue of tampering with nature. Sociopaths always think they can get their way if they just find more sophisticated ways of manipulating the world around them. The outcome is always disastrous. How could you even use that sentence in the context of this movie? Why? It's got a great story, some solid acting, awesome characters, and just the right amount of action and story. Check out Soldier.

While I did find this to be entertaining, I can see why some wouldn't like it. I personally like the movie, even though I can see it wasn't a great movie.Kurt Russell plays the role of Todd very well. He undoubtedly got into excellent shape for his role and it shows. Sure, other actors could have played Todd as well, but Russell was a good choice here. The premise of this movie was a good one, though some parts could have been trimmed and concentrated a little more on the character from birth until his abandonment. The movie at times seems rushed and in some cases, poorly edited.Jason Isaacs (before his career making turn in the Patriot) shows up here in an almost generically campy role of Col. Mekum. He's supposed to be weaselly and cowardly, but generally Isaacs did a good job with the material he was given. Gary Busey was wasted a little here as Church - he should have been shown with Todd and the old soldiers a little more before the introduction of the new breed, to show his loyalties to the old soldiers. Sean Pertwee (along w/ Isaacs in Anderson's Event Horizon) is OK in his part of Mace, Connie Nielsen does OK in her limiting role as Sandra - both are not given enough screen time to care about their characters in my opinion, but the point is there. A pre-Shield Michael Chiklis shows up as Jimmy Pig. Jason Scott Lee is fitting as Caine 607.The basic premise of men trained since birth to become the ideal soldiers, only to be replaced by newer, genetically enhanced soldiers was a good one, though of course not original. Certainly this movie was better than both Solo and Universal Soldier, which were along the lines of the same idea. Had Russell not taken this role, easily this would have probably faltered a lot more if Van Damme or someone like that been cast instead. Generally, I thought the movie could have been a little longer on both the training and arrival of the new soldiers, and Todd's time on the planet.As mentioned previously, at times the movie seems rushed and at other times, it's poorly edited. Some scenes are looped and there are completely visible mistakes in the movie. It's predictable enough, but a lot of movies are generally. None of these 'issues' ruined it for me. I've watched this movie several times & own the DVD and am entertained every time I watch it.In my opinion, it's worth a watch if you're an action or sci-fi fan. Form your own judgment. As long as you don't expect a masterpiece, I think you'll enjoy it for the most part. Everyone has their own opinions and while I do enjoy the movie for what it is, I can see what's weak about it and it is certainly not one of Anderson's best, nor is it overall great, but I like it enough to stand by it. Try it.....you might be pleasantly surprised.

Russell is great as the titular character, and even though he doesn't say an awful lot, actions speak louder than words.This film also lives in the same world as Bladerunner and Alien, objects are referenced, and even Russells past characters are referenced at the beginning, so it demands a repeat viewing at least.It's light on action, nothing really explodes until an hour into the film, so people expecting a full on action fest will feel short changed.Anderson does another okay job, and is joined by regulars Pertwee and Issacs who do good jobs.Busey and Scott Lee look a little bewildered with the whole thing, but all in all its a fun movie.

But this time, it isn't the machines we have to worry about, its us. Kurt Russell and Jason Scott Lee are both excellent in this minimalist drama about future soldiers who have no other interests than being soldiers. Neither have many lines, since soldiers only speak when they are spoken to. So it comes down to their ability to convey their characters with expression, which is not an easy thing to do. But they both manage to pull it off nicely. Gary Busey is perfect as the Old School captain in opposition to Jason Isaacs as the over confident Colonel Mekum. Connie Nielsen and Sean Pertwee do well as the stranded couple trying to raise their son and make a life on a hostile and harsh planet. Overall, the film has the right feel and the right depth of scientific development. No phaser rifles, but lots of over-sized heavy weapons and machinery. The story development is interesting, and there are plenty of scenes where Todd is exposed to the lives of the colonists, a world he is unfamiliar with and uncomfortable in. Rated R for violence and language, the younger teens should be able to watch this without a lot of concerns.

I can't believe that it tanked in the theaters.The story and writing is absolutely top-notch; an original theme with interesting plot direction that I'd expect from a good flick.Kurt Russel delivers what I firmly and without sarcasm believe is the finest acting performance that I have *ever* seen in *any* movie of *any* genre. 79 words in 99 minutes, yet through only extremely subtle body language and facial expression, you know exactly what it is that he's thinking, and wishes that he - as a trained Soldier - could say.If you only want an action movie for bloody gore, this isn't for you either. Certainly a lot of action and violence, but not the over-the-top, blood-and-guts style that has become so prominent these days.If it has a downside, it comes in special effects. I don't know if they used some strange miniatures or just overdone backdrops, but a few of the shots are admittedly rather poor - however, they are also very quick and essentially unimportant to the rest of the film.Brains and determination over brawn and blind ambition, a great movie for anyone. Foul language is very limited, but it is there, so if you have smaller ones that you'd like to keep away from that, I'm afraid there's that to contend with. Few and far between, but they do belt out a couple.Timothy Dalton and Gary Busey were also great casting for their roles. This was filmed before Mr. Busey whacked his head on the pavement and became the Crazy Mr. Busey that we know today.8/10 rating? Yes, would have been a 9 if those minor special effects scenes had been better. It deserves the high rating, for any film of any genre, and Mr. Russel should have at the very least been nominated for a Best Actor award.

Mostly because Russell took a reported $20 million pay cheque. What's great is that he clearly put in the work for that money. Looking buffer than ever and certainly capturing the correct look and tone for his character. I watched this not knowing it was a Paul W.S. Anderson film, which was lucky as I would have judged it before a single frame. Soldier focuses on Russell as Todd, a soldier that has been training since he was a child. Forced to watch dogs slaughtering pigs, heavy endurance tests where the loser is shot, and cognitive training too. Todd is a veteran of many wars, none of which have taken their toll on him, mostly because he doesn't have to socialise with civilians. Enter Jason Isaacs in moustached sneering form with his genetically engineered soldiers. They are stronger, faster, and better. After a training test Russell is believed dead and sent to a trash disposal planet. There he meets some people and he learns to care etc. Russell has so few lines you could actually count them on your toes and fingers. He uses subtle facial techniques and body posture. His reaction to his first ever hug is very emotional and powerful. The action is competent at least, and it's great to see some real violence in a sci-fi movie. The main theme shows that soldiers and loyalty are important, but it's almost important to keep the humanity that is present. I loved it when Russell went nuts, but never lost his cool, his intelligence and experience rises him above the new improved soldiers. There are moments where Anderson is clearly visible on screen. The lack of subtlety concerning Isaacs hammy performance being the main fault. An underrated and enjoyable action movie.

Soldier isn't Star Wars or Blade Runner, but it doesn't try to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable, completely satisfying escapist fare. The special effects and action sequences are nothing eye-popping, but they're solidly put together, and the acting (though some of the minor characters are pretty thin-grade cardboard) is generally quite good.

I went out and bought it the day after renting it. Let there be no doubt that it is filled with sci-fi clichés and no attempt is made to explain the history of the setting. However, those familiar with sci-fi will have no trouble filling in the blanks. The meat of the story centers around the relational struggle between an old soldier and a hippy commune located on a rather dangerous planet (environmentally and two-legged-critterwise). There are striking parallels with our own American (sheltered) culture's relationships with our own soldiers. The movie follows the relationship between the old soldier and the commune as it changes from one resembling what existed between Vietnam vets and American mainstream society in the 60s and 70s to what it ought to be and toward which we are currently moving, slowly.The writer worked heavily in symbolism and perhaps overdid it if he was expecting the film to be a blockbuster.

Nothing new in terms of ideas or plot really. Just a pretty good film.My only gripe was with the garbage ships. Why? It has to be more cost effective to shoot garbage into your local sun than ship it across the galaxy and dump it. Or just shoot it into space full stop. The need for a waste planet was purely a plot device to create an apocalyptic world for the setting.However the rest of the movie was a pleasant surprise. Kurt Russell is pretty inert as the emotionless Todd, a soldier born to kill without thought and follow orders without thinking. To be honest, my first thought was that any actor could have played the role with equal conviction. But what was needed here was an actor with charisma to make up for the lack of dialogue and expression. And Kurt fit that role very nicely.The supporting cast were all good too. Jason Scott Lee as Todd's nemesis Caine is equally emotionless. Jason Isaacs plays the jumped-up Colonel in charge of exterminating the colonists, a role he seems to be very good at. Sean Pertwee gets another minor role here, and seems at his best playing soldiers (see Dog Soldiers). Finally the King of bit-part bad-guy roles, Gary Busey, does his usual stuff here.Apart from the garbage ships, this is good action fare.

That's why after my second viewing of Soldier I felt I should post a comment of my own.I liked this film quite a bit (8/10) because it is in the tradition of the best suspense films  a simple plot, executed well by writer, director and actors.  The stunts and fight scenes are of the traditional type (believable, choreographed action - not insane, physically impossible CGI) and are very well done.  Everything moves at a quick pace, without being so fast as to confuse the viewer.In Soldier, Kurt Russell plays a soldier selected from birth and trained from a young age by a military which seems to need the most ruthless and efficient men to achieve their objectives. After many successful campaigns, Russell's soldier (Sgt. Todd) is tested against a newer, genetically enhanced model who beats him and leaves him for dead.  Deemed obsolete, wounded gravely, and in a coma, Sgt. Todd is hauled away with garbage and dumped on a planet inhabited by some ragtag colonists. There he recovers to find himself stranded and separated from all he has known and counted on in his life.The colonists Sgt. Todd meets are pacifists and don't have a need for a soldier.  They have been attacked by soldiers in the past and are afraid of him.  They argue over whether or not Sgt. Todd can safely join their community and whether or not he has any worth as a member of their group.This is where the film shines and separates itself from other films which have similar plot elements.  Sgt. Todd is shown to not want to leave his old role at all.  Locked into military modes of behavior, Sgt.Todd refers to everyone as sir and expects for them to give him orders.  For him to do anything else would acknowledge that he is no longer a soldier, and that's something he can't bear.  So, although Todd has been abandoned by the military, he can't allow himself to become too much like the pacifists, or find anyway to let himself fit in.  Still, he has nowhere to go and nothing to do, and he stays nearby his new community hoping to be a part of it even as his own soldierly behavior keeps him separate.This section of the film is the biggest reason I liked Soldier.  It is well written, beautifully directed and brilliantly acted.  Russell's performance is dead-on, as Sgt. Todd's face remains a wooden mask even as his eyes move constantly and betray the confusion, fear and longing the character is experiencing.From my perspective Sgt.Todd is every person who has ever found themselves shoved outside of a role that defined them.  Whether a person was pushed out of a job by new management, has retired and failed to find a replacement for the meaning their work once gave them, or has given their life to their spouse and children just to see their spouse die and their children leave home, each of us faces events where we lose the things that make us who we are.  That is what Sgt. Todd represents.Soldier concludes by bringing the community of colonists into conflict with the same military machine which rejected Sgt. Todd.  Now the same community which questioned Todd's worth is relying on him.  Todd has his purpose again, both in fighting for the people who begrudgingly accepted him, and in facing the new breed of soldiers who replaced him.Granted, the ending is somewhat predictable, and the plot as a whole has many familiar elements.  Perhaps that's why some people trashed Soldier. Yet those similarities with other movies meant very little to me.  In my eyes the total unwillingness of Sgt. Todd to leave his old role as a soldier made the familiar elements of the plot unique, and in every film the telling of the story is usually what makes a movie worth watching.As a piece of storytelling, Soldier is a tightly wound, action-oriented, Sci-Fi film with a simple message.  It has no calculated comic relief and takes no huge suspension of disbelief to go along with its high tech trappings.  There are no grand special effects displays to distract a viewer from the story.  It begins, develops and then concludes.  It does all of this with dispatch, but not with such dispatch that anything seems missing. As such, I enjoyed it fully.-SCG "}{"Title":"Very good","Date":"24 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I watched this at the theater and on dvd.

The special effects were not the focus of this science fiction movie, an extreme rarity nowadays. Kurt Russell is simply incredible as Todd. The refugees on the planet on which Todd is dumped are likable and understandable. The villain, Colonel Mekum is not as well developed as he should be, but he is good enough. Possible spoilers ahead Todd is raised from birth to be the perfect soldier. We see him in action and in training. Then Mekum comes along with new soldiers that are cloned to perfection. Todd and two others are defeated by one of the new soldiers and are all presumed dead. Mekum orders them to be dumped on a planet to avoid paperwork. Todd is still alive when he is dumped on the planet. He meets the refugees that crash landed there earlier, and his wounds get treated. He saves the life of one of them, but when he has flashbacks of a previous battle, he nearly kills the same man. When he tries to teach the son of the family that cares for him how to kill a snake to defend himself, the parents think he is just allowing the snake to attack their son. The refugees asks tell him to leave, but they will still help him if he needs anything. When the parents of the boy are asleep, a snake crawls into their bed, and their son kills it before either of them get bit. The father realizes what a mistake he made, and races out to find Todd and bring him back. No sooner does he find him, when Mekum arrives with the new soldiers to test them out. Russell makes Todd a fully fleshed out character. In every scene involving Todd, we never feel like we are in the dark about his feelings. He is easy to read, and despite all the people he killed in his battles, we feel for him. All his life he was used as a machine, not a human being. Same as his fellows. When he lands on the planet, he sees a community that has people that care for one another. There is not one despicable refugee on the planet. The one character who could have been, offers to help Todd when the refugees are under attack. With people like this to protect, who couldn't root for Todd to win? The fight between Todd and Caine is perfectly handled fast paced and realistic. The only sour part was at the end when the two officers besides Mekum were left to die on the planet. Those two didn't deserve it. And who can forget the ending, when the little boy Nathan, the son of the family, wanted Todd to pick him up. After the death of his father, Todd was the only one left that he could look up to. Todd, despite having very few lines, is one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen. Ditto for the rest of the old soldiers who follow Todd at the end. This movie did not deserve to bomb as bad as it did.

Why does the garbage craft maintain a breathable atmosphere, or for that matter, why does it dump on a planet that can support human life?  How exactly does Todd survive the journey in an evident coma?  Why isn't Caine 607 put down after losing his eye, when his only use is to walk point and take the first hit?  But I overlook things like this and enjoy the story.We see Todd conditioned from birth to be a machine; the perfect soldier who knows only fear and discipline.  Like any other machine, he is replaced in time by a better machine.  This generation of Soldiers are engineered to be better, faster, stronger.  But in the end, the obsolete Soldier who has something to believe in is worth far more than his replacements.My friend and I had gone to see Soldier.

The squatter community is a bit overly done as a homey kinda place, but most of the characters are interesting enough of what we see of them. As someone else noted, it's the fact that Todd triumphs because he has something to fight for (despite being readily beat previously).I could live without the main and somewhat obligatory bad guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever and even has a black bad-guy mustache.  And Busey seems to have been a couple of good phrases and has a kinda workin' for a paycheck kind of ambience to him. There are some good minor performances (I've always liked Paul Dillon from Pretender, and his You need a hand, partner? line to Todd is a classic).

"}{"Title":"Am I the only one who saw more than brainless action in this film?","Date":"22 July 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The story is simple a group of soldiers, trained from birth to be unemotional, brutal killers, are replaced by a newer line of genetically engineered soldiers. After a bloody 3-on-1 battle between the old and the new, the bodies of the old soldiers(one of them not quite dead) are dumped on a barren planet. Also on this planet is a colony, whose ship crashed years before. Todd(Russell) is taken in, then expelled, by these people. Soon after another ship arrives, carrying the improved soldiers. Their commanding officer(Issacs) feels it would be a good way for them to get some field experience, since there's supposedly no inhabitants. His orders are to sweep the area and if anyone is found they are to be classified as hostile and eliminated. Led by Caine(Lee), who defeated Todd in the match mentioned earlier, they follow their orders and the expected showdown ensues. The details of the story aren't important, though.What matters in this film is the standard scenario of the unemotional man becoming more emotional. I know it sounds stupid, and, yes, it is melodramatic. Fortunately, we have Kurt Russell(speaking very few lines) in the lead role and a script that attempts to be moving without being manipulative or exaggerated. The whole thing is handled quite well, so I'll start at the beginning.Before Todd is defeated and dumped, we have a short sequence detailing his training, which is like something out of A Clockwork Orange. First step desensitization. Watching three dogs viciously rip a wild boar to shreds while a monotone voice chants various phrases(Mercy is a weakness.) in the background is a prime example. Second step endurance. The trainees are taken on a long run. Anyone who falls behind is shot. Third and final step the test. Trainees prove themselves by beating the living hell out of each other and shooting hostages during target practice. This entire sequence is probably more brutal than many viewers can stand. For this reason, people(those who continue to watch) choose to distance themselves. However, the intention of it is to involve you, and if you aren't involved the rest of the film will most likely seem stupid and corny.Cut forward to the planet and Todd's attempted integration into the colony. Here is where most of the film takes place. During the next series of events we see his progress(or lack of same). A couple, Mace and Sandra(Pertwee, Neilsen), takes him in to oversee his recovery. At one point Sandra asks Todd if he feels anything. When he responds with fear and discipline she hugs him. This is the first time we see him uneasy. No one has displayed any emotion towards him before so he's not sure how to react. The next notable encounter comes with Mace and Sandra's son, Nathan. As Nathan is watching a poisonous snake(he was bitten when he was younger) slither towards him Todd throws him a boot and shows him how to kill the snake, but he doesn't appear to understand. When the snake springs toward Nathan, Todd catches it(in mid-flight) and throws it back into the corner. Before anything else can happen Mace enters and kills the snake, surprised that Todd wasn't doing anything about it. Todd is eventually voted out of the colony. He takes refuge in a giant cylinder(not sure what it is). A tear slides down his cheek and, again, he's not sure what's happening because he's never felt anything before. Back at the colony, Nathan's little training session proves useful and Mace realizes they made the wrong decision by voting him out. Unfortunately, by the time Mace finds Todd the transport ship arrives and the fireworks begin.There are several things Peoples was trying to say with this script. Many dismiss the final sequence as simply good triumphing over evil, but that's not what he meant. The point Peoples was trying to make(I think) is that even when you fight your hardest you'll still fight harder when you've got a reason.Anyway, the technical aspects of this film are pretty good. Paul Anderson, while obviously not the best choice to direct a character-driven script, gives it all the visual style you could ask for(and then some). The set design and effects are as good as you'd expect from a $75 million budget.Soldier is far from an original film, borrowing concepts from just about every Sci-Fi source you can imagine, but the execution is good, as is the film overall. If you're one of those poor, unimaginative people who don't have the ability to become engrossed in a film you're going to hate this one. You need to lend something of yourself to it in order to get the intended effect. Like I said, Anderson is not a character-driven director. So, if you can imagine, check this out. I think you'll be surprised.

Sean Pertwee is the head of the family and when Todd doesn't quite fit into their society, the resourceful survivors send him into the wilderness.Pertwee realises he and his friends have made a mistake and goes off to find the weeping troop.Then all hell breaks loose when Todd's old military officers arrive to blow everyone away. With Gary Busey and Jason Isaacs (Armageddon) going through the motions as cartoon villains, you don't need to be a genius to realise they will get their come uppance.Soldier is a formulaic film which benefits from some good production design, okay effects and that glorious photography by Phantom Menace veteran David Tattersall.There's some fair action scenes and a few nice touches such as the merge between a golden lit tunnel to the arc of the garbage planet.The fact that this is written by Blade Runner's David Webb Peoples means we get the odd reference to the legendary Tannhauser Gate (as mentioned by Rutger Hauer's character at the end of BR) but there's none of the style he brought to both that film and 12 Monkeys.Soldier is effectively a cross between Shane and Seven Samurai but although it's competent enough in the look, the script could have done with a lot more work.

There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about.  If you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad Aliens clone. But, again, that's not what it's about.The movie is really about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions.  And he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.The surrounding social logic is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.

Some punching violent fighting scenes, VAN DAMME style kickboxing and lots of bloody needless closeups, the type of images that make the usual macho braindead crowd cheer with excitment and drool spit all over the person who´s in front. So i was going to press fast forward on my Vcr, when Gary Busey appeared on screen. And i was finding pretty strange that Kurt Russel would be in such a bad kickboxing movie, anyway. So i decided to give it on more chance.And now im glad i did. Because for some strange reason, i really ended up enjoying this movie very much. I think it was the action movie i liked the most in recent years. Am i crazy ?!! Even i, am doubting of my sanity right now.First i liked the atmosphere in this movie. The idea of the garbage planet and how the humans got to live there was not the most original thing in the world, but it was very well presented, and the landscapes really looked very good. Then i liked the visual style in the special effects. I normally hate this kind of computer graphics, but in SOLDIER i didn´t thought they were all that bad. Ok, they look like computer graphics, but are there any movie in which this is diferent ?!! Even in MATRIX or in TITANIC we clearly see when they use computer animation, so why this now would be an excuse to dislike this movie ?Then i think Kurt Russel ,did a very good job with a character like this. True, he doesn´t have many lines, but this fits perfectly with the character. And despite that, this character has much more humanity, than any other carboard war character i ever seen. Something RAMBO wish it had. Soldier was a person, and i think a very credible one, which acted as someone with his background suposed to act. In this case if it had more dialogue i think it would look much more artificial.Despite all the violence in this movie, i liked the fact there even the cliché situations managed to create a believable human atmosphere. Even the bad guys, were not so bad. Probably the only villain this movie has his the commander of the troops. All others are just people like the Soldier who got into opposite sides by chance of fate.So i liked this movie very much, it might not be a such a great piece of art, but it´s an entertaining movie, and i think it has much more depth than it seems at first. Beyond the aparent emptiness of its screenplay and its characters, realy can makes us think and pose some interesting questions about the future of War.And this is a very interesting thing for a movie that is suposed to be so bad.Believe me, there are much worst things you can watch. Overall, it´s a good action movie and a very good sci-fi, wich might seem worst than it is.Just look at it withouth thinking of RAMBO and you might start to find some qualities in it.Very good.

Pretty soon I was hooked. Although I found the fight scenes a little too graphic for my liking, generally the special effects were not so overwhelming as to be mind numbing (as they are so often in movies of this genre).  For me the real appeal was watching Kurt convey his suffering at his alienation from humanity, as well as his slow awareness of how much had been stolen from him by his barbaric upbringing.  I also felt his revenge/defence of the settlers at the end of the movie was fitting and justified.  The director resisted the urge to have him do a complete turnaround and overcome the many years of conditioning.

I'm not a big fan of soldier/war-type films, but I'm glad my brother rented Soldier.I loved Kurt Russell's acting.  There aren't many actors who have the skill/talent it takes to portray a character like Todd.  Given very little dialog, Russell is able to convey Todd's emotions, intelligence, and strengths and weaknesses through facial expressions and body language. Todd's/Russell's transformation from an unfeeling killing machine to a more sensitive but still dedicated soldier is believable. Another actor might not have been so convincing.  In this case, the lack of dialog lends the character---at least in the hands of Kurt Russell---an aura of intelligence rather than a lack thereof.While others are making comparisons to Terminator, I think the film is more kin to something like Dune.  Soldier is a sci-fi action film. People expecting mainly fight scenes and excessive violence might get turned off by the deep themes presented in the movie.

You just know that when the soldier  is seemingly vanquished early on in the film by one of these monstrosities that a time for reckoning will come later - and it does in spades!!The plot is a little bit Rocky, a little bit Terminator and a little bit High Noon/Magnificent Seven .

Kurt Russell is a highly trained, effective soldier who finds himself phased out by a genetically supreme race of soldiers in the early 21st century.  He is beaten up in a grudge match and, left for dead, is shipped off to Arcadia, a garbage planet far, far away.  But wait, he's not dead!  He befriends the planet's inhabitants, who, conveniently enough, speak English, celebrate Christmas, and dance to Irish jigs. Oh, and there are these killer snakes which are tiny, but the women and children of the planet aren't strong enough to kill them.  They show up whenever the film starts lagging and needs some false drama.  Soldier befriends a family, he becomes attracted to the woman (although he can't really express emotion, so we just know because we're shown a starting to feel emotion montage), and teaches the son how to kill snakes with his boot.  The townspeople kick him out in a cliched trial scene on the grounds that he's too aggressive for their colony.  But they invite him back (with an overwrought we were wrong!! speech) to help kill invaders who, coincidentally, are the same fleet that made him obsolete.The only redeeming thing about seeing this film in the theaters is seeing how quickly people flee once the first end credit appears on screen. Where I saw it, the theater was cleared in about 20-30 seconds.  You'd think someone phoned in a bomb threat.Movies often transport us to fantastical worlds, far removed from the humdrum of everyday life.  I hope that _this_ world is one I will never, ever have to visit again.

I was not expecting any deep plot or awesome acting.  I was mildly surprised.  I have heard people complain that Russell (as Sgt. Todd) was too wooden and unemotional, but I thought that he used his eyes very well to express his emotions (mostly fear, loneliness, and determination--exactly how I expect I would feel if I were given the same upbringing as Todd).  After all, Todd would have been conditioned to believe that an outward display of emotion was weakness; and weakness, as the film tells us, is death.  This film is very much like a book in that you have to use your imagination and accept the movie premise to get into it (or just go with the testosterone flow that it seems to invoke in some people). Just about the only thing that surprised me in the movie was the 11/12-year-old Todd, and I stayed thru the credits to confirm my suspicions regarding the actor.  The only other thing that surprised me was what I believe the writer or director was trying to say about a society that builds a warrior/fighter caste rather than using people to fight it's battles.  I certainly wasn't expecting that.  I was slightly disappointed in the boar/doberman scene, but only because I think a real boar would've put up more of a fight and gotten a few good licks in. The plot wasn't great (it was very predictable), but it held together, even in the weakest part (after all, the present-day army plays war-games in areas as close to deserted as they can get, so why wouldn't the future army do something similar?).  Surprisingly enough, the part that I felt was least believable was the type of society the castaways formed.  Usually, unless they were raised in an interactive type of society, such a communal/democratic society wouldn't have been able to hold together that long (over 16 years, if I remember correctly) without someone taking a more firm control than that shown in the movie.  Overall, I wouldn't mind seeing it again and hope that someone makes a better sequel showing what happened to the obsolete soldiers as well as the castaways.

Blade Runner, Unforgiven, and Hero were his earlier takes on the subject.  This isn't up to those standards, but come on, what is? Soldier has some serious problems, not so much in the story as in the overly explicit, not very convincing explanations used to set the story up. (Flying through space to dump garbage, testing soldiers skills by seeing how they do against unarmed and untrained civilians) but once the conflicts are in place it is a decent entry on some of THE central themes in literature. I'm not a big fan of Russell's, preferring his Used Cars performance to his Escape from New York hard ass.  This is a hot performance and would be a hot performance for anyone.  Half a haunted child, half a killer with no imagination, unable to escape either part, he communicates clearly a sense of loss and separation that this character could hardly have articulated. References abound in this movie but they are not just the spare parts some of the trendier types throw in to prove they've been at a movie, but invitations to consider this story in the light of Frankenstein and The Searchers, John Henry and Shane. If you're the type of moviegoer who can sympathize with a good attempt, relax until Kurt/Todd gets on the planet, most of the silly stuff disappears and  classic confrontations unfold.

Kurt Russell is perfect for the part of the haggard, aging warrior and is very well placed opposite Lee as the genetically enhanced super soldier (Lee even looks like a work of genetic engineering with his porpoise like face and wide set eyes).  Kurt's portrayal of a man designed for service yet discovering his humanity is impeccable, it is a very difficult role to play and he has pulled it off very well.  Predictable? Yes, but excitingly so.  Unfortunetly, the sets often look like an episode of Star Trek Next Generation, complete with clean people in ravaged environments, but this can be overlooked.  The movie is notable for its convincing story of a man raised to fight for the army, and forced to find some humanity, but more so as food for thought; can we be programmed from birth in such a way that makes us completely controllable and subservient, and what remains of our soul under all the conditioning; as well as, what is the future of the military?

It plays like a Philip K. Dick adaptation - its nearest recent comparison would be to Screamers, adapted from Dick's Second Variety.  SOLDIER's writer, David Peoples, wrote the screenplay for acclaimed Dick adaptation BLADE RUNNER. He also wrote UNFORGIVEN, which took Clint Eastwood, an actor of limited range, and played perfectly to his strengths by giving him little to say and a town to protect.  The same thing is done here with the even more limited Kurt Russell.  (Lazy reviewers who claim to prefer Russell's Snake Pliskin would undoubtedly have wanted Eastwood to stick with his Spaghetti-western serape, sombrero and stogie too.)There is some wasted motion in the plot, and some of the big moments don't quite work, but as a classic sci-fi treatment, SOLDIER is light-years ahead of the asteroid and dinosaur movies.

He is defeated in a ****ing contest between two of his commanding officers when he fights Jason Scott Lee, who whips him and two of his comrades severely. The officers decide to dispose of the bodies somewhere far away from where they are. They miss the fact that while the other two are dead, Kurt isn't.The story progresses where Kurt is landed in a society of people who want to leave the planet they're on, but lack the means. The planet is assumed to be deserted, and has become one big trash dump. Try as they may, the people can't get the attention of the trash dumpers which they figure are automated. They are a relatively peaceful, normal society. They take Kurt in, who can't fit in well because of his upbringing.I won't give away any more of the story, but this movie has a lot to say about our society using an individual and not giving him the respect he deserves when he is no longer the best. It is also a story about brains over brawn, and learning to deal with emotions. There are several scenes which are touching, buried in the over-abundance of violence associated with a movie of this genre.The story slams our throw-away society. Out with the old and in with the new. Sometimes the new isn't as good as the old...In some ways, I was reminded of the Rambo movies, especially the fact that Kurt couldn't fit in, but felt there was more hope.I give this movie 4 of 5 stars for the Kurts portrayal of the soldier, learning how to feel, the good over evil triumph, and Connie Nielsen's beauty.

Todd, chosen from birth to serve his country on whatever battlefield he may be put upon, to follow orders without question, to be efficient, and lethal.  But what happens to our veteran after a training accident involving a new breed of re-combined and streamlined up-and-comers leaving him seemingly incapacitated is not covered in the manual he received in Basic Training.  Presumed dead he is dumped on a waste disposal planet and taken in by a group of galactic castaways, themselves stranded on the hostile planet after catastrophe struck during their colonial expedition.  The efforts of the Colonists to assimilate Todd into their peaceful society set the backdrop for the ultimate defense of the colony against Todd's replacements.Even though I was thinking that if Todd were merely the dead sheriff returned to seek vengeance that this would be eerily like High Plains Drifter, I was able to forgive the aching familiarity of the Deathwish/Pale Rider/Three Amigos (trust me, it's there) Ultra-Action formula because of one thing  Kurt Russell is COOL.  At forty he is still tough, still impressive, and this time he does a good job of acting too.  I mean, you kind of have to when you only utter few words every half-hour of a two-hour movie.  Coupled with superb direction of action, and despite a stock plot, Russell brings it all together and makes the movie depend on him.  He takes a two dimensional character and fills it out with fear, and discipline, and a cautious sense of wonder.SOLDIER is a guy's movie that works simply, and well, on a small scale.  The great achievement of the film is its ability to justify the characters' future actions based on what has gone into their training and development. Like some great nightmare of B.F. Skinner, (the Grandfather of Behavioral Psychology), they all behave reasonably if you accept the conditions of their development as reasonable.Go see this movie if you want to see Kurt Russell look cool and kick *ss. Go see this movie if your boyfriend would like to see Kurt Russell look cool and kick *ss.

The majority of the movie deals with the development of character and the roles we play in society.  By the end you actually might find yourself giving a damn about what's happening to everyone.

Sure, you can say the plot line is generic, the effects are gratuitous, and there are not enough emotional elements, but in the end you'll just be criticizing yourself.  The film makers, as opposed to setting out to create an all-encompassing melo-dramatic Independence Day clone, instead set out to create a nostalgic return to the violent, unpolitically correct action genre popularized in the mid-1980's.  It is quite obvious that while they most certainly realize the ineptness of the film's drama, they are very aware of the effects that it will have on the viewer.  The explosions, violence, and fight scenes are there not to give you a warm, squishy feeling inside (like they are in films like ID), but rather to elevate you to a level of rage and hostility equivalent to the characters on screen.  And, upon watching the film, by the time you get to the climax, where Kurt Russell stands above a broken and bloodied body, stares menacingly at the camera, and remains unflinching as fire and explosions shoot up in the background, you'll find yourself so wrapped up in the story that you will have no choice but to jump to your feet, throw your arms up, and shout RRRRAAAAAAAA!!!!! at the top of your lungs (as some rednecks behind me actually did in the theatre).  While this film may not be comparable to People's earlier sci-fi classic Blade Runner, it is my opinion that it is a great break from the watered-down, contrived, and very obviously foolish films that populate the genre.  It is true that Soldier is perhaps mind candy, but it is mind candy for the sophisticated and courageous film-goer, as opposed to the typical pimply-faced teens and unimaginative critics that seem to love ridiculous movies like Fifth Element and Deep Impact.  I intend on seeing this movie at least two more times before it comes out on video.  I have no choice but to give it*** out of ****.

Todd's suffering face get old fast. Still, for any American male who carried around a 1A draft card (immediately available for service) there is poignancy to Todd's story and some effective commentary on Selective Service and the dream of creating the perfect soldier. SOLDIER is also a serious, if flawed, study of the moral issues facing a man inside so perverse a system. Todd has a code, and he makes ethical decisions in terms of it, muddling through as best he can.SOLDIER is not Joe Haldeman's THE FOREVER WAR--the antidote to Robert A. Heinlein's STAR SHIP TROOPERS--and it's definitely not ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or PATHS OF GLORY or FULL-METAL JACKET.  But released around the time of a periodic US governmental review of US military planning, it is a worthy attempt to get people, Americans especially, to look at some assumptions on the individual's obligation to the State, and what the State owes individuals. Raising such questions, and raising them in a Kurt Russell flik to boot, may be a source of some not-so-legitimate dislike behind some of the very legit. complaints about the movie.

Kurt Russell gives an admirable performance as Todd and you throw in the late Jon Pertwee's son Sean as the man who takes him into the encampment where Todd soon finds a new reason for living. Connie Nielsen is radiantly beautiful and a strong female presence as the heroine/widow/concerned mother.The pervasive stench of mediocrity which surrounds all of this feel-good, emotional rollercoaster, uplifting drivel that we are spoon fed makes it all the more worthwhile when a film like Soldier takes you on a futuristic adventure of even a marginal sort.Connie Nielsen is radiantly beautiful and also a strong female heroine/concerned mother.

Yes Mekum's new models are stronger and faster but also they are morons. Several scenes highlight this Caine does not notice Todd is going to ram him until about 5 seconds before it happens. Also how does Todd beat the physically superior Caine? He looks down at a weapon; Caine the big dummy he is follows Todd's gaze, then Todd slices him open with the hanging prop blade. When they first fought Caine sensed Todd above him but let him have that advantage which cost him his eye. Everyone remember what Mekum says to him? He calls him a big moron and yells at him. You can tell he is thinking of shooting him. The second objection from the New Age Matriarchy is oh it is so brutal it is so cruel and cold. Hello, these are warriors trained from birth to fight and die on command. This is not a knitting class. I love the wonderful reality meets the sending the light happy thought psychosis we are currently trapped within. Remember when our great leader grandma whoever thinks she is going to reason with the soldiers; you know without all that stupid violence HOW DID THAT GO? Sorry the universe is a violent and dangerous place which when China finishes building up their arsenal like Japan and Germany did in the 1920s and 1930s these fat indolent decadents will learn a lesson about the obsolescence of war and the arrival of sunlight and flowers THE HARD WAY. What is beautiful about the film? Why should you watch it? One scene contains the whole answer in microcosm. They are having a party; Todd stares down through the window at them with indescribable sorrow. He can never be part of their world; he knows what is coming his expulsion. They will not see that side of life it would wreck their party. After a few cowardly words disguised as affection while they hold guns on him; Grandma throws him out with enough supplies so she can sleep well at night. Russell's performance I consider to be the best of his entire career. He can only use his eyes and non verbal communication. When she hugs him watch him shake fighting to control himself; as she pulls back in horror she sees how dangerous that was. He has been alone forever; he barely controls what Caine would have done to her if she made that mistake with him. FEAR AND DISCIPLINE yes Bushido that is all they are everything else has been driven deep deep down. It is also a wonderful picture of why warriors have such a hard time coming back to society you just can't turn it off as Stallone says in FIRST BLOOD. He has affection for them even risks his life to fight what would have been a no win war if the new models were not so retarded. Jason Isaacs is really such a treat to watch even films I did not care for like Event Horizon and The Patriot, he shines here again really giving the film its depth with Russell, Busey is annoying as always not as bad as Point Break.

Now, before we go on blaming any directors for the final cut, bear in mind that studios have the final word in all aspects to their investment. However, I don't believe Russell was desperate enough to sign on an other by the numbers production. Be that as it may, Soldier has nothing going for it. A sidequel to Blade Runner ? I do not see ANY consistencies between the two besides the scribe; David Webb Peoples. He also scribed Unforgiven. Ironically,that's the impression I have for Anderson on this film. We get a automaton, unemotional Soldier who is obsolete and is out-casted then finds himself in situations unimaginable. Well, you could do a lot with that and make it work. But Anderson feels that it makes for a kick-ass reason to jack up a body-count. The survivors seem to exist as a catalyst for unfortunate events and thereby give a man who knows nothing about being a person. But everything about being the alpha soldier. Anyway, I do see a lot of effort from an action perspective, but not as much as on a narrative one. I don't understand why Anderson feels action will make the movie over plot ? Is it a stretch ? For Anderson ? Yes! While I do like the final fight, that is not enough to substantiate a good movie. As I said, the survivors act as a catalyst to ramp up the I must avenge... cliché/turning point body-count. What works on paper and in Anderson's head, may not work on a film. Apparently, Anderson is trying to pigeonhole himself with mindless actioneers with that other no talent, hack; Michael Bay. What's worse, is that Anderson usually writes his own material and that they keep selling. Thus, his motivation for stronger stories is lacking. Russell knew quick $ when he sees it. All he did was deliver a mute and stoic soldier. But there was no humanity to him. So introverted and invulnerable except for his arc where he weeps alligator tears for banishment. I have a feeling, that Russell had a guilty feeling regarding his participation and had foresight to see that this wasn't going to work.

It's not. This vehicle certainly has the action in abundance, especially the closing scenes, but it explores the value of human interaction on a very empathic level too. Kurt Russell is the title character, and performs this role as well as any I can recall. This soldier is much more complex than his famous Snake Pliskin character (Escape from NY), and we learn much more about him.One of the many things this film accomplishes so well is achieving much expository information from minimal amounts of expository scenes and descriptions. We know that the soldier is a product of a military-industrial dystopia of the near future, even though we never see this society. All we do see is the refuse on a garbage scow planet, but the sorts of rubbish disposed of there reveal significant information about this society. The soldier is genetically designed and efficiently trained for top-notch military engagements. He is rendered obsolete by even more advanced soldiers, and tossed unceremoniously like trash on to this planet. The ruthless yet inwardly cowardly officers may be somewhat of a stereotype, but they illustrate this future dystopia also. The transition of the automaton killer soldier into a human being with feeling and a desire for belonging are justly and beautifully shown with deep feeling. The denouement of the story is equally powerful in its effective counter-balance of violence and compassion.The writing, direction, and acting are all exquisite. Highly recommended.

Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.

On the surface, many expected simply a modern explosion filled action movie. Instead, they were delivered much more, while those who might have enjoyed it, probably didn't see the film because they thought it was simply mindless action.Soldier harks back to the 80s style of action adventure movie in many ways. At its core, we have a story about a traumatised character, raised from birth to be nothing but an emotionless military weapon. Both Kurt and the role, have been criticised for the lack of script, but that is the ESSENCE of the character. He is a killing machine, learning to be human. If anything, Kurt should be applauded for his subtle approach to the role. It's the small things that give the character such pathos and depth. From identifying with the mute boy, to his confusion at shedding a tear after being ostracised. Even the minimalist expressions and gestures between he and his men at the end, as he picks up the boy, speak volumes. There is more character in a few of his looks and actions, than any number of overly verbose, two dimensional movie heroes.In some ways, perhaps the problem for many people, is that it truly is a film of two halves. First, we have a character piece, exploring the emotions and situations of this soldier. What makes him the way he is. How his life has been conditioned and controlled. Secondly, we have an all-out battle, where he fights to save the new life he has found, finally finding a purpose, something that gives him meaning. Perhaps the result was that people only wanting only one or the other, didn't feel satisfied.A lot Soldier's depth is beneath the surface, hinted at visually and emotionally, rather than handed out on a platter, and it's easy to see how it can be missed. On another note, when we do hit the action scenes, they are brutal, quick, and full of impact. The climactic battle is one of the most satisfying hand-to-hand fights to be seen in years. This isn't a film where people jump around on wires in slow motion. They get hurt, they bleed, they die. As a result, it probably didn't appeal to the newer breed of action fan, either.I'm not a particular fan of Paul Anderson, but this is his best work, and tragically underrated. Soldier is an atmospheric, stylish, and surprisingly layered character piece, that still manages to be an excellent old-style adrenaline ride. If you like your science fiction and your action movies with a bit more depth and punch, you could do worse than see Soldier.

The storyline is simple & in no way complex nor is the acting stellar. The star power consists of Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee(Bruce Lee Story), Jason Isaacs(The Patriot), Connie Neilsen, Michael Chiklis(The Commish, etc.), and the ever strange Gary Busey. The basic sci-fi film buffs will appreciate the film's subtle nuances while the more serious sci-fi connoisseurs will scoff at the same.Soldier chronicles the life of Sgt. Todd(Russell) who from birth to adulthood endures intense military training, psychological brainwashing, & countless war campaigns to become an elite soldier. Todd is the best soldier in his squadron under the command of stern Cpt. Church(Busey). Unbeknownst to Church, a new breed of soldier has been created to challenge the old order, spearheaded by egotistical Colonel Mekum(Isaacs). Mekum's best soldier, Caine 607(Lee), competes against Todd & several others only to defeat them easily. Left for dead, Todd is dumped on a waste planet to rot. Barely alive, Todd manages to make his way to a secret colony of planet survivors. Taken in & cared for by colony elder Mace(Sean Pertwee), Sandra(Neilsen), & mute son Nathan, Todd recuperates under a watchful eye. Wary & suspicious, members of the colony inquire how Todd found his way to their hideout. During his stay, Todd is confused & bewildered by the simplest of human behavior. Todd knows combat & killing, not civilized behaviors. After several incidents including Mace's son, Todd is expelled from the colony to fend for himself. Meanwhile, the military has located the presence of life forms on the waste planet. Colonel Mekum makes plans to wage a private war against the colonists to test the superiority of his elite fighting force led by Caine 607. After attacks have been executed the survivors, Mace searches & finds the lonely Sgt. Todd. On the way back to the stronghold, Mace is killed by enemy fire. Todd, sensing his humanity for the first time, runs back to aid the helpless colonists. Todd equips himself with weaponry & conducts a seek & destroy mission against the military forces. Cunning & resourceful, Todd takes out the enemy with precise maneuvers & strategic planning. Finally, the two best soldiers meet for a battle to the death Sgt. Todd & Caine 607. Both men beat on each other heavily with Todd rising as the victor. Todd takes the remaining colonists to the military ship to leave the planet for good. After disposing of Colonel Mekum & his officers, Todd assumes command of the crew & takes off to a distant planet to start over. Todd looks out at space holding young Nathan, feeling more like the human he has become rather than the soldier he had always been.Soldier will provide minimal entertainment for a minimal price; your time. Russell's portrayal is fairly dull & wooden which is what he played very well. Lee provided little in the way of acting support to Russell as the evil but elite soldier Caine 607. Busey gives you his usual trademark toothiness & unorthodox acting style but I suppose added some measure of quirkiness to the mix. Jason Isaacs is at his maniacal best as he usually does playing the villain Merkum. Overall, this film gets it's message across, even though it has to pull the viewer along kicking & screaming to get it. If you have an empty social calender & have a few hours to spare, give Soldier a look-see. Hell, I did.

I loved the MK movie, and think that it's the best film ever. I'm not objective when it comes to it because I love the games, but if you wish to know why, my review of is on the IMDb under my Johnnycage10. I digress. I initially thought Soldier was passable, and gave it 6/10 for its action, acting (films with Gary Busey as supporting role can't be bad &#150; see Lethal Weapon and Predator 2) and the interaction between Russel's character and the civilians. ******SPOILERS****** It was impossible to dislike the friendly (but 2-dimentional) characters, especially the husband/wife/child family, though everyone saw that the nice husband was going to die, which would allow Russel to be a surrogate father for his widow and child. My problems then was that I found huge plot holes. First, it was ludicrous that the military would throw away experienced soldiers simply because it obtained new soldiers who can run faster, lift more, etc. The new soldiers were physically superior in controlled experiments (running on an indoor track), but are they really better in the real world (running down a crumbling street and firing back against snipers who are trying to pick them off)? I would say No, since experience counts in the latter situation. Secondly, the villainous colonel was crazy to be ignoring the advice that Busey's more experienced captain was giving. Third, the colonel's order to wipe out anyone who was found by accident on the planet was worst of all. After this expensive film bombed, Anderson disappeared for a while, and then resurfaced as the brains behind the Resident Evil movie. I found RE to be enjoyable enough (though some RE fans hated it due to him not including the game characters, understandably). But I liked the directing, the action scenes, the special effects, the music, and the likable dialogue, even if they WERE uttered by Milla J (Stay where you are, we're coming back for you since we won't leave anyone behind indeed). Like the ill-fated husband/father in Soldier, how could anyone dislike that? But after RE, Anderson directed Alien Vs Predator and wrote the screenplay to RE Apocalypse, and massacred both titles (A predator befriending a human? Jill running around in a tubetop in a city overrun by the dead? Nemesis streetbrawling against Milla J and LOSING?! Nemesis siding with the protagonists?!). That was unforgivable. I hated Anderson ever since and vowed to never see his work again. Then, I saw Soldier again recently, this time with my wife, who unlike me, has experience in the army. I mentioned to her why I didn't like it, and for a shocking twist, she informed me that she liked the film for those very reasons, because she stated that those plotholes, as I saw them, were exactly how the military performed in real life. First, she stated that in her time with the army, experience wasn't valued; the only variable that was paid attention to was how much one could lift and how fast one could run. Second, she added that the colonel's behavior was EXACTLY how inexperienced superiors act when advised that their actions are idiotic by experienced subordinates. Lastly, as to the plothole regarding soldiers being ordered to kill civilians that they encounter, do we need to know more after seeing what happening in Iraq? Unless we still believe Bush and Blair when they go on about the honorable military and the few bad apples who were seen abusing Iraqis in pictures (one huge coincidence that every bad apple who's abusing civilians was stupid enough to have pictures taken of himself while doing it). Newsflash &#150; when Hussein's goons are seen violating people's rights, he's called a dictator, and rightly so. But when American and British grunts are seen violating people's rights, they're called bad apples, but they're not, as that's the norm. Truth is that power corrupts, and when you give weapons to undisciplined losers and set them loose on a civilian population, without proper supervision, then many of them will abuse their power, whether they be Iraqi, American or British losers. That's the point that Soldier was making &#150; power corrupts, especially when combined with ignorance and where one doesn't have to answer for one's actions. That's why it brought up the level to 8/10 after I saw it the second time. As for Anderson, I still hate how he butchered AvP and REA, but I need to be objective about him. He did a great job with MK, imo, and a decent job with Event Horizon (though I still don't understand that film) and a decent job with Soldier, which was a smart film. But as is the case with most smart films, Soldier bombed at the box office (just look at the great Three Kings for similarity). So after having experienced this, can we really blame Anderson for taking the low road and writing/directing films that show off some actress or another with her top off? I no longer can, not after realizing how intelligent Soldier was and how much of a price Anderson paid for being its director. It's too bad Anderson had to appeal to the lowest common denominator to keep making big money in Hollywood, as he really DID show promise with some of his camera tricks in his earlier films, but that's the audience's fault more than it is his own.

It has some really good moments, such as when Sgt Todd tries to teach Nathan a young boy to defend himself against a snake, one of the kind that has bitten him when still younger, which left him dumb. And what strikes me is the way in which Sgt Todd can say a lot without saying a single word, just facial expression and clever camera cuts. Good acting in my opinion. Especially the interaction between Mace and Todd is done very well, leading to Todd's heroic attempt to save the colony and especially Mace's wife Sandra and Nathan, his son. Mace stands out in the peaceful society as being of a broader mind, an attitude which better fits their peaceful intentions, than those of some who would like to have gotten rid of Todd right away. The struggle between those two attitudes also runs trough the film, giving it an extra dimension. "}{"Title":"Uneven but well made and pretty entertaining WARNING!!!!!!

That's a pity, because the film gets off to a compelling start.  The early montage of training is a hypnotic segment and the first action sequence, set twenty feet above ground, is appropriately dizzying.  But once Kurt Russell (and his stoic performance) is left for dead on the literal trash planet, the movie falls apart, giving us another man who learns to feel again when he interacts with an outcast group and must protect them when soldiers arrive.  Such a storyline can be compelling if the lead performance is riveting (see Equilibrium or Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome for something similar, but far, far superior), but Russell is so monotonous it's hard to care for his or anyone else's fate.  Even when the action finally jumpstarts, it's not particularly thrilling and certainly nothing inventive.  For similar themed and far superior films, see The Road Warrior or Equilibrium instead.

I think it was brilliantly done.Sure, it's got similarities to other sci-action flicks.  Sure, some of the scenes could be called straight rip-offs from various other films.  But, remember, Alien is a rip-off of Beowulf, the Terminator is a rip-off of the story of Hercules and the Hydra, and Titanic is a rip-off of Romeo and Juliet - from the wrong perspective, that is.  Always new, always the same. In other words, this movie, Soldier, isn't a rip-off any more than those were.  Inspired and influenced by, sure, why not.Kirk Douglas (I hope I spelled his name correctly!) does a great job. Most people have trouble conveying emotions and thoughts through words and expressive faces, and he manages to convey whole paragraphs and deep emotions through a silent near-deadpan.  That takes some serious skill. Try standing in front of a mirror, holding the kind of poker-face he has through most of the movie, and conveying even the slightest bit of the fear and discipline that is evident throughout the movie.The scene where he is exercising on that metal container, is one of the most accurate and perfect depictions of the way a trained berserker works. Rambo's flashbacks were pathetic, Todd's (the Soldier) are tremendously well done.Okay, so the science in it is horribly inaccurate, though not nearly so bad as in Star Wars, and the idea that the garbage ships would have pressurized air of a breathable sort in their cargo section is laughable. But those data are incidental to the story, which is the story of hard-working men and women, raised to a certain lifestyle, being replaced by improved technology.  Set to a military theme sure, but recognizable to anyone who has ever been told your skills are out of date, and we're downsizing or who has ever been passed over for a promotion in favor of some youngster straight out of college.  And that story is well told.And, if that isn't enough for you, the lead actress is just plain stunningly beautiful.  Worth watching just to see her (and, yes, she is fully dressed or at least decently and modestly covered throughout the film - I'm talking beauty here, not just raw sex appeal).I wouldn't put this film in the same level as The Thirteenth Warrior, but as action flicks go, it's definitely one of my top 20.

I think this shoe fits Soldier as well. All this movie boils down to is an excessive amount of gratuitous violence without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. The inane plot is about how state-of-the-art organic human soldier/zombies are going to be made obsolete by genetically engineered soldier/zombies. This is bad news for soldier/zombie Kurt Russell, who is no longer state-of-the-art and unceremoniously thrown away with lots of other trash on a landfill planet inhabited by a bunch of losers. Kurt has less than 100 words to say in the whole movie, mostly Yes sir and No sir to whoever he's talking to, be they man, woman, child, cat, dog or fire hydrant. To make up for his lack of dialogue, he saves the losers from a bunch of the genetically engineered soldier/zombies, who have been sent to the landfill planet on a training mission which includes killing everyone they run into, since they're told the losers are hostiles. Kind of like Vietnam, huh? Anyway, this movie's grotesque violence makes me wonder if violence in movies and TV really is responsible, to some degree, for some of the senseless violence in real life all around us. Now I'm not a prude about this and I like lots of violent films, such as Pulp Fiction, Scarface, and Resevoir Dogs to name but a few. But the violence in those films isn't gratuitous and these movies have a point other than violence and violent situations. I guess I missed whatever point Soldier is trying to make, although it's hard to even imagine a point to this brutal, senseless movie.

I'm not that good of a writer, really. But I had to comment on this film because it was the most special out of all the films. But not in a good way...My summary up there perfectly sums up this film; A film that was doing well, hitting all the right spots, and when it almost ended (the third act) it got wrecked, it blew up - excuse the pun.This has to be one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. I don't hate it, though, but I hate how took the very wrong turn towards the end. I'll soon get to that.The film had a terrific start - loved how they showed the soldier growing up and going to wars in only like, 10 minutes. Mistaken for dead, he gets thrown in a ship that has dead soldiers and trash. That ship throws all the dirty bits into a desolated planet. Then he wakes up, he gets out and meet the natives. So far so good, actually, so great. He gets to know them and all that. The film had amazing visual effects of the planet; I loved the two (or was it, three) suns in the sky and the orang atmosphere.Until the end, the third act, the soldiers and their leader come to the planet - that's probably where Avatar got its ideas from. Still, I was enjoying those bits, even though it was the third act that annoyed me. They kill some of the natives, then the soldier gets ready fight them.That's when I was put off by the ending. Fair enough, you will fight them right, it's self-defence? But the way he fought them, which was of course pretty much the film's creators faults, was way over the top. I mean, it was full on, over the top action with Michael Bay-esque explosions and non-stop shootouts where the genuine sci-fi touch this film had was completely gone. Seriously, and this madness went on for 20 minutes - which will please action fans, but not sci-fans like myself. I actually loved how he was killing them by appearing out of nowhere, that created good suspense. But use of guns and explosions was too damn much. I got very turned off.Granted, he was a soldier so had to make his guns happy. But still, didn't he lose his magic while he was in the planet? I mean, he got tame and all. But still, the ending was too Commando meets Predator with him wearing warrior paint on his face, looking macho and all. That's what disappointed the hell out of me. I was like, I'm watching a sci-fi/adventure, not some gritty action film. If their weapons were lasers then I actually wouldn't have mind the shootouts - at least that would've given this film a sci-fi feel.When the film almost ended, I got even more disappointed. This time, it wasn't the action. The ending was just lame and cartoonish. Why did they blow up the whole region? I hated how they lame-ised the leader where he literally pisses his pants. There should've also been a fight (not gun/explosion type) with the leader. I hated how they wimp-ified him. I also preferred the film to end in the planet, not them, with the natives, flying in the ship with an explosion behind them.In brief, this film had an amazing start. I loved how the soldier was hanging around with the natives, how more human he became. Then it all ruined after they made him like the terminator where the ending seemed something from typical action films that made this movie lose its sci-fi touch. Also, how a tough Colonel was made into a scaredy cat. The explosive action was made to show off its effects and attract actions fans.That's what I call bad writing. Did the writer have a writer's block towards the end of the script? And did the director really feel the need to add heavy action towards the end?

The most intense emotions in the film are conveyed almost magically by Kurt Russell in a way that does not use facial expressions or anything but the most subtle means, yet leaves the viewer completely understanding and SEEING the emotion. In one scene, Sgt Todd is recovering from severe injuries in his rescuer's home after being left for dead. He struggles out of bed upon hearing voices and is leaning against a doorframe, confused and bemused by the scene before him of a family playing on the floor. When the father notices Todd, he reaches for a crutch he has made for the soldier while he heals. Unknowingly, the father holds the crutch in what appears to be a threatening manner and without moving a muscle, the ill, injured, bemused Sgt Todd is suddenly and instantly a poised and ready death dealing machine. The father has no idea how close he is to death at that moment, or perhaps he does, as he stutters out an explanation of the crutch.Russell portrays all this without moving and without changing expression. The change is in his eyes, it's subtle, yet one instantly feels it. Remarkable acting and Russell manages this over and over in the course of the movie. As he comes to terms with himself and what he's missed all his life (basic human emotional experience), Todd allows a bit more of his expression to show, a trickle of emotional expression here and there, which makes it all the more poignant.As one previous commenter wrote Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.Imagine trying to act under these two restraints you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, Russell pulls off an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. Great job! This sums up very nicely the skill needed to believably pull this character off without making the character look stilted and stunted. One of the few other shows that comes close to this type of non-verbal acting is The Last of the Mohicans with Daniel Day-Lewis, though this technique is used only in places. Soldier takes this concept to the next level, and Kurt Russell makes it believable.

I think the film is far from perfect, but not THAT far.The story centers around a soldier named Todd (Kurt Russell). He was selected at birth in 1996 and for the first sixteen years of his life, he was mercilessly trained in combat tactics. He is now 40 and has fought and won many battles on Earth and other planets.But now, new soldiers are in. Jason Scott Lee as Caine is one of a new breed of soldiers; genetically manipulated to be the ultimate killing machine. When these two go head-to-head, Todd loses and is dumped on a waste planet, presumed dead. However, he survives and finds relief in a makeshift camp built by a small colony of refugees.The colonists tend to his needs, but he has difficulty adjusting to the lifestyle. He doesn't understand companionship, love, or family, which keeps the colony together.With the new soldiers incorporated into the forces, they begin security inspections on waste planets, including Todd. He knows that they will kill him, so it becomes his job to protect his newfound friends.*** Possible spoilers below. Nothing serious, but if you don't want details then skip this ***One of the biggest quibbles is that 'Kurt Russell is not acting. He's just standing there. He doesn't even say anything!' In my opinion, that's intentional. His character 'does not speak unless spoken to by a superior officer'. He has thoughts and ideas in his mind, but he can't verbalize them as easily as we can, simply because he has been disciplined to not express them. He just stands there because he uncomfortable in his surroundings, but he doesn't know what to do about it.I saw this film as an intense psychological study of a man being thrown from one environment into another at the most extreme level. He can't interact with them because his harsh training removes emotion, whereas the community around him is built on community. The only person he seems to befriend is Nathan, a mute boy who shares his burden of the inability to verbally communicate.Mace tries to give Todd a stick to help him walk while he heals, but Todd sees Mace as an enemy wielding a weapon. Jimmy tries to surprise Todd with a Merry Christmas in his Santa outfit, but he only jolts Todd into shock. He suddenly finds himself surrounded by nightmarish images of his past until he is overwhelmed and flees. He finds comfort posting outside watching for intruders. Instead of helping with chores to support the colony, Todd boxes on a metal punching bag until his knuckles bleed and even to the point that he can barely hold up his arms. I found these contrasts interesting in terms of depth of character. In this light, I find Russell's acting very commendable in portraying a character that tries to hide any emotion and almost succeeds.But as I said before, this film is not perfect. The action is just for action's sake most of the time, and is sometimes quite hokey, such as the guns' triggers attached to strings. It's also surprising that Jimmy - a large man - is able to swept up into the air by high winds, yet Todd manages to stand firm, and be seemingly unaffected.*** End spoilers ***The film does suffer from clichés but the concept is interesting and there is a true attempt to explore Todd's character, and it is mostly successful.7/10  "},{"Title":"Some good action, but runs out of ideas early & has a poor central character.","Date":"18 December 2001","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The future sees soldiers raised from children to be conditioned fighters.  However, the introduction of a new unit that are genetically engineered to be better soldiers leaves the first unit obsolete.  One soldier, Todd,  finds his body dumped on a distant garbage planet and nursed back to health by residents of the planet.  However when the new unit is dispatched to patrol the garbage planet with instructions that any life found should be considered hostile, Todd must take on another battle.This much maligned film, sat around in the UK for ages waiting for a release date.  It was eventually sneaked out on video.  This isn't terrible, or the worst thing ever made - but it's not brilliant either.  The writer described this as a side-quel to Blade Runner, because it happens in an earlier version of the future where man hasn't reached replicants yet but are breeding people for set purposes.  The first 15 minutes are good because this idea is shown from Todd's birth through his training.  However after this is done really all that's left is an average action movie.  The clever idea of bred soldiers isn't expanded - with Blade Runner the idea of replications was built on and had plenty to keep you thinking.  This has nothing left after the first 15 minutes.The action is quite good, some scenes are quite exciting as Todd takes on the genetic unit by stealth methods, although this only accounts for the final 30 minutes.  The worst bit is the section up to this on the garbage planet where Todd is taken in, rejected and accepted by the community while learning to live in a different world with different values.  This section drags really slowly - partly because nothing happens of any great interest but also because we're focusing on Todd all the time.  This focus is dull because Todd is such a dull character - I'm not too bothered by the lack of dialogue (although more would have helped) but lets not forget that he's only a human, not a robot.  However he behaves like a robot all the time.  For example, one of the old unit, Riley, asks if his unit will be given weapons only to be told that only soldiers get weapons - not only does he speak without being spoken to, but you can see in his face and hear in his voice the hurt and disappointment that he and his men have been dumped.  However with Todd there's no emotion at all - why are the other soldiers made out as more human but Todd is cold, silent and emotionless?  More dialogue might not have helped but it would have given Russell more to do and perhaps have created a better character.Russell does a reasonable job here.  He doesn't have much to work with but does OK with the silence.  However I though he was given the role instead of an Arnie type so that he would bring emotion to the role.  I don't understand why he played a betrayed, emotionally abandoned man as a cold robot - just having a single tear run at one point isn't enough.  He should have learnt from James Black (Riley) who only has a few lines and a few minutes on screen but is more believable as the soldier hurt by becoming obsolete - he brings out more character in two lines that Russell did in the whole film.  Sean Pertwee is ok as Mace but you do feel he got the role because of director Anderson.  Isaacs is a poor Colonel - he just seems to weak and ineffectual to have reached the position of power that he's at.  Gary Busey doesn't have much to do but at least it better that the rent-a-psycho roles he's been doing recently.  Similarly Lee has a minor role but is pretty good - he looks really bulked out since the last time I saw him.Overall the film has good ideas and good action scenes, but the middle section is dull and meaningless.  Russell plays the lead too cold and rips the emotional core out of the story.  It's an OK film but a dull story that quickly runs out of ideas and a poor lead character takes a lot away from the role.

Anderson this huge box-office failure has a pretty bad reputation in some quarters but it's nice to come on the IMDb & see a more than respectable 5.6 average User Rating out of ten over almost seventeen thousand votes & I have to say that I am a big fan of Soldier. I enjoyed it back in 1999 when it was released straight to video/DVD here in the UK & enjoyed it just as much when I watched it again last night for the first time in several years. The script was written by David Webb Peoples who wrote the classic sci-fi film Blade Runner (1982), the underwater monster flick Leviathan (1989), Clint Eastwood's multi Oscar winning western (Soldier could be seen as a sort of sci-fi/western actually) Unforgiven (1992) & the sci-fi film Twelve Monkeys (1995) so he's capable of writing deep drama as well as striking sci-fi which is at odds with Soldier as it's more of a straight forward action film set in the future. I think Soldier is vastly underrated, it moves along at a great pace, there is loads of explosions, fights & cool military weapons & vehicle's, a really good performance by star Kurt Russell & has just about enough humanity for you care about what's happening & those it's happening to. Despite barely saying a word it's amazing how much personality & emotion comes through from Todd, the other character's are a little one dimensional especially the main villain Colonel Mekum & the colonists who are all peace loving vegetable growing types. At a little over 90 minutes Soldier doesn't outstay it's welcome & I wasn't bored or felt the film dragged once, the central message of needing to be taught humanity & the importance of having it is reasonably well put across but a bit awkward at times (Kurt Russell pumped up soldier trying his hand at some organic gardening while Celtic chants plays on the soundtrack) but as I said Soldier works better as straight forward sci-fi action film & if that's what your looking for I doubt you will be disappointed with this.I must admit that I loved the visual style of Soldier, the special effects are great & seem to be a clever mixture of model shots, CGI computer effects &, gasp, real life elements. For instance the shot as Todd first looks out on & surveys the dusty landscape of Arcadia 234 & there's the yellow sky, the sand blowing everywhere & a huge military war ship sticking out of the sand on it's side is very striking & very convincing. The sets, weapons, vehicles, spaceships & costumes are great & Soldier looks top notch. There's a nice amount of violence here, there are some great fights including one up a set of chains, plenty of huge explosions, shoot-outs & a couple of gory moments as throats are slit & huge knives are shoved into peoples eyes. A sort of futuristic Rambo meets Universal Soldier (1992) the themes of some super soldier learning the meaning of humanity & finally taking on those he once served has been done before but Soldier is one of the best & most enjoyable examples & is miles better than the terrible Solo (1996) which has almost exactly the same story but without the futuristic setting.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 this looks & sounds great, I love the mixing of traditional model & modern CGI effects work & think that the visual look & style of the film draws you in. The production values are top notch. The acting is alright although I thought Kurt Russell was great, he speaks only 104 words but you do end up feeling for him as he puts in a subtle yet extremely effective performance. Jason Scott Lee makes for an imposing nemesis while Jason Isaacs is suitably slimy as the ruthless Colonel.Soldier is a firm favourite of mine, sure it flopped big time but I don't care as I think it's a great sci-fi action western hybrid that delivers even if some of the subtext & themes are a little awkwardly handled. If your looking for a sci-fi action film with great special effects, lots of explosions & a little bit of heart then I throughly recommend Soldier as an underrated gem.

I don't usually watch action films and I flat out hate the majority of Paul Andersons work but I do love science fiction and I always find Kurt Russel worth a watch. Its pretty gnarly stuff, provided that you're undemanding, with a nice if unoriginal plot, good action and real good set design and special effects. The plot follows Russel as a super soldier, trained from birth for maximum fighting prowess, who is dumped on a garbage planet after a new model of soldier is designed and he is rendered obsolete. He joins a settlement of crashed refugees and ultimately helps them when the new soldiers and their evil commander arrive. The budget is clearly pretty high, as all the effects are pretty much top flight and the garbage planet itself, literally a planet where spaceships dump rubbish is an atmospheric, visually captivating place. As far as acting goes, Kurt Russel does well, though he has little dialogue, he makes it count. Sean Pertwee does his customary bang up job as a friendly planet dweller, though he isn't the most showy or exciting actor he is never less than watchable. Connie Neilsen has little to do but look fine and she fills her role nicely, while Jason Issacs is suitably hissable as the villain of the piece. The ever cool Gary Busey is a sympathetic colonel, while Jason Scott Lee makes for a good adversary as a super soldier. The film does turn very silly when it goes into action mode, but its directed with aplomb and there is a decent level of general excitement as well as a bit of neat bloodshed. The very end does get pretty much stupid, but it doesn't hurt too much. All in all, this is no classic, but it is pretty great mindless entertainment and it does show that Paul Anderson is a decent director when he has a good script or actors, and importantly, the freedom to make a film with a bit of ballsiness (unlike the horrendous, castrated abomination that was Alien Vs Predator). Worthwhile if you're in the mood.

His name, Todd, and you see how his life has been during a brief portion of the first part of the movie. It moves a bit to quickly after this to the old soldiers being replaced by artificially created soldiers who after a rather nice demonstration scene show they are superior as far as running and stuff goes so the military quickly ditches an apparently dead Todd and makes the rest of his outfit nothing more than regular Joe's. Well Todd is taken in a garbage spaceship to this planet of junk. Why they felt the need to have this movie take place on another planet is beyond me. Seems rather unnecessary as it could have easily taken place on an island that could have been turned into a landfill, but whatever, it does not really add or take anything away from the film. Suffice to say there are people on this planet and they take Todd in though they are wary of him. Finally, they decide to send him on his way as he is to dangerous for their tastes. Sadly Todd feels rejected a bit, but then comes his chance to show what he is made of as a military outfit consisting of the soldiers that replaced Todd are on the planet killing the people for a reason I can not remember at this time. Well finally we have some really good action scenes and a rather strange yet happy ending. The movie could have used a bit more of this and that...some more action, a few more alien lifeforms, and a better defined plot, but it is not all that bad and proves to be a nice distraction.

That is, until one day where he becomes obsolete and is replaced by a new breed. Then he is dumped on to a garbage planet, left to die. Fortunately for Todd, the planet has civilization there. Unfortunately for his old bosses, they want to take over this planet and are about to find out what antiques can do! I have to say it up front Soldier is not a good film. It's not one of Russell's better films or one of Paul Anderson's better films. Some of it is very good (the first ten minutes where Todd is being trained as a child is awesome) but most of it is just campy. All the references to Russell's past films is a nice touch, but tells you how non-serious this is supposed to be. And as a film that takes place in the Blade Runner universe, it's a pretty inferior partner to that legendary film (Paul Anderson is not Ridley Scott).The pacing is also very strange in this one. We have Todd becoming part of a community, and I think this is shown fairly well (even if the performance is wooden). The battle scenes are also pretty decent, which is good since that's a large part of the movie. But the transition is choppy. Todd is thrown out of the community for risking a child's life, and we should expect a good twenty minutes of him wandering on his own and the community contemplating his absence. Instead, in under five minutes, they realize their mistake, find him and bring him back. Which, to me, makes the entire part completely pointless. It would have been better to show a montage of Todd instructing the child how to fight snakes (not unlike the montage in Over the Top with father and son exercising).If you love Kurt Russell, you'll like this film (it's not as cheesy as Escape From LA, at least, and I still like that one). If you like Anderson, you may also like this (though, this is likely his weakest film of all). It was pushed on me by a questionable group of young men, so I can't really speak all that highly of it (even if the young men are fine gentlemen). Consider my summary thus Soldier is watchable, but disposable.

I am happy to say, I was stunned. When I was a little boy, it was always a big plus if a movie did not contain any mushy stuff. And though my criteria have changed over the past 50 years, the child in me was delighted with the lean mean lack of romance in this film. Kurt Russell, in his greatest and most quintessential Kurt Russell performance ever, plays a stony faced killing machine who is indoctrinated from birth to be a soldier, and nothing but a soldier. He's like Snake Plisskin with all the wiseguy crap kicked out of him. Not surprisingly, he doesn't have much left to say. The tender emotions have been so totally cauterized from his soul that he repeatedly calls Connie Nielsen sir (!!!). One realizes right away that there is absolutely no danger that he will eventually fall into the sack with her, and we will not be distracted by the sight of her bared bosoms. Let the mayhem roll!The film is absolutely gorgeous. The evocation of an alien junkyard world, full of rusting detritus from many times and worlds (including an aircraft carrier tipped on its side), once again excited my inner child Man, would I ever love to go mucking around through all that junk!

His character is a symbol of how society treats those it deems no longer useful, how cruel society can be, how people are treated like mere commodities, to be thrown away when deemed obsolete. This movie provides a chilling portrayal of how people can be reduced to the level of robots, how they can be conditioned to commit the vilest acts under the pretense of obeying orders and what happens when people are taught to obey every oder, no matter how outrageous, without question. Mr. Russell's character says little but when he does speak, his words carry great meaning. This is one movie where the script does not get in the way of the story, which is unique.

However, despite all the negative comments about this film, I found it very enjoyable. For an action film it actually has a plot. Granted, it's not the most detailed of plots, it's pretty simple but that's what makes it good - you can just take it on face value, accept 2 + 2 = 4 and there we go.Kurt Russell did a really good job in his part, not showing emotion for the majority of the film but when he does it is moving because we have seen how he has been trained and what he has been through. Jason Isaacs is good as Mekum, the bad guy of the film. I bought this film after discovering he was in it and reading a bit about it. It was also going cheap. One thing I would say, Isaacs doesn't have his Harry Potter / The Patriot voice here, the voice people may see as familiar to him, but he is menacing when he has to be and is a very good actor. Steadily becoming on of my favourites.I have noticed there has been some dubiety as to the alignment of Gary Busey and his two side-kicks. The simple answer is they are neutral. Church (Busey) wants to stick with the veterans like Todd (Russell) rather than Mekum's (Isaacs) genetically modified soldiers. However, if the new soldiers prove to be more efficient in combat then Busey will be happy to use them. He neither causes any problems for the good guys or causes any problems for the bad guys in an unequal measurement. He's a bastard to both and a nice guy to both.To conclude, Soldier is a very good film with a good balance of story and action. Sci-fi / action fans will enjoy this film if I'm going to generalise.

Most of the tale is set about 40 years later, when this set of focused fighting machines are replaced by newer models, soldiers bred in the womb. It seems you've seen all this stuff before, but this big-budget yarn somehow keeps a lot of it interesting. The strongest theme is an amplification of the army's usual intent to destroy an individual's personality during training and build a new one back up. Russell, the Sgt./field leader of the first group, spent a year getting into proper shape for this role, earned a record $15 mil, and manages to have less dialog than Arnold Schwarzenegger did in the 1st Terminator flic. Jason Scott Lee (from Dragonthe Bruce Lee Story and a member of the new models) says almost nothing at all. A memorable set piece pits the 2 of them against each other during a 'show me yours,I'll show you mine' demonstration of abilities. The inhumanity inherent in the military's aim, the story says, will eventually be our undoing. Until we all love & care for another like the marooned colonists on the 'garbage world,' mankind is setting itself up for endless/pointless conflict. However, until that perfect universe, such colonists will need a perfect soldier to defend them; face it, without Russell, they would all be dead, along with their nice attitudes. The drawbacks to the sci-fi tale are logistics as mentioned, Russell & his mates begin training just before the 21st century begins(now); within their lifespan, Earth has apparently colonized planets light years away. I suppose contact with aliens around year 2015 might make this possible, but it strains credibility. The main villain, a slimy colonel, is way over the top - not to mention he's a total idiot, but it's amusing to wait for and see his expected downfall. There's also simply not enough time to see Russell gain some humanity - we're treated to a quick montage to facilitate our expectations (it feels like 10 minutes were edited out to start the action). This pic, a box-office bust, probably due to poor marketing, should appeal to a male audience fond of a no-nonsense approach of getting things done, whether its saving colonists or mass destruction. The action sets are, if not gripping, decent for a big-budgeter. If you liked the first Universal Soldier pic (1992), this one's also for you.

But, I guess to have the big action ending you have to have that, but it ends the good part of the movie.On the other hand, what was I looking for? A descent into depression at Todd's inability to cope with real life, and long, grueling psychotherapy for him to recover? I'm being sarcastic with myself - but what wouldn't be boring, stupid, or moralistic? How about Todd learning that in morality, as in battle, not everything is as it seems? How about him developing a sense of self-determination and mode of operation with unusual logic because it's developed consciously as an adult instead of during childhood as with most of us? How about him learning tactics from his interaction with normal people which help him defeat the better soldiers in other ways when he can't use the battlefield ways he was taught because they are superior at them? Maybe even Todd learning how to reach a more satisfying, subtle and thoughtful (ironic?) kind of justice than the usual action movie shoot-em up ending? It really seems like they had some really good ideas but ran out of time and had to sew up production of this movie without having time to come up with any good ideas for the ending. Still, some really creepy, disturbing concepts and awe-inspiring acting from Russell. I really enjoyed it.

Having said that, I really enjoyed it. Having seen it more than once, I have to say it has really grown on me. Soldier is a fun action movie that is very entertaining as long as you're not expecting some spectacular movie. Kurt Russel does a great job in his role as the soldier Todd. Although Todd does not speak much during the movie, Russel does a superb job expressing Todd's emotions through his face and his eyes, as well as body language. Without talking, the viewer still understands what Todd is feeling and thinking. I watch a lot of action movies and this is one of the better ones I have seen. The movie is very well directed and edited with hardly any wasted scenes, all serve a purpose in the story. There are no long boring stretches like the extremely disappointing movies S.W.A.T. or Bad Boys 2 any scenes that don't fit, like in The 13th Warrior where one subplot is introduced and quickly forgotten. (I still thought The 13th Warrior was a lot of fun. S.W.A.T. was terrible and Bad Boys 2 was a huge let-down after the very entertaining first Bad Boys. To conclude, if you enjoy fun action movies, such as Blade or Chronicles of Riddick, you'll probably enjoy Soldier as much as I did.

Antihero is probably the right word for Todd (Kurt Russell), the trained-from-birth soldier in a dystopic far future that is hardly delineated at all in this movie, unlike the earthbound near future shown in Curt Russell's earlier Escape From New York (1981). While his character had a detailed mission in EFNY (namely to rescue the president of the USA whose plane has crashed within the walls of the prison that Long Island has been made into, and given over to the inmates' control), the Soldier is the victim of circumstances and much of this movie is a portrait of his damaged psyche.I had to keep reminding myself that this is a sci-fi movie made in 1998 because everything about it looks like it was made in the 1980s or 1970s. That means no computer generated realistic images, everything is done with painted backdrops, a few small sets, models and stunt work. The movie has some slight computer awareness, and uses the visual cliché of showing us the computer display that a man is seeing - projected on his face! SPOILERS ahead, you have been warned!We are introduced to Todd when he is a member of a battle-hardened squad; flashbacks during the film show the society where babies are selected for exclusive training as merciless fighters. Unfortunately for the squad, a dapper colonel arrives with another squad of soldiers who are faster, better, stronger - because they have been bio-engineered in a new way. To prove the point, Todd and two of his comrades are pitched against one of the super soldiers, Caine 607 (Jason Scott Lee). Although Todd manages to put out one of Caine's eyes, the three are vanquished and summarily disposed of in a consignment of trash dumped on the trash planet Arcadia!Todd alone survives, due to the help he receives from a society of scavengers that live on Arcadia. Arcadia is an interesting place. I have to stretch my disbelief to accept that it makes economic sense to transport large amounts of scrap metal to a remote planet, and this would have been easier had not some of the trash looked like 1970-model US automobiles and even an aircraft carrier. There are frequent sandstorms on Arcadia and the inhabitants have thoughtfully provided guide ropes to hold on to when that occurs. But the ropes are held up by parking meters huh? I find that strange.The inhabitants, let me call them Arcadians, are families that were on their way to colonise somewhere else but their ship crashed on Arcadia. They have a woman leader, and the movie would gain from showing us more than it does of their society and personalities. However the intention is to show how Todd with his stunted personality fails to socialise with them. This is presented in scenes where Todd is unable to respond to the kindness of Sandra (Connie Nielsen), mother of the family that has taken him in, (he continues to address her as Sir), and he just stares at their small boy Nathan. Although Todd with his strength and fast reactions shows some usefulness to the community, they feel ill at ease with such a fighter in their midst and politely ask Todd to leave. He does so, but just before the Arcadian settlement is attacked by a military spaceship on a search-and-destroy exercise. It is no surprise that the dapper colonel, his super-soldiers plus remaining members of Todd's old squad are all on board. Todd decides to fight alone on behalf of the Arcadians, and the battle scene is set.The soldiers' weaponry is all powerful and noisy but of primitive design. Two teams drive out from the spaceship in armoured wheeled trucks that they call crawlers. I can't get rid of the idea that a crawler should be a tracked rather than a vehicle with wheels, and that the former is a more suitable means of propulsion on a trash heap on an unknown planet. The driver of one of the crawlers is Caine 607 so we know Todd has a score to settle with him. For me there was a continuity fault in their confrontation first we see Todd manage to drop grenades through the open hatch of Caine's crawler which afterwards bursts into flames. That seemed conclusively lethal, but moments later Caine is out on the ground taking pep-up pills. These restore him enough for a fistfight with Todd.Continuity suffers again in the happy ending. Todd and his erstwhile comrades take over the spaceship, eject dapper commander and take off. Dapper commander is left to try to disarm the planet-buster super-bomb that he has ordered placed on Arcadia. He fails, and Todd and company escape just ahead of the titanic explosion. Now we discover that all the colonists are aboard, but when did they including children and wounded have a chance to embark? Anyway, everyone is headed to presumably a better life at the colonists' intended destination.In summary, Soldier gives an interesting psychological portrait of a stunted personality, which Curt Russell only has to play in a wooden manner. The music lifts this movie above mediocre. The score is well done with a militaristic mood where needed, without being intrusive. Unfortunately a song in metal pop genre is sung for no reason at all during the credits. I do dislike being exposed to irrelevant audio material during closing credits, and it should be obvious that nothing done at that point can ever improve a movie. I won't harp on the point here because after the song, the main music of the movie returns, just proving that there was no shortage of good orchestral material.

I think it does a good job of depicting a brutal society and the good people who spring up like weeds between it's cracks, clinging to survival.  It also is an excellent depiction of the main character, an empty killer honed to perfection and then discarded by his society like a no-longer-useful tool. It is among a group of scavengers that he finds his home, with people who make their living off the detritus of the very wasteful and thoughtless mainstream.  They are able to kindle the tiny spark of humanity he has left, but the movie makes no pretenses about his chances of reintegration.  His psychological scars run too deep, and so instead he struggles with all his life to defend a people he can never truly be a part of because their continued existence is more important to him than his own.  Now instead of risking his life because he is worthless, he fights because his cause is worth more, and this exalts his ability to a new level.  It reminds me of Ender's Game a little, with extraordinary people in extreme circumstances, their humanity being exposed by thier trials; also because of the military aspect of it, with people robbed of thier childhood to defend a people they cannot join.  I think the movie is also well directed and acted.  Kurt Russell certainly gives a nuanced performance with his tight, controlled face and quiet manner punctuated  by his pained, expressive eyes.  The action scenes are also great, and the last third or quarter of the movie is basically one long, well-done action extravaganza.  I hope I haven't built this movie up unjustifiably, and it didn't do too well in theaters so I'm sure there's plenty you can find fault with in it, but I loved it.

His work include Event Horizon, a chilling and claustrophobic scifi horror film, which waits to be released unrated on DVD. He directed also Mortal Kombat and more recently The Resident Evil. Soldier is written by David Webb Peoples, the guy who also wrote Blade Runner, The Unforgiven and Twelve Monkeys, for instance. Soldier stars talented actor Kurt Russell and many other great actors too, like Gary Busey and very beautiful and sensitive Connie Nielsen. So there are many positive things in this film, and the result is not too bad, just pretty stupid, but amusingly stupid!Russell plays sergeant Todd in future, where little boys are taken and trained into savage killers who obey all given orders without asking questions. There are also even more effective killers, robots, that are about to replace these human killers, and the story deals also a occupation of one planet in which Russell is left to die, wounded and alone..So it is likely that he will not look as the planet is destroyed by the folks that almost destroyed him. What follows is totally non stop action, fine effects and exciting situations. And little talk, at least from Russell's mouth.The film is nothing compared to Blade Runner, which has many philosophical aspects in it and has many other things to offer than mere action. Anyway, Soldier is pure actioner without any message or theme, and it is fine, as long as one is interested in these films. I first thought that the film was way too stupid but then I realized that as a spectacular action film, Soldier is almost great and can be seen many times. This should be seen in theatre as there are many visually stunning scenes that prove Anderson to be a very talented director. The fight scenes are exciting, and bullets fly everywhere. There are hardly any breaks to the mayhem, only couple of scenes, which try to develop the characters, before the next action filled scene comes. Kurt Russell is very wooden in his performance, but we must remember that he plays emotionally almost dead person, so this is the only way to play that kind of a role, and that he does with no flaws! Just look at his face as he is without flinching in every scene, killing or shooting, talking or sleeping, the same face. That may feel pretty irritating, but then again, we must remember that this film should not be taken too seriously.The major flaw in Soldier is its emptiness. There definitely should have been some content in the film like in Blade Runner. Now Soldier is just action without brains, and I think that is enough for mass audiences and thus they get what they want. The action is very brutal, too, and the violence is surprisingly gory in some cases, so the film is in the outer limits of R rating. We must remember that Anderson's Event Horizon had to be cut badly to get the R rating, so the man is known for his violent films. I personally would like to see the unrated version of Event Horizon, as it would be the true director's cut. Soldier is perhaps too violent for some viewers, as there are many fist fights, bone snappings, bloody shootings and other brutal scenes of mayhem and destruction. But still this is a Hollywood flick made in the late 90's so don't expect this to be some over-the-top violence fest, despite my writings. Usually expectations rise too high by reading some reviews before watching the film, and my intention is not to do so by telling about the violent nature of the film. So if you want some ultra violent film, try something else. Soldier is mainstream, but still pretty savage mainstream.Soldier gets 6/10 rating due to its great visual style and some exciting scenes and images. Anderson is great film maker, and hopefully he can continue doing these films he does so well.

Arnold is great at showing no emotion, and Stallone would be even better, as he has that look of death in his eyes.  Kurt Russell was fine in this movie, but come on, no action movie fan goes to see a Kurt Russell movie. Yet still this is a good movie, better than say the somewhat similar Universal Soldier. Not nearly as good as Road Warrior which has a similar plot. If someone is going to spend that much money on an action movie, at least get an actor that will become, and sell the movie.

It has a great plot. Basically I don't like the super-soldier movie but this one was interesting.The idea is simple In the future the government decides to build the perfect soldier. They do this by selecting children from birth and then raising them from birth to adult-hood to be perfect soldiers. These soldiers have been in many wars and always gotten the job done. Eventually the government decides to do one better and make and pick candidates from conception instead of just birth and then enhance their DNA. The government replaces the first generation perfect soldier with this years model. The leader of the old model is dumped on a remote dump planet, basically your ordinary everyday ol' trash can planet. There he is taking in by the colonist who crash landed their years ago. They teach him he is more than just a soldier. The generals decide the new soldiers aren't battle tested enough and just happen to decide to do some field training on the dump planet. And use the colonist as target practice...I will not spill the ending for you but that is where things really start to get interesting.The movie serves as a nice warning as what really could happen if the desire for a perfect soldier were ever taken too seriously. Or if the desire for the perfect child were ever taken too seriously by parents. The leader of the old school soldiers would have never gotten his humanity back if it hadn't been for his surrogate parents. There is a good look at group social interactions through out the whole movie too. What people will do right and wrong to fit in and belong.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.

It wasn't bad, the story was coherent, the plot was clear and thought-provoking, the action was exciting enough, the fight scenes were credible, and Kurt Russell and Jason Scott Lee acted well. It's not a must-see like Terminator 2. This is the kind of movie you'd just like to sit back, enjoy and finish.The theme is not original. It's a combination of Universal Soldier 2 (the original vs. the improved version), Gattaca (power of the human spirit), Terminator 2 (killing machine learning to care) and a classic Kung Fu movie (hero gets beaten intially). It's the total concept from this combination and the development of the storyline that gives it a unique appeal -- the inhuman way Todd and his fellow soldiers were raised and trained, their battles, Todd's defeat in the hands of Kane, the settler's rescue of Todd, his life with them and of course, his defense of the settlement and eventual revenge on the bad guys.Kurt Russell acts well as a soldier devoid of emotion. Most of the time it's just his eyes doing the acting. He speaks volumes with that blank stare of his. During the sparse moments he's actually allowed to speak, he gives the voice a blind, subservient, yet non-robotic quality.Plus of course the final confrontation between Todd and Kane features a pleasant twist to an expected outcome.On the down side, the effects are run-of-the-mill B-movie type ones. But since it's not the main focus of the story, it's acceptable, unlike action spectaculars by bigger action stars which tend to lose focus because of the effects and gadgetry.

Russell plays Todd, plucked from birth to become the ultimate in heartless intergalactic soldiery. We see Todd grow from a robotically silent child into an equally roboticaly silent adult in a sequence that covers his first forty years in what feels like..well forty years. When, along with his comrades, he finds himself replaced by a new breed of super super-soldier Todd becomes marooned on a garbage dump of a planet with a group of shipwrecked colonists.

Gun battle ensues. Homesteader husband (Pertwee)conveniently cops it leaving Todd to claim his wife and son as his new surrogate family as he saves the wagon train, sorry, colonists and takes them West, to a brighter better future where I hope for their sakes drivel like this isn't playing at their local galactic multiplex. The central problem is that the plot revolves around a character who by definition is devoid of personality. You wait in vain for Todd to shake off his training and learn to be a human again. Where is the scene where Todd learns to laugh? To dance? To talk for Christ sakes? How can we care about a central character whose attempts at socialisation are represented by teaching a small boy to kill a snake with a piece of footwear?

The universe has been bombarded by hatred, retribution, and warfare. A maelstrom of malevolence has covered much of the universe in decimation. In the midst of outer space, the military has designed a new type of Soldier. He has been trained to consume pain, frustration and fear. This new breed of soldier has been taught to kill without condolence, to exterminate without prejudice,  and to follow  orders      with total discipline...or else...it's disposal time...Kurt Russell (BREAKDOWN, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) is Sgt. Todd, the best of the elite. Todd was disciplined in both the arts of armed and unarmed combat. Todd's priorities included getting the mission done without emoting any inklings of emotional whiplash.  Todd has served in innumerable wars and has won a plethora of awards for his services to the military.However, a new breed of soldier has been given the green light.  Caine (Jason Scott Lee) has been genetically enhanced as the new weapon of mass destruction. Stronger then the typical human, Caine has been programmed to fight any soul he's obliged to expunge. Caine also has the perspicacity of a cheetah. Even more ominous then Todd, Caine has been  ordered        to wipe out the original group of soldiers, and to  replace   them    with the military's new brand of the killing force...Todd, unfortunately, has refused to comply to the military's demands. Refusing to become one of the obsolete, Todd has forcefully joined an alliance with a group of villagers. Knowing that the military has planned to annihilate this small colony of settlers inhabiting a small planet without second thoughts, Todd has decided to turn the tables on his superiors...and all hell will break loose on the supposedly deserted planet...  The army though has assumed the wrong information when they have thought of the villagers to be worth nothing but a speck of dust...SOLDIER, the new Kurt Russell sci-fi/action hybrid had ambitions in mind. The film wanted to convey a motif about humanity and how the army is sometimes declared responsible for wiping out individuality and morality in mankind...just for the sake of instilling discipline.  SOLDIER had good intentions, no doubt, but the film had its shortcomings. For one, the special effects, especially the outer space scenery was visually striking. Unfortunately, the production designs for the rest of the movie fell flat. The setting for the deserted planet evoked a reminder of the innumerable low-budget post apocalyptic movies. Similarities were evident in the plot itself including A main villain turned good; another main villain who has turned against authorities in order to accomplish his own diabolical deeds; a stereotypical civilization that has refused to give the Soldier hospitality; and an even greater stereotyped psychotic Army General. There's also the usual silly looking storm-troopers whom Todd has slaughtered one by one and there's also the innocuous, harmless family that nursed Todd back to health.A bonus in the film, SOLDIER includes Gary Busey as an annoying military adviser who offers plenty of bombastic philosophies. Anyway, SOLDIER tried to merge ideas from several flicks together as one whole film including parts of STARSHIP TROOPERS, THE ROAD WARRIOR, THE TERMINATOR, et. al. The results though, for this film, was not nearly as satisfying as each of those individual entries. Soldier has lacked the excitement and vigor of most sci-fi/action amalgams and the film doesn't go together cohesively from beginning to end. There were several noticeable plot holes in this film, and the pace has failed to keep a certain lively rhythm that has made previous entries of similar kind entertaining, and of guilty viewing pleasures.Enough with the diatribes. SOLDIER still retained itself as a noteworthy entry in the science-fiction/action-adventure genre. There were some decent thrills in this film, and the action can be exciting at times.  The film has cool action sequences, and the usual explosions, violence, blood. The story-line can be easily presentiment and the characters lacked insight though. SOLDIER has earned points for valiant attempts in trying to become a sci-fi epic.  This movie has failed to live up to the high standards of what's considered a quality film. The premise of SOLDIER has been done before, and with a much better product and outcome. SOLDIER has had potential, but the special effects were inconsistent, ranging from surprising    mediocre to excellent. Also, despite all the fancy, decorative visuals posted in this film, one must question Where's the heart of the movie? Well, hidden and buried in a pile of cliches.  SOLDIER has some grand moments and both a great introduction and ending. The middle though, may be rather tedious and plodding.  A meretricious, by-the-numbers thriller.

Thinking that his dead they leave him behind on a scrap plant, where he encounters colony of miners who take him in and he learns about the peaceful side of humanity. Although, that's short lived when they have to defend themselves from this new breed of soldiers.What an emotional masterpiece of pure junk! Um, emotionally barren more like it, although it does try hard to be moving, but for most part this a tired, flat and slickly cold western-space joint. Paul W.S Anderson's Soldier is B movie at heart that just wants to be more, but this brainless Sci-fi fodder can't hide its phony sets, drab direction and derivatively, lacking story. I thought the plot did start off very well, with the busy opening 10-minutes concentrating on these killing machines growing up, which showed promise. But this idea is scrapped for an unevenly, slacking mid-section, which at best can be describe as a complete yawn! This is when it over does itself in this whole inhuman killer discovering that of feelings, humanity and accepting different values of life. It just all comes across as unnatural, rather tacky and totally pointless padding. Especially since Russell's character spends most of his time being a passenger here doing nothing but pouting like a little stubborn kid who portrays very little emotion in his few facial expressions and even less dialogue. Maybe I should be glad he didn't speak too much, as the dialogue we did hear was infantile (my daddy always said?) and wears rather thin. He's a killing machine and he doesn't really get to show us until the final atmospheric showdown in the last half hour. Even then there are only one or two intense moments (one being the final combat showdown), because these gung-ho antics and explosions lack any sort of oomph or gusto. Can these pedestrian action sequences be any more numbingly, dull! Anderson's direction is simply unexciting and incredibly formulaic. This would have to be his least stylish flick I've seen. Written by David Ward (Unforgiven, Twelve Monkeys, Blade Runner) is a stale screenplay that leaks too many holes, thin characters, forced morality and doesn't give too much insight. The performances are fine, but honestly no one really makes much of a dent. Kurt Russell doesn't have to do too much as the very focused killing machine and he definitely turns in the best performance, along with the gorgeous Connie Nielsen. Their performances do keep you watching. Gary Busey gets a thankless role, and the likes of Jason Isaacs playing the weasel Colonel Mekum, Jason Scott Lee as one of new tough genetic breed of soldiers and Sean Pertwee as Mace don't get up to too much.I was just expecting some entertainment -- not anything meaningful, but just like Anderson's Resident Evil it gradually grew into a lacklustre dud that thinks too much than really delivering.

Visually, it's like an ultra-low-budget made-for-cable flick, something on the level of a late-80's Jean Claude Van Damme vehicle you might see on Showtime at 3am.  This cheap look is difficult to reconcile with the fact that they obviously spent gobs of money on the thing, but somehow Anderson pulls it off.A big, stupid, post-Apocalyptic action movie is one of the easiest genres to pull off.  Waterworld was bad, but at least it was marginally watchable. Soldier is absolutely awful, and Paul Anderson demonstrates he can't even do a brainless testosterone movie.

Anyone who wants the definition of cheese on celluloid needs look no further than Paul W. S.

It's shallow and artificial, both plot and character wise (especially character wise) Amy the talking Gorilla from Congo, would've been a better lead. At least she has the ability to speak. Russell's character has about ten lines of dialogue, and waltzes through the picture with one facial expression. When I think back on the film, I find it tempting to laugh at him. He truly is the daddy of all cardboard characters.Most of the movie is pretty darn dull, but the fire laden finale is a medium good pay off for having to endure a long string of silly lines and failed emotional moments where nothing happens. In the final twenty minutes, the film comes to life in a hail of gunfire, explosions, monster truck madness, and fist-a-cuffs. It's all a bit reminiscent of the flash forward scenes in Terminator; the war with the machines. There are a few nice shots, a couple of moments that made me cheer (jokingly of course).In the end, it's not quite enough to save the movie. The soldiers in this movie are the manufacturing of an institution, as is the movie itself. It is a product of the b-movie industry.

Replaced and left to die, it's time for Todd to learn a new kind of way of living outside the army he has served for his whole life...Soldier (1998) is very much a straight narrowed action flick there's the set-up action scene, the more quiet middle section with few bursts of action and then the final 30 minutes or so of pure non-stop shooting, fighting, blood and violence. What separates Soldier from other traditional action films is the lead character Todd he's silent for most of the film, hardly shows any traces of emotion on his face and generally spends a whole lot of time looking around the world he does not understand, tilting his head while doing it like a bemused dog. Not being the typical action hero Todd is a character you either sympathize with or you don't. I didn't and because the film is all about that character, I found the film quite uninteresting.Kurt Russell does a decent job with the character even though he hadn't much to work with. I oddly found myself thinking Todd as a robot from time to time, something he's not supposed to be (probably), I don't know if that is a positive thing or not but it certainly distracted me a few times.

From my understanding the original script should have indicated something of a 'Blade Runner' sequel, and completely worthy of that title, something in the vein of a 'Total Recall' with a military industrial focus. Of course, that was helmed by the master of brutal, smart dystopians Paul Verhoeven, where 'Soldier' was foolishly disposed of in the puerile cinematic rubbish bin known as Paul WS Anderson. As it stands, a masterpiece pared down to it's most base, mindlessly referential and shallow form, is still the best work of this completely uninspiring director. In the DVD commentary for 'Soldier', Anderson mentions that since the settlers' community was set on a garbage planet, the idea was to have all sorts of props from other films, as in garbage from other movies. That couldn't have been more unintentionally self aware, because there's no better way to describe his work than a garbage dump of ideas from superior sources. His mind is where stolen ideas go to be thrown away and soiled, never to be fresh again! The best efforts of all the fine actors and visual designers assembled for this misfire add to the disappointment; Kurt Russel must have been pining for another 'Escape From New York' when he trained for 18 months, to get into the best shape of his flabby life. But collaboration is the mother of wasted potential. Nobody could have known what a remarkably superficial powerwash Paul Wasted Script Anderson was capable of performing on this, he could turn Kafka's 'The Trial' into common John Grisham style pablum.I still like 'Soldier', I have some genuine affection for its goofy ineptness. It has some brilliant concepts and ingenious allegory hidden in it, VERY WELL HIDDEN, like a rose bush crushed under the knobby wheel of a military Hummer. The excellent set design, the great, often campy performances combined with my teenage nostalgia for it, almost allow me to forgive the tragic waste of ideas, and the obnoxious, blustery derivative action and tacky digital effects gimmicks. It's like 'Brave New World' meets 'Apocalypse Now' meets a lobotomy with a rusty steak knife smeared with methamphetamine and cooking lard. Clearly Paul Anderson was a star pupil at the same George Lucas film school that Zack Snyder and Michael Bay graduated from.For all of us who have cut our teeth on witty, socially conscious exploitation films, and the elegant and irreverent Roger Corman productions, where humour and insight were folded into a genre mold with craft and inventiveness, abandon all hope. Studio productions can in essence be the excruciating antonym to that, where ideas and wit are discarded for needlessly bloated genre clichés, and a film like this becomes an arduous tedious process of imagining what could have been. Many have accepted the coercion of studio market saturation, and adopted the pitiful, defeated anti-intellectualism whereby familiarity is effectively calculated in order to maximize the commercial appeal of a movie product, and the consumer validation comes in the form of trite slogans such as turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. Well it is your prerogative to do so, but don't complain when that ride they take you for leads to an oven or a GAS CHAMBER (metaphorically speaking?)!

It places Todd (Kurt Russell) in a world where he was selected at birth to become desensitized to human emotion, sympathy, and sorrow.  This was one of my favorite parts of the movie. It is the `ultimate' in a survival of the fittest situation. After being war hardened over 23 years of battle he has become the leader of this elite military unit of `Human Terminators'. Until this time, they were the ones called in to do the dirty work of the Military, fighting out secret wars and to cover up incidents that have happened that shouldn't have.Then a new breed of warrior was introduced. Genetically enhanced, faster, stronger, and better in every way physically possible. The unfortunate display of these new warriors talents led to the death of two veteran soldiers along with the injury and mistaken death of Todd.  The 3 bodies were dumped on a remote garbage planet while the rest of the veteran soldiers were decommissioned down to field techs, and stripped of any soldier duties. They were essentially replaced. Todd recovers on the planet and realizes he is out of his element. His whole life he was trained to follow orders and do what he is told, and now he is on a planet where there is no one to guide him.He runs into a community of outcasts that crashed on that planet 2 decades before and have built a civilization there. They help Todd recover and invite him into their community. Todd then is subject to things he has never felt before. He witnesses love, friendship, and his expected roll in life changed from someone who kills and destroys, to someone who helps. He cannot understand this new flood of emotions that are pouring through him. And for the first time he is feeling something other than fear and discipline. A small family befriends him and he has a hard time coping with his new feelings towards their child, and even the mans wife. Todd snaps cause of the pressure of his new environment and deals with it the only way he knows how..   Violence. While releasing his stress on a metal punching bag he is misunderstood by the community and a potential harm to them. So he is voted out of their society. Todd leaves to wander the planet alone. And during this time he cried for the first time in his life. They realize they made a mistake by kicking him out. And they locate him to invite him back in.At this time the Military head that controls the new breed of soldiers decides that this planet would be a perfect training ground and a good way to test the newbies skills on the battlefield. The only problem is that all encounters will be considered hostile. That unfortunately includes Todd and his new friends.As the Soldiers engage Todd alone takes them out in Rambo style. The action is intense and the climax builds to a battle between Todd and the Leader of the new Solders that injured Todd months back.This is a Story about humanity and how compassion can drive someone that has none, to do what is right. It is a feel good movie that will have to rooting for the hero as he battles to protect instead of destroy.The Special effects are realistic, and the plot is well handled.

I'm even a decent fan of Kurt Russell so for me to say his performance sucks beyond belief here would be like a Jim Carrey fan admitting Carrey is too over the top in his earlier comedies - it's not going to happen.The movie basically rips off every futuristic/apocalyptic action movie you can think of, including Alien, Blade Runner, The Terminator and of course Kurt's Escape from New York. The problem is there's no substance here.The direction is slipshod and lazy - the action scenes are boring and none of the characters stand out at all. The hero is a dull, emotionless waste of space who has one facial expression preserved throughout the movie The Kurt Russell Cold Stare. (tm) You'll know what I mean if you've seen a Kurt Russell movie before.Anyway, if you're a Paul basher then you'll hate this. If you're not a Paul basher you'll still hate it. I don't have a problem with simplistic action movies - but at least make them ENTERTAINING! I was dead bored watching this.

It also flopped at the US box office and it's not too difficult to see why . It's not a terrible film in the same way as PEARL HARBOR is a terrible film but is a rather uninvolving painfully paced one which totally sinks itWe start off in the year 1996 where new babies are born in to a fascistic militaristic society , cut forward a few years and we find these children are bred as modern day Spartans and their being trained to become super-soldiers ready to fight on other planets . The problem with this that it doesn't tie in with present day Earth reality and we're many decades away from inter-planetary travel . I know the screen writer is on record as saying it takes place within the same time frame/universe as BLADE RUNNER . Strange that you would never know this unless you'd read the interviews with the screenwriter years afterwards or that the screenplay was lying around for 15 years before it was produced . An early 1980s view on Reaganism might have explained the futuristic fears of militarism but couldn't the screenplay have been written to set it in the mid 21st century ? That said after this it turns in to a traditional story of an outsider being the saviour of a bunch cyphers being bullied by bad guys . In effect it's Western B movie plot done with an A budget that doesn't really work . SOLDIER also suffers from a dead pan performance by Kurt Russsell who doesn't say much . Russell was always good at playing all American good guys and seems miscast as the cold hearted silent anti-hero .

His surprises, his tendency to play on claustrophobia, and I could go on. This one is different... whether that's positive or not is up to the individual viewer. The script is by the man who wrote Blade Runner(which this is set in the same universe as) and Unforgiven. Quite why it was handed to Mr. Video-Game Movie, I do not know... perhaps someone lost a bet. He does actually treat some of the ideas herein fairly well(and there is about equal focus on that and the stuff that veers more towards the lowest common denominator)... it doesn't feel entirely like a W.S. flick for that reason, but comparing this to Event Horizon seems to indicate that it's a toss-up, as far as quality goes, when he directs something he didn't write... it could really go either way. The plot is reasonable. The pacing is so-so. The action is somewhat light in amount... and it varies some, but there is some pretty good, and certainly relatively inventive among it. The acting ranges somewhat, but Russell is fine. The special effects are almost invariably great. There is a bit of violence, and a little language. I recommend this to fans of Paul W.S.

In fact, there are parts that fall closer to the touchy-feely emotions of something like ENEMY MINE. I personally like this movie a lot and think it's one of Kurt Russell's stronger performances. For a character who only utters 79 words over the course of the 99 minutes, he does an amazing job of portraying an emotionally deadened soldier attempting to adapt to the world of real people. It's not the eye-gouging, military exercise destroying violence that bothers people who watch SOLDIER, it's the fact that there's a lot more going on here than just violence. I think the premise that deals with the human toll of being a stormtrooping soldier in the future is quite smart, and I actually prefer the streamlined approach of not explaining every future technology in scientific detail. This is not necessarily a movie for tech heads, gore junkies or D&D fantasy freaks; it's a movie about a soldier that just happens to take place somewhere in the future. Enjoy.

I guess I was too afraid to ask that question. Well, I'm sorry to say that SOLDIER didn't impress me a single bit, and it definitely isn't going into my future DVD collection, either. The script is twenty years out of date, turning this into a plain block of a run-and-gun picture set in the futuristic wastelands. Suddenly, it goes further down the mountain than its failure to carve up some new and thoughtful innovations. An emotionless Kurt Russell has one of the absolute worst performances ever on film, and recent history. He's a...well...what can you call him??? A Soldier, of course! A soldier who has no service to his internal character. A soldier whose bold, buff appearance is stiff as an iron board. A soldier who thinks he has the brains of Marcy by calling out Sir to the opposite sex (Peppermint Patty, for example). Send him back to boot camp immediately! Tedious action concerning rounds of aiming gunfire and explosions doesn't make this worthwhile, and the visuals are flat out average at best. I believe Hollywood has already used up its fullest potential to make a really good movie, and has finally ended up in a dearth of any exceeding qualities. SOLDIER will have to do until THE MATRIX comes out on video, and will that film be a stellar hit in my book? Pray that it does, because the domestic movie industry needs a breakthrough to stay alive for the new millennium!

Director Paul Anderson's preparation for Soldier consisted of throwing the following elements into a blender. First, every bad 80's post-apocalyptic film, with a tired junk aesthetic that might have been fresh in 1975. Add a dash of the military styled SF of James Cameron's much imitated Aliens, and then finish with a poorly executed dystopian culture in the style of Starship Troopers, or perhaps Ray Liotta's equally weak movie No Escape. The end result is a underwhelming and flat action film that doesn't deliver anything new or interesting. How Anderson spent $75m on this movie is a mystery, because the effects are either lackluster or non-existent, and the entire film takes place in a junk strewn desert filled with recycled props.Kurt Russell's performance as a deadpan soldier is entirely predictable, and certainly wasn't worth his $20 million paycheck. The only person who emotes worth a damn is Connie Nielsen, and she must have wondered how she ended up here. Isaacs and Busey play their threadbare roles entirely for laughs (and a paycheck).The plot of Soldier is worn, derivative and full of anachronisms. Apparently by 2020 humanity has conquered much of the galaxy, and can dedicate the entire planet of Arcadia to garbage disposal, but the military hasn't evolved past using lightly armored troops wielding flamethrowers and rocket launchers. I might be willing to swallow these plot holes in a great summer blockbuster, or an older genre film like Blade Runner, but not in fresh tripe like Soldier.This film proves once and for all that Blade Runner was brilliant because of the superior writing of Philip K Dick, rather than the hack script of David Peoples, who apparently penned this $75m turkey. It's no surprise that he didn't work again for a decade. It's also been downhill from here for director Paul Anderson, who showed early promise with movies like Shopping and Event Horizon, only to end up churning out dreck like Soldier, then going on to destroy the Aliens and Predator franchises with his execrable AvP.

If you think this is going to be any more than just an explosion packed Sci-Fi popcorn flick, you can count on being disappointed; and you would be if you harboured any hopes like that for this film. Director Paul W.S. Anderson has built his career on delivering movies that are purely made for entertainment; but surprisingly enough, despite three tries prior to this film, he still hasn't managed to get it right. For a film that's supposed to get you enjoying yourself and munching down your popcorn, Anderson manages to keep the movie surprisingly uninteresting. The main problems stem from the fact that the film is so routine, and therefore massively predictable. Anderson tries to deflect our attention from this with any number of explosions and people getting shot; but it's time he learnt that this isn't good enough. The story is basically, Shane, with a Sci-Fi theme. It follows trained soldier Kurt Russell as he gets dumped on a garbage planet after being replaced by a new breed of super soldiers. He tries to fit in with the locals; but he hasn't heard the last of his old regiment.The good thing about having Kurt Russell as the lead in your film is that you're guaranteed some charisma, and a good time should, therefore, follow. However; once again Anderson has failed to capitalise on his assets, and the role that Russell has been given; a stone cold man of few words, doesn't give him material that he can be at his best with; and pretty much, it's a waste of a great actor. The rest of the cast isn't up to much either, despite some names that usually stand out in movies. Gary Busey is severely underused, while Anderson regulars Jason Issacs and Sean Pertwee barely get a look-in either. Connie Nielson is a good looking actress that, for some reason, hasn't had all that many good roles; and starring in a film like this hasn't done her any favours. The film looks cheap throughout, and Anderson has done a slap-dash job at creating an alien planet. There's barely any imagination present; and the fact that the planet this film takes place on is a storage place for garbage is very fitting on the whole. I'm sure that if you scoured the piles of waste there, you'd find quite a few copies of this movie.

The first minutes, Kurt being replaced, really had some slight fascination, but after this, things got worse, to put it in a nice way. The FX might be a matter of taste, I personally thought I could create more action by filming my old StarWars action figures. The characters were all stereotypes, there were no signs that they MIGHT be individuals. And talking about characters DONT TRUST ANYONE telling you Mr. Russell did good acting in this movie. As mentioned many times, Russell does hardly speak. And to express his feelings, there are always slowmotion parts, combined with shots of his eyes... this is acting?!?!?! My fridge is better in impersonating a penguin. There is only one way I can explain all these flashbacks in the movie The production team gathered around a table, when suddenly a member detected that the film was only about 60 mins. So, someone brought up the idea to show the whole film twice, but was convinced to put in these flashbacks to stretch it to about 100 mins. Talking about action This movie isnt an ACTION film at all. It is a film with SOME ACTION scenes. All you fans take a watch and count the action scenes. You´d be suprised. Or maybe you MADE it an action film with FastFoward... that would be an option. How can things like this pass test screenings?!? I never saw the movie Braindead, but this word really made its way into my mind during the whole film. In the German version, they even cut the scene when Kurtie fights the really mean, bad, evil soldier at the end.... so, this makes a no content, no violence film.I have never been that frustrated leaving a cinema and I have seen quite a lot of ****, but this one was an insult.
