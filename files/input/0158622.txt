It has moments, but far too few of them.The few things done right first Jane Krakowski makes a wonderful Betty; why couldn't she have been in the first movie? She makes the silly dialog somehow sweet and fun. The dating sequence is cute and the Vegas arrival scene has some clever sight gags, but these were fleeting montages. Harvey Korman is wasted in a throw-away role with few lines; instead of voicing Gazoo (as he did in the original cartoon), and the guy they use for Gazoo sounds like slate grinding on bedrock.Joan Collins is obnoxious enough on her own; this movie has her play a wrenching stereotypical loudmouth mother-in-law who you want to feed to the nearest T-Rex you can find. And the guy that plays Barney? What the heck is he doing? His entire performance looked like a rejected audition for a junior high school production of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in Jurassic Park. Fred? The guy had a voice almost as nasally as Joan Collins. Wilma is cast as a 7-foot-tall giraffe. Fred goes gambling Gee, what's gonna happen there? Fred and Barney dress up as dancers they even manage to ruin this classic comedy routine. A poorly done triangle story falls flat.This petrified fossil of a film does little justice to the Modern Stone-Aged Family. Rent some of the original cartoons, instead.

However, this film is not quite up to par with the original.  This version deals with the way the Flintstones came into existence.  Young dino-crane operators Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) find true love in fast-food waitresses Wilma (Kristen Johnston) and Betty (Jane Krakowski).  They take an expense-paid trip to Rock Vegas, but the evil Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson) has a plan to get rid of Fred so he can have Wilma for himself.  That is about it for the near invisible plot.  Once again the production values are high, but that does not save this film from being a dud.

Only one thing It's even worse.In this live-action prequel to the 1994 comedy hit, Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and wife Wilma (Kristen Johnston) go to Rock Vegas along with the Rubbles, Barney (Stephen Baldwin) and Betty (Jane Krakowski), where Wilma is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). This is the setup for a bunch of tiring gags that also have to do with a little green space alien coming to earth to see how humans mate, or something as such.This has to be one of the worst comedies I've seen it a while. It was actually painful for me to watch. There really are no redeeming values whatsoever, and I don't think I'd like it even if I was a five-year-old. It treats the audience like dirt, and it obviously seeing if there's any juice left in the audience to pay for another Flintstone flick.Instead of trying to improve upon the first film--which was a bit underrated--this film seems to go for the bare minimum in an effort only to draw money from the audience. I have to ask myself, if they knew the first was so critically-declaimed, why release another awful flick? Try to improve and get good reviews.But nope, no luck here.

Basically The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming) has come to Earth to see how humans (or should that be Neanderthals) mate, in his case, Fred Flintstone (A Knight's Tale's Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin). Soon enough Fred and Barney meet and fall in love with Wilma Slaghoople (Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me's Kristen Johnston) and Betty O'Shale (30 Rock's Jane Krakowski). Betty and Barney suit each other perfectly, but Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) is not impressed with Fred, she wants Wilma to marry rich bastard Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip obviously plans to make Fred and Barney look like criminals by giving them some credit to gamble in Viva Rock Vegas, they obviously see the opportunity to make money to impress their girlfriends. In the end, Chip is obviously defeated, and Fred and Wilma marry, with Betty catching the flowers, oh, and Gazoo (who only Fred and Barney could see) succeeded in his mission. Also starring Cumming as Mick Jagged, Harvey Korman as Colonel Slaghoople, American Pie's John Cho as Parking Valet, The Mask's Jim Doughan as Dinosaur Confessor and Rosie O'Donnell as the voice of the Octopus Masseuse. Addy does quite well replacing John Goodman, Baldwin is certainly stupider than Rick Moranis was, Johnston is more voluptuous and husky voiced than Elizabeth Perkins and Krakowski is definitely better than O'Donnell, all in all, a near better film than the first.

That was shortly after this prequel, featuring a different cast, came to the silver screen, and I remember hearing about this film around that time. Since I was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings of 1994's The Flintstones (both many years after my second), I was in no hurry to see The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, especially since I knew it had an even worse reputation than its predecessor. It's been over 2 ½ years since I last saw the first live action Flintstones effort, and I've finally seen this second one, which is unsurprisingly not good.The Great Gazoo is an alien who is sent to Earth by his species to learn about human mating rituals. Back on Earth, in the prehistoric town of Bedrock, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are two best friends who are both in search of girlfriends. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them. Meanwhile, a rich young woman named Wilma Slaghoople is fed up with the snobbish people around her, especially her mother, and runs away. She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the I'm ignoring you part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of The Flintstones was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's The Flintstones, you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like Viva Rock Vegas.

OK, he didn't have the voice down to a tee, but he resembles Fred, when made up, a whole lot more than Mr. Goodman.I just wish they would have asked Elizabeth Perkins to re-create her role as Wilma. She did a great job in the original, and resembled and sounded like the cartoon character, where Kristen Johnston, didn't quite do it for me in the role. She looked far too mature to be playing Wilma, and didn't have the voice either. But full marks to Stephen Baldwin and Jane Krakowski as Barney and Betty. They were also a lot better than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell from the original film. Mostly because, again, they sounded like the cartoon characters and Krakowski resembled Betty.

This movie has no depth, no purpose, no meaning, but it has prehistoric set creations, big sound effects, imaginative costume designs, and colorful makeup contributions-all of which may capture the attention of the film's target age group. This contraption absent of intelligence, flavor, and just about everything else.This immature prequel to the 1994 comedy hit based on the popular TV cartoon series, The Flintstones, is so bad none of the previous performers have faithfully returned for seconds.  The replacement for John Goodman is Mark Addy, the obese male stripper in The Full Monty. Rick Moranis' replacement is with Stephen Baldwin, whose most profound acting experiences uphold on the M&M's commercial. Kristen Johnson and Jane Krakowski substitute for the much funnier Roise O'Donnell and Elizabeth Perkins. Not coincidentally, these new actors, especially Addy and Baldwin, fit their dumfounded characters perfectly.The film details the fossilized lives of best friends Fred and Barney before they marry and conceive children. The two meet their future wives, Wilma and Betty, at a fast food restaurant. Conflicts evolve when Fred falls in love with Wilma and her filthy rich mother (Joan Collins) requires her daughter to romance playboy ex-boyfriend (Thomas Gibson) and skip poor Fred. Another subplot involves an alien (Alan Cumming) being sent from another planet to observe human mating rituals. Of course, Fred and Barney are right in the middle of the creatures' mishaps.I never cared about any of the characters in this movie; none of them have any motive or brains outside of the script. There is no effective tension contained in the love story either. The production dim-wittily attempts to portray suspense and involvement with romantic competition Wilma experiences. The Rock Vegas blackmail scheme contributes brief uptightness in the audience, but its conclusion will leave you laughing with pity.As far as humor goes, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is lacking of any funny material due to incredibly poor writing. There are dozens of slapstick jokes about dinosaurs, rocks, style, aliens, obesity, and clumsiness, but none have any life. At least similar comedies My Favorite Martian and What Planet Are You From were appropriately wacky. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is too corny for its own good. There were a few scenes that were so pathetic I could not hold my laughter back, but I was laughing at the movie, not with it.

Perhaps there is no coincidence the two movies acquire the same director, Brain Levant. This man has created bad films before (Problem Child 2, Jingle All The Way), but never anything as putrid as this pile of bones.

(Dir Brian Levant)`The Flintstones' were one of my all time favorite cartoons growing up and I certainly appreciated it years later as an uncanny Stone Age homage to `The Honeymooners' - arguably the greatest sitcom ever created - and was surprised that  a prequel was in production to the less than stellar live action adaptation a few years ago with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis and Rosie O' Donnell.  Go figure.Here the plot - such as it is - centers on how good buddies Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (Addy, the portliest member of the English lads in `The Full Monty' and Baldwin playing dim) met their future spouses Wilma and Betty - nee Slaghoople and O'Shale - (Johnston, the Amazonian alien from tv's `Third Rock From The Sun' and Krakowski of `Ally McBeal').  Seems Wilma is trying to get by when she abdicates her rich bitch mother Pearl (Collins, remarkably well-preserved precursor to the first film's Elizabeth Taylor) and her dotty, yet loving father the Colonel (perennial gold standard second banana comic vet Korman who gives plenty of smiles whenever he's onscreen), shirking her inherited lifestyle for a down on her luck lifestyle supported by the giddy barhop Betty who works at Bronto King where the two get along famously. It is there that the two cavemen meet the wives-to-be and set up a blind date after encountering mini alien The Great Gazoo (creepily envisioned with the full-size head of Cumming) who is there to observe mating habits of the `dumb dumbs'.  From there the rest is - as the theme song goes - `a gay all time!' After the two couples find their true loves (Barney was originally Wilma's date and Fred, Betty's) they quickly realize they are meant to be together but Pearl's interference with her estranged daughter only makes matters worse when she throws a party inviting the foursome to discover her plans of getting Wilma back with her ex, playboy and snake in the grass Chip Rockefeller (Gibson of `Dharma and Greg') who ploys to usurp Fred from Wilma at a set up vacation in his casino in - you guessed it! - Rock Vegas. Sure the storyline is pretty lame and some of the puns ridiculous - which was the appeal of the tv series frankly - but the cast seems to be enjoying themselves.  Addy gives an uncanny impersonation of both Jackie Gleason and Alan Reed, the original voice of Fred; Baldwin is believeably dippy; Johnston ably sexy and goofy and Krakowski's giggle is dead-on. And while the production design is accurate to the original with some inventive visuals (the dinosaur rollercoaster for example) and the debut of baby Dino the film just seems unnecessary and by the time Mick Jagged and the Stones (with Cumming - again - doing a gross caricature of Mick Jagger) arrive the energy seems depleted and going through the motions.  Yet little ones who are just getting a taste for the classic cartoon will not be disappointed and of course I'm sure that Universal will still pump them out as long as there's an audience.PS My only quibble is why they didn't allow Korman to voice the superscilious Gazoo (which he was on the old show) and make him more of animatronic than the bizarre and disturbing looking one in the film.  Maybe they can check into that for the inevitable sequel.

(Yes, that can happen because that is the reason why the 1998 film Madeline got a PG rating) Genre(s) Family, Comedy, Romance, Based on a TV show (The Flintstones animated series of the 60's) Summary It is basically a prequel of the 1994 underrated hit. (The Flintstones starring John Goodman). Fred (Addy) and Barney (Baldwin) just got their jobs in the rock quarry. Barney is feeling highly in content of his life although Fred is unsure of his future. Yet they'll meet The Great Gazoo (Cumming) for the 1st time soon enough. Meanwhile Wilma (Johnston) despite her financially wealthy life is feeling rather bored with her glamorous but rather humdrum life. After all she has her overbearing mother (Collins) her ex-boyfriend soon to be suitor for financial reasons of course Chip Rockefeller (Gibson) and who is trying to win Wilma's heart for financial reasons only, but at least she had her senile but good-hearted father (Korman). Wilma tries to escape her wealthy but unhappy life. So she runs away and gets a job at a local fifty-ish fast food place. Soon she meets with Betty (Krakowski) after trying to give a reason why she came there in the first place (but failing because Betty wouldn't let her completely explain) Betty gets Wilma a job at the fast food place. (Known as Bronto King gee try to guess what product plug in joke that was suppose to be.) Soon Fred and Barney meet the girls and you pretty much have an idea what's going on here.  The good If it weren't for the fact that this was a prequel the casting would look downright absurd. (I mean c'mon a Baldwin Brother as Barney Rubble? I don't hate the Baldwins but still). The special effects are first rate. Yet despite the special effects and the gags this isn't just eye candy with simple gags the movie was well made as itself. The cast did well & the performances were well done too. Despite the fact that this is a PG film this is perfectly fine for the whole family. And I can easily recommend this to any Flintstone fan. (Although I am not a Flintstone fan, I did enjoy the show and the movies though). The animals were a really nice touch such as dino (Blanc) a massaging squid (O'Donell) and more. From start to finish this film plays out really well. Overall this is one of the best gag comedies I have seen for a while but so far the animation world is on a winning streak this year I hope the simple gag comedy world can do the same. (Although it's rather unlikely)The bad The humble morality element in this is a bit schmaltzy, but that is no big deal. But if you don't like comedies that its humor is mainly simple-gags then you may want be careful.

The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, he's a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so it's fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilma's 'look' to a T and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that can't be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's stepmother than Joan Collins? Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60's cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding yes! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they aren't. For instance, Ace Ventura Pet Detective is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original Apocalypse Now it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? It's the same thing with both Flintstones movies &#x96; how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing? I always loved Gazoo and he's effectively brought to life in Viva Rock Vegas. The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, it's natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The first two acts of Viva Rock Vegas are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Don't get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.GRADE A- "},{"Title":"good cartoon fun","Date":"8 October 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" This film is good cartoon fun.

The movie also has a few nice little touches like pictures of the cartoon Fred and Barney handed out to people, and the specially modified Universal logo with the Earth only showing one continent behind the word Univershell (Did anyone else see those giant letters out there?).Alan Cumming as the Great Gazoo (and a Mick Jagger-type rock star) is also one of the movie's pros... and indicative of its cons. Writers Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont (Can't Hardly Wait, Josie and the Pussycats) and the late Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr (Top Gun, Anaconda) go for too many cheap gags, have a wilful disregard for the show's mythology - Gazoo didn't arrive until Fred and Barney were both married with children, for starters (and as another poster rightly says, he crashlanded as opposed to being sent) - and don't really have much of a plot going for them. The movie's all as silly as that episode where the boys befriended Ann-Margrock without knowing who she was. Speaking of which, Ann-Margret (who guested on the TV show) returns to Bedrock to sing Viva Rock Vegas in a montage and over the credits, but her take isn't a patch on the BC-52's version of the theme song in the first one, and indeed the overall feeling of going down a level is everywhere - not just in the plot of Wilma's mum wanting her daughter (a miscast Kristen Johnston) to marry an uppercrust type (Thomas Gibson from Dharma & Greg), but from the cast to the visual effects (Rhythm & Hues aren't quite up to Industrial Light & Magic's level) to the music (song-wise, that is; David Newman at least tries), the movie fits in all too well alongside the other losers directed by Brian Levant, he of Problem Child and Jingle All The Way infamy.

Frustrated with her oppressive mother (Joan Collins playing a b**** like only she can), upper-class Wilma Slaghoople runs away from home and meets Betty O'Shale at a diner, who takes Wilma under her wing under the impression that she's poor. Fred and Barney walk into their lives and soon sparks are flying. That is, until Fred discovers what a rich background Wilma really has, one that he intends to impress when the four of them are invited to the Rock Vegas casino of Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's shady suitor. Overseeing all of these antics is the futuristic alien Gazoo, sent to Earth to oversee humans' mating rituals and having the bad luck of taking Fred and Barney as his objects of study.I was not at all expecting to like Viva Rock Vegas, but I did, and it's a joy to watch every time it comes on TV. The cartoon atmosphere works pretty well in live action, and the actors are even improvements on the original live action cast. Mark Addy makes a much better Fred, and Jane Krakowski is a particularly excellent Betty. Stephen Baldwin captures the innocent slow-wittedness of Barney well. Alan Cumming (I am INVINCIBLE!) seals the deal in two very different but equally hilarious roles as Gazoo and the rock star Mick Jagged.The movie is very entertaining and very funny. It doesn't try to be anything more than that and it succeeds admirably. It seems there is no place for innocent comedies on the internet these days, but you could do worse than give this one a chance. Much, much worse.

Yes, it LOOKED great, but the storyline was dull and the characters weren't fleshed out well. However, compared to this prequel, the writing of that first movie is Oscar caliber. In this prequel, the writing is often aimed at what appears to be an infantile intellect. The story is utterly predictable, and the characters are flat and uninteresting. As for the subplot about the alien Gazoo character, if you examine his character carefully, one will notice that his presence essentially does NOTHING to advance or contribute to the story. He could easily be written out. Like the first movie, the set design and other special effects show a lot of work was put into them, but with the movie having such a poor screenplay I think even kids will quickly grown impatient with this movie.

I didn't think the movie was that bad. It is flawed in a lot of ways, but there is some fun embedded in the film. I am stuck on whether it is better than the 1994 movie or inferior. If I were to be picky, I would say better in some areas, inferior in others. My main flaws were with the script and some of the plot. The script is weak in places, but has some funny moments, mainly with the little green alien. The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun.

I mean all the kids love it, it's on Cartoon Network all the time and it's a true classic. It's great.The trouble with a franchise like this is that there will be some companies that exploit a craze such as this and find ways to sneak you out of your money and rip you off. One such example is Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas.It's released in the summer of 2000, and it's a terrible film. It's tacky, lacking in plot, miscast & just truly awful. Now I know that bad films like this are released all the time and that's nothing new. However what's so special about the Flintstones VRR more than anything else is that upon it's release over here, it cost £20.That's right folks. Us punters in the UK had to fork out 20 notes for this prehistoric guff. Now here's the worrying part. A lot of Flintstones fans just looked at the box and said Wow! Flintstones movie! And they bought it and obviously they regretted it soon enough. So I now am going to show you how to have an infinitely better Flintstones experience.1) The Flintstones series on video If you are a Flintstones fan you probably already own one, but if you want to give it a rent now, it is priced about £150 tops.2) Fred Costume You can pick these up in just about any car boot sale for about less than a fiver.3) Action Figures There's plenty of them about, and they cost not even £350 in Toys R Us store.So what does that bring us up to? £10 max. For £10, you have all of these three things, and you're having a great Flintstones time. But for £20, you're having an awful time with VRR.I think I've made my point clear enough.Don't Watch This Film.

It could be the most expensive Hollywood movie without stars. It looks so-innocent-it's-so-80s. And it's a cult classic for anyone wants to study the bad decisions of big studios' executives! I love it. Save (The green alien) plus seeing (Mark Addy) and (Stephen Baldwin) in girly dresses it's nice. Not indigestible like (Bad Boys 2). Not unfunny like (Pirates of the Caribbean2). Not filthy like (American Pie). And not eye-exhausting (like the new Star Wars movies). But even if you loved it you've got to notice 2 things. The stars of the movie aren't stars. And the budget is big.. just strangely big. In fact the jest of live Flintstones came to a point where it had been taken seriously, REAL seriously. I believe the mentality of Hollywood has never been bolder to put all of these millions in a family, no stars, movie. Well,.. I said bolder, not dumber!The costumes, the sets and the extras were all overblown. Many backgrounds were made without any CGI ; true that seems now as an attractive point apart, but I bet that demanded a whole lot of money back then. The bad irony of this movie is that after the first one the cast got smaller and everything else got bigger!Over and above, (Harvey Korman) was out of his gloss. (Baldwin) looked suitable as goofy but not too memorable. (Alex Meneses) is nothing compared to her antecedent (Halle Berry). (Joan Collins) well, I have never known anything good about her (to be fair  a photo of her on the beach while she was in her early twenties, and that's it!). The leads did their best to be enjoyable, being the cornerstone of the movie's cuteness. But to spend this amount of money on them is so unwise move; especially when they looked like shadows for the first hit's cast. Let alone being in a prequel for it ?? (Have you ever heard about a hit prequel ?!). Sometimes I think that it was mainly intended for the first one's stars, and then it got a last minute change. And other times I think that the sets were intended to be part of the studio's tour whether the project hit it high or flopped. Whatever the case may be, this movie wronged its cast; they seemed so tiny in it. Generally, this is fun time for sure. But why I feel every time I watch it that all of this money was worth spending somewhere else ?! "}]
