True, the Buddha parts are simplistic, but then so is the original Buddha story.  Slow, thoughtful, peaceful, subtly stimulating, and with a plot to end all plots-- the one-ness of all individuality. I much prefer this to the more recent Kundun, which tries to tell essentially the same story.

It shows much, tells some, and demands of the viewer some thought. This is not something always appreciated by the viewer. The key to understanding this movie, I believe, is not the search for the reincarnation of an important Buddhist teacher, nor is it the life of the Buddha up to the time he achieves enlightenment, but the way a child, or children, and an old man, come to understand together something of the connections that may exist between themselves. We don't see through a character's eyes, we watch the effects of the characters on each other. In particular, Jesse, the 9 year old American who may or may not be the reincarnation, holds our attention because we watch him absorb the lessons that are being taught, and as he learns them, he grows in ways we can expect a 9 year old to grow. We also watch his father, whose character becomes more sympathetic as the movie progresses, who has even further to grow than his son, because he has already learned too much.The movie is also beautiful to watch. The cinematography, the editing and the direction combine to provide just the right dramatic tension to a movie whose pacing is deceptive, in that it seems slow, but is not. The ultimate result is that a viewer who allows it, will find him or herself transported for a little while, to unexpected places.

One major problem though was Keanu Reeves. They are also other glaring and not so glaring problems with this movie.The acting was adequate throughout except for of course Keanu Reeves. He was not the only one I was not happy with though. Bridget Fonda did not exactly show off anything special either. She was just there nothing great, nothing to horrible just there. Why does she continue to get roles? Is it her name? Her looks? Her acting ability? That is pretty easy its her name. The only thing does she does share with Henry Fonda, Peter Fonda and Jane Fonda is their name definitely not her acting ability.Then of course there is Keanu Reeves. It is really hard to think of a worse casting move than the casting of Keanu Reeves as Buddha. For action roles or even comedy I do not mind him but for serious roles he is about as bad as you could get. His performance at the beginning I do not have a problem with because Buddha is not yet Buddha he is even less than a narrow minded person. At or towards the end though he is supposed to portray Buddha with depth and meaning, not with superficiality and narrow mindedness. That though is exactly what he does though, he stays an idiot from start to finish. As the movie progresses so does the character of Buddha but not the performance of Keanu. In here he appeared about as selfish and superficial as Buddha was selfless and deep.The directing should be great, after all Bernardo Bertolucci is directing this. Well at times it was spectacular but it was not consistent. Some of the scenes, especially toward the end were great, the sceneries of the Buddhist temples and ceremonies and one particular conversation involving a monk were amazing. It was like watching the Last Emperor again. Then the scenes with Buddha were just horrible and annoying. That part of the story did not seem to get anywhere, they just seemed to go on and on. That is what should have succeeded not failed especially Bertolucci being the director. That is where Bertolucci failed and failed miserably.The cinematography was amazing at times as mentioned before. Certain scenes were done very stylistically and well. It did provide some sort of educational importance which is the one thing I was really with this movie. The editing was also pretty bad, it was one of the reasons why some of those scenes felt like forever to get by and why whenever the story was just becoming engaging it had to jump right back to the story of Buddha. The writing was pretty bad but not completely horrible.. The one scene with the monk was great in terms of writing but other than that nothing really memorable. The way the Buddha story was written really made me determine this was a bad script and brought down most of the movie.This movie should have and could have done better but it did not. Cinematographically wise and directing wise some scenes were down right spectacular and other with Keanu Reeves were just down right horrible. Yet the cinematography was just too amazing even in the story of Buddha that I have to say that this an above average movie. It is a good family movie and a little educational but if you want to watch this alone I would not really recommend it. Very easy on the eyes but just a little to easy on the mind.

I wish we could clarify the symbolism... make it clear what Buddhism, at least of the Western and Zen varieties, deems as fact, what bits are symbolism for something internal, and reject the mysticism which evolved after the initial fall of Buddhism...then make a new movie around that one scene.

In Little Buddha, Bertolucci attempted to tell the story of Siddhartha, Buddha himself, but somehow I felt it was a bit too little, as this film also told a separate story about a reincarnated Lama.Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak star as the Conrad couple Lisa and Dean, whose son Jesse is believed to be a reincarnation of a Lama from Bhutan. This led to a visit by the Lama's disciple Lama Norbu, who introduces Buddhism to the Conrad family. However, he's not sure if Jesse is the one, but indications have made the case strong. The tale takes all of them back to Bhutan where they meet up with another 2 potential candidates, and contemplate just who was the actual reincarnate.At the same time, the story of the origins of Buddha is weaved into the narrative, which was what appealed to me when watching this movie. I am not an expert in Bhuddist studies, but I felt that the story was well told, and the cinematography for this segment, just wondrously majestic. I believe many at that time balked at Bertolucci when he casted Keanu Reeves in the role of Siddhartha, as he was better known for his surfer dude image. But I thought Reeves did credibly well, and suffered for his art in making a credible Prince, though some would cringe at this attempt to speak with an accent.Buddhism doesn't get shoved down your throat, so for those who are staunch in their respective religions, no worries, this movie doesn't attempt to be preachy. It makes interesting the journey to Nirvana and Enlightenment, through the Middle Way, and I would say it would make interesting general knowledge (I am not vouching on the accuracy as I can't) in which to build upon.Perhaps what I felt was a let down was the other major segment on the search for the Lama reincarnate, as there were minor sub-plots which got introduced but not further developed. I would be more interested to learn about Siddhartha's path to Nirvana in more detail through film, but probably that's another story for another filmmaker to make. "},{"Title":"Watch it!

The parallels between the boy's journey and the story of Buddha are amazing.Here's a few to check out...When Lama Norbu asks Jesse's father to come to Bhutan, he reacts by getting very angry and controlling, just as the Buddha's father reacts when told his son could be the greatest teacher in the world.When the Buddha decides to leave his village in order to understand suffering, the entire world is dreaming. Everyone in his village is sleeping under some strange mist. When Jesse leaves Seattle, everyone on the airplane is sleeping in very much the same way.When the Buddha learns about death he finds out that the person's ashes are given to the river in a bowl. The image is of a bowl that is washed away downstream. When Jesse's father finds out about his friend's death, he pulls over and walks outside to see the cars on the highway, the cars moving just as the bowl on the river.Those are just a few of the MANY parallels between the story of the Buddha and Jesse. It's interesting to watch for them because each one makes a great point. Also, watch for the use of color in the shots to let you know where the wisdom will be coming from. Many shots are dark (with the use of blue and red) but when a character begins to let go of him/herself you'll notice a much brighter light around the person's face or even a total clarity of the entire shot itself.There are many other things to watch for that could easily be missed too, such as Jesse's father building these beautiful buildings, but each one is always empty.On first glance, this movie does seem simplistic because it is told in a way that a child can understand. Look a little deeper though and you'll see that it carries much more than meets the eye.

I have to say the screenwriters were pretty poor on this film and Bernardo did the best he could with some interesting camera angles but the script he was given was horrible. With out a doubt in my opinion the worst performance of Keanus career, I would say if you can look past the modern day story and just specifically look on the life of Buddha and get past the bad script and acting then you might actually enjoy it but ultimately for me i did not.

That's outrageous! Worst movie ever! That's the problem with many of the comments and some of the reviews of this film here on IMDb. Some of our viewers went to see a Keanu Reeves movie because he was hot. And I guess he was in his own way. But when you think about it, this was not a KR movie. It was an ensemble film. KR wasn't on-screen even half of the time.People do like to hit on Keanu Reeves. And, while I doubt many would say he was ever the world's finest actor, with $3,599,064,053 worldwide aggregate box office (rank #31), he must have been doing something right. I look at some of the criticisms here and just laugh. For example, the accent was wrong. Even though I'm Buddhist and traveled fairly extensively in parts of Asia, I've never actually met a person from Nepal, so I have no idea whether his accent was appropriate or not, particularly since there would be NO APPROPRIATE ACCENT that we could fathom from 2,500 years ago. Let's see, how many people from Siddhartha's village spoke English 2,500 years ago????? Reeves did nicely here, and I quite admire how he emaciated himself to be able to portray the fasting Buddha.If one wants to criticize some acting here, I suggest targeting in on Chris Isaak, who turns in a stunningly bad performance. I don't know how he has done in acting since, but this was pitiful. Stiff. Unnatural. He didn't even move realistically.Another of the criticisms of this film is that, in terms of Buddhism, it is not very realistic. Really? Is that why 3 actual Tibetan incarnate lamas have significant roles in the film? Some people say that American boy is not realistic. I don't know about that. As a teacher/school administrator, I've met plenty of precocious children, and this performance seems rather realistic. After all, he isn't meant to be the average all-American boy; he's supposed to be different.Ying Ruocheng is superb as the main lama in the film. And Sogyal Rinpoche's performance was charming, and about as realistic as you can get since he is actually a leading Tibetan lama in real life.The performance of the other two children in the film are interesting, particularly the girl with self-importance and self-promotional skills...that surprised me a bit...I wonder if that would be realistic for someone like that to be a reincarnated lama.Special mention should be made of the photography. It is interesting how the cinematographer gave the film a different warmth depending on whether they were in Seattle, or Tibet, or back in Buddha's time. Quite lovely, really. And the sets and special effects helped tell the basic bio of young Buddha's life.Financially, this was a disaster at the box office. Which is what I would expect since it was clearly a niche film with an all too big budget. Casting Keanu Reeves may have been an attempt to cash in on a rising star's box office mojo, and clearly some of our reviewers went to the film to see KR, rather than because of the subject of the film.For me, a lot about this film comes down to how I feel as a Buddhist about non-Buddhist Americans (and others) watching this film. Does it present Buddhism as it really is? Yes and no. I'm a mix of a Theravadan (as in Thai) Buddhist and a philosophical Buddhist, and the film doesn't portray those schools at all (beyond the fable-istic telling of the life of Siddhartha/Buddha; it is a depiction of Vajrayāna Buddhism. My impression is that it depicts Vajrayana Buddhism fairly well, but that gives the impression that Buddhism is based on animism (e.g., the appearance of the seer), and to be honest, there is a lot of animism in Buddhism in the way it is approached in the Old World.Normally, based on only the cinematic aspects of this film, I would give it a 7. However, I'm going to bump it up to a 8 because it has one quality that separates it from typical popular cinema -- it is something different and unique. And not many directors or actors are willing to tackle something that is really different and a potential failure at the box office.

Apparently Bertolucci hated Weinstein because of it, how he took away his director's cut, and what we see today is a compromised edit (whether his full vision will ever be seen again, I have no idea).Then again, how great can a movie be with Keanu Reeves as a Siddhartha? Well - it's not great (that was my previous review of what I thought of the movie way back in the day, when I saw a few scenes on TV). However, taken as a whole, it's actually a much better film than I expected, and is very good *despite* what Weinstein did to the cut, which does appear from seeing the film to have been cut by a good few minutes - maybe for the better, I don't know.All I know is Reeves, who shouldn't have any place in this film, gives an astonishingly moving and even at times soulful performance, all things considered, and Bertolucci and writer Rudy Wurlitzer (of Two-Lane Blacktop!) are very thoughtful about the nature of Buddhism and what the Siddhartha means today. There's context for what this little boy happens upon earlier in the story, and it all gets connected well; any thoughts I had of perhaps, in a silly way, of mocking Reeves' performance went away as soon as I saw what the director and actor did with it.And of course Vittorio Storaro is the man, this along with Bulworth is one of his late masterpieces as a cinematographer. Again, not one of Bertolucci's top masterpieces or whatever, and for kids (this was meant technically as a children's film) it can be a bit mawkish and eh. Yet for what it is, I was absorbed in the way that only a powerful director with a point of view on spirituality and, basically, as an artist can do.

Therefore Little Buddha is like any other biblical epic, from The Ten Commandments to Ben Hur to even Raiders of the Lost Ark, as Bertolucci takes the myth of the world's most popular Buddha and adds special effects on par with those previously mentioned.Behind this backdrop of bowls that float upstream and fiery arrows that turn into flowers before they reach their enlightened target, is a message as true now as it was 2500 years ago, and through the story of three children who are believed to be the reincarnation of a beloved Tibetan Lama, we are reminded of the power of love, compassion and acceptance via the middle way.The truth the universe staples us to the dualities of form and formlessness by sheer power of the mind, is gently brought to realization with gorgeous cinematography and stunning music by Ryuichi Sakamoto. Even Reeves is convincing as the great Siddhartha, and with understated performances from Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak, the parents of one of the children named Jesse played by Alex Wiesendanger, all three are excellent ambassadors to this world of mindfulness and joyful.While the film does get a little long winded at two hours and twenty one minutes, if you stick with it Little Buddha is a feast for the senses. For those with a more critical eye, try to look past the magic and see the film for what it really is, a primer for a more beautiful and healthy way of looking at life.Little Buddha is one of my favorite films. It introduced me to the world of Buddhism at a time I needed it most, and in a world where we are becoming more and more polarized politically, as well as enmeshed in the lives of people from all over the world, the message of the Buddhia is more important than ever, at least in my opinion.Available on Netflix in HD.

Also, I really appreciated the movie because it didn't have those Hollywood stereotypes of a Buddhist monk. Everything was really natural and simple and very easy to understand. Although this movie is somewhat old, I think it still does a good portrayal of the Buddhist culture. People may think that it is outdated, but I think that if one doesn't want to watch a documentary on Buddhism, then they should really watch this movie because along with a great story line of a Buddhist Lama trying to find the reincarnation of his former teacher, it really does give a good background story of Buddhism.

In their search, the monks believe that the reincarnation of Lama Dorje is in Seattle and is a little boy named Jesse. Jesse is interested in Buddhism, although, does not know much about it. After being hesitant at first when Lama Norbu asks Jesse to return to Bhutan with him, Jesse's father takes Jesse to Bhutan and Nepal. Once there, Jesse meets the other candidates of Lama Norbu's reincarnation, Gita and Raju. Throughout this journey Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism's history and practices with the book Little Buddha.After watching this movie, I learned how seriously monks take reincarnation. Even though Jesse is an outsider of the Buddhist religion, the monks still go through great lengths to find the reincarnation of Lama Norbu and teach Jesse about Buddhism. I also learned that a reincarnation could be broken up into multiple people. In the end, when we figure out that all three of the candidates make up Lama Dorje, we find out that Raju is the body, Gita is speech, and Jesse is his mind. These three aspects of Lama Dorje are also large aspects in Buddhism. I really enjoyed this movie, and could not find any major imperfections. I enjoyed how the movie showed the storybook, Little Buddha, with Siddhartha's life and Jesse's journey. One thing I would have added is more of an ending of what the children decide to do after finding out they make up Lama Dorje, however, chances are all the children wouldn't stay in Bhutan and it is probably better left hanging then having it be a pointless journey.Overall, I think this movie does a good job teaching the viewers about Buddhism, all while bringing the viewers through Jesse's journey. This movie provides a great opportunity for western audiences to learn about Buddhism. Instead of telling you about Siddhartha, this movie shows you who he was and what he did. Not to mention this movie also has a great story line about a boy's journey with Buddhism and Asian cultures.

In fact, from what I read about Keanu Reeves, the person, it is my understanding that he is a lot like this character polite, soft spoken, sensitive, generous, and highly intelligent, all attributes of an enlightened person. And for those who criticize the acting of Bridget Fonda, having watched most if not all her films, it occurs to me that Ms. Fonda has her own style of acting, which is very understated and natural. She is usually cast in roles that don't showcase her talents, but if anybody ever doubts her abilities, or her versatility, they should watch a film she made where she played an assassin, or an abused wife. In this film, she played a little boy's mother very believably. I do agree Chris Isaak was miscast as her husband. For one thing, Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak strongly resemble one another and could easily be brother and sister.

The film is an extremely emotional film about the great spirituality Buddhism is. But it remains rather folkloric about Buddha's life and the middle way is an English translation that does not mean what the original words meant. Today in English it means the refusal to choose either one way or another and the fact that we are lacking the courage we need to face and assume both life and death because life is great and death is just as great, and life is bad and death is just as bad. Life leads to death through decay and pain. But life is also the promise of rebirth through karma and death. Death is bad because it is the result of decay and pain. But death is good too because it is the door to rebirth through karma and death itself. That's what the middle way means, not neither nor, but both one and the other. There is some attachment, tanha in Pali, that has to be severed, to the middle way seen as an in-between and a non-commitment. You have to accept both sides of nature, the universe, existence, the beginning birth, the growing and decaying life, the ending death, and then if you believe in it the beyond of a new beginning in rebirth. The film is also by far too Tibetan. I am for the little chariot, the southern Asian Buddhism, not for the northern Asian Buddhism, and particularly not for Tibetan Buddhism. This last variety has replaced the non-commitment of Buddha to the existence of God, to the existence of a soul in man, a divine presence in that soul, and his commitment to the absolute absence of any permanence with a fetishized eternal not life but survival from one life to another. In other words nirvana does not exist anymore since for Buddha nirvana is the possibility to step out of the cycle birth-life-death-rebirth and the possibility to merge with the vast principle of universal existence. Nirvana has been emptied of its meaning and replaced by some kind of sainthood that peregrinates from one being to another. What's more the film insists too much on the rites and not on the social dimension of Buddhism. And this shows a social dimension that I had not found in the Buddhist temple I have visited and worked for. They do not teach to monks only but they have a teaching mission for everyone. They do not take care of the health of monks only but they heal and cure everyone. They do not help the members of the monastic community only, closed onto themselves as they appeared to be, but they help everyone in the community at large of which they are full members. In other words this film does not really give an image of the deep spirituality of Buddhism, the search not for one self because the self cannot exist since it is impermanent like anything else, but for the light that is hidden in the very middle of things. That's the best part of Buddhism, the meditation that enables you, through a slow and long learning process in which you have to be both guided and free, to dominate your feelings, your passions, your sentiments, your cravings too, without rejecting anything but by finding the just equilibrium that will enable you to enjoy beauty as much as not to be the slave of that beauty, for one example. Yes a Buddhist can enjoy music or flowers but a Buddhist will not become attached to these and forget that he has many responsibilities to himself, to his direct community, family or other, to the social community beyond and even to the world and the universe. The Buddhists I know are able to love other people and to feel and express deep feelings and yet to remain detached enough to be able to help the friend they love with the distantiation they and he or she need to find pleasure and control pain. That is the middle way too enjoy the pleasure that will not bring pain and control the pain that may destroy the pleasure. To control does not mean to get rid of because it is impossible, to be indifferent because it is uncompassionate, inhuman, but to keep within some limits that will enable you to remain the main agent of your own life in symbiosis with those of your living companions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne "},{"Title":"What the Movie is really about!","Date":"5 May 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Little Buddha is the only popular western movie which addresses the story of the Buddha.

Bertolucci does it again with brilliant storytelling, excellent cinematography(from Vittorio Storaro) and the embracing poetic nature of his films. This movie is about a group of Tibetan monks who travel across the world in their search for the new little prince(which is what Buddha was before he became the enlightened one and is played by Keanu Reaves in flashbacks). Part of the journey that this film focuses more closely on takes them to Seattle, Washington to reveal information to a young couple(played by Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak) about their son being one of the candidates. The boy is given a book that details the story of Buddha and we the audience are then brought into that world as it's told to the child. The parents come along for the ride and have their own spiritual awakenings as their child is brought thru this journey. The acting isn't always the best(especially from Isaak) but the real star here is Bertolucci and his direction which overshadows the shortcomings of the acting. Bertolucci loves to bring the movie-going public to new places, meeting new people and letting them participate in their life adventure and he has done this very well again with this film. After viewing the movie, if you don't come away with a new appreciation for life in general and a better understanding of the Buddhist religion, you have definitely not been paying attention.

After years and years of searching, Lama Norbu arrived at the Konrad household and informed Lisa Konrad, that Jesse, her 7 years old son, may be the reincarnation of Lama Dorje. At first, Jesse's parents were although interested by the idea and respectful especially Dean who sees about Lama Dorje's religion, they were quite doubtful, but after the death of Dean's close friend, Evan, everything changed, their way of seeing things changed and of course their view on Buddhism changed as well. Believing that reincarnation is actually possible gave them a sense of hope and helped them recover from their loss. There was another storyline about the story with a retelling of the life of Prince Siddhartha, who grew up to become the Buddha. Based on the Buddhist faith, little Buddha is a blend of the Eastern and Western culture. It contrasts the difference in the lifestyle and belief of the East and West. Yet it also brings the 2 sides of the world together in some way. Bertolucci brought color to Buddhism, which can often be a bland topic to make a movie about by telling it in a modern society while hatching the origin, traditions and the 'informational' parts of Buddhism in the film. By doing so, Bertolucci brought the viewers a good amount of information while not losing their attention like many other movies on this topic does. Little Buddha has elements of liberation within it, transforming and relating Buddhism to each and every one of us and our modern world without losing the essence of Buddhism and introducing the audience to the fundamental core for example the idea of reincarnation and the origin of Buddhism.However, some parts of the film did seem a little superficial at times, some parts of the film simply was not very articulate. For example they way they located the Konrad family. In the movie, Lama Norbu's student dreamed that Lama Dorje led him to the Konrad house, which is somewhat of an absurd reason to believe that Jesse is the reincarnation of Lama Dorje. Over all, I liked the movie, despite the fact that I found some parts a little bizarre, I would give it a 8 out of 10. It opened up a new horizon for me in terms of my knowledge and thinking on Buddhism, so if you would like to learn more about Buddhism but would also like it to relate to our modern life, the movie 'little Buddha' is a great choice.

His acting is literally laughable (he was actually nominated for a golden raspberry for worst new star) and his co-star Bridget Fonda isn't much better either. Talk about wooden acting... they might as well just be holding the script and talking into the camera, in fact that would be an improvement. Next up is Keanu Reeves, who was obviously cast purely for his star power, playing the Indian Prince Siddharta who was to become the Buddha. There's plenty of hammy acting on display but at least he made an effort. The other actors were actually not bad, but it wan't enough to save this wreck.Next up, the cinematography. It's not terrible, but it's certainly not as 'beautiful' as some reviewers wrote. Some of the sets were pretty well done, there were some nice enough locations and the bits of CGI (creepy talking baby, creepy giant snake and super-fake apocalypse storm thing) while very dated now, were probably OK for the time, but it's really nothing special, just Hollywood standard.Now we come to the story, or stories, as there are two parallel story lines mixed together. The first is about some Tibetan Monks trying to find the reincarnation of their old master and woven into this is the story of Siddharta and his journey to enlightenment. The problem is that the first story has very little going on plot-wise, while the second story had to be way over-simplified for it to fit into under half a film. It just doesn't really work. Plus of course this film is pretty much a propaganda piece for Tibetan Buddhism and isn't shy about it either. Something tells me this film never had a debut in Mainland China...To top it all off there are all the WTF moments that constantly came up. Like why do the opening scenes where the monks meet the parents come off like a creepy horror movie, complete with tense music? Why does the Father have absolutely no problem when his son runs off and gets lost in the back-streets of Bhutan? He's just chilling in a café! Why did they randomly insert stock time-lapse footage of clouds as the view when the boy looks out the plane window? At first I thought it was supposed to be a dream, but nope, just the view apparently. There are just so many things that take you out of the film completely, it's ridiculous.To sum it up, this is a big-budget balls-up.

The notion of reincarnation is further elaborated by the concept of split rebirths, where one body embodies the mind, other embodies the body, and the last embodies speech. The origin story of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha, is told through a storybook towards characters that had close to no knowledge on Buddhism. This method allows audiences, who themselves have might have no knowledge of Buddhism, obtain an understanding of the concepts stated in the film. The characters do a great job of asking questions that audiences might want to know, the concept of reincarnation for example.This film allowed me to gain a better understanding of the concept of reincarnation and the many different forms that it can take (singular or multiple).

I like Bertolucci, most of the time, sometimes I like Keanu  Reeves and Bridget Fonda.  I am interested in Tibet and Buddhism and India and more  Eastern ways of thought and living.  So why did I loathe this movie?  Loathe is probably  too strong a word because there are good reasons for Bertolucci having decided to make  a movie on this subject and it's good that the basic tenants of Tibetan Buddhist (it's  Lamaism but I won't quibble) are exposed to a greater world, albeit in Readers' Digest  format, Buddhism 101.  That's all fine and I expect many people who weren't previously  initiated into the Buddhist explanation for The Whole Thing actually sat and thought  about this movie afterwards, not something that happens much these days in big budget  flicks, especially from Hollywood.But that's about all 'Little Buddha' is, a big budget new age flick.  Bertolucci seems more  and more to be the new Cecil B. De Mille with his huge epics and seemingly bottomless production budget barrel.I was irritated from almost the first minute of this movie.  By the end of it I was at the  end of all patience.  It is the smugness and the vapidity of the script in part, both  attributes embodied in the person of Chris Isaak, an empty vessel of an actor.  He looks  interesting but has absolutely no screen persona at all.  I wonder why Bertolucci cast  him?  Perhaps he wanted an empty vessel for the Seattle kid's father, in which case  Bertolucci is a genius of casting perspicacity.  Bridget Fonda is equally devoid of  character and interest. Their child, in the running for the role of the missing dead lama, is entirely uninteresting  and I would think that a holy Tibetan lama would want to be more multi-faceted than  that kid, and what guru in his right mind would choose to live in Seattle, but then there  are all those fat, tasty slugs to eat there.This movie is a fat, tasty slug of its kind.  The location shots, if that's what they were,  look fake, which I'd think would be a fairly hard thing to do photographing in India. It's that Bertolucci Technicolor Touch gone mad.  All sepia sunsets and glistening golden  flakes in the air and one of those deadly musical scores that wants to waft you into a  trance of bliss and only succeeds in giving one a head-ache.  The Indian music is  interesting and there isn't enough of it.  The locations in Bhutan are very interesting with  the Potala-esque monasteries and the chorten temples, but those scenes smack of an  old National Geographic Special they used to show on television.In fact this whole movie is nothing but Junior High School World Events stuff with one  very famous sex-symbol portraying one of the great Adepts that has appeared in the  world.  Keanu Reeves is okay.  He looks good and enunciates his words clearly, like some  Sunday school cartoon character, and has that deer in the headlights look befitting an  innocent prince in a fit of wonder and idealistic daydreams.  But once Siddhartha leaves  the palace Reeves practically disappears from the movie.  Only a few single lines are left  to him and an extra in fright wig is apparently brought in to portray the Buddha in his  emaciated condition after embarking down the wrong path... of anorexia I suppose.   That's about as deep as this movie seemed to me.All the non-American performers were far superior to the stars.  At least the Bhutanese  and Tibetan people were played with a natural flare and warmth, completely missing  from the Conway family from Seattle.  'Little Buddha' is a good movie to show 8th graders.  There is no violence, sex, foul  language or substance to it, the kids'll love it.  It bored the daylights out of me.Stay away from this phony-baloney Bertolucci travelogue.

In retrospect, the money could have been spent better.The Buddhist faith has always seemed to inspire faith-seeking westerners; after all the Dalai Lama seems an amiable chap, Richard Gere has done his share in promotion-work and, let's be honest here the religion has inspired far less war, genocide and general mayhem than other so-called world-religions. However, I cannot imagine many Buddhists being very happy with having Bertolluci turn their faith into a fairy-tale for jaded Westerners. What would Hindus have thought, had James Cameron turned the Bhagadvad Gita into a 3D action flick? Bertolluci is a very good director, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, he's also a director who takes himself a little too serious at times. Rather than relying on his talent, he tends to ham it up for the greater effect. Why rely on the story and the actors, if you could simply add a more impressive sound and extra color, is the question that Betolluci must have asked himself as he was filming. In essence, that's the difference between good directors like Bertolluci and Coppola, and brilliant directors like Werner Herzog.Now, having mentioned the word ham, we must now speak of protagonist Keanu Reeves. If the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation are correct, chances are good that Keanu Reeves will be reborn as a ham-sandwich. I clearly recall how the entire cinema broke out in laughter, when Reeves opened his mouth for the first time in Bram Stokers Dracula, trying to imitate an English accent. When Reeves tried his good luck at an Indian accent, nobody in the cinema was laughing, presumably out of embarrassment. Just my neighbor mumbled the famous Peter Sellers line Birdy num-num, summing up all that must be said about Reeves performance (and almost causing me to soil my pants). By the end of the film I was thinking about the Islamic creed, which prohibits their prophet from being depicted or heard on any medium.Little Buddha would have greatly benefited from a similar policy.3/10 points because it pains me to give a good director like Bertolluci any less (even though, in the case of Little Buddha, he would probably have deserved it). Plus, we probably have to thank Bertolluci for making this film before M. Night Shyamalan could get his hands on it (casting himself in the leading role, naturally).

There's certainly an interesting contrast between the modern world of Seattle (where one of the children lives), and the ancient world that Siddhartha inhabited. For me though, the most interesting scene was when Siddhartha got enraged and saw the armies marching towards him (I think that that was what happened; it was a little unclear).I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie would have been a little better had there been more focus on Siddhartha; the whole thing about him getting reincarnated made it kinda hard for me to determine what to really make of the movie. But either way, this is a pretty imaginative movie with very impressive cinematography. I've never seen any of Bernardo Bertolucci's other movies, but if this is any indication, his others must be worth seeing.

The Buddha's teachings are largely lacking, replaced instead by the cultish deification and worship of the Buddha as a person/idol. Much of the narrative in this story connects with the depiction of Jesus in Greatest Story Ever Told, including temptations, wilderness periods, and miracles, perhaps to make Buddhism appear like another form of Christianity. Oddly, the modern Western world is cast in a deathly bluish-gray tint, while the world of Buddhism is depicted with fuller reds & yellows.

Don't get me wrong, the movie is not good or anything, but the cinematography and music are too good to be called a disaster. Plus, it's the story of Buddha himself - how bad can that be, even in such an abbreviated form?The only thing that makes the movie remotely watchable is the presence of real Tibetan monks in key roles. That and the sweeping shots of India and Bhutan.Of course, the great cinematography tries to hide a completely ill-advised script. It starts with a good idea - could an American child be the reincarnation of a key Tibetan monk? But the movie then really doesn't know what to do with itself. Is it the Greatest Story Every Told for Buddhism (Tibetan in particular)? Or is it a morality play, e.g., what would you do if two monks swept in out of nowhere and said your child was the reincarnation of a great Buddhist teacher?It would have best if the director stuck with one or the other. As a result, you get this sort of mess, where you get scenes like the child narrating the scene of Buddha's birth. The child actor reading the part clearly has no sense of what he's reading (nor would you want him to -- about the details about how the Prince's mother had to go into the woods to birth him). As a result, we disconnect. It can't be taken seriously.And, Keanu. The inarticulate surfer-dude himself as a divine figure. It's not the worst bit of miscasting in the history of cinema, but it's awful close. Making matters worse, he's frequently in the presence of real Indian actors, which only serve to make you even more aware of his inauthenticity. Seeing him butcher an Indian accent is just pure pain to watch -- curiously, since you'd think the 'goof factor' of seeing him do that would provide moments of inadvertent humor. But he's supposed to be delivering important lines. The only reason I can think of casting him in this role is during one scene in the movie, where he's in a deep trance, shutting out the visions of the daughters of the devil sent to tempt him from finding enlightenment. Yes, that vacant stare into space, his mind free of thoughts. That must have been why he was cast.It's not like casting dopey Bridget Fonda as the boy's mother and casting the monosyllabic Chris Issak as the boy's father were really bright ideas either. But it's truly hard to make a judgment on their acting ability because the script has given them nothing to do. You have this vague sense that Fonda has some undetermined career and Issak is an architect of some sort, and the kid - who in Seattle is never seen with any friends - is their son. And that's it. The characters are not developed anywhere beyond that.The kid, basically, doesn't act like any kid I have ever met. His only focus in life, and in this movie, is to read the story of Buddha with rapturous fascination. The parents, basically, don't act like any parents I've ever met. Send the kid off to Bhutan? Raise the questions about taking the kid out of school, going to a foreign country? Sure, why the heck not? It's a movie, right? Not my real son?Finally. Couldn't the director have put any humor in the movie at all? Just anything to alleviate the ponderous nature of so much of the film. He tries to do show some humor with kids playing together, with some success, but such moments are few and far between. Show the poor kid with some friends in his hometown.
