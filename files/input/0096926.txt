In general, I found the bimbo-actress subplot poorly done, and this was the slowest part of the movie. The other characters were done well, with an outstanding cameo by Martin Short as the aspiring director's agent -- the three scenes with Short would make the movie worthwhile by themselves in my opinion. J. T. Walsh was very good as well, as the fatuous studio head, and the gag at the end where the young director's career is revived was very enjoyable.It's not as good as The Player or Get Shorty, but if you like movies about making movies, you will probably like this one.

Nick Chapman, a young man from Ohio, is trying his hand at directing. We meet him as he is going to an award ceremony at an event where the best new short film directors are competing for a prize and a chance to make it in the business. Nick is not prepared for what happens after his film becomes the talk of the town.Nick Chapman is in a relationship with Susan, an architect just starting her career. His good friend is Emmet Sumner, a cinematographer struggling to make it in the industry. Nick is being courted to sign in with different people so he can go to his next project. He has written a screenplay for a film that he wants to direct. Never, in his wildest dreams, he never imagined the strange world he is getting into, and the weird people he will have to deal with while getting his picture produced! For starters, Nick's agent, Neil Sussman, whom we meet during a luncheon at one of those trendy restaurants, is a creature from another planet.The next person Nick gets involved with is Allen Habel, a producer that sees potential in Chapman. As Nick pitches the film, Allen is already changing the way he feels will attract viewers, which has nothing to do with the original concept. Allen wants to set the picture on a beach, not in a cabin in the woods, while it is snowing, as Nick has conceived it. To make matters worse, Allen invites the young man to a party at his house that turns out to be a disaster as Nick gets to meet the film capital's fauna and flora, and ends up losing Susan.Nick gets dazzled at first, but when Allen Habel's business goes bad, he is left on his own. Added to all that, he doesn't have any money, so he has to look for any kind of job in order to survive. All his big shot friends drop him like a hot potato. No one will take his calls. Nick having broke with Susan and having betrayed Emmet, finds himself alone in the middle of all that phony world, until he meets a rock band and he makes a video of a song that becomes a hit. It is at this point Nick gets his creative powers back and as we leave him, he is directing his picture the way he wanted.Christopher Guest, a witty genius in his own right, directed this movie, his first full length film. The Big Picture shows a great talented director that knows well that strange world of glitter and heartaches that is Hollywood. Christopher Guest has been involved in the movie industry for most of his life and it shows.Kevin Bacon is an asset in any picture where he appears. His take on Nick Chapman is dead on. Mr. Bacon is an excellent actor, as he shows here. It is unfortunate Martin Short, who steals every scene he is in didn't get credit for being in the film. His agent must be a composite on the many characters the director, and him, must have met, at one time, or another.Christopher Guest has a group of actors that are featured in his films. Michael McKean and Mr. Guest have a long history of collaboration. The late J.T. Walsh gives one of his best performances as Allen Habel. The rest of the ensemble cast is also notable, Teri Hatcher, Fran Dresher, and a goofy Jennifer Jason Leigh, among others.Never having seen this film, we were lucky to catch it recently and it was worth the wait.

Kevin Bacon is established as one of the best American actors (also, one of the greats who've never been nominated for an Oscar!). Teri Hatcher is the star of a huge television hit. Christopher Guest still makes brilliant films and gives his actors more freedom than almost any other director today. And my affection for The Big Picture only grows fonder as the time passes.In Rolling Stone magazine's 1989 Hot Issue, then newcomer Steven Soderbergh was profiled as that season's hot new filmmaker. One remark was about how students in LA based film schools have their works shown at big events, attended by many hot shots in the entertainment industry. Meaning, a young woman or man could have a bomb of sorts on their hands before even turning professional! Not the most nurturing environment for youthful talent.Bacon's Nick Chapman gets the full treatment as a guy on the fast track after winning his school's big prize for his project. And things don't go wonderfully well after he starts meeting the movers and shakers in his new world. The late, great J.T. Walsh is a studio head (for the time being) who seduces Chapman into believing all his dreams are possible. Michael McKean is Chapman's friend, a cinematographer who isn't necessarily the first choice to shoot his debut. And John Cleese, Martin Short and Jennifer Jason Leigh have great turns as Chapman's different associates that can't really stop the grimly funny runaway train he's on until his self respect finally returns and he sees everything for what it really is.Most films about film-making are not that good. This is a major exception to that rule. Very bitter, but also very sweet. Just like life!

It's a testimony too about surrendering to this foundation in return for losing the innocent self, its dreams, and friends as well. At one dark point the lead becomes as hungry, and so cold, as his producer. Not Hollywood, but all the big foundations can make you like this, turning you into a machine with no special dream. Now the message is exceedingly true. It's about holding on to your innocence. So regardless of how many Coffins From Hell you'll going to make, just don't lose yourself in one. And don't forget the big picture, your big picture, because it's more important than anything. It takes a lot of time and troubles to win the ability of making your dreams true, but then don't forget what were them in the first place. The secret of this movie's power and immortality is being so simple and accurate. No doubts it's some pieces of its maker's experience, and the movie is soft and sweet at delivering them. Let alone being optimistic too, since the lead at the end managed to win a big chance, his friends back, and his self. So according to this movie; dreaming and fulfilling can't be an impossible thing. Otherwise look how it was made without a lesbian sex scene! Despite looking small among other flashy and huge Hollywood moneymakers, this is really a big picture. Here, innocence is that true, defended, and winner. P.S  I'm writing about this movie after 12 years of watching it for the only time I did yet, and without having a paper of previous notices. Tells you a lot about its power and immortality.

I found this one on yesterday.Released in 1989 and probably filmed in 1988, a young 30-ish Kevin Bacon stars as Nick Chapman. His character is probably early 20s, graduating filmmaker and his short film wins a student contest.The thrust of the movie, and its story, is how first, Hollywood gets on the trail of a new young filmmaker, often without even seeing his winning film. And second, after seducing him into working with them to make his new film, they start asking him to change things that will drastically alter his story.Here Nick has a love-triangle story set in the winter, with two men and a woman in a vacation cottage. The first requested change is to make it a man and two women, and the women have an affair, changes that make it a totally different story.Of course Guest is his own guy, a truly independent filmmaker, known for shooting 5X or 10X or more film than is needed, and building a movie in the editing room. So this is his parody on the corporate Hollywood machine, and how a young filmmaker needs to stick to his principles.I found it mildly interesting, it was also fun to see some of today's veteran actors in younger roles.

It seems everybody has 'suggestions' for the novice director, and the clout to cram them down his throat, especially a pervy producer played with slimy grace by J.T.Walsh. The movie begins to mutate out of his control with funny and disturbing results. Finally he finds himself having to fight to regain control of his film and career. Hollywood movies about Hollywood movie making have proved a rather mixed bag over the years, surprising given the supposed intimacy with the subject matter the films' creators theoretically enjoy.

Luckily, this particular addition to the Hollywood-on-Hollywood genre has a fairly authentic ring.

Nick has some good friends and a loving girlfriend and a great idea for a simple movie. He is also very innocent and naive and basically is chewed up by the Hollywood machine and spat out.The movie reveals how the Hollywood dream is not that great, and it is only through luck that Nick actually makes it. In the film there is another guy who did not win a trophy but he seemed to have made it big. Nick believes that he has made it as well, and quickly leaves his old friends for his new ones. It also seems that Alan is prying Nick away from his friends and setting him up with Hollywood friends, such as the actress Gertrude.Suddenly Alan Hale is axed and all of his projects are canceled. Nick finds that he is now untouchable and left in the streets with not money and no friends. He slowly watches how everything is taken away from him and reminded out how big a dream he really had. His former landlord claims that he was a director that was spat out, as if making it harbringer of things to come, and then reminded when he is applying for a job as a waiter, that everybody wants to make it big in Hollywood.It is only fortune, and a bit of vision, that brings Nick back. He runs into an old school college that introduces him to a band that wants to make a video, and he does. At that time he is trying to rebuild his relationships. It is interesting to see how pessimistic Nick is because he is always expecting the worse and getting the best. His ex-girlfriend threw him out yet when he came to her again she welcomed him, and even visited him again. His old Camera-man friend whom he had let down, was still welcoming to him and said, I was always your friend. This contrasted the people he had met at Hollywood, who were his friends when he was big, and dumped him when he had lost it all.This movie is good, and has a fantasy feel to it. The cinematography creates a more dreamlike world, but it is a dream where the good becomes bad and is only restored through some fortuitous move. What this movie shows me though is who one's friends really are. His true friends remained his friends while his Hollywood friends only spoke to him when they wanted something.

It was his first real directorial assignment and it demonstrated that he had plenty of talent and a sharp biting sense of humor. For some reason, however, the film never saw the light of day upon its initial release and it's only now being reconsidered and reappraised after twenty years in the video store basement. The plot revolves around Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon), a recent film school graduate who has won a prestigious award. Hollywood comes calling in the form of major studio producer Allen Habel (a great J.T. Walsh) who has definite ideas about young Chapman's career path and first feature film subject matter, much to the young director's chagrin. All goes well at first and Chapman is soon hyped up as Hollywood's next great film director, and it goes to his head fast than you can say cut. Along the way, Chapman sells out his best friend (Michael McKean) and live-in lover (Emily Longstreth) and practically everyone else. He flips over beautiful Gretchen (Teri Hatcher in goddess mode) but he soon discovers that he's not even in her top ten list. His fall from grace is brutal and fast and his comeuppance is as well-deserved as his subsequent redemption is hard-earned. A succession of menial jobs to help pay his rent brings the luckless Mr. Chapman down to earth quickly. The scenes of poor Nick working as a telemarketer on the late shift are priceless.If there's a problem with The Big Picture, it's that the film varies wildly between seriousness and light comedy (literally from scene to scene) and from reality to fantasy (kind of like Hollywood itself). It certainly hits its marks when revealing the shallowness of the system and the phonies who inhabit the big offices as they make their nonsensical decisions. Unfortunately, there's a lot of insider jokes that many viewers won't understand or merely just shrug off. Martin Short (unbilled) is the best of the supporting cast as Chapman's effeminate and bumbling agent; he couldn't close a deal if it landed in his lap. Other notable actors (John Cleese, June Lockhart, Eddie Albert, to name a few) make cameo appearances and have fun livening up the atmosphere. One point director Guest does makes crystal clear, however. No one in Hollywood has a clue as to what kind of movie will be a hit with the general public. It's always been a guessing game and nothing more. In the end The Big Picture will probably be best remembered as Mr. Guest's first feature film and a prelude for better things to come. For true film buffs, it'll also remind them of the talent of Emily Longstreth. Her sudden disappearance from the film industry has been much-discussed and remains a total mystery.

Kevin Bacon is the aspiring director courted by Tinsel Town royalty (agents and producers) after winning an AFI student film award; he's a talented and honest guy in an industry often unable to recognize either virtue, and it isn't long before he loses himself to the shallow rewards of Hollywood status fast cars, faster women, and so forth.

The best. I walked away happy. I thought about this movie and about how sometimes life doesn't smile on us in the pursuit of art. This film chronicles the downside of the business but  yet, at least in the real world you get a guy with class enough to kiss you off, be cool and send you back your material so youcan send it to another agent. That's class. Movies like this demonize hoillywood but I was lucky to find someone with perfessionalism. i like the nice let downs, this film chronicles the bad ones. A bit stereotypical then again sometiems life is.

Kevin Bacon and Emily Longstreth make an attractive couple, but the characters on the sidelines give the film its juice.  Best is Martin Short as the gushing agent.  He is right on the money and so indicative of Hollywood.

By the time he realizes things aren't as they seem he comes close to losing everything. Entertaining look at a bizarre cast of characters in oddball situations.

He would go on to develop and shamelessly exploit a specific, detailed formula for films about and using irony the `mock' umentary about performance. But along the way, he starts out by making an unintentionally pseudo-ironic film blasting film formulae. This film is a natural for a double feature with `Sullivan's Travels.' In `Travels,' Sturges introduced irony into films, making a film about a film where the boundaries were clear between what was a movie and not in the story, but highly blurred between the two in terms of style and position. It was a suave notion that has been more influential in its way than any other film notion for decades before or since.Now in a reverse irony of sorts, the young guest makes a film that blurs what's film in the story and does nothing at all ironic in terms of style or position. This is completely reverse of what Altman did. His project succeeds and is worth watching Guest's does not. It is instead a collection of skits.Here's a question Guest works with the same actors again and again in his later projects, often filming months of improvised footage that gets snipped down, Hunter Thompson-wise. Why isn't JJ Leigh in this stable? Other than Martin Short who's notedly nervous, she's the only interesting player here, and her `film' is terrific. Compare this to Parker Posey's audition in `Guffman.'Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

No story, no originality, and enough bad insider jokes to make you cry.  Though Bacon and Short will make you laugh a few times that is not enough to save this from sinking into the crowd of every other hollywood movie. I could go on forever with the rest of the problems but I don't want to crash the server. This movie is for DRONES only. "}]
