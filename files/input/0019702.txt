[{"Title":"Creative, Subtle, & Suspenseful","Date":"1 June 2001","Score":"44 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  While remembered as the first sound picture made by Alfred Hitchcock (or anyone else in Britain), there is much more to Blackmail than merely historical interest.  It reveals the director's subtle creativity, with a carefully structured story that also produces some real suspense, with one of Hitchcock's best cameos and an entertaining chase sequence as bonuses.  The movie has a unique feel, as Hitchcock was still using many silent film techniques at the same time that he was experimenting with sound.  Not all of this works perfectly, but it does not detract from the film's many positive features.Alice White (Anny Ondra, voice dubbed by Joan Barry) goes out for the evening with her boyfriend, who is a police detective (John Longden).  When they have a series of minor quarrels, Alice decides to go her own way, and meets an artist friend.  The artist's intentions are obvious, but Alice is innocently unaware.  When he brings her to his studio, there is soon an unpleasant confrontation that sets in motion a turbulent series of events.The story is carefully constructed not just to produce suspense but also to raise interesting questions in the viewer's mind.  Alice feels a terrible sense of guilt and fear over what has happened - communicated to the viewer in a variety of creative ways - but of what is she really guilty?  The behavior of the detective boyfriend is partly well-intentioned, but he certainly is not faultless.  The moral ambiguity is often subtle, because it takes a back seat to the suspense, and it takes a couple of viewings to appreciate all that is going on.There is a particularly nice symmetry to the beginning and ending, pointing to the greater significance of the action in between.  The opening sequence (filmed in silent movie style) shows the detective and his partner dealing with a suspect in a routine way, not caring about him as a person.  In the final scenes, when the detective must help Alice make a final report on everything that has happened, he sees his job in a far different perspective.Blackmail is of the darker type of Hitchcock, like Notorious or Vertigo.  While clearly made in a different era, it has the same kind of depth and craftsmanship that distinguished those later, more well-known masterpieces.

The visual and sound quality is excellent, especially for a 1929 film, and already Hitchcock is using distinctive camera angles to create memorable effects. (Notice the shadowy interior of the Artist's loft, and the way Hitchcock swoops the camera about to convey Alice's disorientation after the murder.) I also love the way Hitchcock depicts the Blackmailer's flight after his climactic confrontation with Alice and the Detective. We never see the Blackmailer at all - the camera remains frozen on the face of the Detective, who reacts to what is going on. At the moment the Blackmailer shatters the window, the Detective lets out a shout, and the camera - as if startled by the commotion - dollies backward. We immediately cut to the busted window, with a posse of lawmen rushing toward it. It's a wonderful device (what other director in 1929 would have approached the scene in this way, I wonder?). The performances in Blackmail are remarkable and eccentric, in the best sense of the word. Donald Calthrop and Cyril Ritchard, playing the disheveled blackmailer and the lecherous artist, etch themselves in your memory. Anny Ondra is fine as Alice, gamely committing herself to the role, even though she was pantomiming lines. Her dazed reactions at the climax of the murder sequence are shocking. She's like a demented robot, yet the behavior rings true for me. Lastly, let me say I admire John Longden's performance most of all. His role as Frank, the detective, is in no sense that of a traditional film hero. He often bullies Alice, turns moody and childish during arguments and is willing to pin murder on an innocent (albeit not very nice) man. Longden realizes all the not very appealing attributes of Frank's behavior (how he sneers when the tables finally turn on Calthrop), but he also makes clear that he loves Alice and is trying to protect her. He is clearly devastated as he talks with Alice in the phone booth and realizes she is indeed guilty. In summary, few of Hitchcock's 1930 British films are on a par with Blackmail.  The depth of its characterizations will remain unmatched until Rebecca a decade later. Reflect on how Blackmail compares - technically - with America's first sound film and you start to see the true measure of Hitchcock's genius. "},{"Title":"Be patient with this 70 year old classic!

Rather than use the newfound medium of sound solely to record the audio, Hitchcock uses sound in an expressionistic, experimental manner.  After Alice kills the artist, common sounds becoming annoying blasts to the skull!  Hitchcock ends the film with a silent (except for music) chase through the British Museum.

In 1929, Alfred Hitchcock was halfway thru production of Blackmail, a silent film, when the studio told him to remake the film at once as a talkie.  He did, and it became the first films to boldly experiment with the art of talking pictures.The plot is so simple, it's almost boring a detective and his girlfriend, Alice, argue during a dinner date and go separate ways.  She goes off with an artist to his loft, where he tries to rape her.  In self defense, she stabs the artist to death.  A local neer-do-well (Donald Calthrop in a fine, sleazy performance!) goes to blackmail her and her cop boyfriend.  The police accidently blame the blackmailer for the murder. After a chase thru the British Museum, the blackmailer falls to his death. The police close the case, and the girl and her boyfriend have to live the feelings of guilt. Blackmail abounds with the Hitchcock touch.  It begins with a silent, detailed study of a typical arrest, letting us know, Scotland Yard is a fearful force not to be messed with.  When Alice leaves the artist's corpse in his loft, the streets are filled with gruesome reminders of the crime. In her eyes, a neon advertisment showing a cocktail shaker becomes a hand holding a dagger, whenever anyone extends a hand in the street, it reminds her of her victim's extended dead hand, and there's the most famous scene from this film a neighbor gabs on and on about the murder, repeating the word knife.  Hitchcock had the entire gabbing reduced to a low mutter except for the oft- repeated word knife, which is made louder. The chase thru the British Museum seems to be an early rehearsal for all the other Hitchcock films where somebody is chased thru a famous landmark. Blackmail is credited as the first British talkie.  It solidified for the then 30 year old Alfred Hitchcock that thrillers were his territory.

A Hitchcock classic!","Date":"10 May 2006","Score":"15 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" It's an art film by todays standards. But it's also classic Hitchcock. Not only does it build suspense, which for a film of this time seems hard to do through the typical camera distance and theatrical acting which this film has plenty of, but still Hitchcock does it and does it well. It begins as a silent film as we watch an arrest take place. This arrest feels out of place because it doesn't tie into the story. But it leads into an atmosphere of conviction and guilt. This is the films opening. The first dialogue scene occurs in a stylized way, by todays standards, as we follow two detectives walking, one Frank Webber, as they joke around. There are many shots where the camera sits, static, displaying a nice composition, as action happens, dialogue and story unfold. And in between these shots are shots of faces reacting, which incites more psychological participation in the viewer, a very Hitchcock device. The characters feelings, uneasiness, a general tension, become more subjective, not just something we figure we are suppose to get. We actually feel it. Actually, I was very surprised to hear Blackmail is from 1929. Sure it has many technical errors, jump cuts, sounds glitches, and lighting changes, overplayed acting, yet all this aside the story progresses very realistically and sadistically on the part of the guilty lead actress and her mate which in the end feels all very current. I figured this film was from the late 30's if not 40's. The film ends with a kind of uneasiness as we are left with two guilty characters, more so the female lead, who we can imagine will have trouble coping with her conscience. And that is the irony, because after all they are free, and convicted of nothing. But in this case free to dwell in their quiet guilt seems a very harsh punishment filled with more suffering than any jail could provide. In all, a great film to see.

Instead, it is a remarkable piece of cinematic history, and still tremendously entertaining after 78 years. The film was partly shot when Hitchcock learned that he would have access to sound equipment. His female lead was a talented German silent picture actress, whose accent was too heavy for sound, so an off-camera reader had to be used, plus a decent amount of expensive film had already been used and had to be integrated into the 'talkie' as well.All considered, the movie is probably the best example of the transition from these two cinematic paradigms that can be found.The silent portion of the film establishes John Longden's character as a hard-nosed young Scotland Yard detective. Anny Ondra plays the lovely young lady who is engaged to him,and who soon becomes the center of our attention. One night after they argue over some petty matters, they part company and Anny meets up with a male artist friend, who, unbeknownst to her, is interested in more than just pleasant conversation. Frank (Longden) spots them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while. The artist coaxes Alice (Ondra) up to his flat, and things take a sinister turn in short order.Over the second half of the film, the plots unfolds, and the emotions and consciences of the protagonists are sorely tried.What immediately blew my mind was what a great silent director Hitchcock was. Shouldn't have been too surprising since Hitchcock has always struck me as a master cinematographer. The first 20 minutes of the film are completely silent,and there are no interruptions from distracting story boards. Nevertheless, through incredible use of lighting, camera work, and evocative acting, you understand everything that is going on clearly, and are drawn straight into the edgy atmosphere so familiar to those who appreciate the work of this great director.The acting is mostly very good. Only Longden sometimes seems to over or under-act his part, and Ondra is really wonderful all the way through. I was not surprised to learn of her lengthy and productive career both before and after this film and will now look for more of her work.It is also interesting to see how the actors adapted so readily to the new medium. Although some have said that the sound portion of this film seemed over-acted because the actors were still clinging to silent film conventions, I really can not agree. Some of the characters (Alice, for example) required very evocative, rather physical performances, and I can't imagine how she could have done better.Highly recommended for the amazing photography, exceptionally professional though very early use of sound, and the typically perfect pace.

I agree with the first part of this remark, but must disagree entirely with the main point. The ambiguity is indeed intentional. Although the heroine is now seemingly free of any legal charge of murder, we know that she is certain to marry her detective boyfriend, who knows of her culpability in the death of the rapist. She will thus be living in a state of perpetual 'blackmail,' married to the one man who can expose her secret at his leisure.Not a very pleasant thought - and this is not a very pleasant film. The whole story, after all, hinges on an implicit assumption - if she had not killed the rapist, and had the rape become known, the society in which she lives would have held her accountable for the rape - the crime for which the victim, rather than the perpetrator, was considered guilty (and still is, unfortunately, in many regions). This is, of course, the real reason she covers up the killing, since (she has good reason to believe) the authorities would not recognize a claim of self-defense against rape, and she would be held doubly responsible - for 'enticing' the man, then killing him for acting out his 'understandable' sexual urges that she 'aroused.'So she remains in a state of unredeemable guilt - guilty of murder, guilty of having been the victim of rape, guilty of having been too beautiful, guilty of loving a man who could at any time betray her - indeed, guilty of being innocent. Guilty, in short - of being a woman.While Hitchcock's film-making savvy is everywhere in evidence, and the pace is fairly swift, this is one of the master's heaviest, darkest, most depressing films. A good film, necessary to see at least once, but very troubling nonetheless.

There are scenes where people are speaking to each other, though no word screens appear, and this viewer was left wondering if the description on the slip cover of my DVD was in error. However, after reading other reviews of the film, it now makes sense that the film was originally commissioned as a silent, but was then given the go ahead as a talkie. Elements of the silent film style abound, and not just in the opening scenes. Prominent are the full screen facial closeups of the principal characters and the wide eyed demureness of leading lady Anny Ondra.Ondra portrays Alice White, daughter of a shopkeeper and keeping company with Detective Frank Webber (John Longden). An admiring artist who's hand written note requests her presence at a local restaurant leaves Alice searching for ways to break off her date with Frank. I was rather amused by Crewe's (Cyril Ritchard) attempt to entice Alice with his etchings; I always thought that was a lame pick up line, and here it's being used in 1929.What begins innocently enough quickly spirals into disaster, as Alice must fend off Crewe's advances, and with a knife at arm's reach her defense causes Crewe's death. Shades of Psycho, the scene is conveyed off screen as an earlier silhouette shows the couple struggling wildly. That's only one of the Hitchcockian conventions used here, there's also the repeated use of a long stairway, it's downward view a precursor to what we'll see again in Vertigo. Getting back to the knife though, perhaps it might have been too shocking for film audiences to accept back then, but after the struggle, Alice clearly displays the weapon, which has no blood on it! Also, she was wearing only a light colored slip, and there was no indication of a struggle or bloodstains to add grimace to the proceedings.Donald Calthrop is convincing as the blackmailing schemer Tracy, whose bold plan is to extort both Alice and Frank who has been put on the case. The detective already knows who the killer is, his conflicted willingness to help Alice receives an unwitting boost when Tracy is fingered as a possible suspect in the artist's death. Taken into custody by Scotland Yard, one has to do a double take when the police van has to make a stop, and Tracy simply gets out and runs away! He receives his due though, as he meets his end falling through a skylight at the British Museum.Loose ended plot points notwithstanding, I found Blackmail to be an intriguing film and a worthwhile effort from Alfred Hitchcock. It's not well known and that's unfortunate, as this early look at his directing style is peppered with elements for which he would later become famous, not the least of which is Hitchcock's own cameo on a train in the early part of the story. It's also educational, for example, I learned that in England, a police lineup is called an Identification Parade!

It was really quite good and although over-rated despite being cited so often (along with Mamoulian's Applause) as a successful example of the transition between the silents and talkies in all the references I've consulted, it still has some distinct good qualities of its own. Annie Ondra is an excellent silent actress and this among several other films proves it. Her accent was very strong, of course, and employing Joan Barry to lip-synch was genial. Francois Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock about working with Ms Ondra were enough to stimulate anyone's appetite to see her (and to hear Joan Barry) at work. The music - at least in the beginning - is excessively burdensome and busy and frankly irritating. However, when the characters finally began dialogue, it calmed down considerably and actually worked out well until the ending. We're seeing a hybrid here a talkie and a part-talkie. When the talking itself finally happens, the characters aren't even facing the camera but are photographed from behind! This is the famous Hitchcock we know and love in the heat of action. The view of the staircase is very Hitchockian as in Vertigo or Psycho as well as the chase in a public monument (North by Northwest comes to mind). Yes, the director made the move to talking pictures quite fluently and fluidly. One should keep in mind, too, that the film had already been completed as a silent before being converted into a talkie!

Apparently, the sound era arrives about ten minutes in, as the opening reel is shot entirely as a silent movie (minus quote cards) before switching to audible dialogue. Yet like many seemingly creaky elements of Blackmail, this is something that actually works to the film's benefit and gives it a stylistic uniqueness that helps it stand out today.Alice (Anny Ondra) steps out on her police detective boyfriend Frank (John Longden) to have fun with an artist she fancies named Crewe (Cyril Ritchard). A crime is committed instead, and she finds herself back in Frank's arms seeking his protection. Unfortunately for both of them, a sponger lowlife named Tracy (Donald Calthrop) knows what's doing and pressures the pair for his silence.To really appreciate Blackmail's skewed perspective, it's important to understand Hitchcock's complex view of the law. By all accounts a law-abiding, socially upright man, he nevertheless nursed an extreme dread of John Law dating back to a childhood episode when he was locked in a cell to be taught a lesson. As a director, Hitchcock presented authority figures as vaguely menacing, while reserving his greatest sympathy for outsiders who found themselves, rightly or wrongly, on the run.The first image of Blackmail is the spinning tire of a police quick-response van, or is it a roulette wheel? The capricious nature of law enforcement is always on view, whether it's a bobby sauntering outside an apartment window while Alice screams for help inside or Frank using his authority to subvert a murder investigation.This is the rare Hitchcock film that features fine acting bottom-to-top, but Calthrop stands out best as Tracy, the personification of the core ambiguity of this film. Described as kind of mousy, given to smirking while pleading for help and whistling when he thinks he has the upper hand, Tracy seems easy to hate at first glance but isn't, not as Calthrop imbues him with a vulnerability anyone can relate to, cutting across the staginess around him with a dynamic performance that anticipates how cinema liberated the actor from hidebound stagecraft.One's got to live, you know! he says, but the people he says this to act as if this is yet another of Tracy's unreasonable demands. We end the film pulling for him with as much passion as we pulled away from him at first encounter.Subtle directorial touches abound, like Alice holds her face in an expression we see mirrored in a cut-to scene of Tracy fleeing through the British Museum while an impassive giant mask looks on. There's also clever use of the new sound medium (the knife one's not subtle, but a lot of fun) and knowing humor, like a conversation about a new crime film. Frank, being from Scotland Yard, scoffs at such fiction, but Alice thinks it has merit I heard they got a real criminal to direct it, just to be on the safe side.About the only negatives are the static compositions and bad audio, problems of the period and not of the film. Blackmail even has a terrific final shot, which Hitchcock never topped until his final film, Family Plot. It's another rueful note on the hit-or-miss quality of law enforcement, one that stays with you after the laughter fades.

A wonderfully mobile camera, perhaps imitating similar shots in 'Seventh Heaven' (1927, Borzage) or 'The Cameraman (1928, Sedgwick),' follows the characters up a double flight of stairs. A disorientating high-angle shot of the heroine descending a spiral stairway is uncannily similar to the belltower shots in 'Vertigo (1958).'The film's plot concerns Alice (Anny Ondra), who is cheating on her detective boyfriend Frank (John Longden) with a sleazy artist (Cyril Ritchard). During a struggle in which the artist tries to rape her, Alice sticks a kitchen knife into him, and flees the scene of the murder. Frank finds the evidence linking her to the crime, and is determined to cover it up, but the situation is complicated by a two-bit criminal (Donald Calthrop) who knows what's up and sees dollar signs. Everyone in the film is convincing, particularly Calthrop as the shifty blackmailer who you wouldn't trust as far as you could throw him. The ending, too, is a welcome break from the Production Code-enforced contrivances that would later overwhelm Hollywood. Alice escapes all culpability for her crimes, but the accusative laughing face of a painted jester suggests that the crime will always prey on her thoughts.

In its top 100 greatest films, the BFI included only The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938) from Hitchcock, but they both suffer in comparison to his films on AFI's list, like Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and so on. However, recently I bought a DVD of 18 of his British films. Among them is Blackmail from 1929.Blackmail may have a few flaws. Oddly enough, the first few minutes are silent which confused me since it was supposed to be sound. Lips move, but there's nothing to be heard until later. Still, it doesn't do that much damage to the plot, in which our heroine Alice kills a would-be rapist in self-defence. She then tries to cover it up- although today that would seem needless, another reviewer writes this reflects the bad old days when the attitude was to blame the victim.Either way, she's traumatized by the incident, as many girls today would be. This is depicted well, and she's a sympathetic character. A sleazy guy attempts to blackmail her and her detective boyfriend, thus giving the movie its title. One of the more interesting things about this is that little is going on sometimes- long pauses, a guy buying and then smoking a cigar, a family dinner- but we can still see the drama unfolding underneath. Hitchcock may have entered his golden age in the '40s and '50s, but this is definitely a watchable early effort.

Yes there is sound, but there is no synchronized dialogue until about ten minutes into the film when the police detective and his girlfriend who are the central characters speak to one another. Shooting the film primarily silent with synchronized effects and leaving the talking sequences for segments of the film where dialogue was necessary and then having the judgment to know how much dialogue was enough and stop at that point was something Hitchcock got from the beginning. Watch some of the long-winded speeches from some other 1929 films and realize that many of Hitchcock's contemporaries struggled with this skill.The story is a good one. Alice is feeling neglected by her police detective boyfriend, and follows a handsome artist up to his flat. After some flirting the artist turns suddenly violent and assaults her. She defends herself by grabbing a knife and stabbing the man. Stunned and sure she has not been seen by anyone entering the man's flat, she attempts to erase all signs of her presence there and returns home. She mentions the incident to no one, but is weighted down with guilt.Frank, Alice's boyfriend, investigates the crime scene and sees Alice's glove. He confiscates it. Unfortunately, someone else who is not Alice has the other glove. The lovers don't discuss anything but the threat of the blackmailer until the end of the film. Like many of Hitchcock's later works, much of his art is in furtive glances and in objects that recall the crime rather than specific dialogue. An example of this is a jester in the artist's painting that Alice sees as pointing at her and thus accusing her. The jester meets Alice's eye both immediately after the crime and at the end of the film.Highly recommended as one of the best talking pictures of 1929, but I am yet to find a satisfactory copy on DVD anywhere.

She innocently flirts with artist Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard), admires and tries her hand at some painting work, and he asks her to try on a dress that she likes the look of.

Alice did her best to cover up the crime, and of course Frank is the one investigating the murder, and he is shocked to find the only piece of incriminating evidence, one of his girlfriend's gloves, which he hides from the other detectives. He goes to Alice to tell her what he knows about this situation, but they are interrupted by the appearance of petty thief Tracy (Donald Calthrop) who saw her at the artist's flat the night of the murder. The crook is blackmailing them to give him some cash, otherwise he will go to the police and tell them both the identity of the murder and the information Frank is hiding. Of course things go the opposite direction for Tracy when he is chosen as the key suspect for the murder, and being chased by the police through the British Museum he falls to his death through a glass window to the ground. Alice is suffering in her mind thinking about what she has done and almost being pressured to tell the truth, and she does go to Scotland Yard to confess, but Frank escorts her out and that is when the film ends. Also starring Sara Allgood as Mrs. White, Charles Paton as Mr. White, Harvey Braban as The Chief Inspector, Phyllis Monkman as Gossip, Hannah Jones as The Landlady, Percy Parsons as Crook, Johnny Butt as Sergeant, and Hitchcock's cameo (his longest) is as the man on the London Underground reading and being bothered by a boy knocking his hat off. You can tell in many moments that this film started out as silent, including the dubbing of actress Ondra, and the moments without sound effects or dialogue, but it actually works to some effect for the better. Of course the sound use is very stylised as well, I was particularly impressed with the torturous repetition of the word knife, and there are some good gripping moments, so it's certainly a worthwhile classic thriller.

The stars are Anny Ondra, Cyril Ritchard, John Longden, and Sara Allgood.A young woman (Ondra) two-times her Scotland Yard inspector boyfriend (Longden) and goes out with an artist (Ritchard). Things get rough in his apartment, and he forces himself on her. She kills him (a la Dial M for Murder). Her boyfriend finds her glove in the apartment and realizes she did it; the other glove was found by a criminal hanging around the artist's apartment building, and he decides to blackmail the inspector.Hitchcock more than appears in this film; he has a bit with a little boy on a subway. The film is strange in that the beginning is silent with no title cards. Then suddenly, there is sound. It moves quite slowly, with not much in the way of action. The story builds slowly, and the scene in the artist's apartment is quite long before anything happens.Nevertheless, the Hitchcock touches are there. A pivotal scene happens at the British Museum - Hitchcock's upheaval in familiar places. And in the jail scene, there's a sound the director often described as being terrifying in his childhood when his father had the local police teach him a lesson - the jail door closing.The very pretty Ondra, wife of boxer Max Schmelling, is dubbed here. Ritchard in 1929 is not recognizable as Captain Hook.Worth seeing - it's early Hitchcock and it's an 80-year-old movie. Mind-boggling.

She manages to get away, except for an indigent who hangs around on the street. She is so full of guilt for what she has done (though it is self defense), that the entire film plays under a dark cloud. When the witness decides to blackmail her and her policeman boyfriend, things get dicey. However, she maintains her character. HItchcock didn't automatically guarantee a happy ending. He told it the way it would be. The face of the young girl says volumes. There is a great scene where a nosy neighbor begins to describe the crime she committed. During that time the word knife keeps coming up. The word is amplified over and over. Sort of a tell-tale heart thing. I felt her pain when I saw this 20 years ago and I did again when I watched it yesterday. We could see the underpinnings of Hitchcock's method here. It's not very polished, voices are dubbed for the medium. But it still works because the suspense is so nicely woven and paced. There's also a great scene at the British Museum.

After persuading her to put on a costume for him to sketch her, his passion overwhelms him and he attempts to rape her. Alice ends up stabbing him to death with a bread knife. Now, of course who is assigned the case? None other than detective Webber! Of course, things get well let?s say more than just a little complicated when seedy blackmailer gets involved, claiming that he had seen Alice enter the artists quarters.One of the major issues in the works of Alfred Hitchcock is the disparity between appearance and reality. For example, judgments about what one might consider true and good and the prestige accorded to authorities. One of the clearest examples of this theme, is that the figures of law and order are themselves eminently corruptible. I?m not going to spoil, what detective Webber does, but lets just say, appearances must not be confused with what's really happening.Blackmail is a film full of dynamic and inventive imagery, The most talked about sequence from this film is probably the breakfast on the morning after the murder. A scene in which, Alice is asked to cut the bread, she picks up the knife while her neighbor babbles on about the murder using the word ? knife? all the time. The neighbors words become softer and softer, but the word knife? stays loud, so when Alice hears knife-the knife jumps out of her hand! And quite typical of Hitchcock, Alice's father replies Ere!

While his earlier silent picture The Lodger is most often cited as the first example of what came to be known as Hitchcockian, Blackmail really looks like the first time he consolidated his style and knew exactly what he wanted to achieve.Blackmail is not literally all-talking &#150; the first six or seven minutes are made up of an introductory silent sequence in which a criminal is hunted down, and this is in fact very well done, utilising all the techniques of tension and visual attention-grabbing that Hitch had perfected in his half-dozen or so preceding silent pictures. In fact, it would become a semi-regular feature throughout the rest of Hitch's career to begin with a little dialogue-free sequence to set the scene &#150; for example the lengthy camera pans at the start of Rear Window (1954) which introduce all the other apartments and provide Jimmy Stewart's character's back-story.Blackmail is noted for its creative use of sound, although perhaps it was circumstance more than anything else which encouraged Hitchcock to be experimental. The production was begun as a silent, but Hitch suspected it would later be upgraded to a talkie, so he began by shooting around the dialogue scenes, and shot a few with the actors backs to the camera so their voices could be dubbed in later. Also, Anny Ondra's thick accent meant she had to mime to Joan Barry who was reading her lines off set. All this must have given Hitchcock ideas for expressive sound design and off-screen sounds, using sound as a technique in itself, rather than as a whole new format.It was probably with this film &#150; and his next talkie, Murder! &#150; that Hitchcock realised that crime and suspense were his forte. He appears to be having great fun building up the suspense and stringing out tense situations as far as they will go. It's one of the earliest Hitchcock pictures to really delve into a character's guilt and paranoia. Also very clear is the grisly delight he takes the subject matter. Typical Hitchcockian characters crop up for the first time. There is the sleazy blackmailer who is not appalled by the crime he has witnessed, but simply sees it as a chance to profit. Then there's the murder-obsessed gossip who seems to be a not-so-distant relative of Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), or the housekeeper from Rear Window.Even more perverse than all this gallows humour is Hitchcock's linking of sex and murder in that first pivotal scene, which really shows off the Hitchcock psychology. Crewe plays an elaborate game in order to get to see Alice in her underwear &#150; but the way Hitchcock has placed the camera, the audience can see her all along! At the end of this scene, in her distraught state Alice still goes behind the screen to get changed even though she is now alone, but Hitchcock makes a mockery of her idea of privacy by placing the camera on her side of the screen. As well as being one of the most telling example of Hitchcock's disrespectful attitude towards his female victims, it hammers home perhaps the most fundamental idea in his approach to film-making &#150; that there are three players involved here &#150; the killer, the victim and the audience.The story builds up to a tense and satisfying finale which established yet another Hitchcock first &#150; a chase scene featuring a famous landmark, in this case the British museum &#150; an idea suggested by the future director Michael Powell. Although it wouldn't be applied to him for some years yet, this is perhaps the first film where Hitchcock could have earned his nickname The Master of Suspense. Blackmail does suffer from some of the problems of an early talkie, in particular the dialogue scenes are stilted and long-winded. Overall though it's a good solid effort, a significant Hitchcock and a promise of greater things to come.

Hitch had learned visual expressionism in Germany, where he had made his first complete films e.g. The Pleasure Garden; he uses it to good effect here, as we see a neon-sign morph from a cocktail-shaker into a plunging knife.The characters are complex and well constructed. The detective is something of a lout concerned to impose his will on everybody; this makes him a ruthless detective, but has no qualms about covering up for his girl when he finds out her part in the murder... not so much because loves her, but because it puts her absolutely in his power.The blackmailer seems to be as slimy as they come, until we realize that he's dirt poor and only wants some breakfast, some pocket-money and the occasional cigar. Despite the title, he's a minor character, but his acting is wonderful.Anny Ondra as Alice White is the heart and soul of the picture. It's doubtful whether any English actress of that era could have portrayed the range of emotions (and skin) demanded of the character, so Hitch was right in using her - but her Czech accent was so thick they had to use a primitive form of dubbing. She starts out being jolly and slightly mischievous, but events change her into someone overwhelmed by guilt and paranoia. She really just wants to be loved, but the guys available to her range from domineering to disgusting. (The end of the movie suggests that she will live under the total domination of Frank, consumed by fear and guilt.) Some of the technical details are a bit primitive (this is 1929), but the acting and artistry certainly make up for that. My only big objection is to the title - the blackmail is a minor sub-plot, the real theme is the destruction of a woman's personality.PS Does anybody know of other full-length talkies made between The Jazz Singer and Blackmail?

In Blackmail, Annie Ondra has stabbed and killed a lustful neighbor in defense of her virtue. No one knows who committed the murder but the next morning it is the talk of Chelsea. Ondra is haunted by guilt. She sees mementos of the murder everywhere -- a policeman's outstretched hand, or a bread knife. In the back room of her father's small shop, she tries to slice a loaf of bread, but there is a goofy looking woman customer lounging in the doorway and chattering on about the killing. Ondra's hand trembles as she listens to the customer carrying on. Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick -- that's a British way. But a knife. How could anyone use a knife? The annoying customer's voice degrades into a background mumble except for one recurring word. Mmmm, mumble, mumble, mumble, KNIFE, mumble, mumble KNIFE! The last one is practically a scream and the bread knife seems to leap out of Ondra's hand. The director was to conduct a number of other experiments with sound later in his career, from Bernard Hermann's shrieking violins in Psycho to the electronic clutter of The Birds. The story itself is kind of interesting if not exactly gripping. Mainly we see Ondra and her detective boy friend from Scotland Yard trying to hide her involvement in the crime. However, it's discovered by a seedy character who begins to blackmail the two of them, at first simply be asking the boy friend to pay for a particularly expensive cigar. An unnerving scene, so small, yet so portentous.It turns out that the blackmailer, although he had nothing to do with the murder outside of seeing Ondra enter the dead man's flat, has a police record. Suspicion falls on him. The police pursue him to the dome of the British Museum. He crashes through the skylight and falls on the floor far below.I didn't find the ending very satisfying. Ondra goes to the police station to confess, which she should have done in the first place. Her boy friend meets her there before she can spill the beans. But until now, he knows only that Ondra was in the would-be rapist's room. Now she tells him that she murdered the libidinous scoundrel. The boy friend -- John Longden by name -- now sees things clearly. He clenches his fists and stares towards the camera, not for the first time. And then he and Ondra walk away together, hand in hand.Well -- what happens NEXT? What did they do, run out of film? Does she hang or go to jail, or is everything swept under the rug by the two of them who are in cahoots? The code would have prevented Annie Ondra's getting away with murder, even if by middle-class standards it might have been justified. But the code doesn't seem to be at work here. The attempted rape is clearly depicted for what it is, though hidden behind a bustling curtain. And Ondra has either been too innocent or not nearly innocent enough, prancing around in her underwear in a strange man's apartment, teasing him when he sketches a nude woman on his canvas, cooing with delight over his attentions.Any conclusion is left hanging, and I didn't get the impression this was intentional ambiguity. Still, the story has an abundance of tension and the guilt that torments Annie Ondra must have appealed to Hitchcock, who was to continue using it as an important theme in his later movies. One wonders what he did as a child. Maybe it's the responsibility of the Jebs.

It's the first of many of these type scenes that typify a Hitchcock production.When Hitchcock after beginning this film as a silent, switched to sound he didn't anticipate that German actress Anny Ondra's accent would have been so thick that early sound made it not understandable. Like Jean Hagen's voice in Singing in the Rain dubbed by Debbie Reynolds, Ondra's voice was completely dubbed over by Joan Barry.Best performance in the film by far is that of Donald Calthrop as the blackmailer.

No matter, as it is the talkie version that predominates today.Beautiful Alice White (Anny Ondra), whose father owns a smoke shop, is the girlfriend of New Scotland Yard detective Frank Webber (John Longden). As he keeps her waiting thirty minutes for a restaurant date, the inevitable spat occurs between our two leads. Alice winds up in the apartment of her artist neighbor (Cyril Ritchard). She is impressed with his decor. Lusting for her all along, he tries to seduce her, and, in the struggle she grabs a knife and stabs him to save her honor. The homicide was justifiable. Frank Webber is assigned to the case, so he has to track down his own girl. He finds one of her gloves in the flat. When he confronts Alice, the blackmailer Tracy (Donald Calthrop) comes out of nowhere waving the other glove. Now we have our primary plot. Since the unfortunate incident, the guilt on Alice's face is palpable. When she walks on the busy London streets of 1929, note the various situations that remind her of the crime scene.The ending is not happy even though the homicide case is closed (wrongly). The couple knows that the dead man, rotten as he is, did not commit the killing. Alice, and Frank too, have to live with guilt, unless of course she decides to come clean with the law. After all, there is that recurrence of the painting of the ugly, laughing jester. Hitchcockian symbolism? Attractive Anny Ondra was born in Galicia (Polish area) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire a few years after the turn of the 20th century. Because of her heavy eastern European accent, her voice was dubbed. No matter, she was slender and leggy, and was the first of many attractive blondes to work for the master of suspense. She was a decent actress and made the transition to sound. She also had the look, and the director made sure we got long views of blonde Anny's gorgeous legs. Actors had to overact in silent movies to stress their emotions, and we see some of that here in Hitchcock's first talkie. The movie's beginning is like a silent documentary, and works very effectively. It moves along quickly, but suffers from that awful background sound and that general roughness of later 1920s pictures that were transported into the sound era. Scene endings are not always smooth, but understandable. To be fair, the available resources were minimal. By the way, that was the master on the train being worked over by the kid.

It contains so many of his later themes, which he honed to perfection through the years. Inept policemen, obligatory leg shots of his leading lady (Anny Ondra), and eventually the classic 'wrong man' (although his 'wrong man' is the villain of the piece, the blackmailer). This is a very dark film, in its way. There are no 'heroes'. Anny Ondra is childish as she steps into the short dress the artist (Cyril Ritchard) has presented her. In a previous scene, we have seen her deviously getting rid of her boyfriend to share a tryst with the artist. The cop, played by stone-faced John Longden, is revealed as a prideful bully, not interested in the 'law' at all, but rather scheming to blackmail the blackmailer. The themes of guilt are displayed in a very graphic way. A man's arm hanging out of a transom reminds Alice (Ondra) of the artist's arm as it dangled from his bed after she stabbed him. In a truly inventive scene, Alice stares at a flashing neon sign of a martini glass, above the word 'cocktails'. But as her conscience sees it, the glass becomes a hand, holding a knife plunging down. What holds the movie together is the artist's painting of a court jester. The face of the jester is startling realistic, like a photograph, and we see it mocking Alice, It mocks Frank the cop, too. At one point, the face hits the audience in closeup, as if it were mocking the audience. As in 'The 39 Steps', there are lingering shots of his leading lady's legs. (Although it was never done so cleverly as Madeleine Carroll in handcuffs from 'The 39 Steps'.) The ending is fairly black, too. Alice has decided to come clean about the murder, but, too late. The blackmailer has died in his escape to flee the police. Enter Frank the detective, who intervenes and allows Scotland Yard to believe that the wrong man murdered the artist. The movie ends with peals of laughter and there is that grotesque face of the jester staring at us yet again.Hitchcock appears in a rather indulgent cameo with a child who keeps grabbing at his hat.The movie begins as a silent movie with a long, drawn out police chase, arrest and imprisonment of a suspect. This would be repeated years later much more agonizingly in Hitchcock's later The Wrong Man. In his later years, Hitchcock would always portray cops as inept and foolish, but Blackmail is pretty much cop as criminal. It would be great to see these early Hitchcock movies restored. Young and Innocent, Murder! and this film would get more viewings if the source material was improved. While not a 'masterpiece', as is 'The 39 Steps', 'Blackmail' finds Hitchcock....well, quite Hitchcockian for a young man.

This early movie already moves in that direction. If Hitchcock ever believed in an objective moral order, which I believe he did, it's a very complex one, especially when the human element is involved.Brief synopsis of plot-- Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop. She has a cop boyfriend, but one night she jilts him to take up with a handsome artist who inveigles her into his room where he tries to rape her. She stabs him in the process, but is overcome with guilt afterward. Later, she's accosted by a blackmailer who knows she's the killer. Her cop boyfriend knows too, but protects her from the blackmailer who is killed in a police chase. The ending is a surprising one.As the story develops, a number of interesting conflicts emerge. There's the one centering on Alice, between her guilt over having violated both civil law and moral law, on one hand, and her sense that it was in self-defense, on the other. Still, the situation becomes more ambiguous when considering that she did trick her boyfriend and did take up with the artist whom she also enticed with coy behavior. How blameless is she. Then there's the cop boyfriend who shirks his duty by protecting her from both the blackmailer and the police. He loves her as presumably she does him (or is she merely being an opportunist). But how much blame can true love excuse. Now, Hitchcock being the master manipulator, gets us to side with Alice and her cop boyfriend even though we know they've broken a number of laws. Thus, we're invited to think about this reaction and how it fits in with conventional morality and respect for law. Then there's the question of what would have been an appropriate ending given the factors involved.The movie itself generally holds interest throughout, though the first part highlighting impersonal police procedure appears not to fit with the personalized remainder. But maybe that's the point. The cops (and the law) are shown to be unfeeling and ill-equipped to deal with the sort of subtleties raised in the movie's remainder. Less explicable is the overextended business with the blackmailer and the cigar, which appears rather pointless. But then maybe I'm missing something. The dramatic high point is the exciting chase through the monolithic British Museum. Already Hitchcock shows a fascination with national landmarks as climactic backdrops, used here to grand effect. And surely the great stone face staring blindly from a wall as the blackmailer flees down a hanging rope survives is one of the most arresting images of any Hitchcock film. The acting strikes me at times as an unfortunate hold-over from the silent era with its exaggerated movements and facial expressions, particularly Donald Cathrop as the blackmailer. His relentless mugging almost comes across as a caricature. Also John Longden as the boyfriend gives us a hard-eyed stare that equates, I guess, with being a cop, but is almost comical in its persistence. But then, as good as he is, Hitchcock was never an actor's director.What the film-maker has done is to take a fairly simple story and invest its subtext with all sorts of interesting ambiguities, a hallmark of his success both as an entertainer and as an artist.The movie is dated in many obvious respects, but if you focus on why the audience responds as it does and what that means about a cut-and-dried moral order that we're often presented with, then I think you've experienced the heart of Hitchcock's rare gift.

This movie was made many, many years before the discovery of DNA, so the close-up of cigarette butts in an ashtray has significantly less evidentiary meaning that it would today.3. The police lineup in the film is called an identification parade, and the witness does not stand behind a one-way mirror to make the identification, but walks up and places her hand on the culprit's chest.4. The Scotland Yard detectives are simply called inspectors here, and not identified with the modern ranks (DI, DCI) of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) in today's U.K. police dramas.Other differences? You tell me.

It is the first British sound film that was originally shot as a silent and then remade partially with the sound which gives it a very interesting look. It is the film where Hitchcock made the appearance for the first time which would become one of his trademarks. He already used his distinctive camera angles to create memorable effects in his very early picture. As the result, Blackmail looks, sounds, moves, and feels surprisingly modern and fresh for almost 80 years old production. The film concerns a young woman Alice who began to flirt with an artist and while visiting his studio, she stabbed him to death in self-defense after she had refused his demands of posing in the nude and he would not take no for an answer.Watching the movie I also noticed that Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel had the same fetishes - looks like the old saying proved to be right, great minds think (and desire) alike.

In any case, this film will not disappoint you. It actually was made in both a silent and a talking version. Sound had come to films but not all theaters were wired; therefore, Hitchcock made two versions of the film for release. It becomes obvious that overlapping scenes are used in the talking print. This accounts for long periods of silence with only sound effects. In fact, if you view both versions, you will note that there are different players in bit parts. An example.......when the famous knife scene takes place in the kitchen of the White's home, the neighbor who is relating the details of the murder is played by a different woman than that in the silent version. In some scenes dialogue takes place with the speaker's back to the camera thereby allowing the use of the silent footage without having to synchronize lip movement. The unusual thing about the story is that the murderer gets away with it while somebody else takes the fall (no pun intended). With the policeman boyfriend's complicity, the heroine, who tried to confess, walks away scot free and all is well......or is it? If I were the boyfriend, I would wonder what the hell she was doing in her underwear in the artist's studio in the first place. Besides, they have to live with the fact that she did indeed murder the artist. Not exactly a happy ending! This film is worth a look for the historic value and to see those little touches that became a part of the Hitchcock ouevre over the years which endeared him to millions of fans.

In the case of Blackmail, the film works on both levels of silent and sound, but having now seen the sound version I'd be very curious to see the one that is totally silent. Because many scenes and sequences work perfectly, maybe better in that purely and spectacularly cinematic quality, in simple silent storytelling, and here and there it looks as if Hitchcock decided not to touch a thing with the syncing or re-shooting. One sequence that still sticks in my mind, and one that reminded me a little of Murnau, was when Alice is walking outside on the streets following the killing in the apartment, and she walks along with a look on her face that is staggering and sometimes with the bodies and faces merging together.It's the kind of sequence, among others here, that display Hitchcock at the peak of his skills as a director in the silent-film mold, but what's ingenious about Blackmail is how he manages to make some scenes work great for one form and then for another, and occasionally merge the two. In telling the story of Alice (Anny Orda), a shopkeeper's daughter who abandons her date Frank for the evening to cozy up to a painter with a charming/creepy stare and who lures her up to his apartment, Hitchcock lays his touches on sometimes thick and seductively, and with some bits of dark humor (or light, as is his cameo on the bus). Aside from the actual killing scene, which is staged with a minimum of sound and with an astonishing amount of bravura acting from Orda afterward in the apartment, there's the scene where Mr. Crewe sings and plays on the piano and Alice gets dressed on the opposite side of the room/frame. This scene, which expresses the momentary joy of the sound of singing and music as well as the physical and facial expressions from Orda trying on the dress and hearing music, is without putting it too pretentiously that rare moment where silent and sound film merge in a kind of transitional poetry.If it does sound a little like typical Hitchcock, don't fret; it's actually near *classic* Hitchcock, with the murder case being a little more delicate this time around and the instance of blackmail being a devilish twist as the provoker, played by an actor with a great despicable face and a eerie temperament and voice. Working from the play by Charles Bennett, the Master of Suspense is able to weave this possibly stagey affair into a string of tense close-ups and reactions, of dialog that seems to toy with the emotions of Alice and Frank (befuddling Alice's confused parents), and Hitchcock, apparently not happy with the play's third act, cuts to a wild chase scene as the climax that leads its low-life if innocent man through the British museum and all the way up to the roof for one of the first major chase scenes in a Hitchcock film.While this climax nearly gets marred by the inter-cutting with Alice's close-up, and earlier on in the picture there's a jarring moment when the silent-movie feel for the first few minutes (i.e. the cops going into the man's room looking at the paper, the gun, etc) into sound, these are its only major liabilities. Throughout, there's a very firm grasp on making sure that sound and dialog isn't just something of a kitsch device or something silly (albeit I'm sure the singing and piano playing is inspired by the Jazz Singer) but meant to actually involve the viewer in the progression of events. It goes without saying, as mentioned, a good deal of this could be as compelling without dialog and with the occasional inter-title to fill in the blanks. But then one would also lose little moments that make Blackmail special, like when Alice is in her room taking off her clothes from the night before in a kind of purging moment and a bird is off chirping away in the room- metaphor, perhaps, but it at least works as another kind of 'pure' cinema.

The jester's mocking face on canvas almost comes alive even before a murder takes place. The jester's face mocks the viewer rather than the character when it makes the final appearance as it is carried into the police station, torn physically&#151;an oblique comment on law and the police, as the true perpetrator of the crime walks away free in the company of a law enforcer.The electric billboard showing liquor bottles morphing into knives is a visual gimmick that must have been novel when psychoanalysis was new. Hitchcock proves he was up to date on scientific developments and a true expressionist. The limp hand of the murdered person is also used as a psychological image. The aural fade in and fade out of a conversation to highlight the word knife must appear contrived today, but it is very effective for the age the film was made. The conversation between the lady who discovers the murder and the policeman on the phone is shown simultaneously in a very imaginative manner.Many parts of the film remain a silent film (as it was originally meant to be), while others have sound and dialog. The opening scene suggests you are indeed watching a silent film. The chase scene is again silent. (The scene is remarkably similar visually to the chase in The Parallax View) Yet when Hitchcock uses sound sometimes it is remarkably well done&#151;the screams, when murder is discovered, or the use of the word knife repeatedly for effect&#151;and sometimes to silly extremes&#151;the lengthy loud chirping of birds to indicate morning. What is irritating for a modern viewer, is the inexplicable lack of blood in the murder scene, when Hitchcock overdid this element in his later films.Hitchcock has always loved food, especially a full English breakfast. Considerable film time is spent on the blackmailer relishing this and the cop watching him enjoy it with disgust. Hitchcock would copy this scene in Frenzy some 40 years later to even better effect.The film may not be great but is an interesting Hitchcock carrying the wrong man tradition (North by Northwest, Frenzy, To Catch a Thief, The 39 Steps, etc.).

One is that it is early Hitchcock and one would want to see the master of suspense's entire resume anyways, and two; is that it's widely considered to be Britain's first talkie! 'Blackmail' was initially filmed as a silent thriller, and was innovative changed into a talkie halfway through the production.The story revolves around a young woman named Alice (Anny Ondra), who is dating Detective Frank Webber (John Longden), and for some reason or another she decides to ditch to meet with another man. That man being an artist named Mr. Crewe (Cyril Ritchard). Crewe convinces Alice to come up to his apartment/studio, and eventually attempts to rape her. Alice then stabs Crewe dead, and is panicked by the situation. Fortunately for her, Frank Webber is assigned to the case, but unfortunately for her, a man named Tracy (Donald Calthrop) knows the truth, and he wants to capitalise on the situation with the intention of blackmail.To say the least, 'Blackmail' is not very suspenseful, scary or enthralling. It's extremely slow-paced in parts, and some of the soundtrack is a little off as it goes from silent to sound. However, it's very innovative for the time with it's use of the sound, especially during Alice's breakfast scene, which displayed a clich√© that being copied over and over- where one word triggered an emotive state of a character yet the audience is hearing inaudible. Not perfect in the clich√©'s original form as it seemed amateurish by today's standards, but Hitchcock's experimental nature for that scene would have worked well back then. I was also impressed with the dubbing of Alice's voice, which was never Anny Ondra's real voice. I found it actually worked reasonably well, where other voice dubs did not. The storyline and the blackmail itself were hardly engrossing and it was turned around too quickly. I never felt the characters were that cornered, and Tracy simply felt like a bum trying to get a free meal. Though Hitchcock did manage to convey the awkwardness of Tracy's presence amongst people who Anny did not want to find out. However, Tracy was hardly the ominous presence such as Bruno Anthony in 'Strangers on a Train' and he was dealt with way too quickly, and it wasn't drawn for a lengthy time period (in the story). Donald Calthrop's performance is easily the best in the film, though you do feel a little sorry for him when the tables are quickly turned. And, I never really understood why Alice thought Franked hadn't figured it out when she confessed, or why Frank had not confronted her about that date. I think some loose ends needed to be tied up.However, 'Blackmail' does have a lot of merit as an example of Britain's first talkie, and as a blueprint for themes, style and technique that Hitchcock would later master. I particularly liked the use of the gloves as plot-point, as well as the painting of the jester becoming symbolic. The climax would also be similarly repeated in Hitchcock's later films. That said, 'Blackmail' is not one of Hitchcock's best films, and is probably more significant because of its early use of sound. 'Blackmail' is not boring, and is easy to watch. Its just there is not much to this film story wise in the end of the day! It's a good movie, but not a great one- and extra credit because Hitchcock manage to turn this film from a silent one into the first British talkie.***¬Ω out of *****! "},{"Title":"OK story with great cinematography.","Date":"17 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" The film incorporates some of German Expressionism which was really obvious in the film. The beginning of the movie itself shows this through the use of lighting and shadows. A recurring theme is the framing of the face with a dark surround, and light shining only on the eyes. This creates a very intense and eerie sort of mood, which consolidate the theme of Expressionism. The acting is pretty good and both Anny Ondra and John Longden did well. Ondra greatly showed the expressions of a person recently exposed to trauma, and the close-ups of her occupied and fearful expressions emphasize her guilt. Longden first starts off as a pre- occupied character who doesn't pay much attention to Alice, but after the murder he becomes more concerned and does his best to keep her from confessing. I find it interesting that the film goes about different ways to silence Alice. She is never given a chance to tell her story, and hardly gets any input. The story was average for me, but I guess for that time period it could have been engaging. I felt that it lacked motivation on the part of the blackmailer (Donald Calthrop) and that his character just popped up so suddenly. The cinematography however was pretty creative. As mentioned before, there was some Expressionistic styles used in the film, and camera placements helped with that. Also, the beginning scene had a really great shot from a mirror that showed a criminal's point of view.I watched the version of this film with sound recorded, and it was pretty ingenious how sound was synchronized. The voice of Alice is from another actress, and Ondra was miming the words in the film. Though the sound at the beginning of the film is inconsistent and very much like a silent film, it got better throughout the film. Noticeably there was use of ambient noise as well as back shots of characters to eliminate sound synchronization problems. The use of sound to enhance Alice's subjective perception was also a great addition. A obvious example of this is when the neighbour starts gossiping and all Alice hears is knife blah blah blah knife! blah blah knife! That was pretty comedic (and annoying after awhile) but could be related to how Alice was hearing things.

Throughout, I had to shake my head a few times to make sure I wasn't dreaming that I was seeing some movie Alfred Hitchcock made in 1929, just to find out it wasn't really a movie like this and be teased. No, this was reality, and yes that's how good I think this film is.Without the dubbing of Joan Barry (who is an otherwise excellent actress) the actress who plays Alice, shines much brighter. This movie was simply meant for the silent screen.The plot is different from usual Hitchcock formula. There is no completely wrong perpetrator. It's more a situation of your everyday human beings, with all their good and bad side, caught up in a web that's hard to break, without breaking someone in it. As the drama unfolded, I felt my arm tightening from the suspense.Not exactly an overlooked film, at least not usually, but I would say Blackmail is a bit underrated. Compared to most of Hitchcock's movies from the 1920's through 1933, this is by far the best. But beyond that, I think it ranks up with the silent greats from Murnau, Vidor, or Griffith.

No. Is it one of his better early era efforts(pre-39 Steps)? Alongside The Lodger, yes. It isn't without flaws, John Longden's performance is rather stilted with a mixture of over-acting and under-acting, and while the dubbing is not bad at all there were times where with instances of restricted sound technique that the film may have benefited a little better by being silent instead. It looks very good, not among the most audacious of Hitchcock's films but a significant improvement over the production values of Juno and the Paycock. The expressionistic images still look great and give the film an eerie look that suits the story really well without being too obvious. The first class photography helps also, especially in the British Museum sequence. The music is generally fine too, to begin with it could have been much more subtle and been used a little less but quite quickly was much more fitting. The story is taut and suspenseful, even early in his career what was so distinctive and good about what he was most famous for comes through very strongly. It is ambiguous too, but that adds to the suspense and done in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed. The climax is the first of his films to use a famous landmark, and is very satisfying. Hitchcock directs very assuredly, and it is in Blackmail also where he delivers one of his best cameos(they are always fun to spot). Apart from Longdon, the acting was good, sometimes a little theatrical but considering that some of the roles did need a broad approach at times it wasn't a big issue. Sara Allgood stands out in support, bringing out similar qualities to what made her the best thing about Juno and the Paycock, while the best overall performance comes from Anny Ondra who is wonderful.

His Master's Voice was on the labels of RCA Victor records 80 years ago and even longer than that. My summary is woven from that slender thread - The heroine (Anny Ondra) had a pronounced accent and was dubbed. But even a dubbed-in voice didn't prevent her from nearly sinking the picture, as once again Ms. Ondra comes up short in the acting department. Recall, she was in The Manxman (1928) and displayed the same lack of acting skill.In Blackmail, she is passable until the rape scene. Thereafter, she becomes catatonic and wanders in a daze for the rest of the picture. It was very unconvincing - how could Hitchcock put up with such an inept acting turn? The savior of the film is Donald Calthrop, the blackmailer in question, with a performance that turns an exercise in the ordinary acting-wise into something special.Oh yes, the story. This was a first-rate movie in all respects. It was taut and with very little down time, thanks to Hitchcock. It moves along quickly and is absorbing despite divulging the contents in the first half hour. Back to the acting - since this was the dawn of the talking era, it was overacted except for Calthrop, who struck the right chord and was convincing as well as loathsome. Anyone remember Cyril Ritchard? he was the murder victim, and a veteran of the stage and not often seen on the screen.May I offer an opinion? From a brutally realistic standpoint, why should the actions of a victim of a rape attempt be considered criminal, and didn't she do what she had to do to fend off her attacker? Sometimes in this world one has to do what one must, in order to survive - even if it is at great variance with society's, as well as one's own, code of ethics. Tough luck for the would-be rapist - justifiable homicide would be my verdict. Just my own thought. Most of the time my own thoughts wouldn't hold up in a court of law. "},{"Title":"The Men Who Knew Too Much","Date":"28 March 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" Originally conceived as a silent film, but finally released as one of Britain's first talkies, Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is based on a stage-play by Charles Bennet. Both film and play find a young woman accused of murder.Blackmail benefits from its origins as a silent film. Whilst some passages contain strategically added or overdubbed dialogue, for the most part the film is wordless, and contains many sequences which rely on stark visuals and clever editing. The visual sophistication of Hitchcock's best films tends to be a direct result of his work on early hybrid films like Blackmail, which forced the director to develop a filmic language which was, and remains, fairly unique.Other Hitchcock traits are here adorable blonde heroines (Anny Ondra), a Kafkaesque plot, chase sequences, blackmail, rape, murder, untrustworthy Scotland Yard detectives and a shaky romantic relationship which is interrupted by much murder and excitement.Significantly, one of Hitchcock's last act sequences, in which our heroes stroll down a Scotland Yard corridor, plays like a perverse wedding march. The film isn't only deeply suspicious of police and authority, but of all men, who seem preoccupied with both silencing and reshaping women. Our poor heroine is herself both punished for being raped, and made to feel guilty about it. This has led to many labelling Hitch a misogynist who indulges in sadistic fantasies against women, though in Blackmail's case, we're clearly positioned to sympathise with poor Anny Ondra.Anny's character, Alice White, is herself not a typical damsel in distress. She's headstrong, and even a bit vindictive. Note that she knowingly constructs a plot so that Frank, her self-obsessed boyfriend, gets jealous. Frank, who is a police detective and who loves murder mysteries, himself seems to be a precursor to both Jimmy Stewart's self-absorbed husband in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, and the murder mystery loving men of Shadow of a Doubt, who know everything yet can't spot a murderer in their midsts.Blackmail contains Hitchcock's longest cameo (he's accosted on a train by a rowdy kid) and opens with a longer, nearly ten minute sequence in which police officers track down and arrest a suspected criminal. Filmed in a quasi-documentary style, and opening symbolically with a spinning wheel, this sequence informs everything which comes later, though only in hindsight do we realise this. For when we learn that Blackmail has ended with a criminal case being wrongly closed, we begin to reappraise Hitchcock's opening sequence. Was the right man arrested? Is he blackmailed into guilt? And more importantly, is Alice's resistance to rigid, masculinist authority similarly futile?Hitchcock's films often deal with the suppression of a woman's voice and the denial of female subjectivity. This is most literally seen in The Man Who Knew Too Much, in which a singer has been effectively silenced by her husband. A similar situation takes place in Blackmail. The film, itself a silent film which refused to remain quiet, is supposedly about trying to keep a man silent (paying off a blackmailer), yet it is the heroine who spends over a third of the film speechless. Even when Alice finally speaks, Frank repeatedly urges her to shut up. Elsewhere Hitchcock constructs a scene in which our heroine's image and speech are subtly controlled by an artist. Here Alice draws a face on a large board which may be either male or female. The artist, controlling her hand, then adds a sexualised female body. Alice accepts this image, and toys with the idea of giving the image a sexy dress. She is then literally raped by the artist, an act which foreshadows the subtext of Hitchcock's Vertigo.Just as the artist does not concede Alice control of her image or validity to her speech, Frank also tries to suppress Alice. Don't interfere, he constantly says. He may be on Alice's side, but visually Hitchcock continually links Frank to the film's blackmailers and rapists; oppressive forces, continually pushing Alice to the edges of the frame, all attempting to exert control over her sexuality.Interestingly, Anny Ondra is herself an actress with a heavy Czech accent and so who is not allowed to speak. Like most actresses during the silent film era, she was chosen because of her striking, exotic looks. Her voice was then dubbed with that of a British actress, essentially creating Hitchcock's idea of what a woman should be; correct in appearance, correct in accent and correct in relation to cultural and economic demands. She may be a reproduction, a composite made up from several sources, but the intended result is a singular, unified object.The dubbing of actresses like Anny is what writer Rick Altman would call sound cinema's ventriloquism. Sound and image have a complementary relationship, he says, whereby sound uses the image to mask its own actions and vice versa. The two are locked in a dialectic where each is alternately master and slave to the other. Through this illusion of wholeness, untainted by the scandal of a mechanical source, the myth of cinema's unity, and thus that of the spectator is perpetuated. Whilst it is highly unlikely that Hitchcock saw his films in these terms, it is also true that his films were preoccupied with men controlling and even outright building women. Of, like Altman says, removing in order to create a desirable image.Even before Blackmail was completed, Hitchcock knew the era of silent films had ended. I did a funny thing in that scene, a sort of farewell to silent pictures, he would say of Blackmail. On the silent screen the villain was generally a man with a moustache. Well, my villain was clean-shaved, but an ironwork chandelier in his studio cast a shadow on his upper lip that suggested an absolutely fierce-looking moustache. In other words, the villain now no longer needs props and moustaches to convey villainy. He now has access to speech.8/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The film is extremely primitive-looking now, inevitably so given its age, but marks an important evolution in cinematic technique. Hitchcock creates some incredible shots and a cleverly unsettling mood here, all very typical of the things we'd come to expect of him as his career developed.

Luckily, it's not a bad film&#x85; in fact it's a pretty damned good one, more interesting to film buffs and historians to be sure, but still a striking little offering for those curious about this sort of thing.Alice White (Anny Ondra) is a quiet, unassuming shopkeeper's daughter. She is involved in an on-and-off relationship with a dedicated local detective, Frank Webber (John Longden), but is also keeping her options open by dating a mysterious artist (Cyril Ritchard) who lodges in a flat close to her father's shop. One evening, following an argument with Frank, Alice meets up with her artist friend. She allows herself to be persuaded up to his flat, but things turn ugly and the artist attempts to rape her. In panic, she stabs him and kills him. Now a killer with a whole heap of guilty secrets hidden away behind her sweetly innocent looks, Alice struggles to hold herself together as the entire neighbourhood gossips and speculates about the terrible murder that has rocked their little world. Frank &#x96; ironically assigned to the murder investigation &#x96; quickly realises that Alice is guilty but refuses to turn her in. Things become very sticky indeed though when a slimy opportunist, Tracy (Donald Calthrop), reveals that he also knows about Alice's secret and attempts to blackmail her.Ondra is brilliant as the central character, her performance capturing every subtle nuance of the young girl who goes from homely sweetheart to guilt-ridden killer in one swish of a blade. It's a shame that the introduction of sound effectively ended her acting career (her thick accent and unattractive voice is dubbed here, but ultimately film-makers couldn't be bothered dubbing her all the time, and this stopped her from receiving roles once sound cinema became the norm). She really can act, though, and it is sad indeed that she never got to do more. Hitchcock allows some scenes to drag on and within a few years his approach to editing became much sharper. One must remember that in many ways this is an experimental film, a gutsy leap into the unknown, and for a first attempt at a sound movie (both for the director and for British film overall) it's a pretty assured opener. There might not be a huge audience for a film like Blackmail any more, but for those who care this is a very worthwhile landmark movie.

Hitchcock, when he finished his new film, Blackmail, reshot some key scenes with sound, dubbed some, and so here we have Britain's first talkie. It's actually a bit thin plot wise, but that can be forgiven because this so amazingly shot you don't realize the plot doesn't really kick in until 3/4 of the way through. Anny Ondra, whoever she is, is quite amazing and amazingly beautiful as the protagonist, who's one night affair turns deadly.

Taking a technology in it's infancy to new heights by exploiting the possibilities of sound technology, Hitchock not only excels in the use of sound but also in the use of creative cinema visual technique. While BLACKMAIL, like most early sound films, has a number of problems, the positives do outweigh the negatives. It's an important Hitchcock film and one any avid viewer of the director should take time to see.The plot premise is rather simple Alice White (Anny Ondra, who was famously dubbed by English player Joan Barry because her English wasn't up to scratch), a pert young blonde, has a fight with her detective boyfriend in a restaurant and is picked up by an artist. She goes back to his flat, where he attempts to rape her. She resists, and stabs him with a bread knife in self defence. Alice then runs from the crime scene, and is forced to bear the weight of her own frightened conscience and a scheming blackmailer who is out to pin Alice and her boyfriend (who soon finds out about her crime)for all he can get.As with most Hitchcock films, this is not a murder mystery. Rather, it's an interesting psychological thriller that gains it's tension and suspense from the heroine's unfortunate predicament. Despite her dubbing, Ondra does very well in her role. She is especially good in the second half, projecting a wide range of facial expressions and silent emotion that more than make up for her lack of a voice.One of Hitchcock's most famous and critically lauded sequences occurs with the famous morning-after breakfast table discussion at Ondra's home, where she is plagued by memories of the killing and the word knife. Hitchcock cleverly mixes with the soundtrack so we hear only the word knife stabbing at Alice's conscience, and not the rest of nosy visitor's unimportant conversation. The scene is a masterpiece of tension, as Hitchcock focuses the camera further and further on Ondra's face as the word is repeated over and over again.Also note-worthy are several neat visual tricks and the introduction of a major Hitchcock motif birds. The dissolve of a cocktail shaker into a knife is a clever Hitchcock touch, as is opening 10 minutes of film, a montage of images as we are shown the day-to-day work of Scotland yard policemen.The scene at the artist's flat is also quite memorable, because it is quite risqu√© for the time period. Ondra is shown in skimpy underwear , first posing and teasing, and then being attacked by the lecherous artist- freedom Hitchcock was undoubtedly allowed because this was a British production.The ending is actually quite ambiguous, even skeptical, as Hitchcock shows the effect that Alice's conscience may have on her in the future. All seems well between her and her laughing boyfriend, and his colleague, yet one senses Ondra's unease behind her eyes in the final few seconds. Hitchcock's intention is not merely to show us a murder mystery, or a detective drama-instead, it's a disturbing study of how fatal circumstance and crime can affect our lives.

The moment when everything turns worse when the main character gets into trouble is a good switch; something you don't see coming. There are some really good camera moments that if Hitchcock had made this film today could more easily have been portrayed. Some of his panning and blending would really come over well today.

The artist, Mr. Crewe, attempts to rape her but she defends herself with a knife which ends up killing the man. So her and her boyfriend (a detective by the name of Frank Webber) attempt to cover up the murder of Mr. Crewe. That is until another man named Tracy has evidence that Alice did it so he tries to blackmail them. The question is how Alice and Frank will deal with this blackmailer. So I find this film as having a very entertaining and interesting plot with lots of twists and turns. It kept me entertained throughout the entire film.The acting in the film is a weird case because all of the actors do a great job except for Anny Ondra who happens to be in the lead role as Alice. She had a strong Czech accent so she ended up lip synching to another actress who was speaking next to the camera which really makes Anny's performance seem a little awkward. And other than just that she really doesn't display her emotions very well. Thankfully the other actors seem to pick up most of the slack. John Longden plays Frank Webber and he gets the emotions of being concerned and nervous across very well. And finally there is Donald Calthrop plays Tracy and really seems like a creepy guy and a criminal which means that he did a great job in his role.When it comes to sound this is Alfred Hitchcock's entry into sound cinema Blackmail ends up being a little bit of a hybrid. It was originally going to be a silent film until it was later changed into a sound one, at which point the small amount of already finished footage was dubbed and the remaining footage was filmed with sound. This makes the original silent parts seem a little awkward with only a few things having sound in these scenes while everything else is silent. During the parts where there is dialogue and things like that it works out well but music rarely overlaps with dialogue which is a shame that they couldn't have figured that out yet with these early talkies. The music seems to work very well though which is good. And the special effects are great for 1929 as it makes a lot of the scenes look pretty real for the time.So in conclusion this film is really an experiment with sound and a lot of the technical aspects of the film certainly show it. However, the story is good enough where it shines through the problems of early sound plus the acting is top notch (with the exception of Anny Ondra). Sound may not blend seamlessly into the movie but it definitely enhances one of the better Hitchcock films.

Despite the shaky editing and sound, the film nevertheless reveals the seed of genius that would later bloom in its director (especially his skill as a storyteller to be suggestive rather than graphic). Anny Ondra is the standout among the cast, her character Alice White being the only one that really generates interest (not that the rest are bad really, they just don't have too much to do from an acting perspective).

"},{"Title":"A Sound Beginning","Date":"21 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is Alfred Hitchcock's first motion picture talkie - and, the director's growth as a film artist is on excellent display. Blackmail was begun as a silent, and defies the standard for films of its type; usually, these creaky hybrids would be better off remaining completely non-talking. But, Hitchcock welcomes the developing medium with an extraordinary flair. Especially effective are the heroine's scream being overridden by a landlady discovering her victim's stabbed-to-death body, and the gossipy customer tormenting said heroine with her reflections on knives&#x85; Knives&#x85; KNIVES! Of course, talking technology isn't perfect. The lead actress' heavily-accented voice was dubbed live; otherwise, she is fine in the role. Even worse, the story isn't very well-structured. Most obviously, the beginning and ending are very strange. For some reason, the completely silent with sound effects opening reel is retained; at least, it seems like it could be the same one used in the silent version. It doesn't relate very well to the main story, but is reprised in the ending. You will see, however, one of Hitchcock's best cameo appearances, as the story begins&#x85; While quarreling on a date with detective boyfriend John Longden (as Frank Webber), fickle Anny Ondra (as Alice White) flirts with charismatic artist Donald Calthrop (as Tracy). Incredibly, she ditches Mr. Longden, and leaves with Mr. Calthrop, who invites her to his apartment. To see his etchings. Really. The two continue flirting, with Calthrop charming Ms. Ondra right out of her dress. But, when he moves in for the thrill, Ondra has second thoughts. She wants to get dressed, and leave. When Calthrop's advances become attempted rape, Ondra stabs him dead.Interestingly, Hitchcock turns Ondra's act of self-defense into murder by making her guilty; through not only his direction, but also Ondra's guilt-ridden performance. A truthful explanation, to her boyfriend and his Scotland Yard detective colleagues, would almost certainly call her reputation into question; after all, what was she doing in the horny artist's apartment? The jesting portrait of a clown, who mocks Ondra when she is in Calthrop's apartment returns to laugh at us (the viewers) as the picture ends. But, Hitchcock did not want Blackmail to end as it does. In his essay Direction (for Footnotes to the Film), Hitchcock connects the opening sequence with the story proper; and, more importantly, he reveals the original intent for Blackmail The blackmailer was really a subsidiary theme. I wanted him to go through and expose the girl. That was my idea of how the story ought to end. I wanted the pursuit to be after the girl, not after the blackmailer, the director explained. This would have made the story much more interesting, and matches Ondra's guilt-charged performance. Hitchcock wanted to have boyfriend Longden lead the pursuit, and try to help Ondra escape through the window, not pursue Calthrop.Hitchcock concludes, Then the rest of the police arrive, misinterpret what he is doing, and say, 'Good man, you've got her,' not knowing the relationship between them. Now the reason for the opening comes to light. You repeat every shot used first to illustrate the (detective's) duty theme, only now it is the girl who is the criminal. The young man is there ostensibly as a detective, but of course the audience know he is in love with the girl. The girl is locked up in her cell and the two detectives walk away, and the older one says, 'Going out with your girl tonight?' The younger one shakes his head. 'No. Not tonight.' ******* Blackmail (6/30/29) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Anny Ondra, John Longden, Donald Calthrop, Cyril Ritchard "},{"Title":"Fans of dreadful Hollywood sentimental tripe need not apply !","Date":"9 April 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This is a great film if you are interested in the conversion to sound, or if you like Hitchcock.As it is Hitchcock's, and the British Film Industry's first sound film, you see a mixture of techniques from sound and silent film, Hitchcock wanted to show what sound in a film could do and he succeeded, the scene with the repetition of the word 'knife' is one such example.If you want to see a piece of film history, and can ignore a couple of lengthy scenes then this film is for you!You need to look at the film in terms of the time it was made, the technology may be a bit basic or the acting not up to your standards, but its great all the same.

The innovation I'm referring to is, of course, sound. The jump from silent movies to talkies was a major one and not all directors could cope with the change incredibly well. Blackmail is Hitchcock's first ever talkie, and it's admittedly a bit rough, but not too bad. It tells the story of Alice White, the daughter of a shopkeeper in London. One night she meets a man who ends up inviting her into his art studio. While there this man tries to rape Alice, so she murders him. The guilt and paranoia immediately sets in as Alice's world comes crashing down around her as the cover up gets out of hand. Alice's boyfriend, Frank, is the police detective assigned to the case. He finds out about Alice's guiltiness, but so does someone else. Thus, a twisted tale of blackmail and treachery occurs. It's a tale that is simple enough, and provides for a mildly entertaining little flick.Hitchcock is obviously a very stylistic director who has his own very specific ways of going about things. He builds suspense in his own unique ways and weaves his intricate stories so carefully. When making the awkward jump to talkies Hitchcock had to change his formula up a bit with the new resources available to him. Blackmail marks his first attempt at creating his suspenseful atmosphere with sound. Thus it is a little rough around the edges and is missing that air of Hitchcockian brilliance. There isn't anything particularly special about Blackmail. It's a simple, even somewhat dull, story without a lot of complexity or sophistication. However, we can see the first inklings of Hitchcock's style begin to establish here in the way the characters banter, the way the plot tries to twist and turn, and the way the film ends. These innovations are a bit restricted here, but we all know where Hitchcock would be headed after this film.There isn't much else to say about Blackmail. It isn't a terribly engaging film and it's fairly forgettable. For die hard Hitchcock fans it is interesting to watch because of the significance of this film within his filmography. As Hitchcock's very first talkie this film is one worth noting, if only for that fact. Everything else about the film is decent, but there's nothing tremendous here.

To attach his name with any project gives that project a leg up. This happens with many major directors Capra, Welles, Huston...the list is simply endless. Their fans think they can do no wrong, even if the film isn't that good.BLACKMAIL was Hitchcock's last silent movie, and first sound film. It was also one of the first two sound films in British motion pictures. So it is historically significant - a milestone film everyone is aware of, but one few necessarily watch. He does (in my view) one really good sequence in it the robbery and chase in the British Museum. Fortunately this is in the conclusion of the film, and it does help the movie that it is at the end (it raises the excitement of what really is a dull movie). But that said, the defects of the film's plot, and the transition to sound planning, stand out.Noteworthy too, by the way, is that it is the second most famous titled work that Cyril Richard showed up in that has survived. Here we see the young Cyril as an artist, a lady's man (which is surprising), a would-be rapist, and a corpse to push the plot along. Not quite the same thing as his dashing and vigorous Captain Hook in the television version of PETER PAN, but sometimes artists can't pick and choose what they will be memorable for. If you are interested, while looking over his movie/television credits, I noted the next interesting movie he did pop up in was THE WINSLOW BOY (1949) in an extra role. His best grown-up role on stage, as Sir Sir in THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT THE SMELL OF THE CROWD, unfortunately was never filmed or taped (but there is a record of his and Anthony Newley's singing).As is pointed out Donald Calthrop gave the best performance, as the blackmailer, of the three leads. The hero and heroine are somewhat colorless in comparison to Calthrop and Richard. The plot too is somewhat stupid (as also was pointed out) because Anya Ondra could have defied the blackmailer by showing she was attacked and defended herself (as again was pointed out). The behavior of her boyfriend (John Longden), however, is less defensible. Policeman are not supposed to tamper with evidence. However, her relationship with Longden points the way to Sylvia Sidney's with John Loder in SABOTAGE, and Theresa Wright's with MacDonald Carey's in SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and Cary Grant's with Eva Marie Saint's in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (among other Hitchcock films - and better ones).Hitchcock apparently re-shot the whole film with sound (and secretly) because of an order from the studio to only do the last reel in sound. He felt it was silly and so secretly re-shot it all in sound. BAD IDEA ALF. The problem with a last minute change like that (as Hitchcock would have soon realized, but never admitted) is that you need a full script with complete dialog to carry off something like a total film in sound. If one watches BLACKMAIL, for two thirds of it the sound is quite limited to very occasional talking. There are huge periods when people aimlessly move about without saying anything. It's very annoying after awhile Are we to see this as a silent movie (where this would work)? Well, turn off the sound! But what are they saying? Well then, put on the sound but give them something worthwhile to hear and without long, pointless gaps! Hitch tried to bridge the two, and flopped. His fans admire his being the first, and this being his first talkie. Well and good, but it does not begin to compare with the films he began to make from 1934 - 1939 in England, and the films he made in Hollywood.

Sadly, the result, originally planned as a silent with a number of scenes re-shot with sound and sound FX added to external shots is lumpy and uneven. Hitch, who was originally a writer of the dialog cards shown through silent movies didn't yet grasp the value of the spoken word and subtle acting for the camera. Consequently there is much hammy mugging to express anger, sadness, dismay and panic. Anny Oudra, subsequently a BIG star in German and Czech movies is very attractive but the need to dub another actress's voice in a disastrous cut glass accent, totally wrong for a store keeper's daughter is an epic fail. Similarly, Donald Calthrop, the blackmailer adopts a stage London accent that hovers somewhere between Claridges and Bethnal Green. The most egregious casting has to be John Longden as the hunky leading man, he wears an ill fitting suit, too short in the sleeve and leg and spends much of his time with his hands either in his pockets or massaging them menacingly at chest level. He seems to have only three expressions, anger, with dark brows furrowed, joy, with a rictus of a smile and baffled, with head cocked and eyes half closed.The movie has a place in history but as a story it is uneven and pedestrian and sunk by the limited skills of it's leading players.

The psychological terror is also terrific, though not as sophisticated as in his later films. Hitchcock took good use of what was possible at the time, concerning effects, editing tricks and the likes. The plot is pretty good, like with most of Hitchcock's films. The acting is pretty good, especially considering that it's one of the first talking movies, and the actors were not terribly experienced with that kind of acting. The movie moves along at an acceptable pace, though it isn't as exciting or psychologically terrifying as many of his later movies.

I read somewhere that it does exist, but I saw the sound version marketed by Laserlight Video.

This dual version dilemma is the same thing that occurred with the French film Prix de beaut√© (Miss Europe)--the movie was originally silent, but they decided to clumsily add some sound and claim it was a talkie. Both films featured newly redone scenes where the actors talked but also many silent scenes (that were shown at a different frame-rate--thus making the silent part look too fast and jerky) and some clever scenes where voices are dubbed horribly over scenes which were obviously silent originally. In both films, they did this latter stunt by showing the actors from behind and sloppily pasting sound over the scene. I really wish they had either just shown the original version or re-shot the entire thing--this hybrid version isn't done very well.The plot itself is pretty good stuff, though. A young woman is sneaking behind her boyfriend's back to see another man. Unfortunately, this other man is a total cad and tries to rape the girl! She escapes only by performing an escape highly reminiscent of Grace Kelly's in Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER. The rest of the film is awfully exciting as well, as a scumbag apparently saw something and tries to blackmail both this girl and her boyfriend--who happens to be a detective investigating the death of the cad!!! While really tough to believe, I like how this was handled--and the ending was just terrific. This excellent ending helped make up for the slow spots and roughness of the film.Finally, for all those Hitchcock Watchers out there that love to spot the director as he sneaks himself into small scenes, this one features one of the best of any of his films.

But truth being told, the movie really isn't among the greatest in its genre. Even the master himself obviously still had some learning to do. No disgrace, since this is the first 'talkie' from the master of suspense. Well, not exactly entirely a talkie in my book, since the movie is still mostly shot in silent movie style. Sound came available during the making of this movie, which was reason for Hitchcock to re-shoot certain parts of the movie with sound. It doesn't exactly give the movie a very consistent style and makes the editing look clumsy at parts.The movie is a bit of a drag at points, with also some overlong pointless dialog and long shots. The movie does luckily get better when the suspense kicks in and the movie turns into a real thriller. But soon again the movie starts to tend to be overlong at points. It also restrains the movie its story and keeps it rather simplistic. The movie gives you the feeling it had more potential in its story really.There are some great, almost artistic like looking shots within the movie, which still makes this a certainly better than average one and also more interesting to watch. it's a very creatively put together movie, with also some great camera-work, lighting and use of shadows. Of course the museum chase at the end of the movie is the highlight of the movie. It's a greatly directed sequence that is great looking and constructed. It showed Hitchcock's talent and was a premise of things to come. The actors certainly aren't among the greatest of their period. Their excuse could be that this was their first talkie as well though.It's not the most exciting Hitchcock you'll ever see. Even as an early thriller and for 1929 standards it isn't among the most exciting or best ones but it's a movie worth watching for its artistic creativity.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"Civen more credit than what it's worth","Date":"7 August 2005","Score":"4 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" Given much more credit than what it's worth because of its landmark quality. Blackmail was England's first talking picture and Alfred Hitchcock's second suspense film. It can be said, however, that some of Hitchcock's best style and technique is found in this early film. As we follow Alice, a girl who has murdered in self defense the man she was fooling around with, we see what it is like to bear a guilty conscience. She picks out the word knife in a conversation until it is all she hears. She sees the limp hand of the dead man everywhere. A painting of a court jester, the only witness to her crime, appears to laugh directly at her. These techniques may be brilliant, but Blackmail is still a poor film in every other aspect. Having switched from a silent to a talking picture halfway through production, the film seems disjointed and awkward. Some scenes were kept silent, some were filmed with sound, and some were simply dubbed later. Taking place in a twenty four hour period, the blackmail itself never really has time to gain momentum. No sooner does the blackmailer come forward to threaten Alice than he finds himself being chased by the police. You couldn't even call the character a villain. Still, the film might have worked better had the actors and writers been up to the task of adapting to the new medium. They were not. The film's climactic chase scene might be the only thing that makes it worth watching.

Perhaps not.  If the film had been truly great it wouldn't have mattered anyway; but you might care to try the experiment of coming to the film cold and THEN researching - in which case you should read no further.The difficulties Hitchcock faced in converting to sound could hardly have been greater.  The studio decided to plump for sound after production had begun.  Some scenes were shot as if for a silent film but made their way into the final cut anyway.  His star, Anny Ondra, did not speak English - so she had to mime her lines syllable by syllable while another actress in the wings delivered them for her.  (Hitchcock lacked the technology to even record the dialogue separately.)  If you think that this would lead to an awkward and all but unwatchable performance, you would be right.  It gets in the way of her performance to such an extent that in one scene, when she is looking around anxiously, all I could think of was Anny Ondra, wondering where her ghost voice had got to.This is a deep problem, not a trivial one.  Hitchcock is at his best when he is at his most assured, taking us through long tracking shots are passing us intimate close-ups like a master of ceremonies who is never at a loss for something to say.  The glory of Hitchcock is in the fluid technicalities. When they are clumsy, as they are here, the result makes us wince.  (At least, it makes me wince.)  A story that MIGHT, under other circumstances, have grown into something intriguingly ambivalent, here just seems confused.Blackmail is of historical interest, and all of that, but note that it was only really popular in the early days of sound when people would watch anything that talked.  Let's be honest.  Talkies have been around for over seventy years, and we're now in a position to know that the early experiments - this one included - simply weren't very good.

It's already been covered.So I plug in the second disc of my Alfred Hitchcock set. The next movie is Blackmail. Pop over to IMDb.Girl offs rapist. Boyfriend cop covers it up. Language English. Good, I'm not a big fan of silent movies. I've seen enough of them already. Start movie, no sound, watch more. It certainly looks like a silent movie. Now they are talking but there's still no sound, check volume, it's up. Stop movie, look at menu. Yes, the last one on the disc is Blackmail (1928). Back to IMDb Yes, language English. Well something's wrong. Start movie over. Still no sound. Flying Squad Van(tm) cops make a pinch, very quietly. Maybe this is the rapist. Isn't he supposed to be dead? Girl ID's the perp and off to the pokey with him, still not dead. Pair of flatfoots saunter off and I hear whispers. Turn up volume and it's chitchat, still not understandable but doesn't sound important. I hope the whole thing isn't going to be like this. On to a rather disturbing scene in the overcrowded men's room with a bunch of half naked cops and one guy playing with a pair of handcuffs. Oh my. Once we flee from that scene we end up with the dynamic duo entering a room with our starlet in it and BLAMMO, voice! Welcome to the talkies. History in the making...well 80 years ago. I wonder what it would have been like back in the day to actually be there when talkies made it to the theaters. I can imagine applause or at least excited whispering. I don't think the movie would have really needed to be very good. And it just so happens that this one isn't. Oh it's not terrible but it's pretty rough. Way too much time spent learning how to judge a good cigar. I'll keep the lesson in mind if I ever start smoking cigars and can afford really good ones. Maybe it was supposed to show that this guy had once been well off but has fallen on hard times. I don't know. A nice chase through the Museum. In fact it's the highlight of the movie. The rest is pretty much just padding. How can we justify chasing someone through the museum? Oh, we'll have the cops chasing a murderer. No, the murderer is a hottie and the star of the film. Okay, just some down on his luck guy off the street then. Splendid! I would have at least liked for the guy to try to blackmail Alice and Frank for more than just a fine cigar and a meal. Hardly worthy of the death penalty. How about asking for, oh, I don't know, money maybe? In my opinion a forgettable film except for it's historical value. 3/10 to leave plenty of room for Hitchcock's and others' much better works.

Perhaps that is where this film truly belongs, locked away in a dusty drawer, labeled For movie historians only.This is an example of Hitchcock's early work and by to-day's standards is full of mistakes and imperfectionsFirst of all the acting Anny Ondra who plays Alice White the daughter is the only convincing actor. The film comes alive when she is in the scene. Apart from her father, the rest of the cast are mainly expressionless actors. When this film was made the scenes in which Alice changes her clothes and takes down her stockings (legs in close-up!) were probably considered titillating and very risqu√©.Now the sound The sound is very uneven at times requiring constant adjustment. Klaxon horns and trains are deafening. The sound of a canary singing away in the early morning goes on and on, beautiful at first but becoming annoying as it goes on for too long.Now the editing The film needs to go back to the cutting room. This is not a slide show, yet one scene jumps to the next. The film needs to go more smoothly. One feels that it has been put together in a hurry.Now the story itself Despite its weaknesses there is an ounce of truth in it. Ask yourself How many murders have been solved by pinning the guilt on a dead man who cannot defend himself?  "}]
