I groaned because it looked like any other Family Channel movie with cheesy lines, etc. However, I was very wrong. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was recently advertised to be shown on TV again, and I felt nostalgic about it. But, I couldn't help thinking that since I was about 13 when I first saw it, my tastes might have changed, and I would hate it now. Again, I was definitely wrong.This movie can appeal to any age group, because it has plot lines involving a wide range of ages. All the plot lines offer something funny and cute, even if sometimes unbelievable. But with a movie like this, you have to be able to suspend your grasp on reality for a couple hours.If you're looking for a good, light movie to pass some time with, you will not be disappointed by this one. I recommend it to anyone.

Something for everyone in the family.  Chevy Chase and Jean Smart have fairly small roles as the parents but they are a joy to watch.  Stories involving younger kids reminded my of Our Gang, the stories involving teens reminded me of Ferris Bueller.  Rated PG for mischief (say what?), and the word butt.  Emmanuelle Chriqui plays the most popular girl in school who is not only drop dead gorgeous but a girl next door type who is nice to everyone.

The idea is that the snow plow guy takes away snow days by clearing the roads of snow, so he is the enemy. Coincidentally, he is not a nice guy. In real life, most cities have more than one person driving snow plows, right? And not all of them are jerks. So it was difficult for me to get into the idea of the kids doing dirty tricks on the snow plow guy.The romance in the story is too simple. There is not enough depth, it is more like a clich√© romance. The writers try to complete the romance by making the boyfriend a big jerk and I think that was overdone. It made the comedy ugly.

(He ruined it by plowing the roads and making it so the kids could go to school after each snow day.) The older brother of one of the kids is trying to find a way to tell a popular girl that he likes her. The plot is that simple. The plot is not meshed it is just like any other movie, there is more than one thing going on, but it would only confuse you if you are an easily confused person (after all it was intended for a younger audience, and they get it!). There is no harsh or adult language used in the film, to my knowledge.This film has some laughs, especially when Chris Elliott is at his hammiest behind the wheel of his snowplow. Some things seem off, but it's a kids' movie, so I'll let stuff like that go for the most part. Also, there are many story-lines that just aren't woven together well. We're not sure who the main character is supposed to be (it doesn't seem to be the narrator - the adolescent older brother - since his story is in the background). The problem is that they did not focus enough on the fun aspect of this film, the snow day itself. They spent too much time on this kid trying to get this popular girl (whom he then rejects) and that had nothing to do with a snow day, other than the mantra he kept repeating. Snow Day is pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It's good for a deep snowy day if you want to stay inside. Grab a hot coco make yourself comfortable and enjoy. You're sure to get a good laugh.Overall rating 6 out of 10.

I can see how you can thread together multiple plots and characters during a single day (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World did it perfectly so many years ago), but these filmmakers, and ESPECIALLY Nickelodeon weren't prepared to make something like that work. Chris Elliot's Snowplow Man is also such a hateful character. This was during the time when Chris Elliot was somehow in every comedy movie, because for some reason, everyone thought he was hilarious in There's Something About Mary (that would be half-right).

Sure it's got the one or two crude humor jokes and sure it's hokey at times, but it's a hilarious adventure about what can happen on a snow day.Hal and Natalie are a brother and sister living in Syracuse with their weatherman father, stay-at-home computer addicted mom and baby brother Randy. The family is dysfunctional; Laura (the mom) is always on her webcam and never looks away from the screen, then gets angry when Randy makes a mess or wants to play with her. Tom (the father) has very low ratings and is constantly in competition with Chad Symmonz, a flashy modern weatherman who viewers all over town love. Randy is a defiant child always getting into things and making messes just for the hell of it. Hal has a fixation on a popular girl from his high school, Claire.Meanwhile, Natalie and her two friends (an overweight boy named Wayne and her best friend Chet) are mad that it's winter and Syracuse is in the middle of a heatwave, meaning there won't be any snow days, much to the joy of their school principal. Natalie wishes on her brother's favorite action figures for a snow day to come by...When Natalie gets her wish, the town suddenly changes. Anything can happen on a snow day, Natalie says, and it can. Laura is about to learn that a family matters more than a laptop screen, Tom is about to find the courage to stand up to Chad Symmonz. Hal is going to discover that his real true love has been right by his side the whole time and Natalie and her friends will finally have the courage to stand up to the evil Snowplowman, the sadistic and somewhat pervy guy who always foils her plans of a perfect day off of school.I had the movie novelization of Snow Day as a kid (I bought it at a second-hand store when I was three). I've gotta say, the movie is much better, I love the animation in the intro, and there are various funny scenes, from Tom knocking over an ice sculpture of Chad to a janitor finding the words Al Martino bites the big one written above a toilet at his skating rink (he dips the cleaning rag in the toilet to get it wet as he cleans away the graffiti). The only thing I just didn't understand was Wayne (the fat kid). Every time he runs, a farting noise plays in the background, it's unnecessary and pretty crude.

This means he must resort to gimmicks such as a hula skirt during a wintertime heat wave, and a snowman outfit when it finally does snow.  John Schneider is the good-looking and cocky first-place weatherman Chase must compete with.  Chase's wife works too hard, and his children want it to snow.  Hal, his oldest, fantasizes about a girl named Claire, who has a boyfriend, but doesn't realize that a girl he considers a friend wants more.  His daughter Natalie wishes for snow, and one night Chase notices strange readings on his equipment.  The next day there is a record snowfall.  The kids eagerly listen to the list of closings on the radio and are disappointed to not hear schools listed, while the stereotypically evil principal is delighted. The radio announcer realizes his mistake, and the kids are happy (the principal is furious).  Hal can't go out to try to win Claire; he has to babysit his younger brother while his mother goes to work.  Then his mother can't get out (this does not stop her from working), so Hal is off the hook and ready to begin his quest.  (Wonder why she didn't make him shovel the driveway?)  Natalie and her friends throw snowballs at the principal and plot against the scary Snowplow Man, who is said to do terrible things to kids.  Hal tries one plot after another to win Claire.  The younger son paints himself blue and goes out in the snow nearly naked, among other things, but with a computer and a secretary she demanded go to the office, she still gets some work done.  There is good music where the kids go ice skating, except when the kids distract the DJ and put on music they like; this is an opportunity for Hal.  Another advantage for Hal  his father is on television.  Silly fun; nothing too offensive.  A wonderful performance by the girl playing Natalie.  SPOILERS Chase does eventually put Schneider in his place, but I was disappointed he didn't give a scientific explanation of how snow forms (similar to the wonderful opening sequence with models of water molecules coming together to form crystals, worthy of an educational film for science classes); it was enough for the assembled crowd that Schneider couldn't do it.   Also, the kids capture and tie up Snowplow Man and try to undo his work so they can't go back to school.  It's a bizarre scene kids will love.

Is Chevy so in need of money that he needs to pick a script like this? How disappointing.Even the ending with the nice guy, Hal, and never-noticed-her-before best friend-who-is-a-girl, Lane, is telegraphed from the first minute. Naturally the bodacious beauty he is after will never be attained. Besides which, in this genre, if she's so stupid that she goes out with her idiot jock boyfriend for 3-years and doesn't wonder if there is anything better in life, there is no way she will be worth having. Claire, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui, is nevertheless very cute (and a good diver apparently, her only other redeeming feature being that her favourite animal is a zebra) but this film needs to state in capital letters that beautiful doesn't mean intelligent.It takes a more grown-up film like Cruel Intentions or American Pie to suggest that a mediocre bloke could get a beautiful girl, and they aren't monuments to great filmmaking either.Other than a winning performance by our hero's little sister - and Zena Grey is terrific as Natalie - this admittedly good-natured film splutters all the way through to a predictable ending as weatherman Chevy finally makes his television opponent admit that he doesn't even know what makes snow snow. Well meaning doesn't equal funny, however.The only thing that gives the film an energetic feel is the cartoon-like music score by well-known Danny Elfman orchestrator, Steve Bartek, who really adds a sense of adventure to the entire one-joke idea.

The story involving the little kids was kind of cheesy  (that is being kind) but since I'm a teenager, I won't come down too hard. The Hal / Lane story was pretty cute though. Even though it's been done, it was refreshing to see the two friends that were falling for each other in the movie really weren't super models. Snow Day could have easily pulled a She's All That trick. (The outcasts could be on the cover of Seventeen in a heartbeat) But you won't find that here. Schuyler Fisk and Mark Webber both shine without looking gorgeous or being a heartthrob. They just looked like regular kids. I wish we would find that in more films.Since then, I've looked out for Mark Webber too. We'll see Schuyler and Mark both in the future. All in all, Snow Day wasn't total fluff. It's not as bad as the trailers make it seem. And if you don't like the story, at least you can end the movie listening to Schuyler's song It's Not Her on the closing credits.

And since this snow is more solid than rain, kids can play in it and have fun. And that is exactly what the message of the film gets through.Although the story is slightly silly (young Natalie tries to stop the Snowplow Man, Hal tries to get the girl of her dreams, their dad is competing with another weatherman, and so on), its heart is in the right place, and for that, I laughed and smiled my way through.The acting is surprisingly good. My favorite was little 10 year old Zena Grey as Natalie. She's ever so adorable in her first major role (she's had small bits on Saturday Night Live and in The Bone Collector), and she acts exactly like a young girl her age should. Let's hope more filmmakers note the talent in this cute little girl. Mark Webber is also terrific as brother Hal, he's very honest and true in the film, instead of being the typical teen stereotype in so many of today's films of that nature. And there is added support by Chevy Chase, Chris Elliot, Josh Peck, and Jean Smart, among others. Even the direction by Chris Koch is great, there are some nice shots here (like the opening shot where a snowflake falls and lands on Natalie's mouth as she walks away).What a nice surprise it is to see a film released so early in the year to become a surprisingly lighthearted and funny piece of entertainment.

For the teens, there is the love plot as Hal tries to pursue the unobtainable Claire. The chevy chase sub plot is fairly weak, and will not probably be enough to keep adults entertained. The last sub plot of the over worked mom trying to balance business with her family is the weakest of the four, though the kid playing her toddler does a great job and is very funny. Claire is a true beauty, and she provides a fair bit of eye candy for those who appreciate a beautiful woman. Hal is pretty cute as well, sporting unconventional good looks.This movie tries to do too much. I'm left wishing the mother sub plot was cut, so more time could be spent on the Hal/Claire sub plot. The movie tries to invoke a sense of mysticism, that anything can happen on a snow day. If you're willing to open yourself up to this concept, that a snow day is a magical wonderful time when anything can happen, you'll probably enjoy this fun feel good movie.My brother actually plays Bill, Hal's sidekick in the movie. =D "},{"Title":"what an enjoyable movie","Date":"13 February 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  well i really enjoyed this movie and was surprised to see that schuyler fisk was in it as Lane. the last movie that i saw her in was my friend joe which is also an excellent family movie. well this movie focuses around an unusually nice winter but that all changes in one night and the kids don't have to go to school. it's every kids' dream to wake up with a couple feet of snow and not have to go to school. there are several storylines in the movie and each one equally interesting. this is a great movie for the kids and i would highly recommend it.

Chevy Chase was funny as a weather man, but the weather man war was kind of lame. They could have had a better and more entertaining battle. The teen love story just ate up too much time and seemed artificial. The snowmobile chase was a poor attempt to insert some action to keep the viewer awake. I would guess children would like this.

Just look at the success of Shrek and you'll see what I mean.  Now THAT'S a film with wit and intelligence behind its silly humor, and that's why it works for both kids and adults.  So I'm no longer going to say, Hey, it's a family film.  What do you expect?  Maybe all you parents out there are willing to lower your cinematic standards to please your young ones, but I sure as hell ain't.After watching that horrible, disastrous, disgusting, mindless comedy Good Burger (and you wonder why children's IQs are getting lower and lower by the second), I promised I would never watch another film produced by Nickelodeon EVER again!  Well, being that I'm also an open-minded moviegoer I decided What the heck? when I spotted this movie on the racks of my local West Coast Video.The first thirty minutes are UNBEARABLE!!!  I had extreme difficulty watching it straight-through.  My thumb was itching for the Stop button like you wouldn't believe!  Once they introduced the bumbling principal, I almost dropped dead.  Is that the biggest cliche in the book or what??? One of my favorite comedies of all time is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which involves a dean of students (Jeffrey Students) bumbling around like an ape, but was he stupid?  No.  He was just clumsy and had very bad luck.  Here, we have a stupid principal who bumbles (predictably) around, and the kids throw snowballs at him.  I know that kids hate their principals (Hell, I didn't like mine all that much either), but I think it's the portrayal of adults that ticks me off.  It's always a cliche in kiddie flicks for the adults to be complete morons, since it's from their point of view.  And since they hate principals even more, we have to make that person the biggest idiot on the face of the planet.  One of those tired cliches that you just want to beat the hell out of the screenwriters for using.To add to our list of tired cliches, we have the inevitable romantic subplot.  But I will say, that chick who played the love interest was HOT HOT HOT!!  Like in all these stories, she's going with this airhead jock who makes you wonder, What did she see in him in the first place?  And the guy who has a major crush on her (Mark Webber) and supposedly seems invisible to her has this clingy female friend who clicks with him one hundred-percent and has the hots for him, but just doesn't know how to reveal it to him. It's no mystery how this is going to turn out.One critic made a good point.  This is one film where you actually want MORE of Chevy Chase.  He makes a few appearances as a competitive TV weatherman. Chase hasn't exactly been in his prime.  His last work was a supporting role in the low-budget comedy Dirty Work with Norm McDonald and Artie Lange. A movie I still enjoy as a guilty pleasure, but let's face it...it wasn't a box office success, like many of Chevy's previous movies.  However, he's still a fine comedian and knows how to deliver a joke.  This is one of Chevy's (recent) works, where you're actually begging to see more of him on screen.  Chris Elliott wasn't that funny as the Snowplow Man (though I wouldn't exactly blame him), but I appreciate his effort.  Elliott is usually the kind of comic actor who can be funny if given a good script, but obnoxious if given a bad one.  Here, he's in the borderline.  He doesn't try to ham it up as much as, say, he did in that annoying role in Scary Movie 2.  Some of the kids were much more annoying than him.  I actually wanted him to run those little ba**ards down with his plow.OK, enough with the negative.  I'm not giving this film a high recommendation, but I found it amazingly innocuous (once it passed the 30-minute mark) for a Nickelodeon-produced flick.  Of course, we could've done without that recurring gag involving the fat kid farting (it seems like anytime there's an obese character in a kiddie flick, he has to be the butt--no pun intended--of all the flatulence jokes), but as a general rule I found it to be a surprisingly smooth ride the rest of the way.  I still received only the occasional Ha as the film continued to progress, but at least I wasn't grumbling like I was at first.  All the story arcs are resolved in a predictable manner, but not in a way in which you're torchered by the obvious cliches.Snow Day is not a film I'd recommend for the 18 and older crowd, but if you're an adult with children who eat up this kind of fluff, it's moderately easy to take.  Just let the kids watch the first 30 minutes by themselves, then decide to join them on the couch.My score  5 (out of 10)          "},{"Title":"Standard coming of age flick with a few good moments","Date":"2 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  SNOW DAY is an almost magical term for kids, and anyone else who experienced these words in their youth, certainly can relate. The problem with this movie unfortunately, is that it takes on way too many plot complications than the script can handle. In doing so, the setting up of each plot takes time, and this is not good for an approximately 90 minute movie. The effect of all of this is tedium in many parts. If the script had been less ambitious, SNOW DAY would have been a much better movie.Kudos have to be mentioned for the cast, and there were some very funny moments indeed. I must also congratulate the makers for some rather inspired casting choices. My favorite, above and beyond, has to be Iggy Pop playing the ice rink owner/DJ, who plays nothing but Al Martino(!) over the speakers. The graffiti in the bathroom gag was pretty good, too. Chris Elliott, in a DELIVERANCE mountain man motivated performance, is very comical as the sadistic Snow plow man. However, these are not enough to keep this flick afloat. The very young ones might appreciate the humor and situations. For the rest of us though, it sinks under the weight of its script, leaving us to drift haplessly in the dull drink.

It is snowing right now. All this snow reminded me of this Nickelodeon movie, Snow Day. It also can remind you of when you're a kid and you seem to like snow more than now, as snow often times means NO SCHOOL. You can always wonder when we get snowstorms if there will be school. Well, I remember somebody once telling me something. I can't remember who told me, but it's sticked with me since I heard it. If the roads aren't clear, then activities get cancelled. If the roads are clear then things like school aren't cancelled. Yeah, it normally seems like snow is at it's worst when it is accumulating as you might not want to be traveling then. You can get stranded. But, once it stops snowing, it normally doesn't take a long time for the plows to clean up the snow.This movie is a Nickelodeon movie that mostly gives a kids perspective on a snow day. Kids excited not to have school on a snow day, making the most of it and trying to stop the bad guy the plowman. I remember this movie being advertised, and I invited two of my friends for a sleepover and we saw this movie in the movie theaters. I was in 7th Grade at the time, and I even encouraged both of my parents to come. My Dad wasn't up to seeing it until I told him a commercial I saw on the movie which I thought was the plot of the movie, it turned out it wasn't. A commercial of it snowing all across the U.S. including Florida. The plot was where it was snowing in a specific region.So yeah, part of the plot of the movie is kids having a snow day, along with certain other characters like a high school student, it's been so long since I've seen this movie I forget his name, but it shows his love story. Also, the snow day from an adults perspective in this movie. How the adults are reacting to the snow. We see the bad guy from the movie who is the plowman and like the school principal. The kids do everything they can to stop him to have more snow days.Well, as an adult reviewing this movie years later I have to say some of my inner perceptions from the movie. The movie is a little cheesy and disgusting. The plowman is a disgusting character and so is one of the kids. Even at the time I saw this in 7th Grade, I thought it was more of a kid friendly Nick movie, like more for prepubescent kids. But, I wouldn't see how a lot of kids would really enjoy this. There are a couple of things that make this movie fake. For one do you think that many kids could go against the plowman, and not get in trouble with the law. Besides, there should be more than one plow. It is not just for the kids to go back to school, but the rest of the community to go to work. We all have our lives to live.I have also always thought about why school is important besides educating kids. My whole life, I have thought about what would happen if kids did not go to school. For one, it's nice for kids to go as they make friends with other kids around the community that go to the same school. It gives them something to do during the day, as days off from school and work aren't always so good or appreciative if you have SO MANY. Also, a lot of their parents who will be making money it allows the parents to go to work without having to stay at home with their kids, or just allows separation time from kids to adults. When kids are little, they seem to prefer being around their parents and can cry when they're away. But, it teaches kids at a young age that they can't be around their parents all day, and that in life we have responsibilities of places to go to and things to do everyday. A lot of kids would not be productive during the days if they were not required to go to school. So, this movie is a little over exaggerated and not realistic movie of showing how kids are on snow days. The person who wrote it almost made it sound like school is bad, but they did it in a fun way. This movie was still somewhat entertaining, but I have to give it a 3/10. I've seen scenes of the movie since I saw the movie. But, considering I didn't really like it when I saw it thinking it was cheesy, and thinks it might send the wrong message I give it a 3.

Living in the suburbs of Chicago my entire life, I vividly remember hearing reports of heavy snowfall that could potentially close schools, and going to bed those nights hoping to whatever God would listen to my ridiculous plea that I wouldn't have to go to school the following day. More often than not, it was wishful thinking on my part, due to the around-the-clock, persistent work of the snowplows, but on occasion, the snow and ice would be so bad that the school buses couldn't get through (the ultimate factor in a district's decision whether or not to close school) and I'd be blessed with great news when I woke up in the morning.These thoughts and memories flourished as I watched Chris Koch's Snow Day, but not because the film was extracting those paradoxically warm and fuzzy feelings, but because I was so disinterested in the characters and the events occurring in the film that the only outlet I had was my overactive, nostalgic mind. This is a film that has the ability to operate like an episode of the underrated Television show Recess, which concerned a group of six schoolage children who tried to do everything they could to live up the thirty minutes of liberation they got every school day. The kids in the show were bright, developed, adamant about sticking together, and clever in their abilities to stay one step ahead of their school administration. The children in Snow Day are a gaggle of underdeveloped and ill-behaved brats that mistake loud, ribald behavior and baffling choices as likability and logical motivations.The film concerns a group of young schoolkids in Syracuse, New York, who do everything they can to keep their school closed after heavy snowfall, which involves stopping the fearless snowplow driver (Chris Elliot) from getting through to plow the streets. One of the kids is Hal (Mark Webber), who spends the day trying to win the heart of his sweetheart Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard (Schuyler Fisk), who is secretly repressing feelings for him after a lifelong friendship. Then we have Natalie (Zana Grey), Hal's younger sister, and her two friends Wayne (Josh Peck), and Chet (Jade Yorker), who work to stop the aforementioned snowplow driver from plowing the sidestreets leading to the school. Finally, there's Hal and Natalie's father Tom (Chevy Chase), who works as a Television meteorologist, spends the day attempting to cover the record snowfall in a quicker manner than his competitor Chad Symmonz (John Schneider), both of whom fighting for their own job security.The biggest problem with Snow Day is it doesn't have a central focus, despite one pragmatically assuming that the effort to take out the snowplow driver would be the film's primary focus. The issue here is that the film doesn't invest enough time in the efforts to stop said driver, nor does it concoct many setups or provide much development to the idea that would allow one to believe what is actually happening in efforts to stop this man. Snow Day is simply a collection of subplots that make less a movie and more of an anthology film, strung together from comedic odds and ends, never materializing to something of a collective whole.Some of Snow Day's greatest sins could be forgiven if the film was the least bit humorous. Alas, however, Snow Day focuses on the kinds of things people with no knowledge of kids think kids say but never actually do; with that comes a barrage of stale, foreseeable humor and monotonous slapstick that never amounts to anything that is memorable in a long term sense. Even veteran actors like Chase and Elliot cannot save the project with their presence, for their characters have been hamfisted into pure stupidity and childishness beyond what should be acceptable for them as actors.Snow Day is a film bearing very little wit or craft in its writing and its characters. It's more or a less an assembly of parts, characters, situations, and subplots searching for a bigger picture to function in. It's the equivalent of someone dumping a toolbox all over the floor, with wrenches and hammers representing the actors, and the screws, nuts, bolts, and other connective devices representing things like writing, transitions, and characters, and hoping they'll all work together before their eyes and churn out something of untold greatness.Starring Mark Webber, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Zena Grey, Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Schuyler Fisk, Jean Smart, Josh Peck, Jade Yorker, and John Schneider. Directed by Chris Koch.

Natalie's big brother Hal is using this day to try to win the affections of Claire Bonner, the most popular girl in his high school, while Hal and Natalie's father Tom, a TV meteorologist, faces off against a rival meteorologist for weather coverage of the day's events......The only reason I even contemplated watching this was for Chase, just to see if there was still a little of the magic he gave us in the eighties, and early nineties. Well I can put your curiosity to rest, there is very little, but when he's on screen, the film is at its strongest.The rest of the film is your typical teen comedy. Boy trying to get girl, girls ex boyfriend trying to bully the entire town, and some sort of fantasy sub plot involving action figures, and Chris Elliott.Oh and of course, the guy who fancies the good looking girl, has a best friend, who is a girl, who is in love with him.Oh pray, I wonder how it will all turn out?.It isn't terrible.

(It's not a Christmas movie, but obviously still a winter movie.) If it wasn't for that assembly, I probably would have never even heard of the film to this day! I was in my early teens at the time, and can't remember exactly what I thought of the movie, but I might have enjoyed it just a tiny bit (I know I wasn't extremely bored, wondering when it was going to be over). It's been nearly seven years, and out of curiosity, I finally just watched this movie again, and this time, I know for sure that I didn't like it.It has been an incredibly warm winter in Syracuse, New York, until one night, when so much snow comes that school is cancelled the next day! Since the kids have the day off, they can go out and play in the snow, but unfortunately, the one they know as Snowplowman (a very nasty, self-centred man with bad teeth, who seems to care for nobody, other than his pet bird, who rides around with him in his snow plow) is out to make their lives miserable! Natalie Brandston is the leader of a group of elementary school students who are on a challenging mission to steal the snow plow from this man, so they can keep their school closed! Meanwhile, Natalie's teenage brother, Hal, attempts to score with Claire Bonner, something which so many other guys at his school wish to do! This movie is a comedy, but when I watched it a second time, I didn't laugh once (I don't even recall laughing at all the first time). I felt that at least the scenes with the school principal being pelted with snowballs everywhere he goes should have made me laugh, but they didn't. There are some things in the movie which many (including me) would find somewhat annoying, such as the disgusting sounds that Roger the Snowplowman sometimes makes, and the constant farts of a boy in Natalie's group. The teen romance part is also done rather poorly, basically fitting in with the rest of the film. Both the plot and the sub-plot are ridiculous! Overall, I found Snow Day simply boring, and some parts sort of made me feel like an idiot for watching it at my age (nearly 21)! Since most of this movie wasn't TOO bad for me, I won't give it any less than a 5/10, even though I gave Big Fat Liar the same rating, and thought it was better than this film. However, if I hadn't been shown Snow Day at school, meaning that I would probably still be unaware of its existence after all these years (like I said), it certainly wouldn't have been a great loss. I have no doubt in my mind that many kids would like this movie (which is a good thing, since it was made for them), but I wouldn't be surprised if I heard a bunch of kids say they didn't like it. So, I would say that it just might be worth a try for kids, but for those in their adolescent years or beyond, there's very little (if anything) to like. There might even be a good chance that you would think less of it than I do!

When a sudden snow storm hits everyone is excited, however the ploughman threatens to clear the snow to open the schools forcing the children to take drastic action.I didn't expect much from this comedy coming as it did from a kids tv channel, but it did win me over.  The jokes are silly but the material is just about savvy enough to make the film watchable for adults - even if it doesn't really put effort into winning an adult audience.  Because it is aimed at teens as much as babies, the film has a sort of maturity to the humour that works well enough to work out.  It doesn't totally work of course but it is entertaining enough to get by.  The romance plot with Hal is weak, as is stuff with Mrs Brandston.  However the battle between Natalie and the ploughman is exaggerated fun and all Tom's weatherman stuff is funny.The jokes are silly but good, sort of semi-grown up stuff as well as silly kids stuff.  I wasn't laughing out loud but I wasn't bored either.  The biggest surprise about the film though was the cast - how (and why) did it manage to get so many famous faces to give cameos?  Iggy Pop gives a minor character that will bring chuckles to adults, the gorgeous Chilli from TLC makes a brief and unnecessary appearance.  Grier shows her face for a few seconds for no reason.  Chase is good but underused as Tom, Grey is good as Nat but Webber is sort of lumbered with the bad plotline and is average. There are a few other famous faces but I forget them now without looking up the cast list.Overall this is not a great comedy but it was surprisingly enjoyable despite some weak elements to the plot and a sense of humour that is far from being sophisticated.  Regardless - it's silly fun and the kind of film that will keep children distracted while adults will have just enough to keep them from wanting to gouge their own eyes out.

Written by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi. Running Time 89 minutes. Rated PG (for comic mischief).Snow Day is a family comedy that can't decide what it is about, who the main character is, or what its problem is. The worst thing about this movie is that even if all of the above was clarified in depth, it still wouldn't have worked because the stakes simply aren't high enough. From the first ten pages of the screenplay the production was doomed; it brings new comprehension to the phrase too much too soon.Snow Day details the lives of a lot of characters, too many characters, over the course of a snow day, that eager sunrise where, local schools close to due unsafe driving conditions. There is Hal Brandstonb (Mark Webber), a high school teenager who has a desirable crush on a girl named Clare, Chad (John Schneider), who gets physical with any romantic competition, Laura Brandston (Jean Smart), who's occupation overworks her on a daily schedule, depriving her from valuable family time, Lane (Schuyler Fisk), a close friend of Hal, Tom Brandston (Chevy Chase) a struggling weather forecaster who wears childish costumes and does funny things, his executive (Pam Grier), who is angry that their television competition is phony, Snowplowman (Chris Elliott), a nasty snowplow driver whom the local children despise, and the school principal whom many kids bomb with snowballs.Who is the main character here? Where is the defining or development of him or her? Everything is exaggerated and over the top, from the characters to the unbelievable plot. The principal is bombarded with snowballs from unseen assassin-like kids throughout the entire running length; the Snowplowman chases after elementary aged children with his truck attempting to run them over, the teenage crush in which the formulas are repetitive, the weather forecaster's family member's silly behavior, the stations competition with an individual who looks like he is from an infomercial, and even the snowfall itself, which is well over ten feet high. Some characters are used as plot devices, having no shape or development, just hinged by the scripts every need.There is some fun with a few of the characters, and there are some very funny scenes and events that take place. Tom is hilariously portrayed by Chevy Chase, who offers the appropriate cynical personality for the goofy role. Other characters of interest are Snowplowman, Laura, the principal who contributes extravagant but slapstick parody, but never did I care about anything involving the teen romance. That subplot is contrived, typical, and contains so little chemistry. It is a dead end street, and is followed by an ending that would never occur in our wildest dreams. The characters are one dimensional, and lackadaisical; a complete waste of time.Throughout the production of Snow Day, I was continually asking myself questions. Questions like, is this movie about a snow day? A struggling weather forecaster? An overworked mother? A hapless teenage crush? Or perhaps the film was a portrayal of what happens when people are required to spend time together--taking the shape of a family comedy? In that case, we would need more information about each of the characters, so that we could care about them. Whatever the case may be, we still need a conflict in the story. Here, I wondered if the conflict was about a mother who couldn't get to work, a teenager who can't overcome fear to communicate with the girl of his dreams, or a horrible snow plow driver destroying the children's chance at having another snow day. With so many unanswered questions, an adolescent should rather spend time at school learning answers instead of wasting a valuable snow day away in the theater of Snow Day with their hands up waiting for answers that will never come.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

"},{"Title":"Snow Day Is Flaky Fun","Date":"26 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Snow Day is pretty flaky stuff. As the Nickelodeon Television Network's fourth feature film, this wholesome but prefabricated juvenile fodder emerges as tolerably entertaining comic nonsense with more than enough surprises and gender-bending twists to pass muster. Chevy Chase, Chris Elliot, Jean Smart, and John Schneider populate an appealing ensemble cast headed up by a youth Zena (The Bone Collector) Grey and Mark (Drive Me Crazy) Webber.Snow Day covers 24 frivolous hours in the lives of the Brandston clan when anything can happen after a freak blizzard blankets Syracuse, New York, and school is canceled. Children cheer, but their parents cringe. The snowstorm halts virtually everybody except the Brandstons. They refuse to let a little bad weather get in their way. Consequently, adults taking kids to see this harmless hokum should find themselves occasionally amused by some of the insights and antics in this quadruple-plotted saga.The Brandston kids, fifteen-year old Hal (Mark Webber) and ten-year old Natalie (Zena Grey) occupy the foreground. Hal carries a torch for the school sexpot, Claire Bonner (jailbait beauty Emmanuelle Chriqui of The Crow Wicked Prayer), and he believes that fate has given him a sign when she loses her anklet in the swimming pool. Hal recovers the trinket and bides his time for the right moment to return it.Fortuitously, Claire breaks up with her odious boyfriend, Chuck Wheeler (David Paetkau of AVPR Aliens Vs Predator - Requiem), and then shows an interest in Hal that sends Chuck into a boiling rage. Ironically, the other sweet gal on Hal, Lane Leonard (Schuyler Fisk of Orange County), cannot get the guy to notice her, even though she is a constant companion.Meanwhile, intrepid little Natalie and her plucky pals struggle to stop the unsavory Snowplowman (a hammy Chris Elliot of Cabin Boy) from clearing the streets so they can get an extra day off from school. Hunched over the wheel of his monstrous snowplow, nicknamed Clementine, with Trudy, his beaky black pet crow perched beside him; Snowplowman provides some hilarious over-the-top villainy. Snowplowman's reputation precedes him. Rumor has it that he assembled the chains on his huge tires from the braces of kids he ran down while shoveling snow.As meteorologist Tom Brandston (Chevy Chase of Christmas Vacation) somehow maintains his dignity at the third-rated TV station in a three channel market. Lately, Tom has been wearing absurd costumes when he delivers his forecast. Where Tom's boss, Tina (Pam Grier of Coffey), gets the idea that clowning will help them topple their competition, rival weatherman Chad Symmonz (John Schneider of Lake Placid 2) is anybody's guess. Tom sets out to expose Chad for the fraud that he is, especially after Symmonz takes credit for warning everybody about the accidental snowstorm.Although this potboiler boasts little redeeming artistic value, Snow Day qualifies nevertheless as ideal, family-oriented fare with nothing most objectionable than a fat kid that farts when he is frightened. Out of four stars, the above-average Snow Day scores two-and-a-half.

Half say it was miserable, half say family fun. If you have not yet viewed this and are relying on reviews to guide you, please allow me to help you on making a decision.The plot revolves around a snow storm hitting Syracuse during an unseasonaly warm winter. During the following 24 hrs., the people in the town (More so the kid than the adults) go on seperate quests- Weatherman Chevy Chase tries to prove that he is a better weather man then the local town celebrity; Jean Smart tries to balance an off-site meeting and her toddler brat; the school loser tries to school with the school babe after her jock boyfriend dumps her, while also trying to prevent the aforementioned jock from murdering him; And lastly the heroine, a third grade girl, sister of aforementioned loser, tries to stop a snowplow driver from plowing the streets.And now, the anaysis.The blunt truth 99.9% stupid kids stuff, .1% inside jokes aimed at adults.Every adult in the movie, except perhaps for Chevy Chase, is portrayed as cold and with character flaws. The principal, whose sole purpose in the movie is getting hit with a barrage of snowballs in every scene, is the stereotypical mean guy who dances around in his shorts and laughs at the kids when it is 70 degrees in January, and is portrayed just as kids would portray their principal in a story- one dimensional and mean because he is the principal. Jean Smart is a fourth grader's conception of a mom who works at a large company- never any time for them, always on the phone. She, like the principal, is portrayed as a child would write the part. No sympathy is ever given to the fact she is a struggling career woman. Her role is seen only from a child's point of view. Perhaps the worst adult role in the movie is Chris Elliot's Snowplow Man. He is portrayed, once again, like a child would write- the evil man who drives the snowplow. Not a second thought is given to the fact he is employed, paid, to drive that snow plow. He is seen as a one dimensional mean guy who doesn't want there to be a second snow day.Meanwhile, all the children in the film are portrayed as modern-day heroes, gallant generation Xers who are trapped in a cruel world. We are meant to sympathize with the loser, who wants a date with the school babe, supposed to identify with wanting a second snow day, supposed to remember what it was like competing with the bully. But you honestly can't, because, as said before, the entire movie is aimed for a kid, from a kid. Perhaps the worst evidence of this is the ongoing adults are uncool treatment that is becoming sickening as it spreads through youth and movies. I myself am only 16, and find some things from the so-called adult world enjoyable, but I find my classmates have an automatic prejudice at the mere mention of Audrey Hepburn, or the dreaded, 'almighty evil' Garth Brooks. This movie is no different- the local skating rink is run by a man who plays 1940's and 1950's dance music to accompany the skaters. Of course, the skaters are all portrayed as falling asleep because of bordem and having accidents at the rink. We're supposed to cheer when the kids hijack the booth and start playing loud 90's rock music. I was disgusted. This is Nickelodean, the popular kids network, and they are doing no better in teaching kids that adults are bad people. If you want a good family movie with fun that doesn't completely destroy adult aspects, for the love of humanity, see Stuart Little, or rent a Disney movie.

Boy was it bad!  And of course the kids liked it.   I think the filmmakers were aiming for a whimsical, irreverent and heartwarming ode to those wonderful days of childhood when a big storm shut down life for a day and kids could forget about school and homework and just play and have adventures.  But their aim was way off. Most of the characters are unappealing, and forgive me for saying this, a lot of the young actors and actresses are downright ugly! And the totally unnecessary character of snowplow man takes up way too much time and also commits at least one felony (kidnapping) that no one seems to notice!  There's no inspiration or imagination here folks.  Take your kids back to see Stuart Little again.

It is the story of a group of oppressed youth in upper state New York who band together to stop the evil snowplow man, who is robbing them of their second snow day. Led by a brave young girl they stage a revolution not unlike the French or Russian revolution. Snow plowman is beaten, tied to a stop sign and left to die. This film was a touching and inspirational story of the power of everyone, and what happens if we work together to make the world a better place. Those who find it a stupid children's movie need to look past the mundane parts with the boy and look to the deeper meaning of the story. I hope everyone can follow Natalie's lead and eliminate the snowplow men in our own lives. We don't have to take it!

I just thought I would give it a try because I like Chevy Chase and Chris Elliott. Plus, I thought my 2 1/2 year old might like some parts of it. It started off like every other kids movie I've seen, kinda cheesy. Then, all of a sudden, it shows a young girl showing off her young chest and body. I don't know if she was really that young or not, but I don't think it's appropriate for children 12 and under. I'm no saint or anything. I watch R movies in front of my child. I listen to rap music all the time. I'm not one of those crazy parents who say don't watch this or don't listen to that. Come on. I'm only 23. But with America being the way it is today; parents and the media complaining about every little thing shown on tv or heard on the radio, or whatever. It's ridiculous. This is supposed to be a kids movie. Kids driving a snow plow and running over another kid. Yeah, that's nice. What is wrong with us?

Whenever it snowed you felt like anything can happen, and when the snow melted away you always knew that tomorrow would be like any other day...but you still had that one magic day.The analogy of the magic of a snow day and the magic of being a kid is wonderful. This is another, in a series of movies, that points out how just a little change in perspective for one day can change you. Maybe not big earth shattering changes, but subtle magical ones.Through all of the fart jokes, and watching Chevy Chase sled down a hill in a snowman costume, the magic of that one day still prevails.I hope that at least once more in my life I have another snow day!  "}{"Title":"For kids only","Date":"5 November 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  Snow Day is a movie that was for me a big disappointment. Why didn't I like this film? Because this movie was way too juvenile for my taste. This is a movie for kids only. Any child under the age of 12 will probably like it. But I'm sure most adults who got dragged by their kids to see this when the movie hit theaters this past winter were appalled to sit through this. I know I was. I've always enjoyed watching Chevy Chase in the movies, but in Snow Day he doesn't seem to be having a good time. Also, he's not the main star of this film. The two young actors who play Chase's kids get more screen time than Chase does. As a matter of fact, I think if Snow Day had been made more for adults with Chase in the lead it might have been a much better movie. Chase does get a few laughs here, but he's not on screen as much as you would like him to be and in the process he's wasted. That stinks. Because as it stands, Snow Day is a flat comedy with not many laughs. *1/2 (out of four)  "}]
