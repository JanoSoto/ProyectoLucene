[{"Title":"Not as good as TOMMY BOY, but still one of the better comedies from the 1990s!","Date":"6 July 2004","Score":"18 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  After the enormous success of TOMMY BOY, it was expected that Chris Farley and David Spade would star in another movie together. What wasn't expected was that the two movies would be so similar. In TOMMY BOY, Richard Hayden (David Spade) must look after the sweet, but clumsy Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) so he doesn't mess up the family business. In BLACK SHEEP, Steve Dodds (David Spade) is hired by Mike Donnelly's (Chris Farley) brother to look after the sweet, but clumsy Mike so he doesn't mess up an upcoming campaign. While the plots of the two movies aren't exactly identical, they are similar enough to give the feeling that BLACK SHEEP was somewhat rushed into theaters in order to capitalize on the popularity of the duo.Opening on February 2, 1996, just eleven months after the March 1995 release of TOMMY BOY, BLACK SHEEP received dismal reviews (Gene Siskel  said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies). However, the dismal reviews weren't enough to keep audiences away from the theaters and the movie made a decent $32 million, which isn't necessarily a hit, but good nonetheless. As a major fan of both Chris Farley and David Spade, I find this movie to be one of the funniest comedies from the 1990s. I used to like it even more than I liked TOMMY BOY although I now see that TOMMY BOY is certainly the better movie. Both TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP have some of the most memorable moments in comedy history, though TOMMY BOY has a lot more of them.Watch TOMMY BOY and BLACK SHEEP back to back and prepare to laugh like you have never laughed before. Chris Farley and David Spade are, in my opinion, the funniest duo ever to appear onscreen. It's a shame they didn't get to make a more movies together before Farley's death.

I didn't. But I sure did like BLACK SHEEP. The film is a good film if you want a laugh. But you need to have the right sense of humor. Gene Siskel obviously did not have the correct type of humor, as he is reported to have walked out on this film. Well, that was one of his biggest mistakes, because there are far worse movies out there! Chris Farley was funny as hell, I don't think anyone should object to that. David Spade still is pretty funny (although he lost a lot of points with me when he did JOE DIRT).I thought this film was actually pretty good. The other members of the cast were good Tim Matheson, Gary Busey, Grant Heslov, and Bruce McGill. All of them were funny as hell. Maybe with the exception of Gary Busey's character, who I must admit was pretty stupid. The film had a good story though, and it was sweet-natured along iwth being majorly crude and funny. I recommend ALMOST HEROES and TOMMY BOY *if* you liked this movie. BLACK SHEEP gets 4/5.

I must say I have no idea how this movie has an average of four on IMDb.com.  This movie will completely tear you up over and over with side-splitting antics and great jokes.I read a review on another site that said, in comparison to Tommy Boy, Black Sheep has no plot and is nowhere near as funny.  Wrong!  The plot may be just as shallow, but the comic antics in this movie shoot way above Tommy Boy.  For instance, Chris Farley and David Spade enter the cabin and find that it is infested with one single bat.  They go crazy and wreck everything in the cabin, and Chris Farley's character assumes It's Ozzy Osbourne!Okay, maybe you have to watch it to get it.  The plot isn't as bad as people make it out to be, but the storyline does tend to get a little foggy in places.  However, the extensive appearance of crude humor and excellent acting make this movie a classic comedy. If you like hilarious movies, then this is definitely one to see.

Farley plays Mike Donnelly, the younger and nuttier brother of Al Donnelly, who is campaigning to be governor of Washington. Mike's seemingly constant screw-ups, which cause serious havoc during his brother's campaign, provide for the majority of the comedy in the film. There can be no mistake that this is entirely slapstick comedy, but it succeeds very well because Farley can pull it off so well. The hopelessly geeky Spade balances out Farley's hyper-activity with his collected but nerdy performance, leaving us with an odd couple that could be called a slightly less mature version of that of the late Walter Matthou and the later Jack Lemmon (a moment of silence for Matthou, Lemmon, and Farley, would be in order about now&#133;).It is strange that such an immature film could deal so extensively with a relatively serious subject as politics and still manage to keep the slapstick successful, especially since there are moments of real emotion in the film. Gary Busey appears in a small but very effective and amusing role as Sgt. Drake Savage, a military-minded guy who ultimately seems to have a heart of gold. The interactions between him and Spade are some of the funniest moments in the film, along with the constant humor that seems to always be emanating from Farley. The cabin scene with Mike and Steve (Spade) is especially amusing (I got dibs on top bunk!). I am not going to attempt to say that Black Sheep is a truly intellectual film, nor is there anything particularly amazing about the script or direction, but the comedy is excellent, there can be no mistake about that. I mean, Tommy Boy and other movies, like Major Payne, are no cerebral workouts either, but the comedy is there. That's the reason to watch these movies, and to their credit, you can tell that just by looking at the cover. You probably won't learn anything or see the portrayal of many serious issues in a movie like Black Sheep, but you will laugh heartily and you will remember it for that. "},{"Title":"Tommy Boy...

This is their second pairing, after starring in the dreadful Tommy Boy. One can say that their followup is strike two. Farley attempts to help his brother's campaign but he messes up constantly. Spade is assigned to keep him out of trouble and together they uncover a conspiracy. Routine comedy with little plot. Director Penelope Spheeris does her best particularly during scene in a cabin, but after directing Wayne's World this is a big step down. Farley is still doing the nightclub act although not as annoying as he is in Tommy Boy. Spade is stranded with a deadpan role just as he was in Tommy Boy. This is also a major waste of time for Tim Matheson as Farley's brother, especially after his sheer hilarity as a fraternity brother in National Lampoon's Animal House. Also featured is Gary Busey much to his dismay, and Christine Ebersole who has the misfortune of being stuck under a thrashing Farley. One can only hope their career will outlast decisions to appear in films as stupid as this one. This film exists for stupid humour setups such as Farley thrashing atop a woman after being immobilized on top of her. Very forced and not worth the time of day.

I knew John Belushi, and he's no John Belushi. Siskel's colleague Roger Ebert also hated the film, calling it not only one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, but one of the least ambitious; it doesn't even feel like they're trying to make a good movie.That really sums it up. People compare this film to Tommy Boy, and they should. It is very much the same two characters, just in a different situation. If anything, maybe Farley's character is a bit less dumb here... but probably not. There is little to love, although a moment or two (like the roof scene) get a couple laughs.

Lack of time, I guess, but I would have wanted to know more.Farley was definitely the star of the movie, which meant I had to rewind to catch the funnier moments with Spade, if the two were in the same shot. Couldn't help but think Farley wasn't all that fat in this movie, for all the fat jokes.Error alert almost immediately after Mike falls on Steve in the bunk bed scene, the bed is magically in one piece. "},{"Title":"An attention-hungry outcast","Date":"26 March 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the maximum antics, minimum laughter genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny.Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are.The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning.To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on.Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project.Starring Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by Penelope Spheeris. "},{"Title":"Good oldie slap stick Hollywood style","Date":"29 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" You need to take this film at face value.

It was a pretty bad message. There were scenes like that, which really detracted from the movie. At times the movie seemed like too much of a Farley vehicle without much of a plot. The good points to the movie were how it made fun of politicians. Tim Matheson was excellent as a nice guy politician surrounded by political handlers and sleaze. The political clichés and the whole political process makes one really hate political campaigns. David Spade had some funny moments. He revealed some incredible acrobatics during one scene.

It's amazing why a film that is virtually a remake of Tommy Boy can be so much worse but there you have it.Chris Farley was funny and his years on Saturday Night Live proves that he was more than just a bumbling fool as he is portrayed here. The movie starts out kind of strange when we see him working at some kind of civics center. In an attempt to make him kind of sympathetic, we see him bonding with some kid but that side of the story wouldn't have been that interesting and is left a subplot that eats only a minute more of screen time.So what do we get. We get Tim Matheson playing his brother running for governor (in a totally unnecessary part. Simply there because Farley's idol, John Belushi and he were friends). We get his sniveling campaign manager another sleazy guy performance by Timothy Carhart (remember him from Thelma and Louise?). We get another of Belushi's compadres Bruce McGill as the opposing side's campaign manager and finally David Spade as himself. This setup could have been funny but is absolutely played as a setup to Farley's character messing everything up for his brother with slapstick sequences (or anti-slapstick as we feel every bit of pain that Farley feels). If we had seen Farley arguing with people for his brother's votes in the same vein he did with brake pads in Tommy Boy this could have been much better. Why rip something off and then completely screw up everything the original stood for?There are some scenes here that are so painful to watch that it makes you sick 1) Farley's encounter with a bat. Spade covers him in a blanket and whacks the living crap out of him. This was probably a take on the scene with the bees in Tommy Boy. It falls flat on it's ugly face.2) Farley getting stoned and shouting out 60's slogans to cheers at a rock concert and screws it up by screaming Kill Whitey. It has never been funny not even sitcom funny.3) Spade's face off with a crazy Vietnam vet. This is like seeing the worst Police Academy movie you can think off. Spade was in one of the worst so maybe he liked it.Ready for the best part Farley actually finds out that the election is rigged at the last minute. This is so unlikely after we seen him stumble through one blunder after another that I was scratching my head in disbelief. Of course, there must be some conflict that has to be resolved but the scene where Matheson tells Farley to keep out of the way is so unbelievable because we don't feel that they have any connection to one another in the first place.The film has a happy ending or sort of. The brothers are not a bit closer than they were before and Farley goes on his merry way again. It is hard to believe that director Penelope Spheeris was the director of Wayne's World as well. Maybe she just wanted to go home because she knew that this couldn't possibly be good anyway. Farley had less than one year to live and it shows that he was not in very good shape here. A shame he left us with two much bigger bombs than this (Beverly Hills Ninja and Almost Heroes) "},{"Title":"Movie Schitzo's Revieww of Black Sheep","Date":"30 July 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Chris Farley was a movie genius. Fresh from SNL he made lots of funny movies, my favorite of his being Almost Heroes. He had collaborated with David Spade before on Tommy Boy. They both made a pretty good team in the movies. They were both pretty hilarious and it was a shame that Farley had died sometime later. So was this better than Tommy Boy you ask? NO! This was OK, but did not even come close to what Tommy Boy accomplished. So here is the plot Al Donnely (Tim Matheson) is running for Govener of Washington and to ensure a clean election he hires his aide Steve Dodds (Spade) to keep an eye on his kindhearted but clumsy brother Mike Donnely (Farley). So the race to beat their competitor Govener Tracy (Christine Ebersole) begins so that Al can become the next Govener of Washington. The acting is sub par and mostly only Farley makes it up to snuff with the material he is handed. Spade on the other hand is probably thinking, I could be making Joe Dirt right about now, but is still pretty good in the role he is given, but still could be better. Their is a scene where Farley is smoking weed and that is what ultimately led to his death in 1997.

To watch this movie and get offended by the politics that are involved in it is just plain and simply asinine.  You go to the movies for the entertainment and if you are seeing a comedy I hope that you are not looking for intellectual side because that is what makes a drama.  If that is what you are looking for then don't go to a comedy ever.  This is a great comedy movie to me but you all have your own way to think and look at movies and if you don't like this movie then how in the world can you even like Tommy Boy, any of Jim Carrey, or anything from Adam Sandler.  If you don't like this movie then stay away from comedy all together because you have NO sense of humor.  Stick with the girls and watch things that involve drama because that way you will do us all the favor of not listening to you speak.

Vote for Gary Busey!","Date":"24 January 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, Black Sheep is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. Black Sheep is not a sequel to Tommy Boy, even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on Tommy Boy. They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in Tommy Boy. But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. Black Sheep may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. Black Sheep, in my review, completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious.

It Doesn't Deserve Walking Out On !","Date":"1 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word intolerable got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working.The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy &#x96; 1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent.The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore.Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

By that time, I had seen Tommy Boy and Beverly Hills Ninja (two other comedies starring Chris Farley), and after watching all three of these movies, I think I liked them all to some degree. However, after watching them all again recently, I think Tommy Boy is the only one that's really decent. Black Sheep, the second of the three, is slightly better than BHN, but that doesn't mean it's very good.Mike Donnelly is the younger brother of Al, who is running for Washington State Governor. Unfortunately, although Mike means well, he is very clumsy, and often unintentionally gets into trouble. This lowers the chances of Al winning the election, and it doesn't help that his opponent, Gov. Tracy, is exploiting Mike's uncouth tendencies by having pictures taken of him that make him look like a criminal! Al assigns Steve Dodds, one of his campaign aides, to make sure Mike doesn't cause any trouble during the election. Mike and Steve go to stay in a cabin in a rural area, and keeping Mike out of trouble turns out to be a difficult job for Steve. In addition to that, the two find that staying in this cabin isn't always easy.As you can tell by the plot, Chris Farley plays a well-meaning but clumsy, uncouth loony, as usual. You can also expect a lot of slapstick from this movie. However, as much as I usually love slapstick, I can tell when it's done well and when it's not. Sadly, Black Sheep is a case of slapstick done poorly. The gags are usually very simple and often lame. For example, with Mike sleeping on the top bunk in the cabin and Steve sleeping on the bottom as the roof blows off during a storm, despite how long Mike lies there, putting a lot of weight on the mattress, it's so obvious that he will eventually fall on Steve, and when it happens, it's not funny. Now, some parts did make me smile or snicker slightly, such as Mike freaking out over the dogs chasing his truck, Steve whacking Mike repeatedly with a broom to try and kill a bat, and Al seeing his brother on TV at the rock-the-vote concert, making a fool of himself, but all this is not enough.Like Tommy Boy, Chris Farley and David Spade co-starred in this film, and it isn't surprising that many fans of the 1995 comedy have been disappointed by this 1996 follow-up. Personally, I don't think Tommy Boy is a masterpiece, but it's reasonable. Black Sheep, however, while not quite as unfunny as Beverly Hills Ninja, the Chris Farley movie that followed, is mediocre overall. It has been nearly ten years since Chris Farley's tragic death, but he made many people laugh during his career, and continues to do so today. The best thing to remember him for is probably the classic Saturday Night Live sketches he was in, but clearly, Black Sheep is not something to remember him for.

If Farley gets in the spotlight for anything bad, like he usually does, the candidate's hopes for election are slim. So, Spade has the thankless task of hiding out with the fat man in a cabin somewhere in the middle of nowhere. But, of course, since this is a comedy, Farley gets away, and Spade, who cannot tell him why he's hiding him without hurting his feelings, drags along after Farley trying to convince him to come back...or something like that&#133;Despite being directed by `Wayne's World' director Penelope Spheeris, this film's very basic and juvenile comedy is nothing good. At all. The jokes (if you can call them that) almost all fall flat, and I rarely laughed.David Spade's character is a bland, dull, lifeless and immobile creature who we could not care for one way or another, no matter how bad things get.Chris Farley is just plain annoying, as always, with his off-the-wall antics and loudmouthed `jokes' that are more outbursts than anything else. I sometimes wonder if fellow `SNL' comedian Mike Myers was playing for more than just a disgusting character when he created Fat Basta^&&#133; for `Austin Powers'?`Black Sheep' is the kind of movie that no one is talking about the next day. It is utterly forgettable and very, very, VERY basic. It's not an awful comedy, mind you, because I have seen much worse; however, there is really nothing to recommend about `Black Sheep.' People said Chris Farley was the next John Candy, but John Candy will never be matched. John Candy's comedic talent lay in true comedy. He could make us laugh while making us cry. Candy was a good &#150; great &#150; comedian. He had all the traits of a one-in-a-million kind of actor. Farley, on the other hand, gained his laughs by making stupid outbursts, like `I bought a kite from a bald guy!' that are so odd that  people laugh at not because they are funny, but because they are odd.People should be glad that Farley died, because he would have worn out with America, just like David Spade did; unfortunately, even good `Saturday Night Live' comedians like Dana Carvey, Kevin Nealon (Hans and Franz) etc. are all dying out. It's too bad that comedians who are usually remembered for being great are people like Farley &#150; annoying, loudmouthed slobs who hadn't an ounce of real comic talent in them.I think that people should realize, in the future, that just because a comedian is fat he is NOT John Candy.2/5 stars &#150; basic comedy &#150; John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Not quite as funny as Tommy Boy","Date":"30 October 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The last film to team comedians Chris Farley and David Spade has its moments but ultimately pales in comparison to their previous film teaming, Tommy Boy and their many sketches together on the TV series, Saturday Night Live. Farley's talent for physical comedy and Spade's trademark sarcasm generates some genuine amusement in this tale of Mike Donnelly (Farley), the well intentioned but generally clumsy younger brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson), a man who really wants to win the race for Washington state governor. Mike comes along on Al's campaigns as an advertising assistant but always winds up making an embarrassing scene in front of potential voters. Under the recommendations of his campaign manager (Timothy Carhart), Al hires a campaign aide (Spade) to send Mike elsewhere on assisting with the campaign. Soon, Mike and Steve have some rather nightmarish experiences in a woodside cabin and run afoul of a war obsessed renegade (Gary Busey). Meanwhile, Al's opponent, Evelyn Tracy (Christine Ebersole) is corrupting the election so she can fool the voters and win a third term. Mike eventually finds out about this and hilariously sets out to expose her wrong doings. The humor here is a little raunchier and rowdier than in Tommy Boy but not necessarily funnier. At times, the film is very predictable and the comedic punchlines occasionally fail. Still, it's OK and much better than the hugely disappointing Coneheads where Farley and Spade were first seen together in a film.

This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and butt-head humor. More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like Tommy Boy. However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts.One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.

Whenever you see abad comedy, or even a good one that could have been great, 9times out of 10 it is the comic timing that fails.  BLACK SHEEP wasinvariably made in a dimension where time didn't exist.  And if youtruly boiled down all of the funny lines and situations &#150;&#150; all ofwhich belong solely to Chris Farley's character &#150;&#150; at best you'dhave 4 solid minutes of chuckles.  Sure, his hair looks funny, andhe sounds funny, and moves funny, but then attempt to glue on abanal plot about him trying to help his older, smarter brother (TimMatheson) become Governor while the current Governor (ChristineEbersole) is playing dirty-pool with her campaign opponent, andall the shenanigans that shouldn't and wouldn't surround thatstoryline, and you've got one hell of a rotting mess.  Farley, as MikeDonnelly, goes off like the Tasmanian Devil every 5 minutes (mostoften for no discernable reason) and his tag-along buddy andbabysitter Steve Dodds (David Spade) could have been replacedwith a cardboard box and no one would have noticed.  No one elsein that cast is worth mentioning, except Gary Busey, who plays acrazed ex-veteran with remarkably huge, super-white teeth (whichunfortunately belong to him in real life. *shiver*).  I actually caughtmyself thinking, What a horrible waste of celluloid several timesduring this.  I can only assume that there were some incredibledrugs being taken by everyone on set that led them to hallucinatethat they were all comedic and cinematic geniuses.  Even as badas TOMMY BOY was, this one makes it look like CITIZEN KANE incomparison.But the truth is I have no one to blame for this horrid viewingexperience but myself; I chose to sit through it in its entirety ratherthan get up or switch channels to station only transmitting static. Of course, I didn't want to disturb my cat sleeping so peacefully inmy lap (no doubt rendered comatose by the movie).  So I blamemy cat.  BAD CAT! BAD!!!3/10.
