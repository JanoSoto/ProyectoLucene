[{"Title":"Desperately poignant","Date":"19 November 2003","Score":"28 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  A true story While her parents and older sister flee Hungary a young girl is unfortunately left behind with her grand-mother who then ends up in prison.  The young girl is adopted by a childless couple who adoringly bring her up until she is 5 or 6, at which point her grandmother takes her back to her real parents in the USA.  The young child is very brave, but also confused, and never forgets her adopted parents.  This story leaves you feeling desperate for all those involved.  The scenes of the girl in her early years with her adopted parents are very powerful and poignant.  They are so genuine and sincere in their love for the child and they hope she will never have to leave them, but deep down they know that some day it will happen, and it happens when they are least expecting it.  I can't imagine the pain those two people went through, as well as the child, and yet there is more to come.  I spent the whole film fighting back the tears, I was completely absorbed by the depth of feeling.  Some have said this film was flawed in some aspects but I'm no film critic and I have to say that I was so involved with the story and first class acting that if it was flawed I didn't notice.  It is slow-paced but justly so.  I was happy with the ending and felt it resolved nicely.A note about the acting which was superb throughout.  I'm a big fan of Tony Goldwyn who is perfect in these roles.  The young Suzanne was delightful and incredibly genuine as were the adopted parents that were so authentic.  The teenage Suzanne was also very naturally interpreted and believable. All in all, a fine film.

It is a compelling drama that is delicately crafted by the director and superbly acted by the entire cast. In those respects it is flawless. There are enchanting, and disturbing pictures of life in America and Hungary. The story is at once sad, and heartening. It is a film of contrasts, skillfully presented. It draws the emotions of the viewer along with it, and evokes genuine sympathies for all the characters. That is rare in any film.A young girl is torn between her youthful memories of one world, and one set of parents, while trying to grow up in another world with her real family that she seems to barely know. She is caught emotionally between her memories of two diverse worlds. The conflicts come to a crisis when she is 16, and she decides that she must return to Hungary in order to resolve them. I was so enthralled by that premise, and the skill with which the story was crafted, that I was engrossed from start to finish. I'm not even sure if I blinked the entire time. The scenes on the Hungarian side paint a poignant picture of people trying to live under the hopelessness of the communist regime after the invasion by the Soviets in 1950.Natassja Kinski is superb. Her role is a departure from past efforts but she, as always, delivers a sterling interpretation of her character. But Scarlet Johansson and Kelly Endresz Banlaki really steal the show. Their performances as Suzanne are understated and genuine. There are some minor plot flaws in An American Rhapsody, but they are inconsequential compared to the superb emotional ride the story provides. Watch this one for the dramatic and irresistible acting.

It's features an amazing, personal, story of the early Cold War-era immigration to America of a Hungarian family, and it was really incredibly done.  We love Scarlett Johansson (Ghost World), who plays the 15-year-old, but the girl who plays the lead character at age 6 is one of the most loveable child actresses ever, Nastassia Kinski as the mother is great, Tony Goldwyn, as the dad, is good, the pair who play the Hungarian rural couple (especially the man) are fantastic.  Hungary and Budapest too play a key role.  The movie will sicken you, somewhat, about the America-in-the-early-60s mentality (sicken you because you know how much a part of all of us it is).  As one reviewer said, this is no State Department-backed immigration story.  And it will make you fall in love with the Hungarian countryside.  It's a terrific movie-going experience.  I cried several times throughout.Because of how little marketing and buzz the movie has generated, I fear it will come and go in a flash; that's why I issue this appeal.By the way, don't go expecting great filmmaking techniques and perfect direction; it's her first movie and mistakes were made.  But the experience, if you go in the right frame of mind, is great.  It's in English.

Well acted, especially by Scarlett Johansson and Kelly Endresz-Banlaki, who both played the central character of Suzanne/Zsuzsana at ages 15 and 6 respectively.Natashia Kinski played well, too, and has aged gracefully, playing a woman in her into her late 30s or early 40s I suppose. I was particularly impressed by her, Johansson's and Tony Goldwyn's apparent mastery of Hungarian, no easy language, I can assure you. Much of the film is set in Hungary with Hungarian subtitles (and alternately in America in English).

In An American Rhapsody there is no apparent climax (as some critics have been eager to point out). And rightly so, I think. I suppose Suzanne is the defined protagonist - the story is autobiographical, and told from Suzanne's point of view. But each of the other characters could justifiably claim that nebulous title. Certainly, while there are many conflicts and powerful dramatic moments; and while, sadly, Suzanne must make a choice, there is no wrong, anti-protagonist option. Each opposing choice is as right or wrong as the other. So in the end there is no emotional moment of truth that proclaims itself. Her decision is uncomplicated, and stated with a simplicity that defies conventional dramatic practices; one is stunned by how quickly that simple moment of truth passes.(SPOILERS)In the period of Hungary's futile battle for independence from the repressive communist yoke, Margit and Peter, along with their young daughter Maria, make their run for freedom. The dangers for their baby, Suzanne, are too great, so the terrible decision is made to leave her behind with her grandmother, who in turn must pass the child over to a good, dependable rural couple - only moments before she herself is arrested and taken to prison. For six years Suzanne lives an idyllic life with her loving surrogate parents. Finally, Margit and Peter are successful in their never-ending efforts a get their baby back with them in America. At this point, although unrecognized by all concerned, the six year old Suzanne meets her first betrayal. She was told she was coming to America for a visit, but finds out soon enough that it's to be her permanent home. There are moments of frustrated rebellion for the child, until that poignant scene in the park when her gentle, loving father promises that when she's older if she still wants to, he'll let her visit her other parents in Hungary.(SPOILERS)Ten years later, sixteen year old Suzanne still savors her memories of and mementos from that early idyllic life in Hungary. But she is also thoroughly Americanized. She smokes (heck, back then darn near everybody smoked); she hangs around with the gang; and, reflecting her adolescent hormones, she's got a guy - all normal teenage behaviors that frighten her mother and lead to several typical parent-child arguments. But the panicked mother takes a major step beyond typical - leading to a frightening and memorable scene. (SPOILER)Suzanne wakes up to find that her mother has had bars put on her window - the image of the shocked Suzanne looking out through the bars is emotionally staggering to watch. Her mother has also put a latch on the bedroom door that can only be opened from the outside. Effectively, her mother has made her daughter a prisoner, just as she felt she was back in Hungary. And Suzanne strikes out for freedom as dramatically as her mother did. As a result, when she asks her father to keep his long-ago promise, he realizes he must give her a chance to revisit her family back in Hungary.(SPOILERS)Back in Hungary she finds the love between her and them as strong as ever. But life there isn't the same as her memories - and she also is different. And her understanding of her real mother's motivations is changed. So she has that heart-rending decision to make between people she loves and people she loves. And it's that decision that slips by without fanfare. Which is as it should be. It fits. Eva Gardos was not giving us a conclusion so revolutionary as to call for dramatic scenes of introspection or indecision or conflict. Only one factor in the end moved Suzanne, and she spoke it; and that was that.The cast was outstanding. Natassja Kinski's Margit was deeply affecting. Scarlett Johansson proved with her sensitive, true-to-life portrayal of Suzanne that her earlier moving reading of the role of Manny in Manny and Lo was no accident. Scarlett is among the best in the business. Six year old Kelly Endresz-Banlaki played the conflicted, confused, and betrayed young Suzanne with stunning depth.Eva Gardos has moved the art of cinema into a new and more profound dimension.

At the last moment the man who was to transport them demanded more money.  He only complied when my friends brother put a gun on him and told him to row.American Rhapsody covers the escape from Hungary and the eventual uniting of the family members, but it involves much more.  In it you are seen that the importance of family can be over shadowed by the care and love provided by a surrogate family.  The performances of the actresses playing Suzanne are all excellent, but the girl who portrayed her as a five year old child in Hungary and her arrival in California,n Kelly Endelez-Banaki was particularly outstanding.  Her performance will be remembered.  I found Nastassja Kinshi and Tony Goldwin to also be very real.  It is a very rewarding film.Another commentator compared the film to Sunshine, another film developing a somewhat similar story but isolated on the Jewish community of Hungary. It is a longer more powerful story, and one that I have had Jewish friends tell me in someways is to horrific in its treatment of Hungarian Jews. Whatever both films, though carrying a somewhat similar theme are excellent examples of the cruelty in man and also in human humanity.

From the very first scene until the final credits, I was mesmerized. There was not a single scene that I did not find captivating. At the end I was sobbing like a baby.I think that a quality necessary to make a story this gripping is that it has all the elements that are common to the human experience - but with circumstances that make everything exaggerated. It is easy to identify with what these characters are going through, but at the same time, the situation is so unique as to stimulate the imagination and cause the viewer to see the world through different eyes.

I also loved the couple who played her foster parents - the foster father was just oozing with personality and character. The actors who played Peter and Margit did a first rate job as well.I really wish I could find out more about the true story this was based on. My only criticism of the movie was that so many questions were left unanswered...Did the grandmother ever see Margit again? Did Suzanne ever again visit her Hungarian foster parents after her trip to Budapest at age 15? Did the culmination of this story really solve the family's relationship issues for good? Did Margit ever have the courage to return to Hungary and face the ghosts of her past? My daughter says that the mark of a good story is that it leaves you wanting more - so that must mean that this is a really good story. After seeing it forthe first time, I watched the video 4 times before letting my daughter return it. I hope Eva Gardos writes a book about her life someday.

As Peter relates, a good deal of his friends have been sent to prison, for no good reasons, and his publishing business shut down. In addition, Margit experienced a traumatic loss which changed her forever. Therefore, they make plans to escape from communist Budapest and immigrate to America. They plan to take their two daughters along but a last minute, horrendous glitch makes it necessary for them to leave their one year old daughter, Suzanne, behind and in the care of a peasant farm couple in the Hungarian countryside. Climbing under barbed wire and around spotlights, they make their escape with their older daughter. Yet, understandably, when they make it to Los Angeles, Margit and Peter never stop writing letters to government officials, in order to secure the immigration of their little lost girl. Suzanne, meanwhile, loves her adoptive parents and simple home. Yet, when she is six, Suzanne is torn away from the only mother and father she knows and sent to America to meet and live with her blood relatives. After such turmoil for everyone, will happiness follow? This is one great movie that will have you crying at the beginning, the middle, and the end. It is based on a heartbreaking true story and it is certainty that any viewer will be tremendously moved by its happenings. The cast is stupendous, with Kinski and Goldwyn doing a wonderful job as the brave but sorrowful parents. Scarlett Johanssen plays Suzanne as she ages, and she is terrific, but so is the little lady who plays the younger version left behind in Hungary. Then, too, the settings, costumes, cinematography, script and direction are all top notch. In summary, no one who loves motion pictures should really miss this film.

Which fits the title of this film. Suzanne was born near Budapest in 1950, and when she was a small baby her mom, dad, and sister managed to escape to America, but she was left behind with grandma, and then raised by a childless couple who in essence became her parents. This film is her story. The critic Ebert has a good summary.some SPOILERS follow - tread carefully the rest of the way.We see her as a 5-yr-old, happy with her family, oblivious to everything else and the fact that her biological family was living in California. When grandma was released from imprisonment, she came to take little Suzanne to the city for a visit, but instead had prepared for her to fly to America. Mom, dad, and sis are thrilled with the reunion, but little Suzanne while enjoying the visit to this wonderfully different world, was anxious to get back home. In a short conversation with dad (Tony Goldwin) on the park swings, he says, Give it a chance, if you still fell this way after you grow up I'll see that you go back to Budapest.Suzanne at 15 is played by Scarlett Johannsen (of Horse Whisperer and Man Who Wasn't There), an angry and rebellious teen, with a very over-protective mom (Nastassia Kinsky) who locks her in her room after finding her with a boyfriend.  Suzanne had never accepted her transplantation to America, and asked her dad for the trip he had promised 10 years earlier. She went, she saw, she met her adopted family, she visited her grandmother. Her discovery was how much her grandmother had risked, and went to prison, to protect baby Suzanne. And, the fact that her mother witnessed her father being killed by a Communist soldier because dad arose to protect his daughter from the soldier's unwanted advances. This put into perspective her mom's overprotectiveness, and her distaste for Hungary. So Suzanne went home to America, with a fresh perspective, satisfied with her visit to the old world. Good film, well-acted, although as Ebert points out is resolved in the end in a rather quick and simple manner, considering how the story was intricately woven from the beginning.

Her birth parents fled communist persecution in Hungary, but couldn't take the infant out of fear she would cry, and alert the communist authorities. They intended to retrieve her shortly thereafter, but matters were complicated, and she remained. After a few years had gone by and she had grown to love her surrogate parents, the first ones she ever knew, she was taken from them somewhat deceptively by her grandmother. As a teen, she longs to return to her native land to see her surrogate parents, if only for a visit.The film is touching, both sad and joyous, but I was a little disappointed that there were no references, at least that I caught, of the Hungarian revolt against the Soviets in 1956, one that was brutally crushed by the invading Red Army.One thing that led me to this movie, which I purchased on DVD, was that I read that Hungarian actress Eva Soreny was in it, albeit very briefly. She's the elderly waitress in the first scene that takes place in America, in L.A. She has quite a story of her own, worthy of a full-length feature film, a story that mirrors The Sound Of Music. She was forced to flee her native land with her family following the 1956 revolt after communist authorities told her of their interest in using her for propaganda purposes, since she was regarded as Hungary's premiere actress of that era. Her story is told in an episode of the 1950s-60s TV series The Armstrong Circle Theater, entitled The Hunted The Eva Soreny Story, in which she plays herself. After coming to America, she had a few other acting jobs, mainly guest appearances in TV series. I saw her in The Twilight Zone (episodeMute) and Family Affair (A Waltz From Vienna). As far as I know, as of this writing, she is still alive at age 90.

Being of Hungarian origin, it was hard to overlook certain shortcomings with regards to the use of language and music. There are certain situations where i thought the use of the Hungarian language would have been more forceful and certainly more emotionally satisfying, as opposed to using English. And while the movie was made with American audiences in mind, nevertheless, this type of small movie should be able to get away with the use of subtitles all the way through. As far as the music was concerned, it was not even of Hungarian origin in most cases. Considering the title used the word rhapsody, there would have been scope for the use of genuine Hungarian music.The director's stated ambition - in the audio commentary - was to portray all the characters in a sympathetic light, so that we - the audience - do not feel more emotional attachment towards one set of parents over the other. Well, maybe it is me, but I did feel more sympathetic towards one set of parents than the other. Which makes the ending all the more less satisfying and somewhat rushed. As if, somebody said, but we need a feel good ending. If only life would be so simple.On the positive side, the performance of the 6 year old Susannah or Zsuzsi, is quite remarkable. To have such a range of emotions displayed by a child of that age is simply unique. The look of the movie is also well thought out, with the use of the black and white at the beginning and later reverting to full colour.Ultimately, it is a movie that will satisfy the general American audience, but for those that have personal experiences similar to those in the film, will find the whole experience somewhat wasted.

Back in the early 50s, her parents publisher Peter (Tony Goldwyn) and Margit (Nastassja Kinski) are in danger in the repressive Hungary and had to flee with their eldest daughter Maria. The plan was for baby Suzanne to be smuggled out to Vienna but Margit's mother has second thoughts about the dangerous plan. She gives Suzanne to a friend's parents to live with in the countryside. She herself is arrested by the police. Years later with the death of Stalin, she is released. Little Suzanne is sent to America with the tireless work of Margit. Suzanne thinks it's just going to be a visit and she would back for school and to her parents she had known all her life. She doesn't adjust well in America with her overprotective mother. As a teen, Suzanne grows up rebellious yearning to return to Hungary and her other parents.The chemistry between Johansson and Kinski is incredible. I'd rather have Scar Jo in more of the movie leaving much of her childhood as flashbacks. The simple linear storytelling is fine and has some great moments. There are compelling scenes like when little Zsuzsi gets lost in the uniformity of the suburbs. Johansson is just a great actress that it would serve the movie to have her throughout the whole film. Of course, the other way to do this movie is to make it about Margit rather than Suzanne. This has some very memorable moments but the switch from childhood to teenager is a little jarring.

The film stars Nastassja Kinski and Scarlett Johansson together with Raffaella Bánsági,Tony Goldwyn,Ágnes Bánfalvy and Zoltán Seress. It is based on the true story of the movie's writer/director, Éva Gárdos.The movie depicts the personal odyssey of a family's escape from Communist Hungary.One night, Margaret and Peter arrange to escape Hungary with their eldest daughter in tow, forcing them to leave behind their youngest, Suzanne, in the care of Margaret's mother. When the mother is separated from the young child, she goes to live in a peaceful Eastern European countryside with a loving man and woman who raise her until age six, where Suzanne is sent for by her birth parents, now living in America. She finds the adjustment difficult and does not fully comprehend that Margaret and Peter are her parents, but she is willing to stay, and if she feels the same way in several years, Peter has agreed to give her a ticket back to Hungary. Later, as a rebellious teenager, with Margaret becoming a highly overprotective mother, she takes her father up on his offer to go back and reconnect with those who raised her as a child. While in Hungary, she has a change of heart,however, and discovers her true identity. The movie tells an emotionally charged story of Hungarian immigration that is touching and historically accurate.Also,it is a beautiful film that covers the full spectrum of emotions. It also has great performances particularly that of a young Scarlett Johansson.For the most part, it's convincing and poignant.And most of all,it is it speaks so loudly of real emotions and real events as to transcend all movie's shortcomings.

Eva Gardos masterfully captured the pain of having to leave your own country, whether as adults or as a child. She crafted a wonderfully paced, written, acted and directed film. If her goal was to create a sense of longing for a bygone home, she hit a home run.I met Eva in Budapest in the late 1990s, when she was editing Andy Vajna's triumphant producing return to Hungary, A Miniszter félrelép (aka Out of Order). She let me read the screenplay of Hungarian Rhapsody as she was developing it for production. I liked the story, and imagined it coming to life on the screen. Almost a decade later, I finally got a chance to see the film. She stayed true to her story, and delivered an emotionally powerful personal film.I must admit that I am a Hungarian by paternal parentage, and thus very biased. 'Au contraire,' I am also a filmmaker, and can sometimes be critical. However, I can honestly say that Eva has created a film with universal emotional resonance.I truly hope that she continues to make such powerful films.

An American Rhapsody is an interesting movie but nothing more.I watched it mainly because i heard Nasstasja Kinski was in it. I'm a big fan of hers but she isn't so great here and i think it's not her fault. It's the script actually. There's one awful moment in particular that i recall now and it always makes laugh but not because it's funny - it's really stupid actually. It's the scene where the little Zsuzsi says shit at the party, something that her sister has thought her - it's really one stupid and predictable situation and it's not funny at all. The conversations are also too standard sometimes and although the core story is really interesting i don't think the director has managed to justify it. I also didn't like Scarlett Johansson in the role of Zsuzsi. She is really boring in this film.Nevertheless the film is still very interesting at times. As i've already said the core story is really good, there are several very good scenes, Nastassja Kinski is still very attractive, the girl that plays Zsuzsi as a kid is very sweet and fun to watch. I also liked the depiction of America in the 50's and also the life behind the Iron Curtain. There are still some very interesting ideas. I especially liked the scenes when Zsuzsi return to Hungary as a teenager and the story that her grandmother tells her, when she realizes what her mother went through to secure her a good life. But Johansson really wasn't for that part. I don't understand why didn't they get an Eastern European actress. It would have been so much easier and much more efficient. But you know - it's an American film after all.Watch this film if you are in the mood of a good drama but don't really bother if you have something better to do.

One unfortunately has to be suspicious about any such first film a director puts together about his or her own life. Few could pull that off to produce a masterpiece. The tale, surely a moving, intriguing, even fascinating one, is not told too well. Still I will recommend this film for two BIG reasons. If you're not interested in what I deem to be problems with the film, move on to the last para.The language problem, the constant dilemmas the film-makers had to face about when to use dubbing, when not (also depending on which market you want to sell on), when a character should be speaking in American English, in English with a Hungarian accent, in Hungarian with an English accent or Hungarian, obviously must have posed a great difficulty in handling the task of story-telling, and would have made suspending disbelief a bit more difficult for the audience anyway. But English with a Slavic accent as English with a Hungarian accent really doesn't work well when you hear it. OK, for an American with no Hungarian connection it can be alright. But there were problems if you put yourself beyond this, too. Beside errors in telling the story, the Hungary showed in the movie is just not real. It's interesting that among the comments so far I have only seen a guy from Kent (the UK) point that out, even contrary to some others who found the atmosphere of the Hungarian scenes authentic. I have felt neither the political situation get across to the viewer, nor local culture being authentically presented. Altogether, the mood of the era is not captured at all, not translated to the mainly American audience that may still, of course, feel as though it would be.So why would I still recommend the film? On the one hand Eva Gardos doesn't do justice to herself, for the story is really damn interesting. Not just because of the role history plays in it, but because you have women in the focus here and so you're guaranteed to see strong female characters. Or not exactly guaranteed, for I have seen films with women in the focus end up differently, but in 'American Rhapsody' this is something that actually works well. It's primarily one person's responsibility I believe. She is the other reason you have to check this movie out. After the film I looked up her name on IMDb, thinking it was time for some talent-spotting. 'Scarlett Johansson' &#150; OK, I decided to remember the name. Next week one TV channel played 'Lost in Translation'. She was in it, so I decided to watch it. Just guess if I started disliking her after that&#133; -). I'll help you out. Whenever I walk across the Széchenyi Chain Bridge here in Budapest I think with amazement of her having walked across there in 'American Rhapsody'.

I found the separations of family (real or surrogate) which take place several times in the movie very emotionally powerful. I assume the director's family did move to Los Angeles - in any event it does provide the greatest disparity with the rural Hungary for the young girl. As an Easterner, I kept wondering if they had moved to the New England countryside - or to any older rural area or city in much of the rest of the country - whether the differences for the young girl would have seemed so stark. I disagree with the highlighted review that suburban America of the 1950s was shown as cold - to the contrary the film shows neighbors welcoming the new family (even if, as I think quite realistic, they don't pay too much attention to the country they're from), friends gathering for barbeques, strangers returning little lost girls to their homes, children from different countries easily making friends. I thought America was shown as a pretty warm friendly place.One problem I did have was that instead of finding the adolescent girl typical or acting as a result of her past, I thought she was a horrid brat - sullen, routinely refusing to speak when spoken to, flagrantly disobedient in leaving through windows too stay out through the night, drinking through the night with older boys, etc. I didn't sense that this WAS due to the long ago difficulty of adjustment, but was instead this girl's spoiled nature, her willfulness, her lack of obedience. (Nor do I think of it as a consequence of living in America). I was therefore completely sympathetic with Kinski's despair - only by Goldwyn's slowness to anger over her wretched behavior. I kept wondering why the family wasn't physically disciplining the child and treating the adolescent's I hate you statements with the contempt they deserved.I also disliked the withholding of information about the particular motivation for Kinski to leave Hungary for later dramatic effect. Even if the event is true, it was something that could have happened anywhere in the world - and therefore not particularly a reason to leave one country rather than another. Moreover, there was suficient reason for the family to wish to leave Hungary in any event.Nastassia Kinski and Tony Goldwyn were wonderful - as was everyone - particularly the surrogate mother, the grandmother and the child at the heart of the movie. This is a moving film - I do wish it had received more attention. It's well worth your time and rental fee.

Based on the life of the debut writer/director Eva Gardos, the movie adds the immigrant refugee perspective to the teen-age rebellion genre. While I can't know if the black-and-white scenes in 1950's Hungary are portrayed accurately, the Kodachrome sights and sounds of growing up in '50's and '60's suburbia are among the most acutely portrayed I've ever seen in the movies. While my parents weren't the ones with foreign accents--it was my grandmother-- boy do I remember that making me different from the white bread around me. Scarlett Johannsson turns in another stellar performance, as in Ghost World. This is Natassja Kinski's best role in years, and Tony Goldwyn does fine in the sympathetic paternal role that Aidan Quinn usually does. Even the kid who is Grace in TV's State of Grace is apt. All this quality helps to overcome the sentiment and nostalgia, and the creator does avoid the didacticism of most heart-warming TV movies on the same subject of reconciliation.A fine PG-13 family movie, though I would have liked to see more of what Gardos said in an interview that in her real life rebellion I did worse.(originally written 8/11/2001) "},{"Title":"Really strong, emotional","Date":"15 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This film has many mistakes (Hungary, Budapest in 50ies-60ies).

So basically the girl was growing in her home country where her parents escaped to the US because of the political/war reason. But when the girl was warmly greeted in the US airport when she was five years old, she had very serious homesickness. She thought of her foster parents in Hungary very often until she was grown up to 15. and quite understandably, her dad promised her to send her back to her foster parents if she still felt uncomfortable until she was aged. this was a trip to remember, but the director obviously was in a rush, so even though she was quite happy with her foster parents when she was in Hungary, she left again, and went back to her parents in the US. I still did not understand why the girl desired to get back even she had set up some links in the US. and surprisingly she got back soon after she met her grandmom in Hungary.

An American Rhapsody is set in the 1950's through the 60's, and goes from the turbulent laden Hungary to the prosperous but cold America. As the story usually goes the characters in this film come to America to find a better life, and end up finding that to some extent. Although, adapting to the American culture is not always automatic.At the screening I attended, the director told the audience that this is a personal film, and she basically wrote it (between her freelance editing jobs) from her own experience. This is a story worth telling.Both in the film and in real life, Eva's parents left Hungry fearing the harsh communist government (the exact details are murky), but they had to leave Eva (called Susie in the film) behind with her grandmother, who, before being jailed, handed her off to a kindly peasant couple. In the film, young Susie grew up in a modest but warm environment, a bond forms between Susie and her foster parents. Eventually Susie's well off American parents enlist the aid of Red Cross to help her come back to the states. Once there, the film centers around this mal-complacent girl and her struggle for identity. Parents Peter and Margit, well played by Tony Goldwin and Nastassja Kinski, are nice people too, but the connection was not the same. The film jumps ten years later to a teenage Susie (this time played by a precautious Scarlett Johansson) who inevitably becomes a rebel. Susie is a child of a different kind of revolution, and by doing usual adolescent stuff like drinking, smoking, shooting up her room with a shotgun, and making out with local boys; her strict mother is displeased by Susie's indifference. Mother feels she should respect her newfound freedom and Susie just wants a sense of home. Margit doesn't quite know how to handle her daughter, and apparently Peter is working too hard to be around. It is then that Susie makes the life changing decision to go back to Budapest Hungary in effort to find a sense of actualization. The longwinded synopsis I just gave takes around 130 minutes screen time, the third act is a brief and unsatisfying fifteen.It is obvious that this was a personal film for Gardos, and the basic storytelling skills are present. But in the end we are never invited into the characters hearts and minds. For the simple reason that Susie goes back to Hungary, she undergoes a this pivotal transformation, but this means nothing because all the film does is tell us that she changed. Susie may understand the transformation but we don't, and the film doesn't earn its sappy and abrupt conclusion.  The sentiments in this film are nice and all, but after recently seeing a comprehensive and heartfelt film called `Sunshine,' I was spoiled by that films prolonged storytelling magic and rich gimmickry. That similarly themed tale of doom and family in communist Hungary didn't just pay off for one generation of fully developed characters, but three! I was lost in Sunshine's complex web of duty, love, and inevitable failure. By raising some worthwhile family related themes, An American Rhapsody started off quite well, and the acting (especially by Johansson) is first rate, but unlike Sunshine, the film cant pay off with any resonating emotional cadence. By asking us to fill in the blanks as to why character arcs in this film go from point A to point B, the director/writer Eva Gardos is essentially forcing the audience to do her homework for her.Grade C        "},{"Title":"Paved with good intentions","Date":"18 September 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I have no doubt a great film could have been made from this story.

I digress, anyway, this is a well-done portrait of these lives and one of the few films that doesn't have a bias towards the Hungarian way of live as opposed to the American way of life. What seems to be most important is a feeling of closure felt by the child which she reaches at the end of the film. When the parents left Hungary, the child became a well-loved foster child and then was stolen by the real grandmother and sent to America to be a part of her real family. The discovery of the child's real upbringing is most important and this is where the story goes from here.

What lowered it below being an average, sentimental TV drama was a general lack of respect for the history and culture of Hungary. The representation of 1960's Hungary is dreadfully inaccurate with various factual errors. Although much of the Hungarian scenes were shot on location in Budapest, the rural scenes were suspiciously Romanian. Much of the language was blatantly an English script translated, and therefore the Hungarian language is often used inaccurately and unrealistically, particularly the phrase I love you which is not said in the same way as in the English language. The final insult is that much of the traditional Hungarian music in the background wasn't actually Hungarian but of Slav origin.
