But when I read some of the negative comments about this movie, I ad to make a stand. I came across this movie accidentally and I'm glad I did. I think it is one of the unsung great films on music and musicians. Based on the true life of Jerry Lee Lewis, the somewhat eccentric rock and roll genius from the 50s this movie has got soul. Most of the movies about artists end up portraying them as somewhat crazy, egomaniacs, always on the edge of a break down. But this movie has a very warm and light hearted take on Jerry's life. Throughout his ups and down his character comes out as a likable one whom you want to fall in love with. There's not a moment in the film where you would feel sad or annoyed by Jerry. And for this the kudos go to both Dennis Quaid and the director. For the reviewers who have labeled Dennis's portrayal as over the top, you guys don't have a clue who and what Jerry was. Dennis has nailed the spirited and buoyant soul that Jerry Lee Lewis was. I think the people who didn't like this film wanted to see a more serious and toned down film. But this is a film about rock and roll, and there's no better way to make it then it has been donw here. I give it a 9 out of 10. Go watch this immensely entertaining film!

Quaid was truly excellent in this role. Yes, the lip-synching was perhaps a bit too obvious at times, but for the sake of hearing some great music performed by the real Jerry Lee Lewis, that was an irritant I could easily put up with. The relationship between Lewis and Myra (Winona Ryder) is developed sensitively and tastefully by McBride. Humour is added by exploring the complex love-hate relationship between Lewis and his cousin, the evangelist Jimmy Swaggart (Alec Baldwin). There is also great irony, given what ultimately happened to Swaggart, as we listen to him lecturing Lewis about the dangers of taking the gold-paved streets of rock and roll.I really enjoyed this movie. Perhaps it was guilty of portraying everyone in it as a bit of a caricature, but it still seemed to offer an entirely believable story of Lewis's life. Well worth the watching.9/10 "},{"Title":"Dennis channels Jerry Lee","Date":"27 May 2003","Score":"32 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  From some of the reviews here, I get the feeling many viewers of this film have never seen a Jerry Lee Lewis performance, much less have ever seen him offstage.  Well, I can tell you, Dennis Quaid has the man down to pitch perfect.  But it isn't just a great impersonation.  Beneath every nuance and gesture is the frenzied heart and mind that probably would never have been able to function outside of the venue of rock and roll.  Jerry Lee was the white man's Little Richard.  He had rock and roll in his blood and he was BORN outrageous!  He also made Elvis Presley look like a wind-up doll.  `Great Balls of Fire' captures the essence of Jerry Lee's music, especially in the &#145;musical' scene with the kids outside the high school.  Rock and Roll breaks the rules, so why not have a film that breaks the rules by throwing in a musical number that obviously has no backup band?  Those who have seen the high school rock and roll movies like `High School Confidential' and `Rock Rock Rock' will appreciate this spirited ode to them.  Winona Ryder does a pretty good job for Winona Ryder, and it's fun to see John Doe (of the L.A. punk band `X') playing the somewhat stymied father of little Myra Gale.  This film is not a biopic, it's a rock and roll movie, which is what the King of rock and roll (as far as I'm concerned) deserves.  Is he a bad, bad man for marrying his thirteen-year-old cousin?  Is it anyone's business?  The marriage lasted longer then most marriages these days do.  Even if it hadn't, I think people can be capable of respecting the artist and his music even if that artist's lifestyle offends them.  That's this film's point of view, so no doubt, there will be viewers who will take offense.  But to set the record straight, the whole world did not turn their back on Jerry Lee when the news got out about his marriage to his cousin.  There were thousands of fans who actually embraced him more BECAUSE their parents and authorities hated him.  And then there were just the fans (like myself) who will always love his music and audacious energy at the piano, and have decided to leave judgment of his personal life to whatever entity is in charge of such things.

The bad outweighs the good in here, story-wise. GOOD - The music - naturally! There is some great music in here, featuring Dennis Quaid as the entertaining rockabilly-rock-country singer who surely will go down as the one of the great entertainers of his generation. Quaid lip-syncs the songs, but that okay. They sound better with Lewis doing the singing. The movie is colorful, entertaining and fast-moving. Wynona Ryder looks really cute, too.BAD - There is a little bit too much emphasis on Lewis' brother, Jimmy Swaggart (Alec Baldwin) and, of course, they make him look like some fanatical religious preacher. Hey, I'm not a charismatic follower but there was an obvious bias in here and it wasn't necessary. Also, the writers actually made Lewis look a sympathetic victim for the criticism he got marrying his 13-year-old cousin! Only in the film-making world do we see poor morals given the thumbs-up. Sorry, Jerry Lee, but marrying your 13-year-old cousin warrants a bit of criticism! I later discovered this movie was based on a book by that the same girl, so it's no wonder it makes that relationship look legitimate. The ending was not appropriate, either. Most of the characters in this film were exaggerated to the degree that they all look cartoonish. This movie could have been so much better with a more objective look at Jerry Lee's life and people in it.

His cousin says that's the devil's music, and Jerry Lee agrees--but to him that's a good thing.In the 1950's, Jerry Lee is performing that 'devil's music', and quite good at it. We see him go to Sam Phillips, the man who made Elvis a star. Will he be the next Elvis? He might very well be that talented. Phillips is very impressed, and his record becomes a hit.Once Elvis goes into the army, Lewis has his chance to become as big as the King, if not bigger. What may have been his downfall, if this movie is accurate, is his marriage to his second cousin Myra. The English do not approve, and Americans aren't much more receptive.Dennis Quaid does a great job, although it is apparently Lewis himself doing the singing. But Quaid pounds that piano and behaves wildly and shows a lot of passion and energy. I did enjoy the music, even though I usually like my music softer. It's amazing Lewis' music was banned by radio stations, because his songs get played on the station where I listen to Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Nat King Cole. Winona Ryder is a delight, especially when Myra goes shopping after the wedding. Steve Allen looks surprisingly young playing himself, and he seems to be having a good time. Elvis appears briefly several times, played by Michael St. Gerard, who portrayed the King in a 1990 TV bio. Elvis doesn't say much, but he does look the part. In one scene he and a girl are in bed together watching Lewis perform on TV, and the girl seems to want to do 'a whole lotta shaking'. Footage of others watching Lewis is shown (though they are probably watching something else). Included are a shocked Ward and June Cleaver.'Patricia' by Perez Prado seems appropriate for the scene where Jerry Lee and Myra wonder whether to tell Myra's parents. The organ has the whimsical, playful quality that is such a big part of Myra's character, the trumpet section reflects Lewis' wild streak, and the trombones sound like Myra's father probably will after he gets the news.While there were negatives in Lewis' life, this movie doesn't really make these look as bad as it could have. I found the movie entertaining as a whole. "},{"Title":"Goodness!! Gracious!!

You see just how devoted to Myra Jerry Lee really was.  That's the kind of love girls DREAM about! John Doe, Dennis Quaid, Winona Ryder, they were all great in the film.

Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis to a tee but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage Jerry in mind. Nobody acts that way all the time, and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish, reducing Lewis to a buffoonish caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.The author of the book this is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios (I particularly liked Dino on Dean Martin); in the books Tosches gives us a full human being, both separate from and involved in the biz. Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them. As cartoons go, it is mildly amusing, but otherwise it is one of the most egregious, film-destroying performances I have had the honor of viewing. Terrible... "},{"Title":"Wonderful soundtrack - very disappointing film","Date":"11 November 2008","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" Despite all the great music, I was very disappointed with this film for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a very rough interpretation of real events, and in places extremely so. Certain key characters are portrayed incorrectly - notably Jack Clement and Sam Phillips - but most importantly it is the persona of Jerry Lee himself that is of concern. I certainly don't blame Dennis Quaid for this; his performance is suitably crazed and his on-stage antics are at times reminiscent of The Killer in his prime. But Quaid was clearly instructed to play the role more as a comic turn than as the troubled and conflicted man that Lewis was at the time. In fact, the whole film is positioned as some sort of over-the-top comedy, and some of the lowest points of Lewis's life are treated with, at best, a kind of dark slapstick.There are also some more minor details which I personally disagreed with. In some ways, getting Lewis himself to re-record many of his classic hits was a good idea and added more immediacy to the 'live' performances than the old and familiar recordings would have done. However, in parts of the film where actual records of his songs were playing, I believe the originals should have been used to add authenticity. This raises the wider point of the fact that Dennis Quaid lip-syncs at all. Ever since Gary Busey, Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith performed every song completely live in The Buddy Holly Story, anything less has been (rightly or wrongly) seen as some sort of cop-out in rock biopics. Lip-syncing has been used with minor success in films such as Ray, but there is an argument that says you should allow whichever actor you have entrusted to play a rock legend the opportunity to undertake the most important aspect of the character - the musical performance.Another issue with the film is one of its main themes - the relationship between Jerry Lee and Myra, which is handled rather clunkily. The resolution between Lewis and Myra's father is sudden and unexplained, and the relationship somehow goes from being completely taboo to accepted and even normal in a very short time.I'm not surprised that this film was disliked by the Killer himself. It makes light of extremely serious chapters in his life and misrepresents certain people who were dear to him. In my view, it is never a good idea to take a real story and tailor it for your own preference in the hope of entertaining people. Usually, the real story - and in this case, the real man - is much more interesting.

It serves as a singularly appropriate title for a film about his life.Jerry Lee is played by Dennis Quaid and the role is quite a stretch for him. I'm used to seeing an older and more mature Quaid in films like Swimmer and The Express. Still he does do very well capturing the essence of Lewis as I remember him as a lad.The key to understanding Jerry Lee Lewis is in remembering that what he did in marrying those child brides was quite normal behavior from where he came from. Young girls in the more rural sections of the south frequently got married at 13 to 15 and the success rate wasn't any better or worse than in the more sophisticated parts of the country. I do well remember the scandalous stories back in the late Fifties that put a halt to Lewis's meteoric career. Lewis came back and of course never got quite the same success, but music trends change in any event. He's still doing well on the nostalgic circuit, playing more for the love of it than the need for money. Playing that honky tonk piano and singing meant more to him than the trappings of success.Winona Ryder got a big break in her career playing Lewis's notorious child bride Myra. Interestingly enough at the same time Lewis's stories were in the news, Errol Flynn at 48 escorting young adolescent Beverly Aadland was also making headlines. And Flynn was still married to Patrice Wymore.Great Balls Of Fire is a good film, but really without an ending because Jerry Lee is still making music. May he continue to make it.

However, it's precisely Quaid's energy (and the accomplished 1950's period flavor) that keeps this otherwise undistinguished movie going. It's one-half rollicking musical-bio, and the other half an unsteady riches-to-rags tale. Jerry Lee finds his bombastic stage presence hard to shake off in life, rising to the top of the charts--and about to steal the rock 'n roll mantle from Elvis P.--until a marriage to his under-aged second cousin causes a backlash that lasted many years. Fashioned like a live-action cartoon, it's something of a drag when the filmmakers eventually pull out all the usual tried-and-tired clichés, boozy depression and angry rebellion. Winona Ryder, as Quaid's teen bride, struggles with a sketchy role; in fact, all the supporting characters are one-dimensional compared to Lewis.

Another picking point I had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. Then Lewis begins to play his rendition of A whole lot of shaking' and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world.

Discovered by Sam Phillips, the man who discovered Elvis and Johnny Cash, Lewis came up the ranks quickly and was poised to become the King of Rock 'n' Roll when Elvis went into the Army. But the scandal that broke when it was revealed he was married to his 13-year-old cousin Myra (Winona Ryder) and was in fact a bigamist - which today would be shrugged off - just about ruined his career. Soon he was prone to violence on and off stage and imbibing in alcohol.I have always loved Jerry Lee Lewis' music, but the only thing I knew about him was that he married his cousin - so that will show you where all the publicity was focused. I had no idea that Jimmy Swaggert (played here by Alec Baldwin) was also his cousin. I was struck by the qualities he had in common with Elvis - they both were highly-charged performers with so much energy a stage couldn't hold them, both completely original, natural talents inspired by music they heard in their communities, and both were discovered by Sam Phillips. What each one was most of all was just like one of the kids that he sang to, who could pulsate, dance and let their hormones run wild with the music. Lewis remains today an electrifying performer with an unmistakable sound. His high gear Great Balls of Fire, Breathless, High School Confidential, and of course, Whole Lotta Shaking' Going' On are unmatched.Now, how accurate was this film? Jerry Lee himself claims he never acted the way Dennis Quaid portrayed him in his life, though others say Quaid was right on. It's a little like Scottish people hearing a Scottish burr on an actor and saying, we don't talk like that when they do. I will quibble with the depiction of Sam Phillips as a snake oil salesman who, according to this script, lost Elvis. Phillips didn't lose Elvis - his record company was too small to promote Elvis as he needed to be promoted, and Phillips badly needed the money Elvis' contract would bring. Elvis, Vernon and Gladys Presley thought they had it good - no one dreamed Elvis could accomplish what he did - so Sam Phillips could have kept Elvis with Sun for a longer period of time, but rather than stifling Presley's career, he let him go.Quaid does an excellent job as a thrilling performer who perhaps isn't the most likable person off stage - in fact, might be a little sleazy - and Ryder captures the teenage silliness beautifully. Baldwin doesn't get to do much but proselytize.The most interesting thing about Great Balls of Fire is its relevance today. Rock 'n' Roll was perceived as the way to complete degradation for teenagers and the performers were servants of the devil. Rap music is viewed the same way today. With rock 'n' roll, the road to degradation was a sexual one - swinging those hips and getting all charged up could only mean trouble. Today, with rap, it's the message of violence against women and attitudes towards them, the use of violence and foul language. In between, we had the schools ruling that no one could have a Beatles haircut. Maybe someday it will occur to somebody that many things can destroy a generation - war and drugs being two - but music doesn't seem to be one of them.

We can already guess that there had to be a lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what is depicted here. The Jerry Lee Lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time, but then again, all the other characters are only one pencil-stroke from being total cartoon characters.Let's take the beginning. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see Jerry getting his inspiration. Might be possible. We see how the two cousins choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's thrilling and a little scary. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra. From then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed.Not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most one noty character in the film. She teases, she sobs, she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it. There is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third Mrs. Lewis and speaking of wives, where are the first two? That is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. We see Jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable downfall. Absolutely, no basis in reality.To conclude another minor quarrel The movie takes place from '56 to '58 and still Myra says I am only 13 right up till the end.

So even while Jerry Lee Lewis was becoming the Wild Man of Rock and Roll, I don't recall what a stir he was causing with his 'savage animal rhythms' back in 1957. What I do know is that it's impossible to sit still with a whole lotta shaking going on, and the rock and roll world is a lot better off for Jerry Lee having made his contribution.With that said, the film comes across as somewhat disappointing. Maybe it's Dennis Quaid's pouty and exaggerated portrayal, or maybe it's the severely restricted view one gets of virtually a single year in the life of the rock star. Perhaps a treatment in the style of The Buddy Holly Story or La Bamba might have fleshed out the singer a little better, instead of subjecting us to the one dimensional character that appears here from open to close. Some reviewers on this board insist that this was Jerry Lee right from the get-go, but I find it hard to believe that his life wasn't more nuanced than the picture we get here. Not only that, but if comparisons were going to be drawn along side Elvis and Chuck Berry, then maybe we could have seen some interaction between Jerry and his contemporaries instead of the flip brush off he gave them in the story. Jerry and Berry jamming would have been a whole lot more fun to watch.But if you dig Jerry Lee's style of manic raunch and roll, you won't hear any better than what's on display in Great Balls of Fire. Jerry Lee himself provides the vocal power to Quaid's ferocious delivery, the only part of his over the top performance that rings true throughout the film.

With few exceptions it seems, the lives of the first wave of rock 'n' roll greats took some mighty unusual twists and turns, but outside of the tragic death of Buddy Holly in early 1959, Jerry Lee's meteoric rise and fall probably contains more grist for a movie than any of them.Director McBride gives us a full-on take on Lewis' spectacular emergence and brief time when he appeared to be the number one challenger to the King Of Rock 'n' Roll title held by ex-Sun records label-mate, one Elvis Aaron Presley, but in truth, Lewis, whose first two hits are as good as anything Elvis himself mustered in his golden era in the 50's, was probably not good looking enough and certainly was too rebellious and unstable to really carry his fans with him thereafter, although a shrewd, no-nonsense manager like The King's much-criticised Colonel Tom Parker, might have helped.The film itself is highly stylised and is so apocryphal in its treatment of events that I had to make a decision to stop wincing at every convolution in the story-line - worst example, Elvis, Army satchel on his shoulder, dropping by Sun Studios to tell Jerry that he can have it all, i.e. his position as the King - and enjoy it as much as any other Hollywood bowdlerisation you can name. And did Jerry Lee ever really set fire to his piano over a disagreement with Chuck Berry...?Anyway, the depiction of the era is great, with T-birds cruising up and down the streets and the down-home feel of the legendary Sun Studios brought to life. The narrative tries to play up Lewis' contrasting relationship with his since disgraced evangelical Bible-punching cousin Jimmy Swaggert, but there's more of interest in the Killer's liaison with his thirteen year-old wife Myra. The film holds back a little on this sensitive subject, but in the end doesn't shirk it completely (impossible not to, really) and certainly gets across Lewis' self-destructive kiss my ass outlook, particularly during his ill-fated visit to England.Dennis Quaid gives the challenging role of maverick Lewis his all and even if he can't quite put across the undoubtedly darker side of Jerry Lee, his vitality (and spot-on lip-synching!), particularly in the musical numbers, makes up for this. The movie-stealer though is unquestionably Wynonna Ryder as his child-bride Myra, not yet a woman but still drawn to this wild man with a mixture of child-like wonder, innocence and curiosity.There's good support too with none of the acting jarring with the evocation of the period and even if the whole sometimes looks like a slightly heavied-up re-run of Happy Days with its choreographed dancing routines and occasional tricksy devices like for example the telephone wire split-screen device during a telephone conversation, all paying due homage to the era.As stated, this day-glo approach doesn't always serve Lewis' sometimes darker story too well but on the whole, Lewis deserved this affectionate tribute and no-one will question the greatness of his early music, which more even than this very entertaining movie, will be what we remember him by.

A useful feature, it has legs, others help to give it more useful legs, it even has great balls of fire. * I purchased this as it is early Winona and that is a greater puzzle to me. I had thought that this was her at age 15, playing a 13, yet the feature date says age 17 to 18 and other comments say 18. Yet her look, coupled with her 14ish look in Lucas (1986), make 15 feel real. I would like to get to know production dates for this early stuff. In 1969 (1988) she looks so 18ish to me, In Heathers (1989) so 17ish, in Beatle Juice (1988) so 16ish. A fast-ish browse of fan sites did not uncover any reason to doubt the dates as the order in which these features were made. Some sites also include early reviews and what I have read goes along with that. Guess that I just have to accept that actors are actors, inhabiting different worlds and realities than what is obvious to me. * Sympathies to those growing up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, etc in those days. It is very different to 50's England in many respects, but not so different in others. Lewis and Jimmy and the others will have found it to be going against the grain to actually find any worthwhile sense. Oh so different to now, oh so very much the same.

As for Ryder herself, she looks a little too old to play a 13-year-old; I've heard that in footage of them, Myra looks like a little girl.So, Jerry Lee Lewis leaves a lot to be desired.

I look for Jerry Lee Lewis or the 'killer' as he was known. Funnily enough he isn't in the book. That is exactly the reason I got this film out. I know nothing about the man. I am always curious about musicians, especially musicians who are supposedly from the 'golden' era of music. What fascinates me about the fifties is the dualism of that time period. You have elderly people who tell you how much better things were back then. How it was as sterile and perfect as the inside of a burger king fast food joint. Then you actually look into the history of that decade and you find... ...lots of nasty stuff. Racism, sexism and communist blacklisting. A period in history where no one could freely express themselves. Where African Americans could still be lynched. Yeah, what a great decade... I find it funny that even the Beach Boys were really screwed up. Didn't Bryan Wilson have some massive psychological problems? I digress... Jerry Lee Lewis grows up in the south with his cousin Jimmy. He learns to play the piano and is influenced by the blues and jazz. He later goes on to joins Elvis's record label and soon is on the way to stardom. The film itself is total bubblegum. It is an attempted celebration of the 'killer' and a musical. It has no depth and does not explore the relationships of Lewis very well at all. However, I did not really mind this because as soon as I saw Dennis Quaid on the cover, I knew... I knew that this was going to the cinematic equivalent of a double whopper. In fact it is hard to rate Quaids performance because was Lewis actually like that? Maybe the guy was bipolar? Normally, I would say that the performance is way over the top. A caricature, but then I have nothing to go on from the real person. I know absolutely nothing about the subject that the performance is based on.  What is also funny is that Wiona Ryder looks like she has wandered onto the wrong set. She keeps looking like 'what am I doing here?' Another interesting factor about this film is just how dislikable the 'killer' actually is. Lewis comes off in this movie as an egotistical, self centered, sometimes cruel, petty, not to clever individual with a severe case of arrested development. It is funny because this is a film that is meant to be flattering. What if the director had not liked him? He could have made Lewis into an absolute monster! Marrying a 13 year old girl who was his second cousin? I thought this was a stereotype of the 'south.' Obviously, I have been proven wrong! He must have given up on trying to be an adult! He was actually surprised this helped to destroy his career? That is pedophilia! How dumb is this guy? In the film he actually states that you have to get them when they are young so they can serve you well. The 50's were hardly the time of female liberation. Myra leaves the house with a doll house as a suitcase. I found this all kind of creepy!        What is even stranger is that Lewis is related to Jimmy Swaggart. The famous televangelist was later caught with a prostitute by a private investigator hired by another televangelist. Marvin Gorman had been looking for revenge for Swaggart exposing him. Swaggart later admitted he was addicted to pornography. The woman he was caught with also stated in a penthouse interview that he wanted her to give consent to him having sex with her 9 year old daughter! This is obviously a really screwed up family! What the hell is going on in the south?    So despite the fact that this is meant to be flattering to all those that are involved. The really strange situations of the film allude to a much darker narrative. I suspect if this was made like a hardcore Chekhov drama that the film could have been extremely dark... But really just see this film if you like Jerry Lee's music. The movie reminded me of that Buddy Holly musical that tours around now and then. The script and acting don't really matter. They are just window dressing for the actual music.  What I find amazing is that Lewis survived through the sixties and didn't join N.A.M.B.L.A! This is a strange movie! I'll give it 5 out of 10.

Dennis Quaid's over-acting turned Jerry Lee into a two-dimensional cartoon character.There is enough material in Jerry Lee's life for a dozen films, so it was disappointing this movie stopped short soon after his disastrous tour to England in 1958, when news of his marriage to his 13-year old cousin Myra leaked out. This was nothing unusual in the Deep South at the time - practically everyone married young. The scene where Elvis is in bed with the young Priscilla (aged not more than 14) was meant to allude to that fact, but was probably too subtle for some people to grasp.The film has good and bad things going for it. The best thing is the fantastic soundtrack, which Jerry recorded especially for the film. It is amazing that a man then in his 50s could better some of his original hits, and still sound like a 21 year old! Jerry is STILL rocking in 2005 at 70, and has a new CD out soon with other legends duetting with him, called The Pilgrim.The film should have at least have covered up to the early 1970s, when Jerry was one of the hottest stars in Country Music. He climbed back into the charts in 1968 with Another Place Another Time and a non-stop string of hits followed into the 1980s. Controversy has stalked Jerry Lee all his life, but all we get in this movie is a cartoon depiction of about 2 years of his life.There should definitely be a remake or a sequel, but to do the subject justice a 20-part TV series would be needed at least. Just look at the material - all his hits from 1957 thru to the 1980s, the tragedies (deaths of two sons, two wives, his elder brother, his parents), the scandals (cousin Jimmy Swaggart's fall from grace, Jerry accidentally shooting his bass player in the chest, run-ins with the law and the IRS, etc.).But the other thing in the movie's favor is it won Jerry a whole new younger generation of fans. Only trouble is, some people see Dennis Quaid and think that is the real Jerry Lee. It's not - look at the DVDs/videos of Jerry Lee Lewis on Shindig! in the mid-1960s if you want to see the real thing.But I still like the movie, because it's all we've got at the moment as a biopic of the greatest musician of the 20th and 21st centuries.

As it stands, I have distance on it and I love it because it is unlike any other film ever made.Jim McBride as a director treats the material as a straight rock and roll fairy tale.  That's why, if the characters in the movie were fictitious, the film would be a minor stylistic classic among film buffs.  Akin to Dick Tracy for its production design or Moulin Rouge for its weaving of pop hits into a broadly stroked love story.  It would be beloved if only for the few scenes between Dennis Quaid and Alec Baldwin (as Lewis' cousin, Jimmy Swaggart) playing polar archetypes.As it stands, however, the people and events depicted herein are real. Even on a script level, the movie knows that Jerry Lee is a much worse person than depicted in the film.  Where the film alludes to Jerry Lee being a general cheating womanizer and, at times, even a specifically cruel individual to his young wife, the script points it out more evidently. That the script largely demurs from the sometimes horrific moments that Lewis instigated in his true life romance with Myra Gale Brown is enough to turn off most viewers.  That the film itself almost completely ignores Lewis' uglier traits (even while the script is acknowledging them) is why it is considered so uneven and, thus, unsuccessful.  However, completely detached from those detestable facts, the film does offer some of the greatest rock music ever recorded, an appropriately rebellious, true lovin' rocker to record it, and a soft-focus, easily-quotable rock and roll fantasy romance for a screenplay.  Combine those things with the unfortunate, incontrovertible truth and you have an exceptionally odd amalgam of a movie.P.S.  I'll add that I am a huge fan of Jerry Lee Lewis' music, so I admit that I have one up on a viewer who is either uninitiated or is just plain not a fan.

I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. He doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other award for bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy?The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. That was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of Jerry's underage cousin/wife. This brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I fail to see what is so okay about that, but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about family values.Another problem is the format. Is it a stright forward re telling of Lewis' life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the truly weird scene where Jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was Broadway musical in search of a Tony.

This film is a fun-filled, rocking, over-the-top, snazzy, story of the Killer. It never lets up on the music (all original performances by Jerry Lee) and the cast is doing nothing more than having a good time with it all. A few 50's style insertions of some song and dance numbers work magnificently.During the downfall, which is presented honestly and somberly we understand the devastation and effect on all involved. But just like Lewis himself, it rebounds with guts and gusto and never misses a color saturated beat.No one ever put out those great balls of fire, he played it hard and he played it forever.I can play anything, anytime, anywhere says Jerry......ain't it the truth.

(1989)**** (out of 4) Terrific bio-pic follows Jerry Lee Lewis (Dennis Quaid) as he quickly rises up the charts and appears to be about to take over the king of rock 'n roll from Elvis but the media and fans turn on him when they discover that he's married to his 13-year-old cousin (Winona Ryder). For the life of me I'll never understand some of the negative reviews this film gets. Yes, Lewis had a pretty hard life full of violence, drugs, alcohol and various other items that really don't get shown here but the point of this movie wasn't to be a dark and disturbing movie about abuse but instead it was a movie about the glories of rock 'n roll and on that level the movie is a grand slam with great music and great performances. There's no denying that it appears the spirit of Lewis got into Quaid because he delivers a remarkable performance and it's a real shame that he didn't even get an Oscar-nomination. It's very hard for any actor to try and play a personality like Lewis but Quaid has no trouble and in my opinion delivers one of the best performances by an actor playing a real-life person. The spirit, fire and energy he brings to the film is just remarkable and each time I view the film the performance impresses me even more. He gets a strong supporting cast to work with him with Ryder also turning in a great performance as she really captures the spirit of a 13-year-old who gets caught up with his older cousin and his lifestyle. Stephen Tobolowsky and Trey Wilson are terrific as the Phillips brothers and we get Alec Baldwin in nice form playing Lewis' cousin Jimmy Swaggart. The movie features Lewis doing his own singing and piano playing and it's just so energetic that you'll have no problem shaking your leg and wanting to get up and dance. The soundtrack features all his classic tunes and they sound remarkably well and pack one terrific punch. Again, there were several very dark years in the career of Lewis but this film really doesn't look at them and I don't have a problem with it. Most music bios are full of the dark stuff so it's rather refreshing to see something that has fun with the subject matter. Yes, a dark film could have been made about the alcohol. Yes, a dark film could have made about the marriage. This film could have done a lot of things but what it does is deliver entertainment and an energy that is hard to top. "},{"Title":"Wow! Great music, gorgeous guys and gals, plus spotless classic cars.","Date":"7 March 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" What more could a viewer want? Great sounding music from the original Jerry Lee Lewis, pretty girls, handsome guys and cars. OH THE CARS! So many incredible cars from the fifty's in pristine condition. I watched it a second time just to hear the music and see the cars.This movie does a good job of portraying Jerry Lee and his life. Some may think it a bit overacted but Jerry Lee was an up front, over the type kind of guy in almost everything he did. It was his passion for the music. Like he wrote, you're driving me crazy. And maybe he seemed a bit crazy to average folks but hey, he had soul and it wouldn't let him sit still. He had to move, to play it out and sing it as well. Some reviewers felt the scenes depicting his alcoholism and on stage outbursts were detrimental to the movie. In reality, artists with the passion of Jerry Lee have a burning drive within that pushes them to emotions the average person can usually control. Artists who have the pride and passion of Jerry find it most difficult to deal with setbacks because they are driven to excel. That is what makes them artists. Whether they be musicians, painters, sculptors, architects, etc. They are constantly pursuing ways to express what they think and feel. And sometimes they are crushed when others don't appreciate their efforts. They have above average skill at what they do and yet they are emotionally more fragile than the average John or Jane Doe. I rated 8of10 (which is high for me) because it takes a Lawrence of Arabia or a Gone With the Wind to get a 10 from me. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the early rock and roll era music or someone who wants a bit of insight as to what it was like to be around back then.I found my version at Netflix....

Jerry Lee wants to change the ways of Rock & Roll by playing on his piano, which most people thinks it's wouldn't work. Since Jerry Lee is ambitious and he knows the music is changing. When he recorded an demo record for a music producer Sam Phillips (Trey Wilson). Which Mr. Phillips loves as soon as he heard it. Mr. Phillips wants to make Jerry Lee is a big music star and maybe even bigger than Elvis Presley.

Which Jerry Lee later married her but when the public finds out that his underage bride. He finds himself fighting for his career if not always for the better.Directed by Jim McBride (Breathless, The Big Easy) made an enjoyable brash and very board feature that has an memorable lead turn by Quaid in one of his best roles. Great Balls of Fire was probably the first film that doesn't take the usual Biography feature seriously. McBride's film keeps everything moving and it never slows down, even the flaws starts to show up. There's strong supporting performances by Ryder, J.W. Brown as Jerry Lee's cousin and Alec Baldwin as Jerry Lee's evangelical cousin.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an terrific Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound (It would have been great if the sound was remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD's only special feature to this fascinating film is the original theatrical trailer. Great Balls of Fire was an box office disappointment, when it was release in the summer of 1989. Which it is a shame that the audiences were not interesting in this movie until it becomes an major cult classic on video. The music in this feature are excellent and even Walk HardThe Dewey Cox Story pays some loving tribute to this movie. Great Balls of Fire is a one of a kind film that certainly lived on for nearly 20 years. Don't miss it. Based upon the book by Myra Lewis and Murray Silver, Jr. (****/*****).

He seemed poised and perfectly placed to fill the void left by The King when he was drafted...but life, love, and the prudishness of the era all intervened.Please do NOT blame this wonderful, and wonderfully well made film for the discomfort it's romance might STILL cause (It DOES NOT glorify taking a child bride...please watch Winona Ryder's astonishing, heartbreaking, brilliantly funny, utterly tragic perf...her best EVER)....Please don't slam it for capturing the broad, funny, sexy, and infuriating Killer so well that Jerry Lee flinched from the resemblance.This is an unrecognized classic...It deserves rediscovery...and should have made Ryder and the magnificent Quaid superstars!

Oh, yes, there is the conflict with his other cousin Jimmy Swaggart (Alec Baldwin).Quaid follows up what I consider his best role as Det. Remy McSwain in The Big Easy with a rocking, rollicking role as The Killer. Like The Big Easy, the music is an essential and most enjoyable part of the film.

The first mentioned of them is still praised all over the globe by youths and adults alike as a genius.That would probably have been the cause for Arbuckle, too, if he hadn't been involved in a scandal which made him the first actor in Hollywood history to be banned from the silver screen. Last year, actor Johnny Depp talked very flatteringly about Roscoe's work and said he wanted to make a movie based on his life with the scandal as the main subject. While this truly would give the silent comedian more attention after having been largely forgotten since our parents had yet to be born, I still find it very shameful that the only element in Arbuckle's life that seems to interest people is the scandal which ruined his status as the master comedian he actually was.In several ways, I feel the same has been done to Jerry Lee Lewis. Being the arguably greatest and undoubtedly the wildest rock'n'roller ever produced, Jerry's popularity faded dramatically after he married his under-aged cousin. GREAT BALLS OF FIRE!, starring Dennis Quaid as The Killer, is purely based on how his life (and his wife's life, above all) changed when his music was banned from most radio stations and he was hardly allowed to perform on Television, simply because of the marriage.Quaid does a pretty good portrayal of Lewis (I expected it to be much worse), and I consider the music, done by Lewis himself, to be some of the best ever done in the history of Rock'n'Roll. I actually prefer some of the movie tracks rather than the originals, and that really says something. You can hardly sit still while listening to Great Balls of Fire, and to see Quaid roll on the piano is a treat. Jerry Lee-buffs should certainly not miss this.And yet ... while the movie explains that Lewis married his cousin because of pure love and NOT because he was a disgusting pervert, as some ignorant sources claim, it could have been done differently. A movie based on the life of a seventy-one-year old musician (54 at the time the movie was made) who revolutionized Rock'n'Roll throughout with his unique voice and style should include more than the story of a scandal that almost ruined him in his youth. Much more. The movie is also far from being completely accurate.I give this movie seven out of ten stars, but that's mainly because of the music. While I enjoyed GREAT BALLS OF FIRE!, I'm still waiting for THE REAL STORY OF JERRY LEE LEWIS.

Even though I didn't think Winona Ryder did a great job; the play between Quaid and Ryder was so special. You simply can not like them together in this movie. Many of the other actors are truly impressing too, maybe Alec Baldwin in special. He seems so mad by Jerry's singing that you can't understand how Quaid just can stand there and smile.

At the same time, Quaid's performance is itself quirky -  along the lines of Depp's `Fear and Loathing.' The whole thing is a Punch and Judy doing  a Punch and Judy.It gets my appreciation for that. But at root, it just isn't a very interesting story part rock  history, part trailer trash romance, and part holy/nasty metaphor. But then, that's pop  music I guess.There is a scene that sticks Jerry Lee opening for Chuck Berry. Chuck is an ordinary guy,  someone whose life is not his performance. Music is just a job, and he would never get  the whole reflexive passion thang. Jerry goes nuts, literally setting the piano on fire. Then  he marches off with `Follow that, Killer!`The actor's expression is priceless. Almost worth the admission by itself. He is supposed  to be the surrogate anchor for us, watching from the sidelines.There's another image worth keeping. Our vulnerable Winona packs up to move in with  her new `husband.' Her luggage is a dollhouse. That's a sweet keeper, just like Julia  Style's little box of `needful things' in `Hamlet.'

Rumor has it that John Travolta will play Mickey Gilley (a little wink to Urban Cowboy) and Sean Penn as Lewis' guitar player Kenny Lovelace.The movie starts with Jerry Lee Lewis' Live at the Star Club in Hamburg concert in 1964 and I believe ends in 1986 when he gets inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of fame. This is going to be a treat for real fans of Lewis who enjoy his country music. We are going to get his 1968 top ten single Another Place, Another Time along with What's Made Milwaukee Famous, She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me), Me & Bobby McGee and of course 1977's Middle Age Crazy. The scenes of Quaid as Lewis in North Hollywood's Palomino Club, Country Music's most important West Coast club during the 70's and 80's is going to be epic. This should be in production by 2012.

The flighty and totally fitting thirteen-year old character was BRILLIANTLY acted out by Ryder, and Quaid delivered and absolutely captivating performance.  I don't find this movie lacking anything required in a movie about a music genius' life, and in fact, it goes positively overboard with the tremendous depiction of Jerry Lee's and Myra's lives.  The music video is wonderful as well. Alec Baldwin also delivers to add a little religious drama to this rocking flick, portraying Jimmy Swaggart, Jerry Lee's cousin.The movie drags you in and makes you feel unbelievable apathy for the couple who married for love, and start to even hate the British press for ruining Lewis' career. Anyway, the movie, I think, is nearly perfect.  If you want an amusing movie, I strongly suggest you rent this, also if you are a fan of Ryder or Quaid, this should not be missed.

Here, as the legendary Jerry Lee Lewis, he is about as believable as an actor can get. Winona Ryder, who plays his 14-yr-old cousin then wife, was actually 18, but she was such a waif of a girl she is very credible in this role.  The one poorly cast role was Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart. I had lots of TV exposure to Swaggart when I lived in Louisiana in the 70s, and he didn't look or act anything close to what was depicted in this movie. Some may think it very strange that a mature man would marry his under age cousin. However, that was not so strange at all back then, and over there, if you know what I mean!  -) This film is a good one, for its depiction of Lewis, arguably one of the most important figures in American music development.Ryder was such a sweet, innocent young girl then.  Just last week, now at age 30, she was arrested for shoplifting thousands of dollars of jewelry. What a shame. She may be innocent, but I doubt it. "}]
