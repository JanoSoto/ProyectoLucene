Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best fourth movie in a series ever. I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship (both on set and off set) is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious (even though that is a part of his character). In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character (something that was missing in the previous film). Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the all-round comedy of the film, but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise, he is definitely the most menacing.The action is still brilliant despite the fact that the actors are getting older. The story is decent for a fourth film and the overall execution is brilliant. I actually prefer this film to the second and third of the series because I find it to be more entertaining overall. It cuts down on the seriousness (even though its still there) and adds a lot to the comedy and this is a very good choice.All in all an excellent film. Highly recommendable for all fans of action movies and the series in particular.8/10 "},{"Title":"Lethal Weapon 4 - Great ending to a great series","Date":"23 April 2006","Score":"49 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This movie is the end of a series which spanned almost two decades.This time around Riggs (Gibson) is facing three very personal problems. 1) Age is catching up to him, 2) his g/f is pregnant and he's facing being a daddy, and 3) he's facing the dilemma of wanting to remarry. Also, Murtaugh (Glover) is about to be a grand-daddy to a baby by his oldest daughter, and she is secretly married to Detective Butters (Chris Rock), which everyone is keeping a secret from him.Add to this the fact that both they are now taking on one of the most powerful crime syndicates in the world, the Chinese Triads, in an effort to stop slave trading and money laundering. The task of a bad guy this time goes to Jet Li, who made his American debut (atleast from an American Film Company) in this movie. Yes, this is the movie which launched him here in the states, and he deserved it.This movie is as good as the rest of them, though nothing beats part 2 in my opinion. Lethal Weapon 4 really hits home on a lot of subjects, such as facing responsibility, to coming to terms with who you are. And it ended the series in a way that makes you smile and love it even more.I give it a 9 out of 10.

It was enjoyable to see the characters we love deal with the inevitabilities of aging and the fierce loyalty of friendship. Some of the mystery is gone and it feels like a pair of comfortable shoes. But aren't those shoes your favorite ones? It was interesting to see the development of Lorna and Riggs' relationship, as well as the growing up of the Murtaugh kids. It makes you feel like you're catching up with old friends at a reunion! Plenty of action and the incredible work of Jet Li make this movie a favorite at my house. Overall, a great wrap-up to the series and a lot of fun for long time fans. Worth seeing! If the language is a real issue, watch for it on TNT and enjoy the edited version.

The Lethal Weapon series is really a good group of action films, but part 4 doesn't really seem to take itself seriously. It clearly had the biggest budget and probably some of the most elaborate stunts and action scenes (as well as some of the most exciting, such as that thrilling freeway chase scene), but many of the other elements of the film have deteriorated badly. I think that with the addition of Chris Rock, while he delivered a satisfactory performance as far as the role that he was playing, caused the film to detract into too much goofy comedy, which unnecessarily diverted attention away from the surprisingly interesting smuggling plot involving illegal Chinese immigrants and counterfeit money. Joe Pesci was just as funny as ever, which is probably the reason the Chris Rock actually took away from the film as a whole. Pesci is all the comic relief that a Lethal Weapon movie ever needed, and Rock is another substantial addition of comic relief that just isn't necessary. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson work great together for the fourth time; I'm beginning to wonder if they couldn't go on with this great duo forever. And of course, Renee Russo is back, with her and Riggs picking up with their quirky relationship, right where they left off at the end of part 3. But the person who really steals the whole show is Jet Li. Man, I thought Jackie Chan was fun to watch! Even though it's not all exactly real, this guy pulls out some unbelievable martial arts moves that give Lethal Weapon 4 a much-needed boost of energy. I wonder how long it will be before Jet Li and Jackie Chan come out with a movie together. Probably never, because if they worked together, no one could touch them, and if they were enemies, neither of them would be able to end up as the loser or the bad guy. Oh well, we can still hope, right? Even though the 4th installment in the Lethal Weapon series is not nearly as good as any of the previous three, it still remains a quality action film, despite its many weaknesses.

I remember watching it the first time and thinking, oh no, another bad sequel.However, once past the first ten minutes, the film starts to pick up its pace and retreat into familiar Lethal Weapon style.Just like film 2 and 3, Lethal Weapon 4 isn't as good as the original, but it never gets to the point of unbearable. It is quite entertaining and fun to watch, with some very great actors, that have some very great chemistry between each other.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover fit like a glove, and Joe Pesci is perfect as the comedy relief, not being like the recent side kicks we always see, that are so obnoxious we want to punch them. Mr. Pesci is a very talented actor, and he always makes me laugh, whether it's Lethal Weapon 4 or Raging Bull and Casino.Rene Russo provides Mel's love interest yet again, and though I found the marriage thing a bit of a throw-in, it was still good for the story. It provided some laughs at the end of the film.Chris Rock stars in one role where his character is not completely annoying or loudmouthed, mainly because he wasn't extremely famous yet, and had only been on SNL and a few small roles in film... Joes Pesci and him throw back and forth a few insults and jokes, and bounce off each other, which helps me welcom Rock a bit more.Jet Li's first American film, I believe, proves he can be a quite and intriguing character, which later helped him get roles in films like Kiss of the Dragon and The One.Another thing about this franchise is that director Richard Donner directed all four films, and it's always good to use the original director for a sequel, rather than a lesser director, as we have countless examples of. (especially horror films!)From the opening jazz music we have come to love, Lethal Weapon provides enough entertainment and fun to keep one entertained, and it's definitely worth watching. I hope they stop while they're ahead, and do not make another Lethal Weapon film, because it's rare for a film series to still be entertaining and imaginative after these many sequels. 3/5 stars- "},{"Title":"The Magic Was Still There","Date":"23 May 2002","Score":"23 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  It is extremely rare for the fourth film in a series to be just as good as it's three predecessors.

Loud, action sequences, and humor mixed in for two or more hours of entertainment. The more characters they add also adds to the completion. After all fans noticed that Rianne had a crush on Martin Riggs in the first movie. As the movies went on, each new Lethal showed that was a harmless crush. Martin Riggs who lost his wife because he was a cop, is afraid of getting married again for fear of losing Lorna. My favorite portion is seeing that Martin Riggs after so many times of being the tough hero, needs Roger Murtaugh at the finale to finish the battle. Also you finally see the clenching speech,given by who else Leo Getz, that makes Martin run for the altar with Lorna. Lethal Weapon was the start of a partnership, when they were paired together. Lethal 2 built on that relationship, when Riggs admitted some things he never said before( you find out more about Victoria Riggs death). Lethal 3 tested it, when Murtaugh was going to retire and his kid's friend was killed by him. Lethal Weapon 4 finally made it a family, by well you just have to watch this to see and hear the ultimate ending line to a film. All in all a great movie to watch.

Well, they were right; it's awesome, or at least it was back in '99 when the disc came out, back when not everyone had a DVD player. It's still top-of-line for picture and sound. When bullets are flying around, you hear them from all five speakers. It here it almost seven years later and we still find many films without this kind of excellent surround- speaker participation.The Lethal Weapon series, this being the fourth and last of them, was popular because of the combination of action, comedy, suspense, romance and drama. For me, they wore thin because the characters were too loud - always shouting at each other, too profane, too smug, too much Liberal-agenda and there was too much action. Things needed to slow down here and there, and give the viewer a break now and then.This sequel is no exception, although it was a little tamer than the first three Lethal Weapons, that is until going berserk again in the final few scenes, one of which - the hospital scene - was totally unnecessary. To be honest, some of the action scenes in this movie were amazing even if they had no credibility. You just have to suspend belief and enjoy some of the outrageous scenes in here.As usual, there are the left-wing agenda plugs, unwarranted cheap shots at the NRA, it's okay-to-have-a-baby-out-of-wedlock, etc. etc. Although the couple does finally get married, a rabbi performs an irreverent quickie ceremony, another slam on the seriousness of marriage.With all that goes on in this film, as in the three previous LWs, you are worn out by the end. If you are a fan of this serious, this last sequel should please. I thought it was the best of them.

Although not as good as the first three films,Lethal Weapon 4 is an Action to watch if you liked the first three Lethal Weapon's.Lethal Weapon 4 finds Riggs(Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)having to deal with Chinese criminals including a deadly criminal named Wah Sing Ku(Jet Li)who are smuggling Chinese slaves into the United States and have to stop them. With the help of new partner Lee Butters(Chris Rock)Riggs and Murtaugh have to deal with the Chinese criminals as well as Riggs becoming a parent,Murtaugh becoming a Grandfather and getting old and the gang is all back for more laughs and thrills.Lethal Weapon 4 is a Action-packed and funny conclusion to the Lethal Weapon franchise and every main character is back. Every franchise or film series comes full circle and the Lethal Weapon series is no exception and the Lethal Weapon series goes out with a bang with this film. Now,Lethal Weapon 4 since it's release has divided fans with some loving the film and some hating the film,I fall right into the former category because I liked this film and the other Lethal Weapon films for what they arethrilling,Action filled,funny movies. Right from the explosive opening Lethal Weapon 4 is a film filled with Action and great laughs taking what worked in the first three films and adding it to this film. LW4 is funny and is probably the lightest of the films in terms of Comedy and Humor with the characters Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Butters and the moments and dialog between the characters is hilarious and memorable. While LW4 is an Action-Comedy the film at it's heart is about getting old and change especially with Riggs and Murtaugh because Riggs and Murtaugh have been through a lot of things throughout the series getting into crazy adventures and even though the two have survived and had success Riggs and Murtaugh realize that they are not getting any younger and success won't come as fast. The change comes when Riggs realizes he's going to be Father with Lorna Cole(Rene Russo)and Murtaugh being a GrandFather of Rianne's(Traci Wolfe)and realize they can't be cops and take risks forever. Each sequel introduces new characters throughout the series. In LW2 it was Leo Getz,in LW3 it was Lorna Cole and in this film it is Lee Butters and Wah Sing Ku. Lee Butters is a character who works with Riggs and Murtaugh and brings laughs and one liners and is the opposite of Riggs and Murtaugh and is the new generation of cop. The character will divide viewers some will like him and find him funny while others will feel that Butters doesn't belong in the film but I like the character for his laughs and loudmouth energy. The villain Wah Sing Ku is pure evil and is physically the most challenging bad guy Riggs and Murtaugh have ever have to face because Wah Sing Ku is so quick and can take your head in one second without hesitation and he doesn't have to say much words because he is that menacing. Every time Wah Sing Ku shows up a there is tension all around and you will feel like something is going to happen when Wah Sing Ku is around. LW4 like the other films moves at a wonderful pace and never slows down until the end. The Action and fight scenes are great and each Action scene is raised to a higher level each time and there is suspense and nice build up to each Action scene. The ending of the film is excellent because it is filled wonderful Action,Laughs and heart and will have viewers smiling at the end and it is a great cap off to this excellent series.The cast does amazing jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover do excellent jobs one last time as Riggs and Murtaugh once again having great chemistry. Joe Pesci is hilarious once again as Leo Getz and has great scenes with Gibson,Glover and Rock. Rene Russo is fantastic as Lorna Cole and has good scenes with Gibson. Chris Rock is great and funny as Riggs and Murtaugh's new partner Detective Lee Butters. Jet Li is menacing and believable as Wah Sing Ku,one of the villains of the film. Kim Chan is wonderful as Benny Uncle Benny Chan,a Chinese crime boss. Steve Kahan(Capt. Ed Murphy), Mary Ellen Trainor(Dr. Stephanien Woods),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)and Eddy Ko(Hong)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and energy especially with the Action scenes. Great direction,Donner.The score by Eric Clapton,Michael Kamen and David Sandborn is great and intense and matches the tone of this film. Another great score from Clapton,Kamen and Sandborn. There are also songs by War(Why Can't We Be Friends)and Eric Clapton(Pligrim). Wonderful songs.In final word,if you love Action films and the Lethal Weapon franchise you will love Lethal Weapon 4,an Action-packed,hilarious conclusion to a great series that is well worth your time.

You can tell by watching this movie that cast and crew worked together as one big family. A lot of cast and crew members of the first three Lethal Weapon movies returned in this movie. That is the biggest power of the movie.The story itself actually is quite weak, messy and not always easy to follow. This is due that the story was still being written during production and all the scene's had to be shot in chronically order in order to finish the movie in time. But this seriously is one of those movies were the story is of no importance at all. The true power of the movie is in the characters and their relations. There are some incredible fun sidetracks in the story and some amusing dialog.Additions to the cast for this movie are Chris Rock as an highly enjoyable police officer and new partner for future Lethal Weapon movies (?) and Jet Li in his first American movie, as the new main villain. Both were really good and enjoyable in their role. I dislike both actors right now actually but at the time of Lethal Weapon 4 they were still two unknown actors therefor there is no reason to dislike them in this movie for me. Another fun role is played by Kim Chan, who's character involves at least one hilarious scene.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are still amazingly good and fun together, after already three Lethal Weapon movies and are truly a golden screen duo. Other welcome returning actors are Rene Russo and Joe Pesci. It's funny, I normally don't like Rene Russo in movies but this is one of the few I can stand her in. Joe Pesci is fun as ever as hyperactive Leo Getz.The movie also features some top-class action sequences and fights, making this movie not just one of the most entertaining but also best action movie's of the last couple of years.

As it usually goes I go against the crowd in that I like this one a lot better than three. The action is great, there is a good villain, and there is a lot of comedy with fewer scenes where the movie seems to be trying to make you depressed. Murtaugh and Riggs are getting older and it is starting to show. Their new opponent a super butt kicking member of the Chinese mob trying to get his brother over to the US. This movie starts out with a bang as an insane pyromaniac is burning up the town, then the story goes to the whole Chinese story. The comedy is great as Chris Rock makes for an excellent new character and the dentist scene is very funny. The action includes a very good car chase and numerous fight scenes with the highlight being between our heroes and a very ticked off Jet Li character. This fight alone made the movie worth it as it is very exciting and you really worry for our two officer's lives. It is not perfect, however, as once again it sort of has more of a television episode feel rather than a theatrical movie, but it still doesn't take away from the enjoyment I got from this film.

Bad plot, major holes in the story, heavy handed, politically correct dialog (yeah, right, cops hang anti-NRA posters in the squad room, and these guys love gun control international.  Yeah, these characters are anti-handgun! Gag me.) It is just SAD.  Hang it up, guys, you are too old for this stuff, and you surely need a different director.   I could shoot holes in the plot, but it would be a waste of time--it is a blooper gold mine.

With a budget of $100 Million Lethal Weapon 4 was considered the weakest in box-office return and critical reaction but in my opinion I consider it better then Lethal Weapon 3.With both Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are getting older and whilst still causing damage in Los Angles there can do less physical fests. Both men's families are expanding, Rigg's partner Lorna (Rene Russo) and Muztagh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) are pregnant and both are them are promoted to captain. At the same time they investigate people smuggling by the Triads led by Benny Chan (Kim Chan) and Triad enforcer Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li). With the aid of young police sergeant Lee Butters (Chris Rock) and private investigator Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) the two set out to bring down the Triads who are putting people into slavery.Like the first three films there is strong chemistry between Gibson and Glover, with good comic timing, particularly in the beginning when a nutcase in homemade armour, a flamethrower and a machine gun is causing a lot of damage. But the two are getting older and it was clear that a stunt double was being used more often and there were jokes about their ages. It was also good that Gibson cut the Three Stooges stick and his character was more serious and down to Earth With the rest of the cast there Chris Rock was decent, offering his motormouth style of comedy and he is a much better then many American comedians like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dane Cook. He is better stand up but he is a decent actor and he is also good as playing a straight, serious character as well. Jet Li was excellent as the villain, both as a material artist and as a sinister threat, the real mastermind of the plot. Pesci's character also improves from the annoying being he was in Lethal Weapon 3, but his character still doesn't add anything to the film.Richard Donner keeps the stunt work of the first three films and there are some excellent sequences, especially involving Jet Li's fighting ability. There are good gun battles and a excellent car chase on the freeway which was done with traditional action techniques. The scene involving the nutcase was also fun. But some of the action became more over the top, with bad guys missing with great skill with AK-47s whilst the good guys can shoot really well in the dark and at distance with pistols. Other examples are when Riggs uses the laser sight of his gun to bounce a bullet into the back of a Chinese guard, considering that's not however a laser sight works and Riggs and Murtaugh drive through a building without killing anyone and then jumping back onto the freeway. Another examples are when Riggs shots the back of a nutcase in his flamethrowers fuel supply and he ends up flying into a fuel tanker and a oil drum flying into the air into Murtaugh's boat. But Donner is a good action director and when it's done right it was great to watch.There is a good use of a Chinese score in the film, adding to the atmosphere. Donner does have good pace in the film and the script does have some fine ideas, like counterfeiting Chinese currency and human trafficking. But some elements are just fillers like the car chase when in the end the officers question Uncle Benny for information. Like the first film the henchman takes over the organisation. Also the ending is cringe worthy with Lorna giving birth, with an unfunny scene where Lorna and Riggs getting married by a Rabbi (it more funny that we all know Gibson is a raving anti-Semite) and a sentimental ending about family which only Americans can do in a vomit inducing way.The film is worth watching simply because of Jet Li.

Jet Li is a phenomenal athlete and fairly menacing screen villain.  Several of the action/fight scenes are well choreographed.  Chris Rock has a couple of good scenes, especially the cell phone discussion with Joe Pesci.  But the movie suffers from such deep flaws that one has not only the disappointment of a poor film, but of a director and actors who know that star power and their franchise will carry them along and who just don't care anymore.Just some of the problems I noticed, in no particular order(1)  One of the major events in the movie is the promotion of Riggs and Murtaugh to the rank of captain.  There are two major problems with this plot point.  First, though it hardly matters in this avalanche of the improbable, their promotion isn't just implausible, it's ridiculously improbable.  They are supposed to have done so much damage that the city's insurance carrier will no longer insure the police.  So they are promoted off the street.  But since there are no open spots for Lieutenants, they are promoted one rank higher.  Excuse me?  They do so much damage that the city loses its insurance coverage and they can't even be taken off street duty?  Are *all* cops on the streets?  But that could be overlooked if it were not for the second problem  The promotion does, apparently, nothing.  The only effect of their promotion that we see is that they are called captain and sir.  They keep their same desks, their same duties, their same partnership.  (Do Captains even have partners?)  So why, since it doesn't do anything, do we even have the promotion subplot in the movie?(2)  I know I'm going to sound like a prig for mentioning this, but I was really repelled by the level of casual brutality and harassment Riggs and Murtaugh show.  They don't even have to wait for proof or even reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing, they simply destroy property, ruin a business, beat people up, shoot them, etc.  These are clearly rogue cops, and it may be a sign of the formula of the movie failing that we notice it.  It is not as though any action-movie heroes are textbook cops, but this movie is unforgivable in forcing you to notice it.  Perhaps more disturbing is that Riggs and Murtaugh are joined in this adventure by Lee Butters (a younger cop played by Chris Rock) who is just as casual in his brutality as the older cops.  He also casually cocks and brandishes his gun at Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci), apparently just so you can tell that being a bad cop isn't restricted to the older, jaded officers.(3)  Big secrets are kept in ways that suggest that the characters haven't seen each other since the last film.  Riggs and Murtaugh are the closest of partners, the earlier movies make it clear that they think of each other as family.  But Murtaugh never mentions that Trish (his wife) is a successful writer?  Maybe he is embarrassed about what she writes, but would he never have mentioned in the early days that she had written something that she was sending off to a publisher, that it had been published, *nothing*?  But perhaps given the example he sets, he should not be surprised to find that his daughter has never revealed that she has been dating a man, has fallen in love, has married him, and is carrying his baby.  She has also never mentioned his name or occupation.  And this after making much in the last three films about Murtaugh as the devoted family man.  That's a betrayal of the characters and it's revolting.Now more briefly(4) Women escape hostage-takers but don't run to alert neighbors or call the police, but remain in area to be recaptured.(5)  Renee Russo's character (Lorna Cole) devolves from the third movie's smart cop to a broad farce of sappy, stupid, pregnant woman stereotype with some martial arts thrown in.(6)  They seem to have entirely forgotten here the first movie's point that Riggs is an outstanding martial artist.  He doesn't get beaten up because he is getting old.  He gets beaten up because the writers have, again, betrayed the character.(7)  The Chinese villains are supposed to be dastardly killers, using their cars to push their victims in their cars (conveniently stopped at railroad crossings) into the path of (conveniently) oncoming trains.  But it is a quite silly form of execution, not because it relies on the unlikely coincidence mentioned, but because all it takes to thwart this method is to hit the gas.  The path ahead is clear; when you're getting pushed just go with it and the train will pass behind you.(8)  Murtaugh's very quick to suppose, given basically no evidence, that Butters is gay and attracted to him.  Nice sleuthing.(9)  Simplistic, smug, moralizing on guns and slavery.  We're clearly supposed to feel uplifted by Murtaugh's opposition to slavery.  Good for you, Rog.  Are you against murder and cruelty, too?  If Richard Donner is a filmmaker who botches a film this badly, why would I trust him for moral guidance?Of course, there is the usual run-of-the-mill action film weirdness  windows are made of a supremely fragile material which looks like glass but which is effortlessly broken by the protagonist's fist, and cars on the LA freeway that do not swerve or slow down when following a man on a inverted table being dragged by a sheet of plastic from a prefab house.  But these aren't really faults of the movie so much as a stupid turn the genre has taken.  It is a rare action film these days that doesn't fall into these traps.All in all, Lethal Weapon 4 is a movie worth watching only if you don't care about film or about yourself.

It is nice to see Rene Russo back and I loved Joe Pesci's turn here, especially the scene at the cemetery at the end of the movie. Jet Li is brilliant and is the deadliest villain of the franchise in my opinion, he is a definite step up from Jack Travis in Lethal Weapon 3. One of my favourite things about the Lethal Weapon franchise is the cast. It has not changed throughout the four movies. Aside from Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as Riggs and Murtaugh, Darlene Love plays Murtaugh's wife, Traci Wolfe, Damon Hines, and Ebonie Smith are Murtaugh's kids, Steve Kahan is Captain Murphy, and Mary Ellen Trainor is the police psychiatrist.

It's a bright idea because it's another element in LA criminal life and it adds an exotic flavor that was lacking in parts 2 and 3. If the action is still too loud, too repetitive (a skilled villain hidden in a dark lair) and the criminal investigation hardly unbelievable, the balance between action and comedy is much better than the last two and each characters has its moment. Above all, it has the most hilarious moment of all the saga when the duo goes into the dentist. The newcomer here, Chris Rock, is rather shy but brings a few good lines. The idea of Danny's misconception about his sex life is well played. Pesci is again great and it has the opportunity to show a more dramatic side as well.

I was only about six months old when the original was first released, and by the time this fourth one came out, I was nearing adolescence, but was still too young to watch R-rated movies. I've seen all four LW films for the first time this year. Watching this 1998 action comedy's three predecessors, it seemed to me that each one showed a slight drop in quality from the last, so I had fairly low expectations for this fourth one, but still planned to finish watching the series. Many may disagree, but I think this one actually showed a slight improvement after Lethal Weapon 3.Sergeant Martin Riggs' girlfriend, Lorna Cole, is now pregnant, so he will soon be a father. Sergeant Roger Murtaugh, meanwhile, will soon be a grandfather, as his daughter, Rianne, is pregnant. One night, Murtaugh and Riggs are out on a fishing trip on Murtaugh's boat with their chatterbox friend, Leo Getz, who has become a private investigator. However, on this trip, trouble finds them once again, as their boat is struck by a large vessel! After a fight against Chinese men aboard this vessel, Riggs discovers that it is full of Chinese slaves! Detective Ng believes that Chinatown crime boss Uncle Benny Chan has something to do with this smuggling. Since Cole is pregnant, she cannot help out much on this mission, but Riggs and Murtaugh are sent along with Getz and Detective Lee Butters, the father of Murtaugh's grandchild, to take on the Chinese Triads. Riggs and Murtaugh are now both showing signs of aging, which unfortunately will not help them on this mission.In addition to the action in the Lethal Weapon franchise, you also expect humour, and there's lots of that here. I definitely laughed during the intro, with Murtaugh clucking like a chicken in his boxers during a confrontation on the street. Joe Pesci once again plays Leo Getz, and this character is still funny, with his conflict with the two main characters, and the scene around the beginning with the shark on the boat. This third sequel also introduces Detective Lee Butters, played by Chris Rock. The confrontation with Butters and Getz on the road had me in hysterics! There are some good action sequences as well, with fights and chases, which definitely had me in suspense. Unlike LW 3, Rene Russo doesn't steal the show here as Lorna Cole, though she could have if the character had not been made pregnant. Also, the romance between Cole and Riggs, while maybe still not perfect, was done a bit better here than in the previous film. The film also has some significant problems, however. The laughing gas scene is rather tedious, our heroes take a tad too many blows in the fight sequences, and the film left me wanting just a bit more.Like probably most people, I would say the original Lethal Weapon is the best of the bunch. However, I think Lethal Weapon 4 comes in third, inferior to both LW films from the 80's, but better than the first one of the 90's. I know many would disagree, but I would say this fourth installment in the quadrilogy was a good end to the series. There have been talks about Lethal Weapon 5 coming out in 2012, which have been on again and off again. Since I've found contradicting news articles on this project, I don't know whether it's happening or not (maybe nobody does), but I don't know if it would be a good idea anyway. It's been over a decade since the last installment in the series, and too many sequels can be a problem. Well, whether they make a fifth movie or not, and whether it turns out to be any good or not, overall, the four films that have already been made make a good action comedy series.

In the first installments the humour was overshadowed by the sinister nature of the plot. Lethal Weapon 3 took a much more relaxed attitude, and this has carried over to Lethal Weapon 4.I really enjoyed this film, I thought the action was good and the humour well-done. Gibson and Glover return in excellent style as the un-orthodox cop partners, Riggs and Murtaugh, and the more recent additions fit in well. Even the supporting cast of extras have a chat with the main characters, making it seem a far more natural environment.However this film did have its problems. I shall get those out of the way first.When in a chase, the dialogue becomes so hectic and each character shouts over one another until its a mess of 'blah'. This works once or twice, but the repeated use of it wears thin after four films, as does the mild-mannered chats in huge firefights. Also the more silly of the funny scenes seem out of place in a film that has a potentially serious plot. Finally the character of Leo, this is no criticism of Joe Pesci who is a great actor, but the character of Leo is infuriating and only bearable when bringing out the Chris Rock character.Bad stuff aside, onto the good points! The actual dialogues between characters are hilarious, Gibson and Glover have many conversations that made me laugh out loud. Chris Rock adds to the comedy with a more young 'in your face' attitude. The relationships between the actors seems very genuine and convincing.While on characters, it is always important to consider the villains. I'm probably not the only one to say that Jet Li plays by far the best villain in the series. True you don't find out much about him but he steals every scene he's in. Considering he couldn't speak a word of english when making this film, his lines aren't exactly extensive (1 line). Still he gets across the emotions of his character perfectly. And of course, his prowess in fighting is several steps above any other villains in the series. Great bad guy.All in all I found this film a lot of fun to watch. It is afterall a cop-comedy, not a serious action thiller. The problem comes only when they try too hard to lighten the mood, and it becomes irritating. Thumbs up though! Very enjoyable film.

Lethal Weapon 4 explodes onto the screen. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover ignite the screen as buddy cops Riggs and Murtaugh and all the old favorites are back to join then. Leo (Joe Pesci), Captain Ed Murphy (Steve Kahan) and Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) make returns in this powerful action-blockbuster. Joining the already impressive cast are comedian Chris Rock (Detective Lee Butters) and international action-star Jet Li (Wah Sing Ku). It is great to see something other than drug traffickers dominating the scripts for the final installment in the Lethal Weapon series. This movie has everything that I have come to know and love from the Lethal Weapon movies. Laughs and action a 'plenty are here with the action more hard-hitting than ever. The inclusion of Chris Rock as Lee Butters adds to the comic parts of the movie, although Gibson and Glover match Rock with witty one-liners all the way. Although this film has been criticised for being 'shallow' I believe that this is possibly the best film of the series. This movie is well worth a view and certainly worth the hiring fee. Although it is best if you view this after the first three as you will get a better idea of the characters and scenes they talk about in the 4th installment. Another good feature in the re-released version of Lethal Weapon 4 in Australia is that the end credits are a collage of famous and infamous moments of the Lethal Weapon series including old favorites such as the 'toilet scene', the final scene of Lethal 3 and the sniper scene from Lethal 1. Overall I would have to say that this film has got it all comedy, action and a few good and interesting plot twists. If you are like me and enjoy a good action flick with plenty of violence and great one-liners check this one out. Although this film does not take much to understand it is perfect for a Sunday night flick. Enjoy what is a great film!

Mel Gibson didn't annoy me for once, and him and Danny Glover are just so fun to watch. They have a certain chemistry that is definitely needed for the characters they play (who are best friends, am I not right?). Jet Li's character was more flat compared to Gibson's and Glover's, but who cares? I enjoyed watching him play the bad guy, and how fantastic he was! He may not be a very versatile actor, but his martial arts and his basic grasp of the craft is just enough for a fairly one-dimensional character.All in all, Lethal Weapon 4 is great entertainment with a great Jet Li.

As someone already said, Riggs is too settled.  He and Lorna make a good couple and there's real chemistry there, but Riggs with the short hair and looking a little heavy, and with a girlfriend and a baby on the way, etc., well, he just isn't real Lethal anymore.  And a big part of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh (the core relationship, always) is their differences.  Now they're just about the same.

When a movie is watched in the big screen with a great surround sound equipment and a big audience the experience is different than watching the movie on video at home and alone.The movie has an opening with action and comedy.  A semi trailer explodes and goes sky-high- really cool.  Then the movie moves to a different setting, always keeping the comedy.  Suddenly action starts again.  But after that thrilling sequence at Los Angeles Harbor, the movie plot goes down.  For more than 30 minutes, the story is just talking with some funny moments.  After that, the plot goes high again; of course, it's not a big plot Chinese people making fake Chinese money.  However, the movie has great action sequences, like the car chasing, and good kung-fu fighting performed by Jet Li.  The fighting could have been more, I mean, what Jet Li showed on Lethal 4 was not all he knew, but maybe the kung-fu wasn't that much because Gibson and Glover don't know anything about martial arts.  Jet Li couldn't perform big moves against men like Mel and Danny, so the director keep the fighting cool but not that cool.  Joe Pesci and Chris Rock gave the movie a funny touch, like when they both start chatting about cell phones- really annoying but funny at the same time.  Rene Russo did good too, specially for a pregnant woman.  Fighting Chinese people while pregnant is not an easy task.EVALUATION 8 out of 10.  **1/2 out of ****.

But Mel Gibson has always had a very strange ooh I wouldn't kick him out of bed effect on me. OK he's made some stinking turkeys in his time, but he's always done them with dignity, cool and above all sexiness.However, Lethal Weapon 4 was the worst pile of disjointed, feeble, over-budgeted rubbish I have yet seen him in.  The series has worked for me due to the great chemistry and witty repartee between Mel and Danny but it has become jaded and stale.  The script was not just a crumby action script - it was like talking to your alzheimer's suffering grandmother.  The story didn't flow and far too much pally-buddie-coincidence driven scenarios ground down an action packed adventure into a series of slushy sentimental cliches.What I would say in it's defence is Jet Li was fantastic.  He upstaged the entire cast.  A menacing look here, a well placed (but still cool) kick there and the partnership of Mel & Danny was left looking comatose.  When they are discussing leaving Jet alone because he's too good.  I thoroughly agreed.  Give him the entire Lethal Weapon 5 and Mel and Danny can stay on the golf course with Connery and other aging over-payed and lazy actors.Sorry Mel, but however good you are in bed - you need to do better on the screen before you come anywhere near me.

Sure it's pretty much the same old formula but nonetheless Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make a good pair and have a lot of on-screen chemistry. There's enough explosions, gunplay and wisecracks to keep the average action fan happy and some (although admittedly not much) character development. There isn't any mention at all though of Murtagh's supposed retirement at the end of Lethal Weapon III or why he's still on the force which was a bit strange. Surely it wouldn't have taken much to chuck in a few lines of dialogue to explain this. Ever since the 3rd movie, the studios obviously figured, since the movies were successful, they would aim for a wider audience and so tone the movies down a bit. I think the last 2 films although good still didn't have the edge of the first 2. The 2nd was the best in my opinion. I'm not sure if making the same film again will be a good plan if there is ever a Lethal Weapon 5. There was a rumour going around that Danny Glover's character was supposed to die in the beginning of the movie. I think this would have probably been better, or something similar as Mel Gibson seems to be losing his Lethalness. Seeing Riggs go totally off the deep end a'la Unforgiven would have made this a lot better......probably!!!

Truth be told my sole purpose for watching this film was to see Jet Li's Hollywood debut. If you can get over the first twenty minutes of banter then you're in for a fairly comfy ride.  Mel and Danny's conversations range from touching; to complete warble and you get the feeling that there is nothing left in their characters that hasn't been seen in the previous Lethal films.  Rene Russo's character strikes me as annoying and nothing more than a distraction to the main plot.  As usual Pesci, as Leo Getz, provides the laughter and can do no wrong whilst Chris Rock is the new cop in town and slips into the role with ease. Just when you think that LW4 is nothing more and you're about to leave the cinema or turn off the VCR/DVD/LD player... Jet Li appears.  As Wah Sing Ku, Jet enthuses limitless energy (in his character and his action shots) bringing the film to a knife's edge.  His Hollywood debut as the bad guy is carried out superbly and demonstrates his wonderful diversity.  Jet's charm and graceful movement oozes out to us and we're left wanting more.  Perhaps he does this too well because I wanted him to kill off Mel and Danny.Because of the photo album, I feel that this will and should be, the last of Lethals - there is nowhere left for Donner and Joel Silver to go and no character or indeed villain will surpass Li's electric Wah Sing Ku.  I got the feeling that Donner was a little too greedy in casting.  6 stars equals too many.  Donner should have stuck with 3 plus Li and bring a darker edge like the first Lethal. In a nutshell, the banter can drag on but it's worth watching for Li's explosive performance alone.  An excellent evening's entertainment.

Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) have returned, and this time, they will need a helping hand...Riggs and Murtaugh team up once again to bring us the fourth entry in the immensely successful LETHAL WEAPON series, LETHAL WEAPON 4. Lots of action, gunfire, huge explosions, wild stunts, general kinetic energy, cool shoot-outs, awestruck martial arts, and total chaos accompany this movie into full blast...sort of. Lethal Weapon 4, though earnestly tried by both the cast members and the production crew, misses the mark...Director Richard Donner (LETHAL WEAPON 1, 2, and 3) returns to the series as well as the two veteran leading actors. Rene Russo is back as Riggs' pregnant love interest, and Joe Pesci gives us plenty of laughs too as a funny Private Investigator, Leo Getz. A new addition to the LETHAL WEAPON cast is Chris Rock, who was hilarious as Detective Lee Butters.  He has tons of laugh out loud moments, and coincidentially, he was the one responsible for getting Murtaugh's daughter pregnant...Martial Arts sensation Jet Li makes his U.S. debut here in LETHAL WEAPON 4 as Wah Sing Ku a nasty villian with a style, and a penchant for beating up the competition. Li is the show stealer for this movie. He displays many patented, slick, and rigorous lightning quick moves and speed. He is tough, graceful, and a nearly impossible villian to beat. Li also does a fine job creating a malicious edge as well too, using a necklace full of beads as a potent weapon...Looks like a reunion here, folks! Riggs and Murtaugh are up to their necks as they attempt to crack an illegal immigrant smuggling ring. This ring of terror is lead by, who else, supervillian Jet Li, and his assistant, Uncle Benny (Kim Chan). The two idiotic cops have managed to provoke the anger of both Li and his Triads, and now, the buddies are on the organized gang's hit list...marked for death...LETHAL WEAPON 4 is pure firepower with lots of hilarity, but this film needs lots of target practice. The cast plays for laughs in this film as well. One scene that was also a spotlight grabbing opportunity was when both Chris Rock and Joe Pesci were arguing (and improvising) to one another about how cellphones are useless and annoying and they skyrocket your phone bill and such. That scene was a defining moment in this movie. Chris Rock deserves accomendation for being a funny, wisecracking comedian who has a disputable attitude. Like Jet Li, Rock stole the show from the two leading characters.The action is LETHAL WEAPON 4 is furious...if sparse. Although the action sequences in this motion picture are sedulously choreographed, most of the good scenes have already been shown in the trailers. You know that that's a desperate attempt for money and attention.  The explosive beginning of LETHAL WEAPON 4 wasn't bad...in fact, it was terrific.  Still, the exploding gas truck and lots of inferno in this introduction was all too full blown...and predictable.  The car chase scene at the freeway, where the car Riggs and Murtaugh were driving crashed through an entire building literally was also fun...but I already anticipated that. The marathon at Chinatown was kind of presentimented too much also...LETHAL WEAPON 4 is obviously losing its magic. Why? For starters, here are several pathetic attempts at eliciting laughs.1) Danny Glover resorts to running around in his boxers just to get a bad guy's attention. 2) Danny Glover (Murtaugh) thinks that Chris Rock is getting close to him because this young neophyte is acting officious in front of this captain. 3) Mel Gibson using stereotypical remarks on Chinese and Asian Americans just to get some answers. (i.e. Flied lice.) 4) The Lethal Weapon gang plus Uncle Benny must use laughing gas in order to interrogate Benny. Benny though, shined too with some of his witty dialogue. 5) Riggs no longer retains his suicidal tendencies; instead he tries to attract laughs with his silliness on how to become a daddy.LETHAL WEAPON 4 should exit the curtain right now while its reputation is still running high. Sure, the action is overwhelming in this flick, but all the excitement was already drained with all those overhyped, wasteful trailers. This film has one too many boring dialogue, inane comedy (for the most part), and a mean-spirited attitude towards Asian Americans.  Only one redeeming factor saved this film from being sent to the compost heap Jet Li.  He's one of the most aplomb, confident martial artists around; too bad he couldn't have played the hero.  Riggs and Murtaugh are getting too old for this...RATING ** out of ****.

I had no reservations about buying a movie that I'd never seen because I know I can trust Richard Donner (Superman, Ladyhawke, Radio Flyer, The Goonies and the other Lethal films) for a good time with the exception of Assassins. Look at it this way, Lethal Weapon films are their own genre and the best of the buddy cop films.One thing that happens too often in sequels (Godfather and Star Wars Trilogy excluded) is that there seems to be a loss of certain key elements that made the original great. I missed the seriousness of the original when watching this latest installment. It's as though the characters have forgotten that they are in a mortal realm where death is something to avoid. Gibson's character had a death wish from the beginning but he never faced a dire situation without reacting emotionally. In this film, no-one seems to be real. Especially when facing life altering challenges.But, who cares? We expect sequels to be bigger and badder. The biggest opener of all the films was the blowing up of the building at the beginning of LW3. So, the flame thrower wielding madman was a step back in my opinion but fun nonetheless. Jet Li was fantastic and the dentist office scene with Uncle Benny is priceless. I loved this film and appreciate it for what it is, an all out action thriller.

Murtaugh is about to become a grandfather courtesy of his daughter who's secretly (only to her dad) married to another cop, while Riggs is about to become a father with Internal Affairs inspector Lorna Cole (RENE RUSSO), although they're not married. With the assistance of their comic sidekick and former money launderer turned private eye, Leo Getz (JOE PESCI) and a new detective, Lee Butters (CHRIS ROCK) who's curiously over friendly to Murtaugh, the two old partners discover that a crooked local businessman, Uncle Benny (KIM CHAN), is involved in illegally moving immigrants into the country as slave labor. When they discover that a member of the Asian Triad, Wah Sing Ku (JET LI), is also involved, they start to put the heat on the bad guys. If you enjoyed any or all of the previous entries in this long running series you'll love this one. The addition of comic Chris Rock (TV's Saturday Night Live) to the cast works quite well and adds a much needed additional layer of fresh humor to the proceedings. Given that talent of Richard Donner occasionally revs up the action to a point nearing that of legendary Hong Kong director John Woo (The Killer, Face/Off), including several fight sequences between Li and Gibson and Glover that were clearly the favorites with our audience. While some (actually many) of them push that credibility factor to the limits, the film still manages to get away with it.

The acting is great with a stronger story than the third of the Chinese Triad into money and selling slaves. Also on the side of Riggs is the issue of marriage as he tries to get past his wife's death as Larna wants to get married as she is pregnant and at the same time keeping from Murtagh that his daughter is married and pregnant by Lee Butter! Gibson gets some great moments of laughter when teasing Murtagh at why Butter is always so nice to him. Jet Li makes a truly lethal villain though he dosen't say much, it clears in his facial expression and fighting skills with a truly bloody showdown between him and Riggs and Murtagh.The comedy is really funny in this one with some real laugh out loud moments and it feels remarkably fresh again after the rustiness of it in the previous instalment. Chris Rock helps in this instance with some terrific banter particularly between him and Pesci, which had me crying with laughter, the action is exciting and choreographed well with a couple of excellent stunts. The ending is wonderful with a true tribute to the series with a photo taken in hospital when Larna has the baby and the end credits (with a superb soundtrack song) that pays a true tribute to the cast and crew by showing photos on set during the making of the films.

In addition, the difference between this and the other recent action movies including Jet Li is that in the movie Jet Li fights! And the movie might be seen just to see the fight among Gibson, Glover and Li. Revenge is matter that makes that exciting. Not just fighting, it has a story. Donner guesses the expectations of Jet Li fans, martial art fans which is everything. The another important point is that Li is not one of the passive or paper tiger enemies. It means a lot of fun and adrenalin. Then, one of the best gags comes ''another day, we chase him with an anti-aircraft.'' The operation scene was superficial, pretty mild and besides, much humor (and sometimes over) rather than suspense, but not a big flaw. The car chase scene of the movie is the best in the series, it is one of the best action sequences of Lethal Weapon series.

I have been wanting to see it, but just haven't, but I was not disappointed with it, and enjoyed it. Now, there were some things I didn't care for. Now, why would they withold from Murtagh that his daughter is pregnant AND married to a cop? Why did Jet Li and his gang burn down Murtagh's house other than the fact of the Wongs? The whole crew was great. I love the part when Chris Rock jumps on the fellow who was an innocent bystander and tells him if he gets Johnny Cochran, he's going to kill him. And Joe Pesci, he is classic. And Danny Glover stripping down to his drawers to divert a shooter just for Mel Gibson's kicks was another great scene. All in all, a good movie.

In one of the rare moments where Riggs and Murtaugh spend a quiet moment fishing in the lake along with their sidekick Leo Getz (Joe Pesci, who is now a detective as well), realize that their tranquillity is about to come to a close as a rusty old ship happens to make its way and illegal Chinese civilians pass them by. Next thing you know, the we find the cops feuding with these Chinese thugs with old Uncle Bennie(Kim Chan) as their leader and a powerful violence-happy hoodlum (Jet Li) whose passive ways through danger is absolutely staggering. There is some subplot about Murtagh taking immigrants into custody and another family taken in by gangsters, but the action unlike the other three instalments doesn't have the same appeal as it starts to become predictable and at times loses its meaning.One of the more surreal scenes, we see Riggs dragging down the freeway, perched on top of a kitchen table in Murtaugh's car as though he was in a lake doing water-skiing while being attached on some kitchen foil. Of course he's still in one piece with no harm done, and successfully still manages to spew out a few wise-cracks on the way. With more illogical scenes, we find the car crashing through an office building and coming out the other side and the car still has enough composure to successfully make it to the freeway as the chase progresses. I hope no was hurt or killed while all this chaos was happening. I'm not trying to be arrogant here, if you still enjoy the same formula that made the Lethal Weapon franchise a hit I say the more power to you. I just think that at this point in time, the forth instalment offers nothing new and is starting to run low on batteries. The other three movies were very good and I liked how they flowed through the story, but in Lethal Weapon IV, there are no more new ideas and we can tell that Gibson and Glover are starting to get on in age here.

Either way, though, Riggs remained just as impulsively, even innocently, refreshingly true-to-form, in his target, as well as method, when it came to upholding his image, or what was at least still salvageably left of it, even to behold at all, as had the vampire, referenced immediately above, with, by then, his own even more irresistibly compelling lack of choice; although one can only wonder why, for instance, Clint Eastwood had failed to be nearly as astutely on-cue, when, in The Gauntlet, his already so dangerously faltering intuition, on several almost terminally reckless occasions, had begun manifesting itself in the terminology of a preacher, with his answer, to Sondra Locke, about taking certain things on faith, rather than in the form of even a most dire warning, as to the kinds of answers which can only be acquired the Hard Way; but, merely assuming, of course, against all the real odds in the world, that they had made it nearly as far as city hall, let-alone actually prevailed, even then, out of the jaws of a legal system so efficiently infested with a predominance of henchmen who are paid, as Blakelock said, not to think, but only to react, to what is right, simply because it is the law, minus any neatly-quantifiable concept of the only real law being that which is already so debatably and, thus alone, insolubly right. . . . Contrarily, though, given the inherent need of interpreting even the most clearly unambiguous kind of language, for content as well as applicability, rather than leaving even the latter to be determined only by the most Pontifically Infallible kind of authority; even an Adlerian Slip or two, which Murtaugh employed, for the purpose of laying down the nature of the law, to Leo Getz, is about the only kind of improvement to be otherwise so indispensably, even urgently expected, perhaps even more often than not, even on a totally freelance basis; as well as being so harrowingly reminiscent, in intent as well as quality, of Broderick Crawford, to Stephen Boyd, in The Oscar, or Brian Dennehy, to Sylvester Stallone, in First Blood, or even the Honorable Henry T. Fleming, to Arthur Kirkland, in And Justice for All, as to almost have necessitated the greater desirability of even a reprisal of Joe Pesci's characterization, from Goodfellas! Moreover, were it not for the fact that, as an ambassador (II Corinthians 520) (Ephesians 620), minus any Diplomatic Immunity, my formal mandate authorizes nothing more than the attempt to peacefully, rationally persuade; I'd have been preparing a sequel, to The Patriot, single-handedly, if necessary, by now; over the issue, just for openers, of Tea&#151;and Taxes&#151;again! . . . Jet Li, unfortunately, had been far-too-correct, as well, in his understanding as to the real nature of the law; along with his frighteningly superlative proficiency at the kinds of skills intended to help Riggs save a bit more face, the kind he'd also so cleverly salvaged while exiting ringside; just in case, that is, of any possible errors in judgment, from his audience, that he'd actually regarded himself as the greatest master of all; over-against even a much more seriously sadistic streak, too, which just about rendered even his own almost as genuinely unamusing, especially to him, as well as to the department psychologist, not to mention Murtaugh, as an actual trip to Uranus (or should I say Neptune?) could also very easily have been! Also, had it been me, rather than Leo, who'd been the victim, of one-too-many pranks, such as that mean-spirited set-up, subsequent to all the unprovoked bad-mouthing and belittlement, at a certain traffic stop, even after the times I'd already been impulsively thrown to the ground, face down, for no good reason, with cocked guns aimed at the back of my neck; I might have been almost tempted to remember the words, of Glycon, to Demetrius, in the sequel to The Robe, when he said, Forget your religion, for just one day . . . Your God will thank you for it! In fact, that pipsqueak, in the back seat, really needed a Jocko DeParis, The Strange One, to have dispensed with him; before far-too-many, of the likes of both, even on this side of the Rubicon, had undoubtedly ever graduated from the academy! But, then, if six long years of such, even at the university, followed by the related drowning, of my Natalie Wood, from Splendor in the Grass, had not decisively broken me down, I've therefore already long proved myself to be among the safest prospects of all!

Unfortunately I started watching them in the wrong order. I actually watched them in the order 2,1,4,3. Bizarre I know, but I did enjoy them still, and eventually managed to watch them in order and loved them even more. I can see why they're considered possibly the best buddy movies and are up there with the best action movies as well. I have watched them over and over again through the years and they never get boring. However, this one is definitely my favourite. I watched it today and felt I had to post my views here and highly recommend it to all you action fans out there, but I bet you've probably already seen it anyway.I don't want to get into the plot, although it is pretty interesting. I really want to talk about the action and humour, which is sensational throughout it and keeps the movie fast moving and it never gets boring. All the characters from the first 3 films are back, which is great as you very rarely see this today in franchises of this size and all of them do their part. These include Gibson, Glover, Pesci (who're all absolutely hilarious still and in this one they're definitely at their funniest), Russo, The Captain (not sure of the actor) and Glover's family, who're all still played by the same actors. A well done to bringing them all back to Director Richard Donner, who has helmed all 4 movies which has been a big key to it success. Another great character added here though is Chris Rock's who was the funniest in the movie. He has some great lines, but I won't spoil them for you though. Pesci in particular matches him though as his constant okay, okay, okay fast talking self.But the focal point here has to be the action and on an entertainment scale this movie blows it right out the window. When I commented on The Rock I said it was the best action movie ever, but I think today having watched this for the first time in a while, it may have overtaken it. The action is sensational and comes thick and fast from the opening scene to the climax. These are Gibson and Glover taking on an armoured guy with a flame thrower which ends in a bang, a fight on a huge ship followed by a great explosion, a chase on foot through Chinatown, A fight inside Glover's home which leads to the highlight of the movie- a terrific chase across a freeway, and finally a great shootout and showdown between Gibson, Glover and Jet Li whose also great as the villain.These action sequences are the best in the series, but the great thing about this movie is, it doesn't focus on action all the time and manages to fit in a decent plot, great humour and more importantly, the character development between the leads; Gibson and Glover. I also enjoyed the warm and friendly family scenes inside Glover's house involving the Chinese family and the relationship development between Gibson and Russo. I especially enjoyed the very end in the hospital. In fact there isun't one scene from this movie I would cut. Its perfect and is definitely the best in the series, which is a huge surprise and rarity because not only is it a sequel, its the third sequel! So, overall this movie is perfect and I'd be more than happy to see a Lethal Weapon 5 some day if it ever materialises because I love all 4 films, but this one especially. It is definitely one of my all time favourite action movies and up there with my favourite movies ever made. If your an action fan who hasn't seen this get out there and buy it now. Its one of the greatest.Pure entertainment 10/10 "},{"Title":"The gang go out on top!","Date":"28 January 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" It came as something of a surprise when it was announced that a fourth LETHAL film would be made, especially given the 6 year lay-off and the huge status of Mel Gibson since his Oscar winning direction and performance in BRAVEHEART pushed him right into the all time Hollywood 'A' list of super-super-stars, but any fears that Gibson's ego could be too big for the new production, or that things would be too unfamiliar after so long away, were to prove unfounded.LETHAL WEAPON 4 would probably go down as the best entry into the fine series, given the truly special nature of the stunts, action, and explosions that not only surpassed the lofty standards set during the series, but that also stands well in comparison with anything done since. Check out, for example, the scene in which Riggs and Murtagh take down the 'Exterminator' style killer in the opening moments &#150; I've never seen an oil tanker do anything like that! But the action is not the only huge plus. The introduction of Chris Rock into the formula was a real masterstroke from the casting department; especially taking in mind the 'special relationship' the plot throws up for him and Roger. Rock is also superlative in proving a match for Leo (Joe Pesci), and the reaction of Riggs and Murtagh when these two motor mouths get together is comedy gold! Rene Russo is back, along with all the characters we have come to know and love over four films come together, and with a twin pregnancy storyline intertwined with Riggs agonizing whether to marry Lorna, Roger angry his daughter is pregnant without being married (little does he know!), Leo working as the world's most conspicuous private detective, and on top of all that Lorna suspecting Roger being on the take, there is enough here for a small soap opera! Throw in a gang of Chinese Triads involved in human trafficking slaves with Jet Li's mobster, and what you have is one of the most explosive, stylish, hilarious action comedies of the 1990s! Jet Li deserves a special mention in his first major US film. He may have few lines, but he has genuine screen menace and when he swings into action he comes to the fore in a big way with some of the most impressive martial arts skills ever committed to celluloid. As already mentioned, the action scenes are imaginatively written enough already, with scenarios such as Roger's fishing boat sinking (leaving the shark Leo just caught free to get some payback!) or Gibson going fist to fist with mobsters in the rear of a moving caravan on a freeway, but with someone of Li's skill on board, the whole things goes to a whole new level.Only a couple of false notes are sounded, those being that Rene Russo looking a little too physically able when knocking out villains while nine months pregnant, and some of the crucial dialogue in key situations being inaudible due to other sound effects, somewhat lessening the potential impact of comedic scenarios. Also, if you haven't seen the other LETHAL films, there are a lot of in-jokes, such as the 1-2-3 routine and other features that any sequel would contain (check out the BACK TO THE FUTURE series for instance).If this represents the end of the LETHAL series, as implied by the ending and Mel's other projects subsequently, then LH4 certainly is a fitting way to end a fine franchise, and a great example of going above and beyond to finish on top! This has to rank as one of those films its hard to dislike and easy to love, and is a fine tribute to the work of everyone involved in the entire franchise over a decade or more!

But hasn't that always been the point? Drop the pretense of being in any way logical or (groan) 'reality-based', and simply deliver a well-crafted, well-played rush. We applaud Jackie Chan's sense of silly fun as much as his physicality, and Lethal Weapon 4 has got both in spades.This installment finds the extended 'family' of Riggs (Gibson), Murtaugh (Glover), Leo (Pesci), and Lorna (Russo) joined by new faces Chris Rock and Jet Li, as a particularly nasty bad guy. The plot involves the smuggling of Chinese counterfeiters into the U.S. by a crime triad, but all that is really just a coathanger for the collection of action sequences and gags that director Richard Donner has skillfully assembled.Like a predecessors, LW4 is an odd hybrid of The French Connection and The Love Bug (imagine LW5 with Herbie as Riggs, Dean Jones as Murtaugh and the late Buddy Hackett as Leo, but I digress). The chemistry between Gibson and Glover continues and, in spite of the often trite dialogue that is written for them, they infuse their exchanges with an infectious energy and enthusiasm.What negative criticism I would level at LW4 regards the lack of darkness that so imbued the first two films. There were moments of real danger in those films that made the comedic elements seem astounding in their mere existence, let alone effectiveness. LW3 took a major step away from that, and towards a goofier, glossier, more (if you will) Love Bug-ier sheen, with lesser results. LW4 is an improvement on that film's formula, but someone should have remembered that Rigg's unhinged self-destructiveness was part of why the series was so compelling in the first place.

First, the comment that the character  development was good could not possibly be farther from the truth. The  reason for this, of course, is the desire to put as much of Chris Rock's  stand-up routine, Riggs' and Murtough's infantile antics, Pesci's comic  relief, and a whole lot of things blowing up into the film. Rock is not an  actor, and his character was completely unnecessary and as one-dimensional  as they come. He served no real purpose in the film except to get a few  cheap laughs from his supposed homosexual attraction to Murtough. This  plotline, along with the entire scene in the dentist's office, have been  done hundreds of times in sitcoms, and with much better and funnier  results. It was also amazing how Jet Li, playing the role of cyborg robot  killer, was actually the most human character in the entire movie. He  actually showed some genuine emotion, although nothing more than furious  rage. The script (if in fact there was one) was also severely lacking. Plot  details were thrown in like an afterthought in between explosions. The  action scenes were extremely elaborate, but at the same time boring since  they, in almost every instance, had nothing to do with anything that had  transpired previously. If this movie is what you're looking for, save  yourself some money by watching the Chris Rock Show and a Fox special.  This was an awful movie in a summer of awful movies, and I have lost  respect for everyone who appeared in this fiasco for their association.

I'm not a huge fan of the Lethal Weapon's but this one isn't to bad, there are hardly any special effects (looks more real), it's got a couple of new actors (Chris Rock and Jet Li) and it's got a much better look to it (90's look). In my opinion the fighting scene's in Lethal Weapon 4 are actually pretty damn good, especially the start and the end, it's as if the director has actually moved on from the other boring Lethal Weapons. The new actors (Chris Rock and Jet Li) make the film a lot better, especially Jet Li because he adds a lot of that really good Chinese fighting to the movie.The story is about Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh and how they find a bunch of Chinese slaves almost at America on a bout so Roger decided to let them stay at his house, little does he know that a Chinese gang The Triads want that the Chinese slave family , especially the Uncle. Once the gang gets the slaves Martin and Roger decide to team up with Leo Getz and Lorna Cole to hunt The Triads down.Lethal Weapon 4 is very entertaining, has a good look to it and the acting isn't bad. If you liked the other Lethal Weapons you'll like this, if you didn't like the other Lethal Weapons then you still might like it.

Riggs is being pressured by Murtaugh to marry the (very) pregnant Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), Murtaugh's daughter is expecting too but before the festivities can begin, the duo has to tackle one last important case. (THEY AREN'T TOO OLD FOR THIS SH**.)It turns out that the Hong Kong Triads, led by Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li, in his American debut), are attempting to smuggle Chinese immigrants into the country and are also trying to buy back the four heads of the organization. Joe Pesci is also returning as the annoyingly funny Leo Getz and comedian Chris Rock turns in a capable performance as Murtaugh's soon-to-be-dead son-in-law, Lee Butters.The action here is as lethal and brutal as it's ever been in with any Lethal Weapon movie. The acting and chemistry is flawless, as usual, and Donner's direction is sharp as a tack. Of course, as Roger Ebert noted, the characters have sort of become sitcom regulars who must casually contend with vicious criminals from time to time.Of course, the big story here is Jet Li, whose hardcore fanbase may be or may not be proud to see him in his first American performance and surprisingly, he's one cold and deft villain in this movie; Li's a lot more menacing than past villains such as Gary Busey, Joss Ackland, and Stuart Wilson. No wirework here (or at least none that is easily noticeable), but Riggs and Murtaugh are able to hold their own against him in the film's brutal climax that's drenched in rain and thunder.Lethal Weapon 4 is the best film in this otherwise lethal series and I honestly hope that if this is the last entry, then it's at least the biggest and baddest.10/10 "},{"Title":"Great sequel to a great movie!","Date":"23 February 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  After four installments they're still going strong!

In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) is the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon series. It is the last installment in the franchise and it is a good one. It is the last movie in the series and it ended perfectly. I am glad there wasn't a fifth movie. I heard they are planning to reboot the original movie. The same is with Die Hard and those reboots are stupid! This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, this is entertaining funny action film I've ever seen. Best part I wish I had a siren right about now Rog Really hilarious!! I could watch it over and over again! It is my at least favorite movie in the series but it is still a lot of fun. The gangs are all back Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci and Rene Russo, there are some new additions in the cast Chris Rock and Jet Li./ Jet Li is such a bad ass and in this movie you have Chinese Triads, I was disappointed with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in this, I seriously think those two guys become a soft pussy's in this film. I think wife's and baby coming on their way making them a really wuss, don't get me wrong, Riggs and Murtaugh were both a bad ass in the whole trilogy. In this film they are fighting like a pussy's. But still I like this movie a lot, I still like Rene Russo I am happy that Riggs and Lorna get's married at the end of the movie and I also love that both Rianne Murtaugh and Lorna gives a birth to their baby's. The action sequences were not that great but Jet Li was a damn bad ass and that was his first American movie. It was one of the first roles I saw him as a villain, I was used more to see Jet Li been the good guy. I think it was hard to convince him to play the bad guy. Even for a villain he did a good job playing his character. This was the last movie in the Lethal Weapon series and I am glad the movie showed the different site of the characters. Especially the movie explained and made a perfect ending with what happened with all our favorite characters. The rest of the crew did a solid job and I like it a lot. I have all Lethal Weapon movies on Blu-ray and I also have 2 & 3 on DVD the director's cut. I couldn't got Lethal Weapon the directors Cut on DVD but I got Theatrical cut on Blu-ray. I also have the trilogy on VHS tape they are all Director's Cut. Seeing Director's Cut on DVD and VHS tape for 2 Hrs. 07 Mins the same running time is this film Lethal Weapon 4, I was really disappointed. I thought the movie was set too long than the theatrical cut I grew up with it. The theatrical cut was always my favorite of the first one. I am glad I own the original first movie on Blu-ray with theatrical cut. I am big fan of Lethal Weapon movies and I love all of them. The same is with Rambo franchise I love all four of them. Lethal Weapon 4 get's the same score by me as Lethal Weapon 2 did a 9. I am glad I know what happened with all the characters that I care for and the scenes in the hospital were beautiful, I love Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) in this movie as private detective. Who helped Martin Riggs when his wife is getting a baby. Lethal Weapon 4 was a by the numbers rehash of the franchise's formula, but the Martin Riggs character had lost his edge from the previous movies. A big disappointment. Tough I have enjoyed this movie considering its a 4th in the series, I thought Chris rock was funny especially his scenes with Joe Pesci = NO means NO..!, I'd agree in that I'd be hard pressed to choose between number 1 and number 3. Also like the idea of Chris Rock having his own movie. Perhaps in the same character he could take on a young partner and they become the next generation albeit different\their own characters within the Lethal weapon universe. Lethal Weapon 4 is the fourth installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1998 sequel follows Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) as they uncover a smuggling ring involving Chinese immigrants.

Gibson and Glover continued their crazy but great-teamed partnership and delivered much humor to keep the film engaging enough to go along with the mad rush of all the action scenes. From the Riggs' daredevil freeway car chase with a triad member during rush hour traffic to Murtaugh's personal dilemma with his daughter marrying a cop, the story is fast-paced from start to finish. In his first appearance in a Hollywood movie, Jet Li proves he is one formidable villain to be reckoned with, showing off his awesome martial arts moves (it's particularly fun seeing him grapple around with Gibson and Glover) and delivering his quiet and serious, but sinister self. As an action hero star, it is an interesting seeing Li take on the role of the bad guy. There is also some added drama and suspense during the scenes where Murtaugh's takes in a band of smuggled Chinese refugees who are entangled in the triad's scheme. Joe Pesci appears again as fast-talking and sometimes annoying Leo Getz, but you actually get to see a more serious side to him this time, and Chris Rock appears as motor-mouth Detective Lee Butters. The constant rambling of his loudmouth personality can be excruciatingly irritating, but it was pretty funny seeing him drive Glover crazy. And, Kim Chan plays the crime lord and leader of the triads - an actually humorous performance and not so much sinister. I loved the line where he correct Gibson in pronouncing fried rice. Quite a few overzealous acting, but overall, it's a smashing sequel that closes out the Lethal Weapon trilogy pretty well.Grade B "},{"Title":"Not Lethal Enough.","Date":"29 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) Dir Richard Donner / Cast Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, Jet Li High powered action that attempts to broaden character yet evaporates into mindless action violence. Rene Russo is pregnant and Mel Gibson wrestles with the idea of marriage. Danny Glover's daughter is also pregnant but he is unaware that the father is fast talking rookie cop Chris Rock. Joe Pesci discovers the pains of being a detective. Plot regards the smuggling Chinese into America for illegal money making labour. Jet Li is the new villain and he is so swift that he can handle Gibson, Glover and Russo all at once in an ass kicking bout. Routine story that owes much to its spectacular stunts. Gibson and director Richard Donner collaborated on all three previous Lethal Weapon films as well as Conspiracy Theory. Glover is still the bunt of jokes but perhaps the biggest is the reality that his daughter is pregnant with Rock's kid. Russo wrestles with her future as a mother and wife. Rock is a nice edition with his usual psycho-babble that gets under Glover's skin. Jet Li plays off a fine villain who ends up warding off Gibson, Glover and Russo with near ease.

Riggs'  oneliner comebacks to Murtaugh's conservative suburban ways make for a few chuckles between all the explosions and car chases. This movie upholds that tradition but Murtaugh has loosed up with few one-liners himself.The premise is simple, Riggs, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci, GoodFellas), and Murtaugh stumble onto a slave trade run by the Chinese Mafia. This is no good. So they will stop it. Simple eh? Toss in a couple subplot's, namely Murtaugh's daughter marring fellow cop Lee Butters (Chris Rock, HBO's Bring The Pain) behind his back.

This was the first film in English for Li, and also marked the first in 25 films he plays the villain. Unlike many American action films, the camera was left with a wide angle and fewer cuts to show off Jet Li's martial arts abilities.

I saw the first and second Weapon again just 2 or 3 days before I saw this in a theater, and I am very amazed at how the title character has changed in 10 years. His jokes are still very corny, unfunnny and mainly pointed at his only friends (Pesci and Glover) but his mad temper and unpredictability exciting strength of the first film has really died out. When I saw the previews, I thought Gibson would be quite a match for Hong Kong martial arts superstar Jet Li, but I was wrong. When the two eye each other during their first encounter, every one of my friends who saw it with me could tell Gibson has deep fear in his eyes, even though they are just acting.

We cared about the characters. Now however the franchise has developed into a repetitive, if exciting, set of action sequences; heartless, vapid and annoying. Lethal Weapon 4 sees the ageing Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) on the hunt for the importers of Chinese slave laborers, but really the plot has little to do with the essential character of the film. The story is about only tying together a series of shoot outs, car chases and fights. We're left with something like a good football match, but one where you're team isn't playing. Even the music is becoming annoying; David Sanborn and Eric Clapton (or their clones) provide the wailing musical score that has become the signature sound for the Lethal Weapon series. But even that great sound needs a change. Even Sanborn and Clapton are becoming cringe city these days; only a parody of what made a difference a few years ago. Loaded Gun, a hilarious spoof on the Lethal Weapon series, perhaps started the rot, but it's obvious that progressively the series has been making more and more fun of itself, to the extent that Lethal Weapon 4 is done almost completely for laughs. But still there are the action sequences.These have been crafted such that they will please the most avid car crash, big explosion and flying automobile buffs. The opening sequence is entertaining, even if we know nearly all about it from the trailers. This has a Ned Kelly character spouting flames and machine gun bullets at Murtaugh who is in his undies in the rain. Ned Kelly is completely unexplained and is inconsequential with regards to the rest of the film, but in the context of the no brainer that Lethal Weapon 4 is, that's no surprise. Gibson is the trump card actor in these films of course, and Rigg's cocky jibes at Murtaugh are still lively, but most of the bite is gone if you don 't think that Riggs has a death wish. Danny Glover, the black side kick, also does the same ol' thing. Rene Russo again is a waste of time and Joe Pesci gets the best laughs, but again it's all just little hats, guns and bad language.  But still there's an exciting freeway chase complete with Riggs being dragged along on a table behind a truck and an extended, James Bondish  (this one lacks credibility) final brawl to enjoy. But give me the original Lethal Weapon any day.

That should be enough but this is crazier, more explosive, jokier, and more ridiculous. It is overloaded. What started as a fun duo has expanded each and every sequel into a whole gang. It overshoot its target and has become an unmitigated mess. There are way too much story and too many characters. It takes forever to get the story moving because the audience has to catch up with all the characters, both new and old. It's odd that the addition this time is an angry Chris Rock. He's probably the funniest guy in the cast but his character is more tiring than funny. Any time the movie starts to move, it gets bog down with jokey side stories and various diversions. Also there isn't any compelling about the investigation. The bad guy Jet Li is revealed right away. The only thing left is for him to do is some kung fu fighting. The rest about the bad guys is meaningless and a waste of time. This is simply a rambling tiresome end to a great franchise.

To go from drug-runners to gun-runners in the first three films but now dump Chinese immigrants on us is more than a step-down. My theory is that it was more an excuse to go easy on the audience activity-wise so they could allow for the attention to all the new stars.To start, Rock is shoehorned into the proceedings to rant his way through an endless mire of blathering scenes that seem inspired by a stand-up act. It's as if Donner or the producers said, Hey, just riff on cell phones and racism. You're funny! Then you have Li, who utters maybe ten words and smiles creepily in between looking like a martial-arts video game sprite. Pesci is back to bark his way through F-bombs and excessive intrusion; Russo has maybe three scenes, already discarded for The New Kids.As far as our heroes, Gibson and Glover, they can't even manage to get into carried on their charms mode. It's highly apparent both seem to be too tired to participate. The line about Too old for this sh** is not just being spoken by Riggs and Murtaugh, it seems to be coming more from Gibson and Glover. Gibson, once so adept at ad-libbing, can only manage a few of his signature Riggs-isms to dig on others; Glover sticks to his usual perplexed screeches of Riggs!! Riggs!! Of course, these films have always been primarily built around its action montages, but they don't even get that right (for the most part) this go-round. Forty-five minutes between action scenes? No, no, no. After a cartoonishly inexplicable one centered around a flame-spraying wackjob, far too much rambling set-up goes on before Gibson finally breaks into a chase of a potential bad dude. They finally manage an impressive stunt featuring a mobile home roaring down a freeway, but when the lives of the characters have become so drab, it's hard to care.I must mention the one moment where they accurately reached back to the feel of the earlier films. Without going into huge spoiler territory, I'll just say it involves the guys familiar We go on three mantra toward the end of the movie. It almost brought tears because it both provided a valid emotional moment, and one of familiarity from the prior entries dealing with a partnership. But it's far too little to give this installment a pass.The end credits sequence is a sweet fourth-wall breaking to give not just the cast, but the producers (and even the casting director!) some screen time, in obvious anticipation that Riggs and Murtaugh have really turned in their badges for good.

(Becuase let's face it, a lot of fourth films suck.) It is a fun, fast and furious entry that is filled with light-hearted humor and fantastic action. Although it's been 12 years since its release, it holds up well as a great surrogate conclusion to the Lethal Weapon saga, presuming the long-rumored part 5 will never actually happen.This time around, Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) tangle with the Triads and corrupt Chinese authorities whom plan on using counterfeit cash to pay for the release of the Four Fathers- four top members of the Triads. At the head of the nefarious plot is Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li), a lethal and deadly adversary whom may be too much for our aging heroes to defeat.The film's plot is slightly rushed, and it isn't until the last half hour or so that the pieces all fall into place (and this might be due to a rushed production- the movie was made, start to finish, in a matter of months, from what I understand with an incomplete script), but somehow it all comes together quite well.We are also treated to new subplots and characters, such as Chris Rock in a hilarious performance as Detective Butters, whom is having a baby with Murtaugh's daughter- yet Murtaugh himself is unaware Butters is the father, as it is being kept secret because he disapproves of his daughter marrying an officer of the law.Returning characters (such as Rene Russo and Joe Pesci) are also further developed. Leo Getz is now a PI, whom Riggs and Murtaugh exploit, and he has an unexpected and truly heartwarming scene that takes his character to a new level unseen in previous films. Lorna Cole is now pregnant with Rigg's child, and they are preparing for the arrival, and also contending with their mixed feelings regarding marriage.Love and family is a huge part of Lethal Weapon 4's storyline. The whole of Rigg's character is tested when it comes to family and loyalty, as he is still struggling with the death of his wife Victoria, while trying to make things work with Lorna. And Murtaugh has taken in a Chinese family (the Hongs), whom he discovers being smuggled into the country.The film is well-written (with a screen story co-written by future Hollywood big-shot writers Alfred Gough and Miles Milar, who went on to work on projects like Spider-Man 2, Shanghai Noon and Smallville) and Donner's direction is amazing. The action sequences are well-done, and the film does have a nice East meets West vibe with our gun-toting heroes taking on a villain that never once fires a gun, but relies on his martial arts and wit to defeat his enemies.The acting is also top-notch, with great performances by all involved.The film is a good conclusion to the series. It ties up almost all loose ends, and it has some of the best action out of the entire series. While it arguably the worst out of the four (although I did enjoy it more than part 3), that's not saying much as the first two films are classics, and the third film is still very well-done. This is a good movie, it just isn't perfect.I'll give this one a 7 out of 10- a great way to end the franchise. Unless they decide to make Lethal Weapon 5, in which case, I'll be first in line to see it.

It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we knew them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the gun handling left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more marketable product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming Indiana Jones 4.) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line, I'm getting too old for this sh*t. It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike!

This series started out beautifully and ends as it started, wonderfully.  The best part of Lethal Weapon 4 is that this is a movie, that could stand on it's own as a great action movie.  That is not only very unusual for a third sequel but it's almost impossible to do.  But Richard Donner brings together the cast and crew for a finale that is action-packed, fun, and a little sad.  A lot of years have passed since the original and Riggs and Murtaugh are a little older and a little wiser and Donner is not afraid to show their weaknesses that have come with age.  Riggs has fallen in love finally with Lorna Cole (Rene Russo returns) and they are expecting a baby.  Murtaugh's daughter Rianne is also expecting.  The movie starts out with an explosive scene with Riggs and Murtaugh going up against some crazy nut with a flame thrower, a bullet resistant outfit, and a machine gun.  Of course that situation couldn't end without Riggs blowing up the city block.  The story line for Lethal 4 is a little more in depth but fortunately still makes sense and is fun to watch.  Chinese Triads are smuggling over immigrants to sell as slaves to Chinese factories.  Some of the slaves are used to make counterfeit money in order to buy four top Triad leaders back from a Chinese Ambassador.  Jet Li stars as the big bad guy and he is chilling and evil looking and an unbelievable martial artist.  I am not a huge fan of Jet Li but he was the ideal adversary for Riggs and Murtaugh.  Donner brings everything back from the first Lethal film and rolls it into this one smoothly.  Riggs is not quite as quick as he once was and although Lorna has managed to domesticate him...there are several scenes where Gibson is taking on Jet Li hand to hand and you see that flash of that loose cannon Riggs we all know and love.  That crazy look in his eyes that we all remember.  Joe Pesci is back and this time Leo Gettz is a Private Detective which means he finally has a gun of his own.  Fortunately again Leo is used in moderation and not only that but the character this time is given some depth and instead of being just constantly annoying he is a little more sympathetic and at the end of the film he has a very moving and touching conversation with Mel Gibson's character Riggs and he helps Riggs genuinely, with a very big situation in Riggs personal life...whether or not to marry Lorna Cole.  Rene Russo still manages to kick a little butt even being pregnant which sometimes makes you think about the poor baby.  Chris Rock joins the cast as a fresh new cop who reminds you a little of Riggs and a little of Murtaugh but also adds his own flavor to the group.  He is made out to be the new generation of cops, and kinda of a new generation of Lethal Weapon.  In one very cute scene which was bordering on un-necessary Chris Rock and Joe Pesci have a little back and forth squabble slash stand-up routine about cell phones.  What seems un-necessary is probably actually Donner's attempt at demonstrating the old and the new.  Pesci being an old comic, and Chris Rock being the fresh new face.  The cast...whether it be our old familliars from Lethal 1-3 or newcomes like Rock...fit together perfectly.  This is a family through and through and as they say in the end We're family.  The whole series of these films together are amazing achievements in the world of Action films where almost anything passes for entertainment.  Blow something up and it's an action film.  Instead Donner has given us a series with characters that are likeable and important, and deep, and relatable, and given us lives and stories that we love to watch.  On top of that he builds action films that are chock full of explosions, and laughs and guns, and martial arts and a world where reality has to be set aside and you get to ride shotgun with the two craziest cops in the business.  I hope that maybe someday Donner might bring the cast back for another one although I think I would be shocked and floored if he was able to pull off another part in this series.  It really would be milking the cash cow and Donner is not much for doing that.  Definately check out Lethal Weapon 4....but without a doubt check out the whole series...you can't miss these movies.  Lethal Weapon 4 I give a hearty 9/10 "},{"Title":"Wedding Bells, Ammo Shells.

He even destroys Riggs and Murtaugh's car. While they duck down, Murtaugh reports that Lorna is pregnant and Riggs will be a father. Riggs reports that Rianne is pregnant and Murtaugh will be a grandfather. It comes as a shock to both of them. Riggs suggests Murtaugh draw the guy's fire by stripping down to his underwear and flapping like a chicken. It works and the guy blasts a tanker truck which blows him sky high.        Nine months later, Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo Getz are onMurtaugh's boat. Leo had caught a shark. Leo is also now a private investigator. They have a run-in with a cargo ship and it's crew are shooting at them, so Riggs get's aboard. Murtaugh's boat sinks and he and Leo have to swim--with the shark.         The ship runs aground and Riggs discovers a bunch of Chinese immigrants in the haul. When the police come, Murtaugh and Riggs run into Sgt. Lee Butters (Chris Rock). Butters is always especially nice to Murtaugh, whom thinks he's coming on to him. Murtaugh also discovers some more Chinese immigrants hiding in his life raft. They were the Hongs.        Murtaugh invites the Hongs to stay at his house. What Riggs and Murtaugh are soon to discover is that a crime lord, Uncle Benny, and his assistant, Wah Sing Ku, who is a master at martial arts. Pratically better than Jackie Chan.          Murtaugh, Riggs and Butters are driving around one day and run into Leo Getz. Leo and Butters don't really get along at first. Leo thinks he's a perp; Riggs, Butters and Murtaugh arrive in Chinatown and deal with crooks.                   Later, Murtaugh returns home to find the Hongs gone, and Wah Sing Ku there as well. He and his men tie up the Murtaughs,Riggs and Lorna and set the house on fire. They're rescued thanks to young Ping. Murtaugh and Riggs chase the baddies. They were driving a black Mercedes. Chaos and action packed moments ensue and soon their cars are wrecked and the baddies dead.         Murtaugh and Riggs learn of counterfeit operations, headed by Uncle Benny. Leo leads them to Uncle Benny at the dentist, where they use laughing gas to make Benny talk. But Murtaugh, Riggs and Butters become intoxicated also and they laugh their secrets out. Murtaugh finds out just why Butters was being so nice to him. Because he's the father of Murtaugh's grandson. Murtaugh is very mad at that.       Riggs and Murtaugh go to foil the counterfeit operations and soon engage in a lethal battle with Wah Sing Ku. There's even a daring rescue of Riggs underwater.         Next day, Riggs is in the cemetary visiting his wife's grave, when Leo shows up. He tells Riggs a very sad story about a pet frog he had as a boy. Riggs had no idea Leo had such a hard childhood.Suddenly, his pager goes off Lorna's at the hospital, so they race over there.         Lorna refuses to have the baby unless she and Riggs become married right there. So they get a priest and both say I do.Soon the kids are born, and the Riggs', the Murtaughs, Leo, and Captain Murphy all line up for a picture. After all, they're family, and amazingly enough, Riggs and Leo have been firm friends ever since.       This is a good Lethal movie. I wonder if there'll be a Lethal Weapon 5. That was a tragic story Leo told about his pet frog. Also, Leo Getz into another speech about something. This time it's cellphones. He and Butters both exchange comments. Which is funny. Pairing two funny men.       Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, and Jet Li are a star-studded cast.

The opening of Lethal Weapon 4 is typical Lethal Weapon and done to perfection. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh have been called to a disruption in downtown L.A. Anyway this maniac is destroying things with a fire torch, yet the experienced cop partners are in deep and meaningful discussion about there personal life instead of getting the bad guy. So Riggs tells Murtaugh to take off his clothes down to his boxers and to flap his arms like a chicken. So Murtaugh does it, Riggs 'blows' the bad guy away and once again makes his partner look like an idiot. This start just made me ask for more, and my wish was to be granted.  Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, each now feeling too old to be doing what they're doing, try to stop the Chinese Triads from doing their illegal business in the U.S. Uncle Benny, Chinatown's mob boss, has imported Chinese slaves to pay for an artist to create counterfeit Chinese currency which the Triads will use to buy the Four Fathers (heads of the Triads) back from the Chinese military. Lee Butters joins the team as a new cop and Leo Getz is back, now as a P.I. The cast of Lethal Weapon 4 was fantastic. I want to give praise to the performance of martial arts specialist Jet Li. His scenes in this movie were fantastic and left me dumb-founded at times. He is a talented man in his field, and was the correct choice for the role of the Chinese bad guy. His eyes make him look especially bad, and his movements are just amazing. I also liked his performance in the movie Romeo Must Die, where he continues his martial arts role even more, with the beautiful Aaliyah.Once again the main characters stand up for a final time. Glover and Gibson pair up superbly as the cop partners. One of the classics quotes from the whole film would have to be when, Uncle Benny tells Riggs in his Chinese shop that ` it's fried rice you Plick', a terrific line. Those two have gone through a lot together, and what a ride it had for their audiences. I have loved every bit of it. Yet the funniest role of the whole series belongs to funny man, Joe Pesci. Leo Getz is a crazy character and he had me in stitches again in Lethal Weapon 4. The scene where he talks about the mobile phones is hilarious,  They f#*k you with the cell phones' what a line! New man to this film is comedian, Chris Rock. His role was another funny one, especially the way he sucks up to Sargent Murtaugh. I am looking forward to seeing more movie roles of Rock's in the future.  Again the scenes in this are just incredible. The scene on the immigration boat was great action, plus watching poor old Murtaugh get the short end of the stick was very amusing, he seems to never have any luck. The scene through Chinatown was cleverly put together and one of my favourite in the whole film. The martial art scenes in lethal weapon 4 were first class. The scene at the Murtaugh's house was just exceptional, as was the conclusion of the film, were we get to see how peeved Jet Li really can be. Also the car chase on the highway was great, it was good change from the martial arts and certainly left hanging for sometimes. Plus the scene at the dentist was very funny and just shows how crazy this lethal weapon team can be. Yet the scene at the end of the film with Leo Getz and Riggs at his wife's grave site, was something I wasn't expecting, but I thought it was beautifully written and wonderfully acted. Ok, Ok, many people have said that this Lethal weapon is the best or the worst of the series. Look I found it breathtaking in some instances, and at times very very funny. The cast's through each film in the series has been great to watch (especially with the final credits of this film and the song &#145;Why can't we be friends'), and some of the crazy scenes and antics, have been hilarious. I think people who criticise this film completely really aren't a fan of the genre, because each film has been different and makes you feel better for the viewing experience.

In this fourth installment of the popular action/drama series, the pair are confronted with a murderous Chinese Triad with links to Hong Kong, that deals in counterfeiting and the smuggling of illegals into the country, where their new lives become nothing more than virtual slavery.  It's a subject that touches a nerve with Murtaugh (Glover), which brings about an irrational decision when he thinks he can help.  But not to worry; Riggs (Gibson) is there to back him up, and together they take on one of their most formidable opponents yet, Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li), head of the Triad, who happens to be in the process of discharging a personal agenda from which he will not be deterred.  And making matters all the more complicated, Riggs and Murtaugh each have personal issues of their own to deal with  Murtaugh with his daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), and Riggs with Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), the first woman with whom he's had a long standing relationship since the death of his wife. 	With three highly successful `Lethal' outings under their belts, it would have been easy for director Donner and his stars to phone this one in, make a few bucks and move on.  But not these guys; Refusing to rest on their laurels, they deliver yet another exceptional, action-packed movie that maintains the quality and consistency of the first three.  Gibson and Glover manage to take their characters to yet another level, keeping it all fresh and refusing to cruise through the comfort zone on auto pilot.  Russo, as well, turns in another winning performance; she and Gibson really click together, rivaling the kind of chemistry Bogie and Bacall brought to the screen.  Their relationship is extremely well developed and handled with skill by Donner, as is the entire story; it all moves ahead quickly and is never allowed to slow down or meander, which keeps the emotional level and tension high throughout the film.  The action is possibly the best of any of the series, with some sequences so good they deserve comparison to John Woo's best.   	Jet Li is absolutely dynamic, and brings a real sense of menace to his character of Ku.  For the first time, you get the feeling that Riggs and Murtaugh may be up against more than they can handle by themselves.  And even with all this series has going for it already, in this one they manage to introduce yet another character that adds even more to their formula for success  Chris Rock joins the team as Lee Butters, the next generation of law enforcement, an officer with a degree in psychology.  He adds some humor to the proceedings, but more than that, he makes Butters likable and seems to have an immediate grasp of who he is and where he fits in.  And fit in well he does, essentially becoming the third member of the team.  Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back as well, this time as a private investigator still trying his best to ingratiate himself with his friends, Riggs and Murtaugh.  Interestingly enough, one of the more touching scenes in the film (near the end) develops during a conversation between Getz and Riggs, one that offers the audience (as well as Riggs) some insight into what makes Getz tick. 	The supporting cast includes Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Darlene Love (Trish), Eddy Ko (Hong) and Mary Ellen Trainor, reprising her role of Police Psychiatrist Dr. Stephanie Woods for the fourth time.  Working from another exceptionally well written script (this time by Channing Gibson), Donner and Company have scored yet another triumph with `Lethal Weapon 4,' which can stand on it's own, or as a part of one of the best action/drama series ever made.  Which one of the four is the best?  Toss a coin; these are movies the way they ought to be made.  I rate this one 10/10.

On the plus side, Donner usually gets decent tech crews and artists for his work.The original 'Lethal Weapon' trilogy is a trademark of the 80s.  Stylized flash overdose mixed with lame plots--drug dealers, Nazis, and crooked cops.  They parody what we consider serious in an Arnold or Seagal movie, but still try to be dramatic.  I find the original to be the best because it balances the different influences best.Now with '4', we have a parody of the first three.  The plot is less contrived this time--Triads and smuggling--but still simple.  I wasn't expecting 'Ronin', but considering the budget you'd think something more detailed could have been written.  Some interesting things to consider--The human tank opening is the most interesting set piece in the trilogy.

Parts of it seemed more like a sitcom than an action film.By no means would I say it was all bad, - it was nice for Jet Li to appear (even if he was somewhat wasted) and the sight of Riggs sliding down the freeway on a table was certainly a fresh take on 'daredevil escapades' - but right down to the snapshots at the end, this just wasn't 'lethal' enough, anymore... (but then, I guess Cuddly Weapon wouldn't sell so well... )Lethal Weapon 2 was on the 'bitty' side; but at least they kept the 'edge' to Riggs' character. In the 3rd, he was more jovial; but the 'darkness' was preserved by the subplot of underage firearm use. By the time the fourth rolled around, it seemed like they were playing it safe because they didn't want to leave the audience on a 'bum note'... I think taking that route would have been appropriate though, and left the franchise with more integrity....

With a budget of over $140 million making it the highest budgeted entry in the series, part 4 eventually made double that Worldwide. So with that you can't really blame those involved for trundling out another instalment. But you sense that the box office returns tellingly the profit was heavily reliant on takings outside of America came about more out of loyalty to the show it winds up feeling like a TV series we have been with for years, and a belief that this was indeed the last time we would see the coupling of Riggs and Murtaugh.Viewing it now, part 4 is pleasant enough without the heavy weight of expectation. Back then in the late 1990s it wasn't unreasonable to expect some pizazz from the latest entry. Part 3 had made a staggering profit Worldwide of over $285 million, but critics and many fans were unimpressed with the big bang for your buck approach they took. The story was, ultimately, shallow and really rather lazy. So with the monster budget in place and an expectation that the series would go out in a blaze of glory, we expected much. But got little. Chris Rock joins the cast as Murtaugh's detective son-in-law and Jet Li kicks his way into the franchise as a Triad hit-man with personal issues. And that's that really, where did the money go? Rene Russo as Riggs' honey has been reduced from a buttock kicking character of note to being nine months pregnant, while Joe Pesci as love him or hate him squeaker Leo Getz is now a PI serving only as a set up for some of Riggs and Murtaugh's scornful humour. There's some solid gags in there, delivered with the usual panache from Gibson, and director Richard Donner sets up some thrilling action sequences. Notably a thrilling freeway pursuit as Gibbo surfs a table! But the money isn't up there on the screen, it's in the pockets of those who finally hopefully are too old for this feces.It's not a fitting closure, but the love of the characters just about remains intact.

Stop at this number, please. Yes, I guess the magic is still there, but I think this is a great example of another trying sequel, that's had it's time. In this latest wearied weapon, marking a six year absence, since it's predecessor, again the story isn't new, especially when you hear about asylum seekers today. Here they are used as guinea pigs, by a nasty triad group, where one abandoned family temporary become part of Murtaugh's family. I must say the start is originally fantastic with a guy suited up in a metal suit, looking like the Michellin man, armed with a flame thrower, who our most popular cop duo, must overthrow, the scene evolving in a successful, humorous resolution, Riggs busting his partners chops again. Getting back to the story, that again sees Riggs at war with another enemy, Jet Li, part of the triad group. Also we have Kim Chan who might of been reprising his role in The Corrupter, as having the same name here, Uncle Benny, who proves a bit of a hoot, especially with one abusive line, involving fried rice. A very much pregnant, Russo, is back, where for Riggs, the idea of a second marriage is a brick wall he can't get past. So too, thankfully is Pesci, and Rock too as a hot shot black cop, secretly in love with Murtaugh's daughter. Murtaugh's wife has a secret too, though I'm not gonna tell. Gibson and Glover still make a great team, that humour we love is still there, with so too the action, including one thrilling car chase sequence which is a bit of a hairy watch. As from Gibson's perspective, it had me asking how that shot was done, Gibson being dragged behind a truck, merely hanging onto some plastic sheeting, sliding zanily across the freeway, amidst dense traffic, one of the film's high points. So was Pesci's private moment with Riggs, where he shares a story about his pet turtle, that makes Riggs re examine his single status. We have some tragic and sad moments, that have you wanting our super duo, especially Riggs, to kick the crap out of the bad dudes. Some funny moments I loved, between Pesci and Rock, as well as Rock and Glover, who's made uncomfortable, as he seems kind of sweet on Rog, was priceless. Too that early incident, that had Glover going shirtless and flapping his arms like a chicken, is something the department won't let him forget, even nine months onwards, was one of the vivid memories of the movie. With everything that makes the 'Weapon' movies work, I just felt there was a tired point here. I just found it a bit of a stretching sequel, and a trite but duller, despite having all the right components, where to make another sequel would be unforgivable, if criminal. You must come a point and call it quits, and remember the 'Weapon' movies for what they were- one of the best buddy cop franchises ever made. Just don't look back.

I believe he made the last two and he has made this one as well, so when approaching a Lethal Weapon movie you know what to expect. The good thing is because the same person is in control of the movie, we know that we are not going to be that disappointed. As the Lethal Weapons were not my favourite movie, I was not looking towards this one with great anticipation. I did like it, but I think that it is a movie to wait for on video.The thing about the Lethal Weapon movies is they are action/comedies. The first movie was not that comical, but they have become more funnier as time goes on. This fourth one is probably the funniest of the lot of them, but the comedy is based on character relations rather than on anything else.While out fishing, Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Myrtle (Danny Glover) run into a ship full of illegal Asian immigrants. They run it aground and thus uncover an illegal smuggling ring which they plan to break open and the rest of the movie deals with them trying to bust the smugglers who happen to be triads. Some have said that this movie is racist I disagree. If it is then it is unintentional. The gangsters might be Asians, but they balance that out with good guy Asians as well, that is the Ho family. I think any racist comments in the movie is simply looking for ways to undermine it. Asians are not portrayed as being evil gangsters who seek to undermine American security, it is just the the gangsters are Asian.This makes me think about the actors, Jet Li was a Hong Kong actor and was a super star over there. There was another Asian, who played Grandfather Ho, who I recognised from some Hong Kong movie. One wonders what is happening to Hong Kong cinema now that it has been handed over to the Chinese, and it seems that some of the actors have moved to the US to start up careers there. As to Media Asia Distribution and Golden Harvest Films, well I don't know what has happened to them. Jet Li though has very few lines, which makes me wonder if he really can speak English that well. I have been told that Jackie Chan cannot speak English all that well, and most of Bruce Lee's movies were in Chinese, but I wonder about Jet Li. As to his role though, it is not like some of his other movies, such as High Risk or even The Master. Jet Li plays a very silent and deadly criminal in this movie, but it is very different from his other roles.For entertainment value, Lethal Weapon 4 is great. I really enjoyed it, and so did my sister who hates Mel Gibson. So it is not a movie to rush down to the cinema to see, but it is one that if fun and enjoyable.

This will not stand as one of the best in all the series partly due to the fact that the plot here is a little lazy than the ones we saw in Lethal Weapon 1 and Lethal Weapon 2. Lethal Weapon 3 may have had the best intro scene but it too was just lazy in the aspect of its script, as it was more like let's get a girl for Riggs than it was let's make a buddy cop movie.Here the duo are up against the Kung Fu fighting Jet Li, his introduction added the Kung Fu genre in to this action comedy and Richard Donner the director just didn't have what it took to make this Lethal Weapon a master piece, but if this movie is to stand on its own it is a nice action comedy.Again the score is done by the trio of Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton & David Sanborn, although here the whole hip addition didn't make me enjoy the score as I did in the previous movies.In this flick our buddy cop duo is up against the Chinese Triads. Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo were fishing when they came across a smuggling ship, and as usual by accident they ended up crashing the ship.Now they are cut between human trafficking and the murder of three people on the ship. The Triads are in America with Jet Li as Wah Sing Ku being in charge of the operations, Riggs and Murtaugh are trying hard to be able to piece together what the Triads are up to, and the connection between their operations and the human smuggling.But as this was going on both Riggs and Murtaugh are expecting. Riggs girlfriend Lorna is pregnant with their first child and Murtaugh eldest daughter Rianne is pregnant with hers. Roger however doesn't know who Rianne's baby daddy is, but Riggs knows that it is Detective Lee Butters (Chris Rock) and he uses this to play tricks on Roger making him think Butters is gay.I do commend the producers in their ability to maintain the cast, right from the first to the forth The Murtaugh family of Husband, Wife and three kids have been the same cast from the first to the last. Riggs and his new found love Lorna from the third was also here in this last one, the captain has been the same all through the series, and Leo Getz that was introduced in the second was also maintained although the series.What can I say, I did enjoy watching the crazy duo again for the fourth time, and the DVD box set of all four movies is one you will like to own.Plans are there for a reboot or continuation of the Lethal Weapon franchise, I just hope they won't blow it.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Average (contains spoilers)","Date":"19 August 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  After LW3 this is an improvement on the coherent script- and the bad guy- areas, but now there's just too many characters, too much joking, hence too little room for action.

Russo gets barely room at all, Pesci is only just a clown/punching bag and Rock is in the wrong movie.The opening is better than in LW3, after that things move SLOW, but the plot unravels nicely. The mood is lighter than in LW3, but near the end there has been too much slapstick comedy and bad jokes and too little action; BUT there's also been hints of the original chemistry between Riggs & Murtaugh AND this time a truly evil opponent played by Jet Li, so it all could be salvaged with a nice LW2-type MASSIVE shoot-out. But instead, suddenly we're just thrown into a (short) shoot-out and pretty soon after that mr. Li gets wasted in a (nicely) sadistic two-on-one. Verdict Average. All the minuses counterweight the plusses so you might end up feeling cheated.IF LW3 would have lost its appalling feeling and absorbed the best elements of LW4 onto its too-thin-plot so that it would have included bad guys from both parts (two separate cases), we'd had a HELLUVA trilogy back in the days...

After Riggs' battles with Mister Joshua and Pieter Voordstet or however you spell it, I half expected him to chew Travis up and spit him out. So, in the rush to create a fourth Lethal, the makers reversed the formula. Now, they have an exceptional villian in the shape of Wah Sing Ku, a Chinese triad played to perfection by Jet Li, but they lost what made the other three films so great. The banter between action sequences has gone from hilarious to just plain annoying.Part of the blame for this can be laid fairly and squarely upon Chris Rock, who is such an annoying loudmouth that when I see him pull a gun on Leo Getz, I half expect Joe Pesci to revert to gangster mode and stab the moron to death with a pen. Then there is the treatment of Lorna Cole in this episode the addition of Rene Russo to Lethal Weapon 3 added a whole new edge of excitement in several action scenes, but here she is relegated to pregnant dead weight. Lorna and Martin versus Wah Sing Ku, now that's a three-way action scene I would pay good money for.The main story arc of our heroes inadvertently uncovering a Chinese people-smuggling operation was also clumsily handled. Whenever the destructive detectives need information enough to get to the next action set-piece, they consult detectives from the Asian Crime Unit. Here's an idea why not have Martin and Roger working closely with the ACU to crack the case together, rather than running off like loose cannons to destroy half the city in their typical fashion?That leads me to another serious problem with this film the cast was getting way too crowded. With Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, and Joe Pesci, it's crowded enough to detract a little from the banter, but what happens when you add in a thoroughly annoying man like Chris Rock? Well, you guessed it - the banter just gets confused and messy.All the action in the world can't hide a bad script, and the audio commentary on the Region 1 DVD reveals that the script for Lethal Weapon 4 was written about twelve months before principal photography began. This is not nearly enough time for rewrites, editing, and so forth before the cameras roll. I guess the desire to make more money simply overwhelmed the producers this time around. Oh well.

The critics panned this one as by-the-numbers and I agree somewhat. However, the real reason to see this movie is Jet Li, who plays the leader of the Mafia. He was brilliant! One of the most sinister villains in movie history, he uses incredible martial arts and infliction of pain on his foes and plays a remorseless leader beautifully. There are some good action scenes as well, see the Jet's henchmen set fire to Murtaugh's house with his family, Riggs and Ms. Cole inside, see Riggs and Murtaugh go after them later in a great car chase through L.A., and the climax is good, too.

So solly, but the honorable dilector does not know Chinese don't all have accent.The one part of this movie that held my attention was Wah Sing Ku, killer for the Chinese mafia (not, as a previous reviewer erroneously pointed out, Japanese Yakuza), played by the veteran Hong Kong action star, Li Lian Jie, aka, Jet Li. A world-class wushu practitioner, Li had a few opportunities to showcase his talents. Words like breath-taking and awe-inspiring do not begin to describe his skill. *SPOILER*The utterly maddening part of this movie is that it somehow wanted us to believe that a couple of out-of-shape, over-the-hill cops could beat in hand-to-hand combat a well-conditioned, young wushu master who has trained for his whole life and (the movie suggests) killed people much tougher than Riggs and Murtaugh. Yes, I realize it was their movie, they had to win, the bad guy had to lose, etc., etc., etc., but I'm afraid my suspension of disbelief isn't quite that pliable.*END SPOILER*Other than Li's portions, this movie deserves to be placed in that mountainous pile of mediocre, killing-time formula movies.

The film soon begins to take off after about 15 minutes or so when the plot begins to develop.  I must say, slavery is a very different subject for the LW series but it works well.  But if there's anything about the series we love most, it's the action and comedy.The action on one hand is very good this time around, however it dosen't live up to the top notch sequences in the 3rd installment.  The previous films always had a little bit of martial arts in them, this one has a lot.  This is where the film shines because it introduces the outstanding Jet Li to Hollywood.  They did such a good job with these fight sequences that many many many American have instantly became a Jet Li fan and looked for tons of his previous work from Hong Kong (may I suggest Fist of Legend and Once Upon A Time In China for starters).  The car chase is also a highlight of the film and it shows how lively Gibson's and Glover's chemistry is.The comedy is at it's best here, this is the funniest of the series.  Joe Pesci still has his character down great, he uses the F word an extra 100 times in this one.  Chris Rock also brings a whole lot of his talent into the film with parts he obviously wrote.  When Pesci and Rock are together it's hilarious.  Two great moments are the conversation about cell phones and the dentist office.This is better than the 2nd installment but not as good as the 3rd, nor does it come close to par with the original.

For starters, it's simply not as good as the other entries. The action scenes may rank among the finest in the series (or indeed any series), but the rest of the movie feels, if not tired, then too comfortable. The family atmosphere both onset and off comes clear from the screen, overwhelming any sense of danger. There is endless friendly banter, joking and kidding around, and occasionally a bad guy pops up. But with an ever-growing roster of good guys, who always survive every movie, and no way near enough proper, nasty bad guys, there is little threat to our heroes. The essential status quo of an action movie is that the forces of good are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the forces of evil, but Lethal 4 presents the opposite. Riggs (sadly without his trademark haircut) and Rog, along with Rog's family, Leo Getz, Lorna Cole and the police guys, are this time joined by Butters (Chris Rock) and a huge Japanese family.    The bad guys....well, there are some Triad crimebosses, who we see little or nothing of, their lame henchmen, and Wa Sang Ku (Jet Li). And that's really about it. Perhaps really memorable bad guys have always been a problem with this series, but there should atleast be a lot of &#145;em. Ironically, Jet Li is one of the most sinister and memorable villains of the series, but with such a weak crew of associates behind him, he's virtually on his own against all the good guys.    Of course, the whole series revolves around Riggs and Rog. Danny Glover, to his immense credit, has given a great performance in each film, and does so again here. And he doesn't look any older than in 1987. But Mel Gibson's Riggs has matured too much, and although it's a fine performance, it's too static, almost tired character who has finally calmed down and settled down. It works in that conceivably, the influence of Rog and family has matured Riggs and made him happier, but it's less fun to watch. Let's not forget who the Lethal Weapon is of the title - it seems the makers of Lethal Weapon 4 did.

As with each previous sequel, they've added one more major character, more one-liners, more action, more effects - resulting in a formless mishmash where the elements are all competing for attention leaving the viewer overwhelmed rather than entertained.  (Consider that the excellent Rene Russo is relegated to a minor role.)There is a plot somewhere in there, and some character issues, but all is obscured by the frantic pace - trying to fit in dialogue during a car chase scene, for example.Worth seeing, but turn off your brain and just enjoy the effects.

That should be an accomplishment in itself. Sure, Lethal Weapon 4 was supposed to never happen and a lot of people probably wished it would have stayed that way. However, how does that explain this movie being one of the highest grossing films of 1998?This movie is another action flick in the Lethal Weapon mode that contains many explosions, fights, humour, stereotypical villains and victory for good over evil, yet does it in a subtle, but interesting manner. Sure, Rene Russo's performance may make you gag at times and if Mel Gibson (Riggs) delivers another of his pathetic one-liners you will turn off the VCR, yet it never happens. If there was anything that I truly enjoyed during this movie, was the performance by Jet Li (the only one who played their role not their own personality) some exciting action sequences (where Riggs is being dragged behing a moving house on a sheet of plastic and is about to be run over by a crazy Chinese man) and the overall flow of the movie (all action sequences were in the right places).I found all of the main performances with the exception of Li to be fake and uninteresting. I really couldn't seriously picture Chris Rock as a police officer and Joe Pesci is overly annoying, even more than his character which was uneccessary in this movie. Some scenes in this movie were overindulgent (the laughing gas scene) and I felt that the viewer was being explained the plot all the time making one believe that the director thought the viewing audience was just plain stupid.I liked the way the movie was wrapped up in the last action sequence, but found that the last scene with the births taking place were totally unecessary and unconvincing (What was with the make-shift wedding and the Gibson-Pesci bonding). All I can hope for is no more sequels to this series because I know I will watch them and be let down again.5/10 stars.

The reason for this admittedly superficial accomplishment is because ALL action movies live and die by their villains, and LW4 offers a thrilling villain by the name of Jet Li, a martial arts expert out of Hong Kong. His presence immediately corkscrews the fear and loathing needed to really hate the bad guys, seeing as how, you know, its so hard to tell them apart from the good guys.The plot involves Asian ganglords who illegally import slave labor, are forging Chinese banknotes to buy back members of an Asian triad, yada yada yada, the plot is barely coherent and mostly unnecessary in a movie like this anyways. It's always been style over substance in this series, and by this point director Richard Donner (who's done all four pictures), could do this in his sleep. The secret to this series' longevity is the amazing repoire between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who have created one of the most dynamic cop pairings ever. Their incessant banter has the feel of genuine friendship and spontaneity - you can't tell me its all from the script. These characters are so woven into their being they don't even need to slip into them, they ARE them, and that ease of embellishment creates an audience empathy no script could ever do.Also aiding the effort is the return of Joe Pesci as Leo, Rene Russo as Gibson's love interest, plus a new member, Chris Rock, as another detective whose name Riggs and Murtaugh can never remember, and who is bound to have a complicated relationship with Murtaugh. There is enough human interest in this movie to flesh out these characters, along with the usual spectacular chase sequences and fights. The movie is funny, silly, and ridiculous, but if you don't mind being entertained on a strictly superficial level, you'll enjoy Letal Weapon 4.

There is probably no-one who can say that he or she has never heard of it before, which shows how successful these movies once were. But when has the time come to quit? After you've made already three movies that looked very similar to each other and didn't offer anything new, isn't a fourth one a bit too much then? That's the question that I was asking myself before watching Lethal Weapon 4. And after seeing it I knew the answer, yes it is a bit too much...Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh have made a career out of stopping criminals and surviving several explosions and other attacks on their lives, but now they are feeling too old to keep doing such crazy stunts and their superiors seem to think the same way, because they get promotion so they no longer have to go on the streets, blowing up some buildings or other stuff. But of course wherever they go, the action is always near and soon they try to stop the Chinese Triads from doing their illegal business in the United States. They are confronted with Uncle Benny, Chinatown's mafia boss, who has imported Chinese slaves to pay for an artist to create counterfeit Chinese currency. This money will then be used by the the Triads to buy the Four Fathers, the heads of the Triads, back from the Chinese military...All the movies in the series look pretty much the same. It's the same kind of story, the same jokes, the same actors ..., so you always know exactly what to expect. And in a way that is a good thing, because when it is all recognizable, once again you can be sure that it will work out fine. But in the end you get tired of it as well, because this movie doesn't give you any hope for some new and original features. The only thing that does change is the cast, when with each new movie one or two new characters are added. This time that is Chris Rock, who will be the newest detective in Riggs' and Murtaugh's team. And yes he is funny and interesting to watch in this movie, but it is never enough to save the entire film. He's never able to make you forget that he's the only new thing this movie has to offer. All the rest looks exactly the same as always and that really is a shame. I'm sure the makers must be able to come up with something better than this, but easy money and success win from a daring new concept.All in all this isn't a bad movie. If you liked the other three in the series, you'll like this one as well. But I just hoped for something new and that I didn't get. I loved the first one, liked the second one, was a bit disappointed by the third and the fourth didn't really do any better. That's why I give it a 6/10, perhaps a 6.5/10, but certainly nothing more than that.

It mixed high-octane, explosive action with great chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and as the films wore on, a supporting cast was slowly added to keep things barrelling along. But by the time the fourth film was released, it appeared to prove that familiarity does indeed breed contempt. It couldn't stick to the formula any tighter and while the old ingredients are still there, they've not been mixed together with any love as though the chef was bored of making the same meal time and again.During a typically excessive shoot-out, Riggs (Gisbon) and Murtaugh (Glover) discover that there are changes in the future - Murtaugh's daughter (Traci Wolfe) is expecting while Rigg's partner Lorna (Rene Russo) is also with child. So does this bring any stability to their chaotic careers? Sadly for Captain Murphy (Steve Kahan), it appears not - the pair are thrown into a case involving a boatload of Chinese migrants, a local Triad boss (Kim Chan) and a martial-arts expert (Jet Li) who doesn't take kindly to any interference with his plans. But Riggs and Murtaugh are starting to feel their age, especially when eager upstart Lee Butters (Chris Rock) tags along.It's not a complete wash-out but Lethal Weapon 4 feels like a contractual obligation rather than a genuine attempt to thrill audiences. True, the action sequences (of which there are many) maintain the series' usual high standards and there is no signs that the relationship between the two leads is degrading. Dialogue still has that improvised feel to it, meaning that so many lines are spoken over that the film's plot (which is the weakest so far) is difficult to follow. Aside from Glover & Gibson, Russo's previous good work in Lethal Weapon 3 is overlooked as she is almost completely sidelined in favour of motor-mouth Rock and fellow hyperactive Jo Pesci who returns as the increasingly annoying Leo Getz. There is also a strong of sense of deja vu - when our heroes count up 1-2-3 again just before doing something stupid, it simply isn't as funny as it was before.In many respects, it's not that much different to the others but Lethal Weapon 4 isn't much more that a dumb action flick with some fairly decent comedy bits thrown in for good measure. But it just doesn't gel like the earlier movies and while it looks much like the others (except with a few more wrinkles this time), it doesn't feel the same. Whether that's because action movies are all much-of-a-muchness or whether Lethal Weapon has now become a parody of itself, I cannot say but as much as I wanted to switch off and enjoy it, I found myself wondering what Murtaugh was still doing on the force when he was due for retirement back in 1987 in the first film.

This is immediately evident when after an unexplained and pointless - though admittedly action packed - intro that has nothing to do with the film (remember the starts of 1, 2 & 3 were all related to the plot line that followed) featuring a Ned Kelly styled psycho with a flamethrower, the imminent arrival of not one, but two babies is announced.Ahhh babies, the sure-fire signal that a franchise is bereft of new ideas.But for the most part in LW4 that doesn't even matter, why invent new ideas when the old ones still work just fine? The usual suspects are still around, Leo (Joe Pesci) is now a private eye, still irritable, yappy and profance. Riggs kept a woman alive for two films in a row, and now Lorna (Rene Russo) is one of the preggers chickies along with Roger's eldest daughter Rianne who ignored her own condom ad and got knocked up by a young loud mouthed cop named Butters (Chris Rock), who seems to be there to be a similarly abrasive counterpoint to Leo and to create a dumb running joke where Roger thinks he is gay for him.As always the case comes to them, this time it is a people smuggling operation lead by villainous Chinese criminals, after it is busted open the 400+ are sent back; but not a dozen or so that Roger decides to keep for himself in some kind of 'free the slaves' arrangement. This ludicrous turn of events only gets worse when he decides to keep them all in his home. What exactly did he plan to do with them?? Doesn't matter, because in a stroke of luck this one family is the main one the smugglers actually wanted to get into the country (why the other 400 odd then?), and they head to Roger's house to claim them. (I've said it before, everyone knows where Roger lives).After this the usual stuff happens, Roger and/or Riggs gets p*ssed and decide that's enough leading to the deaths of countless bad guys and many explosions.And really that's why Lethal Weapon 4 gets a pass mark from me, the action sequences are almost as solid as ever enough and the pace hectic enough to demand enjoyment, even if by comparison you know that they are merely going through the motions by now.The humour is there but you have to look a bit harder to sift the good jokes out of the flat and bland ones - the Leo / Butters dynamic was supposed to be hilarious... at least I think it was - there is one good freeway chase, one good hand to hand combat scene where Jet Li finally gets to show how much better he is than any of the good guys and the final shootout and fight is OK.I would've been happy if it had of ended when the bad guy died - but noooooo - they had to force in an indulgent 'everyone loves each other' montage that spilled over into the cast and crew. Maybe as a DVD extra guys, but a sappy way to close out a 4 film series where most of the fun was found in potty talk and head counts.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Lethal Weapon had a strong enough formula that even the duds were OK, this pales in comparison to 1 and 2, but if it's on late night TV I'd probably find myself hanging around till the end, at least the logical end before the mutual back-slapping parade.

Dang, the movie just went on and on and on&#x85;Upon seeing this again in order to review and finish off my four Lethal Weapon reviews, I have three additional complaints #4 It spent far too long at the precinct. #5 Chris Rock seemed like he was sooo thrilled to be in the dying, now-defunct series that he smiled throughout every screen shot &#x96; even when it was an either serious scene or didn't call for a grinning performance. And (#6) the never-ending subliminal messages about peace/love/harmony. But that's any of the Lethal Weapons.That all said&#x85;I actually enjoyed myself this time. I let it all go and enjoyed the sometimes few/far-between action segments. The comedy was still fun. The chase and fight scenes were well crafted (aside, again, from the stand-in fake-Mel) and entertaining.Sure, I got all the same feelings (I mentioned above) but, leaving my brain at the door, I could find fun in the group's final adventure. Absolutely, it's not the best one - #2 still holds that crown &#x96; but it's, surprisingly, slightly more entertaining than the third installment that I loved growing up.To sum up the weak plot (no one, including myself, watched these movies for that) the old gang investigates an illegal human-smuggling trade while they deal with getting outdated alongside two secondary characters are pregnant and two separate Asian families are trying to escape in America.Wow.. that took about 8 seconds to sum up the movie. Again, we watch these for the improvising dialogue, the humor and the non-stop action &#x96; when it finds its way on screen, that is.It was a good closing to the series &#x96; though you might want to literally turn off the film when Riggs (Mel Gibson) fights off Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li.) Quite frankly, you will have another 20+ minutes of fluff and additional and unnecessary endings following. Not to mention a horrid closing credits song written specifically for Rodney King.

Lethal Weapon 4 is a disappointment, more disappointing than Lethal Weapon 3 but still in my mind a decent action flick.This time the story which is confusing has something to do with China bringing the four fathers of crime to the U.S. while other Chinese people are trying to buy them back with counterfeit money. Now that's the worst part of the movie. It seems so out of place for a Lethal Weapon movie.All the original characters are back. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are still in top shape as Riggs and Murtaugh. Joe Pesci plays Leo Getz again. I like that he does more than he did in Lethal Weapon 3. He's still a funny character. Rene Russo plays Lorna Cole who now has Gibson's baby and is thinking about marriage. They are all good. And it's really good to see them again.Here's the new. Every Lethal Weapon movie has its new character. This time it's comedian Chris Rock. He's a pretty good addition. My favorite scene with him is when he talks with Pesci about phones and how the companies screw with you. It's funny. Jet Li plays the villain. He's a better villain than the one from Lethal Weapon 3. They are pretty good additions.It's well done with the best part a freeway chase that involves a mobile home and a sheet of plastic that drags Gibson along the road. But the movie is too light. This is supposed to be an action movie, but it feels like a comedy with action scenes. The villains aren't that interesting. The ending where everybody is taking a picture and says we're family! is really cheesy and didn't fit.What's great is Richard Donner is also back. He's great at action scenes which make them work. But this movie feels like everything's there. The cast and crew must had a good time.

I'm sorry, but it does. I consider myself to be a fan of the Lethal Weapon franchise, too, sans the fourth installment. In my opinion, it just lost sight of what made the other movies good.The biggest problem I had with the movie is what they did to Mel Gibson's character, Martin Riggs. Martin Riggs was one of the cinema's biggest badasses, that is until this movie got a hold of him. I realize people get old, and maybe they were wanting to try to be realistic but to have Riggs not be able to hold his own in the police boxing ring against a younger opponent and to fake an injury to get out of fighting the guy was just sad. Combine that with him running out of breath while trying to catch the bad guy, etc. It was just too much! No one wants to see their heroes not be able to do what they did best anymore. They should've done what Stallone did in both Rocky Balboa and Rambo, be older and still be badasses. Granted, those movies came out after Lethal Weapon 4 but they could've done the same thing. I mean, even John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard was still a badass, why couldn't Martin Riggs have been? I also hated the Jet Li character. I think he was totally unrealistic, particularly at the end where he's fighting both Riggs and Murtaugh two-on-one and gets a rod shoved through his midsection and he's still putting up a fight. Yeah, right! I don't care how much of a Kung Fu master you are, you're not going to be packing much of a punch after you're stabbed through the stomach with a rod. That's not to say that other unrealistic stuff hasn't happened in the series, but I just thought to expect the audience to buy that was asking us to suspend our disbelief just a little too much!Chris Rock's character was also horribly annoying, as is Chris Rock himself. I hate that they tied him in with the franchise because if they ever decided to make another Lethal Weapon which probably isn't likely to happen, they'd have to tie him in, or otherwise make some excuse for his absence&#x85;it's just no good.I like to pretend as if the fourth film doesn't even exist. I won't watch it, I don't own it. I wouldn't recommend for anyone else to either. Do yourself a favor, stick with the first three films and you'll be just fine. They're actually good!

But Donner in the past has rubbed our noses in his liberal guilt and it does seem a little disturbing that in this movie not only does he make comic figures out of a large number of Chinese but he also extracts an appalling performance from Mr C.Rock - clearly the newest cool black dude on the block - who mugs and shrieks his way through the movie in a manner reminiscent of a foul - mouthed Eddie Rochester Anderson. Messrs Gibson and Glover go through their over - familiar schtick with the look of men condemned to repeat it for ever. They shout,roll their eyes and gabble so quickly I had difficulty in making out some of what they were saying. Their performances reek of sheer desperation as they can clearly see the series hitting the buffers just a little way down the line.

Murtaugh hadn't been pensioned off yet ?! Especially after 6 years of the last movie where he was having days before leaving the force for good ! In fact the answer to this question, whatever silly it may be, is what this movie was based on! This is the same of the past. So nothing was special or new. To be fair, there was Mel Gibson's short hair, Jet Li's martial arts, and the one and only Mr. Chris Rock!! Don't cast Chris Rock in a Lethal Weapon movie, or rather any movie, again ! that was a remake I wrote about the movie right after watching it back in 1998. It's still the same by the way! He's unbearable, boring and I don't know how to cast him as a police officer in the first place ??!! I remember how the routine he did about the old telephone with (Joe Pecsi) was the lowest bottom the whole 4 movies hit. All of my friends, who watched it with me at the theater, agreed that at this point we all wanted to change the channel ! Notice well the way (Gibson) says Hi Gaaaang to the evil guys near the end to understand how nothing was taken seriously this round. This is the first LW movie where Murtaugh's hair is all black ?! Simply to make you forget about the unspoken matter of retirement! The action wasn't that good, maybe Li's fighting only. The whole sequence of the car chase was nothing compared to the action that these movies used to deliver, like for instance the chase of part 3, which I expected something better than it, or at least as good. Furthermore, the final battle began so clumsy, then ended up as extremely violent.. I hated both its parts.Anyhow, the plot was nice, as well as the theme of We're not getting' too old for this s**t!. The shot in which the leads' car jumps into a building to land safely without harming anybody or anything sure is the most cartoonish moment in the series, and I like it. I loved the music. However it made me reminisce about the last 3 movies more than expressing any memorable scene in this installment, except the what took you so long?! scene which I see it as the best one here. Well, overall there was fun. But not for long! At one TV interview, in 2004 I think, one interviewer asked Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon 5 what would.. to have the last interrupting him to assure decisively There will not be Lethal Weapon 5!. To tell you the truth I felt happy. And I felt that they didn't like working in this one at all. The ending was still being written while the movie was in production (!). I didn't see anything they added in this one. And I didn't see something it added to anyone was in it! The musical finale, of the movie and the whole series, did give this one some necessity. It was a good goodbye. But it doesn't need a whole movie to say it though!

It was great to see Rene Russo return as Riggs' (now pregnant) girlfriend Lorna Cole and Joe Pesci is once again back as the loudmouthed Leo Getz who is now trying is hand at private investigations. Chris Rock is brought in to play Sgt. Butters and provides a comic element unsurpassed in the previous movies and his interactions with Leo Getz really shine out as the comic highlight of &#145;Lethal Weapon 4'. Generally the cast is as strong as any previous LW movie despite Russo now being no more than a bit-part actress and the script being of rather low quality.The action sequences are generally dull though there are a couple of good martial arts displays from Jet Li and a couple of good gun battles. The (now) obligatory car chase scene added nothing really different from the previous car chases of the series and, although entertaining in parts, fails to add any real excitement to the movie. &#145;Lethal Weapon 4' suffers badly from a feebly written screenplay which features numerous events that have no bearing on the story and seem tacked on just to make the movie last longer.&#145;Lethal Weapon 4' lacks the quality of the previous three movies and it's rather a shame that this great series is to end on such a bum note. The only real accomplishment is how the intricate character of Riggs is now fully developed from his roots in the first movie. The way Riggs has slowly calmed down and become less reckless over the four movies is a quite nice gradual contrast from the suicidal and possibly psychotic Riggs we met in the first movie. This movie is worth watching for &#145;Lethal Weapon' fans and maybe for general action fans but is certainly not the best of the series. The `magic' seems to have fizzled out as this movies adds little new to the series and we are left with a barely average action/comedy movie. My rating for &#145;Lethal Weapon 4' &#150; 6/10.

Later on, Murtaugh discovers the horrible truth Lee impregnated his daughter and is intending to make a life with her while Riggs must contend with the fact that he's getting older & is no longer the invincible super-cop he once was, as well as make peace with the memory of his late wife before he can really embrace the family that he is about to have with Lorna.Gibson & Glover have always played well off each other, but their chemistry cannot mask the inherent weakness of the script's story, despite some honest attempts to imbue Riggs with more human dimensions, nor can it mask the sloppy editing in certain action sequences (it doesn't take an eagle eye to spot an obvious stunt double for Mel Gibson in some of the scenes with Jet Li). Pesci's presence is always more of a hindrance than a help, despite the lame attempt to have him be semi-important to the plot, because outside of that he serves no real purpose other than to be loud & spew motor mouth profanity, same as Chris Rock, whose only real purpose is to be Chris Rock and to see if he can out-cuss Pesci.

In recent years, he's sharpened his acting skills a bit, knowing when to be Chris Rock the Comedian and Chris Rock the actor. That wasn't the case back when this movie came out. I didn't find him even partially convincing as a police detective, and found him to be much more annoying than funny. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover still had the great chemistry, but they seemed more concerned with being an Abbott-and-Costello-type comedy team than being Riggs and Murtaugh.

Basically L.A.P.D. officer partners Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are still fighting crime, despite feeling a little old, and their friend Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) has become a private eye. Their new assignment is to stop the illegal business and dealings being carried out by the Chinese Triads, in particular with Chinatown mob boss Benny 'Uncle Benny' Chan (Kim Chan), although it is actually Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) to worry about. Besides being promoted to the rank of Captains, Martin is looking forward to partner Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) giving birth to their child, and Roger is worrying about his daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) giving birth herself, and he doesn't know who the father is. Helping Martin and Roger in the investigation, and having little digs at Leo when they can, is Sergeant Lee Butters (Chris Rock), who is the father of Rianne's baby, oh, and some Chinese people are hiding in Roger's house. After many chases on the highway and stuff, some gun play and maybe an explosion or two, it all comes to a head in a warehouse, and a martial arts fight with Wah Sing Ku. In the end, Martin and Leo rush to see Lorna giving birth, and she does, and Lee and Roger go to see the other newborn as well, and they all pose for a group photo. Also starring Steve Kahan as Captain Murphy and Darlene Love as Trish Murtaugh. Just like the second and third films Gibson and Glover are still fun, Pesci still gets annoying but funny moments, rising stars Rock and Li stick out, and with the big chase it's not a bad action comedy thriller. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching! "}]
