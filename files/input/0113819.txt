[{"Title":"Mighty Aphrodite","Date":"22 March 2000","Score":"41 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  Hot on the high-heels of Showgirls comes Woody Allen's latest film, Mighty Aphrodite, named after the Greek goddess of love, another American film trying to interrogate the questionable mentality and dubious spirituality of the skin trade. A lot will probably be made of the fact that, not satisfied with merely pointing out classical references in his text, Allen decided to have a whole Greek Chorus (consisting of F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis, David Ogden Stiers and Jack Warden) filmed in an ancient outdoor amphitheater in Taormina, Italy (wearing masks, no less, in a nod to classical authenticity) and genuflect on the alter of genuine myth to underscore the tragic and comedic parts of his film. It doesn't matter how well- versed you are in the Greeks, you'll be able to enjoy what Allen has done with his approach, which is a very refreshing idea for film (bringing it all back home) and also a great surreal scaffold for the situation he presents. Purists be warned. Allen (Now 60 years old, but trying to play his role like he's not a day over 40) and Helena Bonham- Carter (29 years old) are happily married when one day Bonham-Carter's biological clock goes off and she wants to have a baby immediately. Allen hesitates so much at the thought of pregnancy that Bonham- Carter, who really can't wait, says, fine, let's adopt, then, which of course hits the raw nerve of Allen's masculinity as he defends his genes against the idea of having someone else's child join their family.Allen's character in this film is a sportswriter, adding another tough layer to his never-ending quiche of a meditation/angst-ridden search for definitive masculinity. Every scene where Allen suffers some sort of gender-related torment is set in a male arena When he's fighting on the phone with Bonham-Carter about the decision to adopt, the backdrop is a boxing club with every ring filled with sparring partners. Another scene where he contemplates his situation shows him pacing back and forth on the sidelines watching the New York Giants scrimmage in the Meadowlands.The couple finally decide to adopt a boy, and in one scene in particular I realized just how much Allen is stuck in a zeitgeist rut. In their uptown apartment Allen and Bonham-Carter bandy names back and forth for the new little tike as Allen, forever the cultural namedropper, comes up with the monikers of all of his heroes Django, Groucho, Thelonius. Bonham-Carter is oblivious to his suggestions as she coddles the baby and suddenly you realize that Allen should have made this film years ago, because the conversation sounds like something that was written for what would have been the sequel to Annie Hall. Now that he's twenty years removed from the carefree days of dynamic dialogue with Diane Keaton and the spark she brought as Allen's main female foil, Bonham-Carter seems unsure of herself, treating Allen as obligatorily as a father or uncle rather than her husband. Enter the plot.Bonham-Carter is being chased by Peter Weller (48 years old), a seductively sleazy art gallery owner, which sends Allen's mid-life crisis into an absolute tailspin as he begins wondering if he's really happy with his wife, and as he's looking at his newly adopted son he wonders aloud what the mother of his adopted child is like. Enter Cassandra and...you get the picture.One of the things I realized while watching Mighty Aphrodite is that Allen has spent a good portion of his career in film flagellating himself for not being the American Ingmar Bergman, when all the time he should have been luxuriating in the fact that he's the American Federico Fellini He has an uncanny sense for seeking out ripe minor actors, ready to be picked, and then letting them find the aspect of the character they're playing that makes them Characters rather than just parts played by actors. Even though I feel as if Bonham-Carter is not given nearly enough room to fully flesh out her character (which is a shame for an actress of her caliber), the film is really about Linda, the real mother of Allen and Bonham-Carter's adopted child, who turns out to be a ditzy porn star overflowing with spunk and zeal.Linda, played by Mira Sorvino (Quiz Show, Barcelona), Paul Sorvino's daughter, steals the film. Allen has tempted fate and defied the Greek Chorus' warnings by seeking out Linda, but since she's in the skin trade he arranges to meet her at her apartment in the guise of being merely a john. When Allen's reticence at wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am sex gets the better of him, he finally shows the age and mindset that he really is and turns into a grandfather before your very eyes.But, Linda is a ditz first and a hooker second in that she understands her victimization but also begins to realize that her situation is only as hopeless as her innate tenacity is boundless. In the most delicate scene in the film, and maybe the most poignant scene I've seen all year, Sorvino is in her bathtub-sized kitchen trying to defend her life to Allen, and as she keeps talking she realizes her own complicity until she finally mentions that she even had a baby once that she gave up for adoption. Allen gives her this scene by not entering the frame for what seems like a full minute. The direction in this scene alone, in Linda's chessily decorated flat complete with clocks of pigs in heat, shows just how gifted Allen is at being able to take an obscure actress, give her a two-dimensional role and have her find the heart and soul of the film on her own.Leave it to Woody Allen to deliver a film that is fascinating on many levels and is as beautifully structured as anything you're likely to see all year. I don't believe it's Best Picture material, but it does show a very strong return to form for Allen, no matter how unsure he is of reentering the war between the sexes.

Woody Allen's material can lend itself to similar critique.  Mighty Aphrodite has a superb balance between sophistication and corn.The Greek chorus idea is very well used, both at a sophisticated level - the film is essentially a modernised Greek drama - and at a corn level (when the chorus morphed into a more Broadway-style chorus Janie avoided the cheese by going into the kitchen and uncorking the wine). The Greek myth theme is well done throughout - I loved the appeal to Zeus especially.  Also the deus ex machina resolution was terrific fun, although I think not entirely original (I believe it was Cocteau who previously used the helicopter as a visual deus ex machina).  Fine performances - Mira Sorvino is a super tart with a heart.  Even Helena Bonham Carter is more effectively used in this film than in her standard Merchant Ivory roles, although I thought she lacked chemistry with Woody.  Good also to see F Murray Abraham as the leader of the chorus - why do we see so little of him these days?I'm a fan of Woody, but he has been patchy in the last 10 years or so.  With this one, he really was in sparkling form.  Well worth seeing.

And if suddenly I feel I am getting too serious here, let's just say that this is a very funny film.By now there is no escaping the fact that Woody Allen's films are largely autobiographical in that he uses what is happening in his own life to fuel his storylines.  For an audience this is sometimes only apparent in hindsight as the tabloids are quick to exploit Woody's foibiles.  But he beats us to it, and for that reason Mighty Aphrodite deals us a killer blow - it is very, very funny but in dealing with adoption, children and in marriages on the verge it is also very moving.  I laughed till I cried (the juxtaposition of the Greek chorus with the contemporaneous is a brilliant device) and finally I just cried.As to the movie itself, it is beautifully photographed and brilliantly edited (and with some inspired choreography) and acted to the highest order (Helena Bonham-Carter standing in for Mia Farrow just as well as Kenneth Branagh stood in for the Woodmeister in Celebrity - and how incestuous can we get here).  But the final word has to go to Mira Sorvino who is funny, touching and inspired.  Sometimes (not often) the Academy gets it right and her Oscar was one of their finest hours.

Great plot device, which shows  what Allen can do when he casts his mind wider than people  chatting around restaurant tables or at parties.Interesting to see how Allen has developed as regards sexual frankness and the use of four letter words. Strangely he is returning to the device of being sexually inept (something he had been moving away from) to gain extra laughs.For once he gives the best lines to someone else - and in Sorvino we have a great comedienne A really touching and funny performance. Another Oscar that an actor/actress would never have otherwise got without the magic pen of Woody - no wonder the guy is so loved in the business!Away from the main comedy the thing bumbles along. Wife Helena Boham-Carter is not faithful and they argue a lot. The usual hypocrisies, double standards and manners are displayed (for a WA film), but they don't stop the film as they do elsewhere. The Greek chorus asides - are actually fantastically funny and a real piece of comic invention.Thankfully we have a something to do and somewhere to go here, it isn't just people whining about their lives. Allen wants to improve the life of the hooker-come-porn-star and suggests hairdressing and teaming up with a half-wit boxer (who he met through his job as a sports writer) he thinks she will like. A very entertaining film and it is good to see that Allen can write funny lines for women - which I thought he was incapable of. Recommended.

The supporting cast is one of the best ever assembled, and heading this supporting cast is the breakout performance of the century.  Mira Sorvino as Linda Ash has to be one of the greatest comedic performances in the history of film.  She is charming, and sweet, and everything you would never expect a New York hooker and porn star to be.  She creates Linda Ash from lines and direction that could go either way.  She could have chosen to make this character a hardened, tough city chick.  Instead, she went a completely different route of innocence despite sexual experience and naivete in the face of New York attitude, and it won her a well-deserved Oscar.  She is also just as delightful and funny as she is touching and poignant.  See this movie, even if it is only for Sorvino's performance, ignoring the incredible and novel script, the presence of Helena Bonham Carter and other actors of her caliber, and the fact that this could rival Annie Hall for best Woody Allen film.

You know the Greek chorus, chiming in at those moments when drama might need a little heightening, and if needed adding some unintentional humor to the process of a story like Antigone (actually, it's not a very funny story, but besides the point). Woody Allen combines with a fair amount of his usual wit a film that plays upon the big moral quandaries that are juxtaposed by a it's own built-in audience within the story; occasionally, one of the Greek chorus members (F. Murray Abraham especially, in one of his funniest roles) comes directly to Woody's character telling him 'what are you doing?' in a scene of near-classic Woody-nervousness comedy. It almost leans on becoming a little too goofy to deal with, as the story itself should have enough weight on its own to go without a sidebar of fantasy. But it does help garner some big laughs; where else will you see Zeus with his answering machine on? Woody Allen plays the aforementioned sports writer, who's married to a preoccupied art curator (Helena Bonham Carter), and together with her has an adopted son. He starts to get curious about where his son originally came from, as he seems very bright and an above average kid even at the age of five. After some prodding and searching, he comes upon the mother Leslie, aka Linda St. James, aka Lucy C** (Mira Sorvino, in a somewhat deserving Oscar turn). A prostitute and sometimes porno actress, she soon goes under Woody's character as a new woman, breaking away- slowly and with some trouble with her business manager- into a normal life. Although Allen does go to some lengths to make Linda, and even Carter's character, pretty well-rounded characters, he himself sort of stays in a narrow role as either the usual Woody nebbish with many a quick wisecrack (i.e. first meeting Linda at her apartment, surrounded by a screwing pig clock and cacti with genitalia, and his run-in with her 'manager' at a seedy bar), or as the surrogate match-maker for Linda to go on with a new life with a new man.A lot of this leads to funny scenes, not least of which surrounding what is in the subtext rather sad, of the situation of how she gave up her son for adoption and that it's never said outright what the truth is about Woody showing up to her, and there's somehow through what is potentially troublesome material some laugh-out-loud scenes. A scene that is meant, conventionally, just for character development like at the race track where Linda bets on the Eager Beaver is a riot, as well as the arranging of the first date with her and Michael Rappaport's dim-witted farmer/boxer. And Allen even attempts for a wallop of whimsy at the end when irony is piled up high, and everyone is seen, simply put, being in a level of bliss with their respective lot in life. If it isn't totally focused as a better Woody Allen picture, it may be because it works a little better when around the Allen/Sorvino connection, as opposed to the whole side-story involving him and his wife, which could be picked out from any random Woody Allen movie (and not necessarily a very involving side-story either).There's a good few laughs, a couple of brilliant zingers, and better than average performances turned in. Like Bullets Over Broadway it's a successful attempt at presenting dramatic subject matter in a light-hearted fashion, if not as deep or layered as the former.

Amanda decides she wants a child but can't afford to take a year away from her art gallery projects, so they adopt.  Over the years the child strengthens their marriage and turns out to be incredibly clever and gifted.  Curious about his parents Lenny sets out to find Max's mother (understanding the father to be dead).  Expecting her to be intelligent he is surprised to locate a hooker who aspires to make it to Broadway and is working her way their in adult movies.  He tries to get to know her and seeks to better her lot in life by getting her out of the game so that his son won't grow up to locate his mother to find she is an aging porn star.  This causes tensions between Lenny and Linda but also at home as the cracks in his marriage begin to show.Woody Allen's films do tend to be similar if not the same &#150; certainly the last few years have seen him return to a regular light comedy style (I'm not complaining).  However they potentially could be all the same.  Here he cleverly mixes Greek tragedy into the story to make it sufficiently different.  The story is certainly different, with a hooker taking center stage, however Allen's trade mark wit is still very much on show.  The Greek chorus line is merely a different way of delivering his usual one liners and funny observations and doesn't distract at all.  It's very straight forward, but the Greek touch makes it feel fresh and new.Woody Allen is as good as ever &#150; he maybe looks a bit old, but he's so good at what he does that after 5 minutes it doesn't matter.  Sorvino is excellent in a daffy role &#150; it's not the sort of role usually rewarded by awards but she deserved the Oscar for a funny performance.  Bonham-Carter is not very good as an `Noo Yorka' girl but luckily she has little screen time.  The support cast is full of quality and lots of well known (if not famous) faces in small roles, F Abraham Murray is the head of the chorus line but the support includes Peter Weller, Jack Warner, Tony Siricio (Soprano's Paulie), Michael Rapaport, Paul Giamatti &#150; the list goes on.Overall this is yet another quality product from Woody Allen, it's hardly ground breaking stuff but when someone can be consistently this good year after year then you've got to give him his dues.

Allen's character's efforts sense of what happier direction the prostitute's life could take and his efforts to reform her, are also  exactly what most of us would do if we discovered that she was the biological mother of our adopted child. Allen has such imagination - and such an understanding of how people of varying education and background, talk and move, and what they care about.I did feel the subplot involving Helena Bonham-Carter, her career and Peter Weller, was less imaginative, less interesting. I've always had trouble warming to Bonham-Carter - perhaps it's just how unlikeable virtually all her roles have been - and this role didn't help. Mira Sorvino's character sounds amusingly like Victoria Jackson from Saturday Night Live - her figure is so eye-popping, and her sweetness so endearing that she definitely is the memorable character for anyone who sees the movie. Oh, that's the one with Mira Sorvino is undoubtedly how people would remember this movie. However, the Greek chorus was a wonderful idea - and Jack Warner in a small role as a blind seer, and F.

Story is about a sports writer named Lenny (Allen) who is married to Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter) and she works in an art gallery but their marriage is on the rocks so Amanda suggests they adopt a baby but Lenny at first says no. After they adopt a boy they name Max it takes no time for Lenny to change his mind. As Max grows Lenny is very curious about who left him for adoption and he starts snooping around until he tracks down Max's real mother. Turns out his real mother is Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino) who is a hooker and sometimes porno actress and Lenny sets up dates with her (No sex) and gets to know her better. He doesn't tell her that he has adopted her son and a friendship develops between the two. Meanwhile, Amanda is having an affair with Jerry (Peter Weller) and she moves out. Lenny tries to help Linda improve her life and sets up a date between her and a local boxer named Kevin (Michael Rapaport). During the course of this film Lenny talks to members of a Greek chorus who chant out what he should and should not do and sometimes they break into song! Three of the Greek chorus members are F. Murray Abraham, David Ogden Stiers and Olympia Dukakis. This is one of Allens funniest films in years and Sorvino steals the picture. I could listen to her talk that dialogue all day long. One of the many lines that stand out is when on a date with Rapaport she tells him she dated a pinball champion, but two guys strangled him! Sorvino appears on the surface to be just another kooky hooker but as the film develops we start to really care for her character and Sorvino adds just the right amount of charm and realism without forgetting the comedic elements of her role. One of the reasons the friendship between her and Allen works so well is because Sorvino displays her own sharp and quick wit to their spirited conversations. Allen has never used four letter words in his films but he does here and it seems appropriate with Linda's background and the violent pimp that Lenny goes to visit. The cinematographer is the great Carlo DiPalma and he's shot several of Allens films as well as Blowup. The colors are interesting in several shots and the color yellow is very prominent. The focus of the story is about Allens character tempting fate by intruding in on Linda's life and trying to change it. This is clearly one of Allens best films and Sorvino is just terrific in a career making performance.

Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style.In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs.All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding.

Allen was hilarious trying to resist Sorvino's advances in their first scene together. Not to let us forget that we are in the realm of Greek tra-medy, Allen employs the characters from Greek mythology who comment on and even participate in the events. Among then, the blind seer Tiresias who can see the developing problems in Lenny's marriage better than Lenny himself, Miss Party Pooper, Cassandra who was cursed to always predict the truth but no one would ever believe her, and the ancient chorus whose leader (Murray Abraham) desperately tries to stop Lenny from finding the truth by begging him in the best traditions of Greek tragedy, Lenny please don't be a schmuck! ) "},{"Title":"Warm & Fuzzy","Date":"29 March 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  I liked this film a lot.

Essentially a tale of a failing marriage, Allen frames it as a textbook Greek tragedy, complete with masked chorus and deus-ex-machina. To prevent this from being one long joke that outstays its welcome, he structures the movie brilliantly so that it becomes funnier as it goes along. It is a superb piece of writing, shot through with hilarious one-liners and sight-gags.Allen always gets the very best as far as acting talent is concerned. Blink and you'll miss Paul Giamatti, Olympia Dukakis, Claire Bloom... Among those with more screen time are F Murray Abraham, Michael Rapaport, Jack Warden, Danielle Ferland. But the acting burden falls on Allen himself, Helena Bonham Carter and Mira Sorvino. Allen is, as ever, endearing and irritating in equal measure. I think he knows that about his screen persona and mines it effectively here. Bonham Carter is an excellent foil for him. I'm not a fan of hers but she really is very good here, both vulnerable and pushy. But it's Sorvino, in an Oscar-winning turn, who steals the movie as a warm-hearted prostitute with whom Allen gets involved. The trope of the man who has mixed motives for trying to reform a sex worker is familiar from RAIN (Joan Crawford in 1932) aka MISS SADIE THOMPSON (Rita Hayworth in 1953) and also from NEVER ON Sunday (1960). Allen's take on it is pretty compassionate, creating a wonderful role in Linda Ash, she of many aliases. Sorvino does him proud.Having said that, sexual politics are not Allen's strong point. In his movies the women are more often the problem than the solution. This is true as long ago as Meryl Streep in MANHATTAN through to Rachel McAdams in MIDNIGHT IN Paris. Exceptions that prove the rule are Mia Farrow in ZELIG and Samantha Morton in SWEET AND LOWDOWN.Here, though, Allen gives his character a harder time than usual. This contributes to making MIGHTY APHRODITE more than just one of his comedy fantasies (like LOVE AND DEATH, for example). Visually it's one of Allen's flatter movies - straightforward, unflashy, even a little dull. But the screenplay and the performances more than make up for that.

The film does get a shot in the arm about 30 minutes after its start from the introduction of Mira Sorvino, who gives a knockout-breakout performance (and is also a knockout herself, in the more traditional sense of the word!).

There are a few shortcomings here and there, the film does lose its momentum at times, there is a lack of chemistry between Allen and Helena Bonham-Carter, Bonham-Carter is a little stiff with an accent that can falter and while the Greek chorus is a great idea and are a lot of fun and at least serve a purpose sometimes it did feel like they were being overused. However, Mighty Aphrodite is a beautiful film to look at with sumptuous settings and cinematography and fitting costumes(apart from the slightly dishcloth-like ones for the Greek Chorus), not surprising as nearly all Allen's films are very well-made with some having some interesting images. The music is also very catchy while the script- very Woody Allen in style- is snappy and has a perfect balance of bawdy comedy that provides a lot of laughs and tragic drama which gives the film heart and poignancy. The story does a very good job at this also, it's fun and good-natured but it doesn't undermine the tragedy one bit. And it does fine with developing its characters who are neurotic(a deliberate choice that is often done by Allen, anyone who has seen an Allen film before should have no problem with this) but real and well-rounded. Woody Allen directs assuredly and gives a performance that shows great comic timing and is somewhat charming.

A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path.With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of reality (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here.Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing.If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F.

This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin.The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack.

One day, over dinner with friends, Lenny's wife says she would love to adopt a baby. What a surprise! Lenny is given no time to warm up to the idea, as a baby boy is soon offered to the couple. They do it, they adopt the little guy and name him Max. As Max grows, it is obvious that he is a brilliant and very lovable kid. This gets Lenny to thinking....what are Max's true parents like? They must also be very bright, no? As it was a closed-record adoption, Lenny must break laws to discover Max's lineage. Eventually, he learns the name and whereabouts of Max's mother. But, oh, what a discovery. Linda (Mira Sorvino) is a hooker and an occasional porn star, and most important, she is as thick as a brick. Yet, her beauty and loving personality draws Lenny to her, to the point that they become close friends. Suddenly, Lenny wants to find Linda a nice husband and get her out of the call girl business. Any takers? This is a great film, with great being an almost insufficient word. The plot and script are ingenious, as clever lines abound everywhere and the use of a Greek chorus to further the story along is amazingly successful. Then, too, the cast is superb, with Allen giving one of his best performances, and Sorvino perfection itself as the dense but lovely hooker. Bonham Carter, Olympia Dukakis, F. Murray Abraham and others are on hand to delight us, too. The production is first rate, with fetching costumes, sets, and New York City scenery. Needless to say, Allen's direction is wonderful as well. There is a bit of rough language and sexual conversation, in a few spots, so do take note, if this is important to you. But, Mighty Aphrodite is one of Allen's best and funniest works indeed. If you want to perk yourself up with some mighty big laughs and a sweet story, to boot, get this one before the sun goes down.

Luckily, 1995's Mighty Aphrodite is the former. Starring Allen in fine form and a worthy Oscar winning performance by Mira Sorvino, this film is a light hearted, fun story with some nice analysis of life.Lenny (Allen) and Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter) are a happily married couple who want to move their relationship up a notch. Wanting a child, Amanda convinces Lenny to adopt so that she needn't go through pregnancy. Eventually however, a curiosity pops up in Lenny's mind and he finds himself searching out for his son's biological mother (Sorvino).Arguably Allen's finest film since 1977's Annie Hall, this directorial, written and acted performance by Allen is hilarious, witty and superb. Playing his usual neurotic self, Allen comes out with some superb lines as he attempts to make a better life for the mother of his adopted child. Combining observational lines with jokes and the occasional slapstick, he paints a clever portrait of a man with an obsession to make a friends life better.Alongside Allen, the true star of this film is Mira Sorvino. In her finest performance, Sorvino is perfect as the squeaky voiced prostitute and porn star who wants to be an actress with a family. Combining a sense of hopelessness with dizziness, Sorvino gives a justifiably Oscar winning performance.As well as some superb acting, the best part about this film is the usage of Greek tragedy as a form of commentary. Lead by F. Murray Abraham, the Greek performers are all singing, all dancing, comedy in a can as they beg for Allen to be careful before eventually singing about a wonderful life.Mighty Aphrodite is a superb story about two friends who grow closer as one attempts to improve the others life. With brilliant performances by Allen in front of and behind the camera, and an Oscar winning performance by Sorvino, this film makes us feel good about life and makes us laugh. Allen's finest since Annie Hall (1977) and definitely in his top five of all time. Well worth a watch. "},{"Title":"Mira Sorvino.

Of course, Sorvino is a hooker and glorified porn star.  Allen's screenplay is humorous and insightful, but some elements of this film just do not work (the Greek Choir in particular).  The direction also appears misguided and a good ensemble cast seems wasted at times.  Olympia Dukakis, F. Murray Abraham, and Peter Weller all just fill up dead time in the venture.

It's a delightful and enjoyable film, but it doesn't seem to add up to much. When you compare it to his extensive filmography it wouldn't even land in the top half of his best work because it's far from being memorable. He's directed so many movies that several of them feel incredibly familiar and for that reason they are easy to forget. He repeats several of the same themes throughout his movies and Mighty Aphrodite isn't the exception, especially putting a lot of emphasis on love and infidelity which are recurring themes in Allen's films. At times his films stand out for simply capturing these human emotions in a new way, and at others they do thanks to a particularly strong performance. In this case it was Mira Sorvino's supportive performance as Linda Ash that garnered all the attention playing a hooker who isn't all that right in the head. The way she delivered her lines with her high-pitched voice contributed to the overall comedy of her character. If there is one thing that I will remember from this forgettable Allen film it's her Oscar winning performance. Despite her solid performance this is still one of the weakest Woody Allen movies I've seen.In Mighty Aphrodite Woody Allen plays Lenny, a sportswriter, who is married to Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter). In order to spark some life into their monotonous relationship they decide to adopt a son who they name Max. After several years Lenny is surprised to discover that Max is such a brilliant kid and so he decides to search for his biological parents convinced that they must have great genes. He visits the adoption agency and is denied the files, but his curiosity gets the best of him and he finds a way to steal them. He tracks down the biological mother only to discover that she is a prostitute who is now going by the name of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino). Lenny sets up an appointment with her and is disappointed that she ended up being so dumb. Concerned with her lifestyle, Lenny tries to help Linda by reforming her and setting her up with some respectable man. Meanwhile, Lenny and Amanda are going through some marital problems of their own. The narrative is linked with a bizarre Greek chorus (led by F. Murray Abraham) that compares Lenny's story with the Greek tragedy Oedipus.Allen always delivers some witty dialogues and funny situations in his films which make them such an entertaining ride. Mighty Aphrodite has a few moments like this that work well, but as a whole it is a very forgettable movie. Allen plays once again a sort of neurotic character who is fascinated with discovering who his adopted son's mother really is. Sorvino's performance is brilliant and elevates the material, but there isn't more to it. Neither Allen nor Bonham Carter seem to stand out and their relationship isn't central to the film. The Greek chorus was far from interesting and only took away from the story by trying to hard to compare the modern tale with the Greek one. It's a light and corny film that is saved by Sorvino's presence and Allen's distinctive style of humor. http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Mighty Aphrodite Is A Delight To Watch","Date":"1 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F.

They have an adopted son, Max, who is so bright that Allan is compelled to seek out his birth mother and see if she, too, is as awesomely brainy -- perhaps a math professor or some kind of Nobel Prize winner or a descendant of Kandinsky.After much effort, kept secret from his wife, Allan finally locates her. She's Mira Sorvino --a tall, tasteless, shrill whore. Allen spends most of the rest of the movie trying to liberate her from her business agent, a skinhead with an earring, but after a while complications arise. Allan eventually tries her out, and his wife has a tentative encounter with their friend, Peter Weller, all of which is kind of familiar Allan territory.I'm beginning to find these plots a little tiresome because they're so repetitive. A knot of New York neurotics forms an unbalanced system of attractions, and the stuttering Allan is in the middle of it all.The stories now depend more on the jokes and one-liners and the particular quirks of the performers than they do on the plots. If there's anything innovative, this is where it's liable to be found.Actually this one has quite a bit of novelty slathered over it. There's no sex of course but Mira Sorvino gets off some surprisingly frank lines. And some of the expressions are as amusing as those we've come to expect from Woody Allan. He makes my stomach sick to my stomach. And this time around there's a Greek chorus that mixes epic poetry with Yiddishisms. The chorus does what the original Greek chorus did, commenting on the action, but sometimes the leader, F. Murray Abraham, emerges from the group and in garish makeup follows Allan around and scolds him. There are also multiple appearances by Cassandra. And Jack Warden makes a couple of delightful short appearances as Tiresias the Blind Prophet. After the chorus introduces him a couple of times using his long Homeric epithet Warden comes up with something like, Oh, cut the crap and just call me Tiresias. I don't know why the characters always eat Italian when they could be gorging themselves on plump Kalamata olives and taramasalata. And I suppose the title, Mighty Aphrodite, is meant to suggest that everything we value rests on loving it without too much questioning.The movie's good for a couple of laughs and a more or less constant smile. There's nothing dull about it. It's not a knockabout farce or anything though and, if there's a message at all, I suppose it's that we're not supposed to mess with McFate. Allan has a brilliant son and he ought to accept this gift of the gods without questioning it. I have an adopted son too and I have to beat him half senseless to get him to do his homework. Allan's lucky. But, come to think of it, maybe if I looked up my kid's birth mother, I'd find she was the Empress of Korea or something. Maybe there's a couple of bucks in it.

I know that many people think he's a film-making genius, but I've never been able to figure out why. Some of his movies are OK; most disappoint me. Mighty Aphrodite features pretty typical Woody Allen-style humour (which means that while I found this at time mildly amusing, I didn't find it outrageously funny) but I also found Woody's work here to be both less irritating and more normal than many of the routine, somewhat neurotic sex-obsessed characters he tends to play. Perhaps for that reason, I also found that I enjoyed Mighty Aphrodite more than I usually enjoy Woody's work. It features a pretty strong cast (F. Murray Abraham, Helena Bonham Carter, Mira Sorvino, Jack Warden and Olympia Dukakis among others) - a feature fairly typical of Woody movies - and in general they do a pretty good job with their parts.Here, Woody plays sportswriter Lenny. Lenny is married to Amanda (Carter), who wants to adopt a baby. Lenny objects but finally gives in. He falls in love with his son, and becomes obsessed with finding his birth mother, which leads him to Linda (Sorvino). It turns out that the boy's mother is a prostitute and sometime porn actress who desperately wants to go straight, and after a rather funny initial encounter, Lenny takes her under his wing so to speak and tries to help her move on in life. Woody's relationship with his female co-stars was strange. I didn't think he and Carter made at all a believable couple (I find it hard to find Woody believable with anyone in fact!) but somehow once she reappears after disappearing for the middle part of the movie they seemed more natural together, perhaps reflecting that both characters have had what might be called an epiphany experience, having strayed from their marriage. Woody's work with Sorvino was better, and Lenny's relationship with Linda was more developed (the central part of the movie actually) and I liked the somewhat paternal interest Lenny took in her (an interest not normally shown by Woody characters) although that made their eventual (and inevitable I suppose) sexual encounter more jarring. In the end things work out pretty well for everyone. Lenny and Amanda seem to get things back on track, and Linda ends up happy - although the end of her story is - to be honest - silly to the point of being totally unbelievable. Without revealing how it all works out, in the end the irony (as narrated by Abraham) seems appropriate to the story.That brief mention of Abraham perhaps gives reason to mention what (to me) was the most irritating part of the movie - the repeated scenes involving the Greek chorus at the temple (who eventually started popping up in the characters' real life situations.) It seemed to me to be a typical Woody device to make the movie seem - well - weird, which is often my reaction to Woody's movies, and to me it didn't at all help what was an otherwise pretty decent story, which I would give a 6/10 "},{"Title":"Sometimes funny and generally entertaining film","Date":"26 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" You have to like Woody Allen's sense of humor in order to enjoy this film.

Here Lenny Weinrib (Woody), a schlemiel of a sports reporter, and his wife, Amanda Sloan (Helena Bonham Carter made up and dressed like a Manhattanite aspiring to operate an art gallery of her own in fashionable lower Manhattan) decide, despite Lenny's initial resistance, to adopt a son because Amanda is too busy and self-involved to have a child the usual way. Eventually, mainly because his son is so smart and promising, Lenny sets out to find the birth mother who turns out to be a minor porn actress and full-time prostitute who goes by many names, chiefly Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino). Lenny's intentions toward Linda are non-sexual; he wants to probe her background. Meanwhile, Amanda drifts somewhat hesitantly into the arms of a New York sophisticate. Lenny receives the news from Blind Tiresias (superbly played by Jack Warden), a street beggar. Lenny thereupon has sex with Linda for the first and only time as a result of which she becomes pregnant with a girl. Afterwards, a repentant Amanda returns lovingly to Lenny and they resume a passionate relationship. Along the way, Lenny has tried unsuccessfully to match Linda with a stone-headed boxer who aspires to return to his brother's onion farm. Lenny tries in vain to conceal each one's background from the other, but it doesn't work. Eventually, Linda is rescued by a deus ex machina in the form of the pilot of a disabled helicopter that alights in a field alongside the highway which Linda is driving and she becomes a satisfied Connecticut housewife. Lenny and Linda encounter one another once on a shopping trip, he accompanied by her son and she wheeling a baby carriage with his daughter. The Greek chorus appears intermittently breaking occasionally into New York slang to superb effect. The chorus is led by F. Murray Abraham and includes Olympia Dukakis as Jocasta and other actors impersonating Cassandra and Oedipus. The film won a supporting actress award for Mira Sorvino and an Oscar for Woody for best screen play. The second of these awards was abundantly deserved. Mira is very funny as Linda but the award was something of a reach. This is one of Woody's funniest movies in many years. Though Woody plays his usual self, the film is highly original. Others have employed the Greek drama framework, of course, but no one has used it more productively. The scene between Lenny and Blind Tiresias is priceless, setting the denouement in motion. Try it. You'll like it.

It isn't up to him to direct down to your level. The movie doesn't meet standards of movie normalcy, and that will probably confuse and annoy those who aren't up to using their brains extensively while they enjoy a film.Woody Allen has become more challenging to watch as he matures, but as I get older and more observant I can find and enjoy more of the subtleties. When it seems like it's getting slow that just means he's setting you up for something grand. Mira Sorvino is good. Decent. But she isn't all that. She's great to look at. Is she the super-acting light in an otherwise dark cave of a movie? Absolutely not.Watch, listen. Enjoy! And remember, great movie makers are like great writers.

I'm not sure why--it's a lot of fun, and has a happy ending (a rarity in a Woody Allen comedy).  It contains some really rude humor, another rarity for a Woody film.  Mira Sorvino was wonderful and hilarious, but I'm not sure if her performance was worthy of an Oscar.  I suppose having a famous father helps.  The scene in her apartment, when she meets Woody for the first time, is classic Woody comedy.  After the build-up of her character and the little boy, and Woody's reaction to her when he meets her, is as funny as anything in his earlier wild era movies. The musical interludes were a little surprising, but a nice touch.  The music in the movie must have been a warm-up for his next effort.  Good supporting cast too--the only movie besides RoboCop that makes good use of Peter Weller's deadpan style.  This is one of my favorite Allen films of the '90s.

Basically, Allen plays a man looking for the mother of his adopted son, who turns out to be a prostitute played by Mira Sorvino in her best role ever. Woody's character, Lenny, is followed around by a Greek Chorus that comments on his predicament (a la Play it Again, Sam!).  In fact, the chorus really gives the movie glue - something that sets it apart from, say, Hollywood Ending.

A rather vulgar screenplay for the Woodman makes it all the more hilarious because he never looks like the type of person who would use four letter words.

The Greek chorus idea was used in one of Allen's earlier plays but is an hysterical device here,  almost acting out worst case scenerios of what might happen but never really do.

The opening tie-in to Sophocles sets the stage for the all the reversals that are to come. The Greek Chorus and their commentary on the action via Cole Porter tunes is in keeping with the lighthearted nature of the film, not to mention being wholly hysterical. Allen structures the film to have a two way commentary between the Greek world and the modern world, both of which serve to provide an interesting perspective on the plight of the characters. This is most especially evident when the Chorus cries out to Zeus only to get his answering machine.Jack Warden, a great character actor, is perfect as Tiresias, the blind seer.

Woody Allen has such an in depth understanding of human nature that he is able to excoriate it on a very comedic and intellectual level. 'Mighty Aphrodite' offers a many variety of laughs, from poking fun at ancient Greek plays to seeing Woody Allen acting out that neurotic horny little hypochondriac that we see him as in all of his films, which are nothing less then comedic brilliance. Allen's slapstick and famous one-liners make this movie a hilarious must see. I can't give all the success of the movie to Woody Allen, because it's Mira Sorvino's portrayal of the compassionate, hopeless hooker that provides the movie with much of its wit and humor.

Certain of Allen's experiments in Mighty Aphrodite, such as the Greek Chorus, just didn't work for me.  Woody's dialogue is always funny, but when it's delivered by twenty people at the same time in a shout it loses something.  The chorus only worked for me when the soloists interact with Woody on the screen.  Woody is his usual unimpeccable self on screen - almost every man can identify with him immediately.  I remember a poll in the late seventies or early eighties among American men asking them with which movie character or star they idenitified with the most, and it wasn't Redford, or Reynolds, or what later would have been Bruce Willis or Schwarzenegger - it was Woody.  He brings the common anxieties of men to the screen in unexpurgated form, never diluted.  I think one of the secrets of his success is that he explores his own anxieties and experiences very closely, and much of what you see is at least a bit biographical.  The attraction to hookers appears in any number of his more recent works, especially Deconstructing Harry, just like the attraction to young girls appeared in Manhattan years before Soon-Yi became a household name.Allen has also adopted any number of children, most when he was with Mia Farrow, and this is clearly him playing out his own little fantasy of traipsing into their backgrounds to find out who was the sensational Mom who gave birth to such wonderfully smart children.  In this case his character, Lenny, gets the bug when his wife begins ignoring him and his young adopted son continues to dazzle him.  His detective work leads him to Linda/Leslie/Judy Cum played by Mira Sorvino, a porn actress and hooker who gave the baby up out of financial difficulty and doesn't know who the father is.  Sorvino pulls off the most unusual feat as an actress with Linda - she is dumb, shrill, judgmental, with quick vindictive anger - while at the same time becoming increasingly more real, human, and sympathetic at the same time.  Her voice is art - it is grating and annoying but somehow we come to look forward to hearing it.  A lot of people have written that the voice was offputting; look, if you don't like Joey Lauren Adams because of her little girl voice, then Sorvino's Linda will have you climbing the walls.  Sorvino won an Oscar for the role, and in spite of the fact that the Oscars are just a high school popularity contest and the real winner is rarely the one who deserves it, this is a deserving performance.  Sorvino is a knockout.Allen is Allen as usual (good).  Helena Bonham Carter plays Allen's typecast New York City careerist wife like the rest(okay); Peter Weller stares at Carter unabashedly as her boss and lover.  Allen even manages to sprinkle in his usual cast of characters - the mobster, the dumb guy, and uses the Greek chorus as Lenny's confidante.  It has a touching and unusual ending - Allen almost always knows how to end his movies on the right note.  It doesn't rank with The Purple Rose of Cairo, or Hannah and Her Sisters, or Crimes and Misdemeanors, or Everyone Says I Love You, or Manhattan, or Annie Hall, or Radio Days, or any of the other of his best films, but it's still worth watching.  It ranks closer to Deconstructing Harry, or Zelig, or Broadway Danny Rose, or Bullets Over Broadway.  Allen is indisputably one of the greatest directors of American (or any other) cinema and a national treasure, in spite of his well publicized foibles, and this is a good Woody Allen movie.

It is true that this isn't his best work (that would be Annie Hall), but it's certainly shouldn't be regarded as a blip. Like most of Allen's best films, this one stars the man himself in the leading role. I'm a big fan of Woody Allen as an actor; he's certainly not very versatile, but the character he tends to play leaves a lot of room for some very funny comedy, and that is capitalised on in this film. The story follows Lenny (played by Woody Allen) and his wife (played by the usually magnificent Helen Bonham Carter, that has something of an 'off' day here) who adopt a child that turns out to be a genius. Somewhat because he is bored with wife, Lenny decides to hunt down his child's natural mother, only to find that she's a dumb prostitute called Linda. Hilarity ensues, and Woody eventually decides to help her; maybe because he doesn't want his child to find out that his biological mother is a hooker, or maybe for some other reason...As usual, this film features Woody's trademark wit. When Woody is good, he's real good, but when he isn't he can be annoying; but suffice to say, the majority of the jokes in this film work, and the ones that don't can easily be forgiven for the ones that do. It's familiar territory for Woody, a man that is more than familiar with light hearted comedy, but this movie is somewhat different to his others, as the story is intertwined with Greek tragedy, and he has employed a Greek chorus line to play along with what's happening on screen. This makes the film surreal and also rather silly and for that reason I didn't like it at first; but I got more attuned to it as the film went on. The story itself is a good one, and one that has ample opportunity for comedy; but it's the subtext of it that's most important. Many themes are intertwined within the central tale, such as the ills of disturbing a sleeping dog, curiosity killing the cat, and there also seems to be a commentary on environment affecting a child's development. Whether or not this is intentional, I don't know; but it's definitely there. Allen has also soaked the film in irony, and the ending is superb in that respect.Of the sixteen Woody Allen films that I've seen so far; this is one of the best. It's not perfect, and there's things in it that don't work; but the dry wit will have you laughing out loud at times, and if you like Woody's style; I cant see any reason not to like this.

But combined with his lack of genius, the end result is (except in the one case) not life-altering.One could take the time to tease out his interests at the time here Greek tragedy, there Russian expressionism, somewhere else noir. But that's just a parlour game.The interesting thinking about this film for me comes from considering Bonham-Carter. I think she is an intelligent actress, certainly in the top dozen to follow. I particularly look for situations where the director does not provide strong guidance, as I believe to be the case with her here. Then you can see what the actor creates for herself. Mira has the simple character here, literally and in terms of difficulty. In contrast, Ms Helena has a pretty tough space to fill -- and this must be done in the background, playing off of Woody.

The movie revolves around the comic antics that ensue when he attempts to turn the woman around and set her on the straight and narrow. The movie is much better than the reviews I read had led me to believe, with much of the old Allen gift for comic dialogue in evidence. It is certainly a better movie than Manhattan Murder Mystery, his prior effort, and in many ways reminds me of Broadway Danny Rose. The ending is - surprisingly - oddly touching and affecting in a bittersweet kind of way. I think this is one of Woody's better recent movies.One caveat; some of the humor of the movie involves parodying some of the conventions of classical Greek drama - the chorus, the masks, etc. etc. Knowing what 'deus ex machina' means really adds to the humor of one of the plot devices that helps to wrap up the story.

His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism It's worthwhile to carry on.This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart.Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device.As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly naïve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same come-on's and gimme-a-break's as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character.Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending.Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

Mira Sorvino is good, and lights up the screen, but... It's under-directed, some of the characters (eg. Allen's wife) struggle with the paucity of material, and sometimes it's just downright frivolous. This is a shame, because in some ways it reminds me of Crimes and Misdemeanors there's a married couple and there's a moral dilemma. But Crimes was much better than this, partly because Allen didn't take the weight of the acting so much on himself, and partly because it treated a serious subject with some seriousness.

You end up wondering what some guys in rags, prancing around some wasteground 2,000 years ago, have to do with 1995 Manhattan.  Well, they're pretending to be Woody's subconscious.  Don't pay them TOO much attention.  Just to spare everyone a little headache.Otherwise, excellent Sunday afternoon viewing.  Linda Ash (the prostitute) manages to upstage Woody's character, Lenny Weinrib, at nearly every turn. Allen continues his lifelong love affair with his native New York, and in keeping with the relaxing flavour of the film, a lot of less famous, but equally picturesque sections of the city are visible.  You can almost detect a sea-change happening to the city; it was filmed at around the time that Giulani's reforms started to turn New York around for the better.  'Mighty' is actually a feel good movie, but you don't get that nice, warm feeling until...well, watch the film, I can't give too much away!His characters in film are consistent, and reflective of his own persona; Lenny is a Jewish sports journalist (Allen is Jewish, and Jews, relative to their population, are disproportionately over-represented in Sports Management), his office is overrun with paper and contains no computer (Allen was 60, although it's still unrealistic for a publisher to do without one!) and, like his real life, he's forever involved with much younger women (both Linda and Amanda were 29, his secretary early 20's, and he remarried in 1997 to a 30 yr old!).Another warning on that note; watching Allen playing his role as if he were a hotshot 35-year old again is a little disconcerting.  You just get the feeling, sometimes, that he's too old to live his life at this speed. However, he does make a couple of acknowledgments in that direction.Finally, a bit of trivia for the buffs, for those who want to brag at dinner parties about the movie, and for lovers of Pellegrino water; the latter is seen twice during the film.

I loved the twists at the end, which were cleverly written, and Mira Sorvino's character was brilliant. The whole concept of Woody Allen finding his adopted son's mother and ending finding out that she was a prostitute, was refreshing compared to his usual troubled relationship movies. The quirky prostitute made the movie for me along with the great performances by all the cast. She stole the screen from Woody Allen in every scene and she totally deserved her Oscar for best supporting role. On the whole, the movie does drag a bit during the beginning, but once it gets going it was a joy to watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the late 90's, and now that I have seen it again, it's a timeless piece that has to go down as some of Woody Allen's best work. That is totally due to Sorvino and the way that Woody Allen wrote her character. Helen Bonham Carter was under used for the role as his wife but she was a good choice by Allen. Personally I think that the movie could have done with someone else playing Woody Allen's character and that Mira Sorvino should have had more screen time, but that just me being fussy. Budget $15million Worldwide Gross $26millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a man trying to find his adopted son's mother. 6/10 "},{"Title":"An antic Greek choir is a good idea, giving yourself the leading role not so","Date":"22 April 2014","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" What's wrong with a director who cast himself in nearly every film he made? Nothing if your name is or was Charles Chaplin, Clint Eastwood or Gene Kelly. But in case of Woody Allen there's definitely a problem. He always cast himself in a role of a character he wishes to be. In Mighty Aphrodite he plays a sport journalist married with a pretty wife (Helena Bonham Carter) who is a designer. For sure it's a frustration for Allen to be born in a body that is anything but athletic and it's clear that he imagined this character to compensate for his physical shortcomings. A role as a real sportsman would be totally unbelievable so let's make it a sport journalist! At one day Lenny (Allen) en Amanda (Bonham Carter) decides to adopt a baby, or in fact Amanda takes the decision. After a couple of years their marriage is in trouble and Lenny starts a search for the biological mother of the toddler. As a viewer you're not sure what the reason is. He suspects Amanda of cheating on him so maybe he is looking for revenge or to raise his son with the woman he's looking for. Or it is just his midlife crisis. After some research he finds out that the mother of his adopted son is a hooker and porn star by the name of Linda Ash who also lives in New York. He approaches her as a customer but instead of having sex with her he tries to talk her into a more decent life. Of course Linda is very wary about Lenny's approach after the experiences she has with men but he succeed to win her trust and actually gets her out of her job and into a hairdresser training. In fact he is so concerned about her welfare that he tries to find her a decent man. Then it all goes wrong he thinks he's right about the cheating of his wife and the man he thinks is a very good husband for Linda finds out about her porn career.When both Lenny and Linda are at a low point in their lives they found comfort in each other and even end up in bed. But Lenny returns to Amanda who also decides that the lover who is after her isn't worth the end of her marriage.So not only gives Allen himself a role very close to something athletic he also give himself a marriage to the beautiful Bonham Carter and a good night with Mira Sorvino who plays Linda Ash. Not total unbelievable wasn't it for the fact that he portrays Lenny as a total neurotic and klutz. For a person who has a very social job and has a marriage which give him a lot of contacts in the art scene his clumsiness is far overdone. The scene where he first enters the apartment of Linda is so shamefully bad acted that it is painful to watch. Just like the scene where he tries to convince the pimp to keep his hands of Linda.Not to say that this is a bad movie. Allen good be quite funny here and he brings a brilliant idea to the script. An antic Greek choir which (with the assistance of some of the Greek gods) give comment on the story and the characters and on some occasions try to interrupt and talk Lenny out of his plans. This idea give the film a light tone against the neurotic acting by Allen and the heavy themes like abortion, prostitution and divorce. As a viewer you wonder when the real reason for Lenny's interest in Linda comes to the surface. That this didn't happen is a bit of disappointment because you're curious about the reaction of the two women in Lenny's life. But it also fits in the light mood of the film.So Allen puts a lot of good ideas in Mighty Aphrodite but it's a pity nobody convinces him to hire a good casting agency for the role of Lenny.

When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby.

But in the end it is an uplifting and hopeful movie.The movie is only held back by a few small things. There are occasional moments of unrealistic convenience to advance the plot. And there is a Greek stage ensemble which advances the storyline in certain parts. It becomes annoying occasionally and can break up the pacing of the film, but there are a number of hilarious lines and segments they deliver, so I see the necessity. It's also nice to see F. Murray Abraham in an Allen flick! And then there is a lack of chemistry between Lenny (Woody) and his on-screen wife, played by Helena Bonham-Carter. This is weird considering Woody's films are so carefully cast. It's possible that this inconsistency is because Woody was like 40 years older than her when making this film.Which creates a layered metaphor for Woody's personal life from this period. This is around when he left Mia Farrow and married her adopted child, Soon Yi, herself about 40 years younger than Allen. Haha, Woody's own life is creepier than his fiction!

There is an amusing but, to my mind, irrelevant Greek chorus, that appears from time to time throughout the film. Allen seems to think that his slender story is the stuff of Greek tragedy but he is far from the mark in this judgement. Allen further indulges his penchant for having beautiful young actresses playing opposite him. Helena Bonham-Carter looks uncomfortable throughout in a thinly written part that has her, in a sub-plot, having an affair with her art-dealer boss but suddenly ending it to go back to Allen. Myra Sorvino, though visually stunning, adopts a high-pitched voice that is intensely irritating. It is difficult to believe that this performance won her a best supporting actress Oscar. Allen's attempted Pygmalion transformation of the young hooker is reminiscent of similar situations in Annie Hall, Manhattan and Husbands and Wives and Alice.Another aspect of Allen's life that is covered in the film is adoption. One would think that with his experience of Mia Farrow's adoptions, he would be technically well qualified to write about this subject, but the writing here, and throughout the film is slipshod. The themes are not fully developed and the film comes to a sudden end as if Allen tired of it. Although the verbal wit is, as ever, very amusing, the film as a whole is unsatisfying and, despite its critical success, a disappointing follow up to Bullets over Broadway "}{"Title":"Isn't life ironic?","Date":"21 April 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen, although I have seen few of his films. Mostly I feel like his performances get a little old for me, since he can only really play himself, in all his awkward, stuttering glory. He has a peculiarly dry style of humor that, to me, seems to get a little routine. He sort of satirizes the world around him as though consistently astonished at the strangeness of it all, dropping clever comments and observations as though by accident. He's not my favorite filmmaker, but one thing that seems pretty consistent about his films is that they are generally brilliantly written, and Mighty Aphrodite is no exception. I was a little put off by the intercutting to the bad performance art group, acting out Allen's interpretation of life's little absurdities on a decaying Greek amphitheater, and in increasingly modern and unpoetic language (Certain thoughts are better left unthunk!). Allen stars as Lenny, a sportswriter in a failing marriage with a woman named Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter), who thinks that if they have a baby it might save their marriage. The film opens with their conversation on the subject, in which they discuss all of the possibilities, including adoption, which Lenny immediately dismisses as unacceptable. All it takes, however, is one look at the cute kid from the adoption agency and his heart melts. Max, the new baby, soon grows up into a remarkable young man, and Lenny sets off on a personal mission to find his birth mother. He believes that any kid as smart as Max must have an equally brilliant mother, and he wants to know where the prodigal son came from. In Allen's illustration of some of life's great ironies, the birth mother that he discovered is a woman who calls herself Linda or Leslie, when she's not using one of the screen names she adopts in her performances in porn films, which she believes is just acting. There is a strange chemistry between Linda and Lenny, because she is so much younger and taller and sexier than he is, and because she's a prostitute and thinks he is just another paying customer. Quite the contrary, he is so astonished and horrified that he can hardly stand up. There is obviously a very strong sexual undertone in the movie, since Linda is both a hooker and porn star, and I've read reviews of the movie that suggest that even the graphic sexual descriptions have a sense of innocence, as if they are not really signifiers for the explicit sexual acts that they describe. I wouldn't quite say that. I think they take on that sense of detachment because Linda is so unbelievably dumb that she doesn't really understand the meaning of what she's talking about. She seems childish when she talks about it, which lends a sense of detachment, but I would hardly say innocence.Lenny's mission is to get Linda to clean up her life and become a respectable woman, like he imagined Max's mother to be. An intellectual giant is clearly out of the question, so he decides to settle for just getting her into a healthy and respectable relationship. His first attempt is a young boxer who dreams of moving back to his brother's farm and becoming a potato farmer. He is a match for Linda's diminutive intellect, and there is a touchingly awkward scene where he introduces the two of them in a park and then leaves. Both of them are clearly clueless about what to do.For almost the entire movie we're waiting to see when Lenny will tell Linda the real reason why he sought her out, especially when she emotionally reveals that she once had a child but had to give him up. The other revelation that we wait for is for Kevin, Linda's new boyfriend, to discover who she really is. Lenny had given him an impossible story about her, one which would fall apart the first time they had a normal conversation. When it finally happens, he reacts violently. Mira Sorvino's performance as Linda might be the most irritating performance that has ever been nominated for an Oscar. Her bizarre falsetto whine always made me think of the kind of voice that a babysitter might adopt to make the kids laugh when they miss their mom. Her mind is absolutely vacant and uncomprehending of the world around her, so it's hard to imagine her in a normal relationship at all, which may be why we never see that happen. She's also given ridiculous lines like Not a day doesn't go by that I don't wake up thinking about him. The double negatives render it nearly meaningless, but we can guess what she means.The film's biggest weakness, however, is the astonishingly obvious plot devices, which are so incredibly witless and weak that they stand out like big red flags in an otherwise well written movie. Linda's pimp won't let her quit but has an intense love of sports (I'd give my own mother for courtside Knick's tickets!). Lenny, conveniently, is a sportswriter. Or, my favorite, the movie spends all this time trying to find a good man for Linda, but when all efforts fail, Mr. Right quite literally falls out of the blue sky. Nice. Thankfully, the movie ends with an interesting twist of fate that calls attention to the movie's interesting assertions about the human condition. It's a strange tale of highly flawed people eventually achieving happiness. Maybe most people would choose a different form of happiness, but what they found this might have been the only kind available to them.

Annie Hall, Manhattan and even a couple of his later efforts like Bullets Over Broadway showed Woody the writer at his most brilliant.  But in the 90s it seems the Wood Man is trying to move into Farrelly Brothers territory.  Mighty Aphrodite is a prime example of the crass and unappetizing direction he has been taking lately (Deconstructing Harry is another) and its inferior to most of his other work.  For me, Mighty Aphrodite lands with one big thud. A new Woody Allen movie has always been a cherished event.  So there is nothing more indigestible than to hear our favorite neurotic and his co-stars spitting out needless profanity, while churning out obvious scenarios and sight gags geared specifically for titillation and sitcomy laughs.  The f*** word  may sound good coming out of Adam Sandler, but hearing Woody Allen say it (and worse) is almost sacrilegious.  Woody has always been an insightful master of comment and insinuation and to see him sink to this new low level is gut painful.  It is such an unnecessary, desperate measure and completely beneath him, I'd rather have him retire altogether than to spiral into mediocrity like this.  It's like listening to Stevie Wonder trying to sing gangsta rap.   It doesn't fit.  Do what you do best, man!This claptrap has Woody, of course, looking for happiness everywhere but in front of him.  This time he is on an obsessive search for his adopted baby's mother, which eventually leads him to hooker Mira Sorvino.  Sorvino is about the best thing in this film, which is not saying much, but I think her Oscar win (with all due respect to Sorvino) was undeserved.  Admittedly, she and Allen share a couple of fine moments especially with an endearing clod (Michael Rapoport), but its not enough to sustain the movie.  Most of the characters come off cruel, indifferent, obnoxious, and/or stupid.  A totally bizarre, confusing and unfunny Greek chorus (led by F. Murray Abraham) providing a commentary on Allen's trials and tribulations doesn't work either &#150; which is about par for the course.  The plot is incidental, the script is weak, even the music has little bearing on the mood of this piece, which is unheard of in an Allen film.If Mighty Aphrodite is any indication of where Woody Allen the screenwriter is headed, then gimme the good old days!

"},{"Title":"Mediocre Comedy with Cliche Conclusion Life is Miraculous, Sad, and Wonderful","Date":"20 May 2004","Score":"3 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDEDWhile the petty production value of Mighty Aphrodite reaches the unbearable level at times, it may be suitable to lead a cliche conclusion as Life is miraculous, sad, and wonderful. First, the director/actor Woody Allen presents middle-aged men's fantasy, having a platonic relationship with a hooker, and then doesn't forget having sex with her eventually, as an offering-everything-you-want entertainer.The Drawback List- Casting a Greek Chorus as a narrator role seems pointless, or even irritating, when it is terribly directed.- As the catalyst of the plot, Max, the adopted son of Lenny (Woody Allen), should be more involved in the drama--hooker Linda (Mira Sorvino) should come to know she is Max's mother. That would add the twisted meaning to Linda and Lenny's relationship.- The affair of Lenny's wife doesn't make any sense to the plot.- Allen's acting is arguably skillful to play a role of a loser (described by Linda); still some may find it jarring.- The rest of the cast is trifling, but it may work to yield deadpan humors.- Occasionally the camera does long takes with spatial depths; but with the imbalanced contrast to other average camera works, it ironically emphasizes the film's paltry value.- Preceding an ugly disaster, a nicely done romantic scene between Linda and her date Kevin wastes the viewers' emotions. I personally object to this type of usage of lovely scenes. "}]
