He gets spotted by Tim Matheson, a real estate millionaire, who asks Fletch to kill him so his wife can receive the inherit. Fletch goes snooping around and finds out that his smuggling ring investigation might somehow be tied to the millionaire.With a different leading man this film could very well have been a full blown thriller. Imagine John Frankenheimer directing and Robert De Niro starring. But, in dealing with what's at hand, Fletch is a good comedy where Chase can showcase his range of disguises and delivery of good one-liners. Chase absolutely smothers the film with wisecracks and the overall very well constructed mystery is nearly overlooked. With repeated viewings I've actually come to appreciate the film more for it's genuinely gripping detective story elements, it really does boast a solid mystery that unfolds well.There's one thing for sure here; you have to be a fan of Chevy Chase for this film to work for you. Since I'm a fan the film is in high regard. Chase's wisecracks aren't all brilliant but they're mostly very good and here he's at the top of his game.Fletch and Clark Griswold are the two characters Chevy Chase will most be remembered for.

The film doesn't need to poke fun at itself, we have enough fun watching Fletch.It's hokey at times, and some of the supporting actors can be a little flimsy, but if you're interested in a great light-hearted mystery from the 80's, Fletch is a great watch!

First hired by Lorne Michaels as a writer for SNL, it didn't take long for his face to appear on camera.With the opening line...Good evening. I'm Chevy Chase, and you're not, he launched his successful career.Unlike many of his turn-coat fans, I have and love 25 of his feature films. There has never been a movie by Chevy Chase that I did not like. I even have Couch Trip because of a cameo by Chase in a condom ad in the background of this movie.In my opinion, the Fletch movies are among his best works. I loved Vacation, but Fletch and Fletch Lives are by far his best endeavors.Irwin Fletch Fletcher is an investigative newspaper reporter who is currently working on a story about illegal drugs on a CA beach. With this future star-studded cast, take in many names you'll know and love, who were still struggling to achieve some level of fame at this time.George Wendt, Geena Davis for starters.In this one, Chevy runs an almost one-man-show as a roller skating rabbi, a doctor, an airplane repair technician, a beach bum/junkie, an insurance investigator named Harry S. Truman, another insurance investigator but this time a Comanche Native American named Mr. Poon, a wannabe LA Laker, and a sycophantic tennis bum. Although I know this is not the case, this character seems to have been written for Chevy's style. If you were a fan of SNL, at the time ...back when it was GOOD... in the late '70's and early '80's, then by all means, check out this movie.

No, that is not a figure of speech. You literally had to be there. Before computers and cable. In the age of print. In the age of books. Greg McDonald popped out nowhere with his Fletch series and it caught on like wildfire. Fletch was an investigative reporter, and the books were marketed as mysteries. But there were a lot of mysteries back then. So, you ask (er ... you WOULD ask if you were paying attention) what was there about the Fletch series that made it a runaway bestseller back in the days when mysteries were a dime a dozen and dinosaurs walked the earth? The answer is not the character, not the mystery itself, and not the rich background detail (because there was none). It was the writing. Sparse. Bare. So tight your backteeth ached when you read it. On the cover of the Fletch pocket books -- yes, they sold them in bookstores and drugstores -- the publisher actually reproduced a few sample lines of text from the book simply to show off the powerful, simple, prose. As this is written, I don't know how many AMLIT classes around the US have McDonald on the curriculum but I can opine that they all should. His writing was THAT unique. Now the film. Imagine how the Hollywood screenwriter felt when handed this project? Apoplexy comes to mind. So, fearful of losing the gig, he did what every Hollywood screenwriter does when he doesn't understand the material he has ... he turned it into a comedy. Chase was cast and he was just superb ... but superb in a role that never existed in the book! (And less superb in the sequel because by then the novelty was wearing off). It showcases the power of movies in our culture that, to this day, millions of Chase fans think that the Fletch series was actually written that way. Factoid -- one of the oddest, and possibly scariest, things about the film is the scene where Chase puts on the disguise of the old man. Because, if you compare the makeup with the way he actually looked some 30 years later -- as in Google Images -- you will find a perfect match.

In this movie, Chevy plays a newspaper reporter who is investigating some pretty big crimes. What really makes the film good is that Chevy is funny, but smart at the same time.The film starts off with Irwin M. Fletch Fletcher (Chevy Chase) investigating drug trafficking on the beach in LA. He is picked up by a yuppie called Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson). Stanwyk tells Fletch, who Stanwyk thinks is a junkie named Ted Nugent, that he has bone cancer and wants Fletch to kill him so his wife can collect an insurance policy. Through the rest of the movie, Fletch has to find out whether Stanwyk is serious and why the chief of police (Joe Don Baker) wants him to stop his investigation on the drug trafficking.The reason I like this movie so much is that it is one of the 1980s movies where an actor who was previously only known for comedy is now playing a more serious character. To a large extent, Fletch is to Chevy Chase what Axel Foley is to Eddie Murphy. Like Axel Foley, Fletch is a really funny character, but also shows intelligence and resourcefulness in difficult situations.Through the movie, Fletch uses a string of aliases and disguises that provide comic relief to a film that could have been a pretty gripping drama. My favorites are Gordon Liddy the airplane mechanic, Mr. Poon from the SEC, and John Cocktoston the tennis player attempting to woo Mrs. Stanwyk (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson) while charging expensive lunches to Mr. and Mrs. Underhill at the exclusive club. Also look out for Gilette (George Wyner), the attorney for the former Mrs. Fletcher who provides the straight man for some pretty funny jokes. Oh, and some unknown actress named Geena Davis playing Larry, one of Fletch's allies against his boss Frank (Richard Libertini) at the newspaper. I would go into more, but there's too much in this movie to shake a stick at.If you want to see a funny movie with a serious plot, watch Fletch.

Fletch agrees and decides to snoop into Alan's personal files discovering he's not ill and is a drug-dealer. Fletch also meets and falls for his wife, Gail (Nicholson) who eventually discovers Alan is trying to steal her money. Baker (The Natural) plays crooked police chief, Jerry Karlin who is dealing with Alan. Geena Davis, George Wendt, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, M. Emmett Walsh and the late, James Avery also appear. Chase is great in this as usual as well as Harold Faltermeyer's score. I recommend this 80's Chase classic.

He's got all the best disguises, all his passports up to date, and is just as good as any police detective in his comedic investigations.

The movie has a feeling of being a comedic police film so if you like that type then give Fletch a viewing.If you liked movies like The Naked Gun, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Spies Like Us, Turner and Hooch or Chevy Chase's famous film Vacation then you will most likely enjoy the movie Fletch.8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Fletch Works!","Date":"1 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" One of the Greatest Actors of all-time, Chevy Chase delivers a stupendous performance in 'Fletch'.

Although it doesn't have very many laugh out loud moments, the fight scene at the end is pretty laughable, and i'll admit the part where the dog talks is pretty dumb, this is a great movie. If you enjoy sarcasm in real life, Fletch will give you exactly what you need. The groovy soundtrack gives a great and fun 80s aspect to it. The main thing is that this is a great movie to own, and watch again and again, and very easy to reference in the outside world. The wolf in Hoodwinked is based on Fletch,(but it is far superior).

The film has some unnecessary profanity, so it's not suitable for families and won't be to the taste of some viewers. I'd like to be able to give this a higher rating &#x96; somehow I think Chevy Chase is better than seven stars. But even with a decent script, the film just isn't that funny throughout. It has its moments, and those are mostly with the disguises. Chase's heyday in movies was in the 1980s when he made almost 25 percent of more than 70 movies, including the only ones that were at all good. He only had a couple big hits (Vacation and Christmas Vacation) with just a few other good films such as Fletch.

And that's the real surprise here it works. Fletch is a movie that caters directly to Chase's droll wit and detached persona; so much so, that I can't imagine anyone else saying his dialogue. It's not only very watchable, but this script fires off one-liners like crazy (indeed, some of my favorite movie lines can be found here). Tim Matheson looks his cinematic best, while the fetching Dana Wheeler- Nicholson is smokin' hot in that tennis skirt (hell, even just standing there saying her lines). And there's even room for Joe Don Baker (Mitchell!), playing a corrupt cop; he really does fit that role. And say what you will about the music (very, very '80s ... but that ain't a crime), Faltermeyer's theme is catchy as hell.

Chase's ability to assume numerous completely different identities is unrivaled. He's in a class by himself in that regard. I've read where Kevin Smith wants to do the standard prequel update w/ Jason Lee as Fletch. < That IMO will be as big a flop as Steve Martin's embarrassing attempt at Peter Seller's PINK PANTHER.I usually watch this movie over & over its that good.If you want to watch comedic perfection this is your movie.

He states to Fletch that he is suffering from inoperable bone cancer that will slowly eat away at him like a virus and desperately wants out of this misery. Suicide will nullify his insurance, while murder would give his family the whole package. Fletch accepts the job, but can't help but sense there is something shady here, so he conducts an investigation on Stanwyk and discovers his connections with drug trafficking, as well as local police chief Jerry Karlin's (Joe Don Baker) involvement run a mile deep. This leads Fletch to pose as a number of disguises to get where he needs to be.Director Michael Ritchie directs this picture with the kind of energy it needs, and screenwriter Andrew Bergman (who would write the fabulous It Could Happen to You roughly a decade later) drums up several different sketches that never seem to tread the line of strenuous parodies or a compilation of something resembling Saturday Night Live skits; one of the biggest problems that could've plagued this project as a whole.Yet it's easy to say that if a viewer is searching for Chevy Chase's best performance, they may have found it. Chase is a master at deadpanning humor, and nearly every few seconds, spouts off a shamelessly cynical one-liner that would live on in the hearts and minds of Fletch cultists everywhere. To see him relaxed and confident on screen is one of the many pleasures of the picture, and it gives me reassurance of his possibilities after, not long ago, watching the dry and scarcely funny Three Amigos, which totally shoved his character to the background, where he was lucky enough to get a smile in.Fletch works in large part because of Chase's incredibly sophisticated energy, but is sustainable because not only is it an enjoyable piece of comedy, but also a devilishly entertaining crime drama, that sports a simple, yet effectively handled mystery that one could call fulfilling and worthwhile. Composed of its inherently basic material, delivered in a fittingly unassuming way, with a terrific central performance, a script efficiently written by an underrated comedic talent, direction that stays alive, and a supporting cast (comprised of people like Tim Matheson and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson) that work well with the Chase's detached title character, as a quick and spontaneous romp, this one carefully constructs its entire setup to make for favorable entertainment.Starring Chevy Chase, Tim Matheson, and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson.

I haven't read the book , so I don't know how much this movie is faithful to the book or is the book better/worse than movie. Opinions differ. Gregory Macdonald after seeing the movie was pleased and complimented both director Michael Ritchie and Chevy Chase. I know that I really liked the movie , so in the future I'm going to buy the book . That tells you something about the quality of the movie.Hollywood was trying for many years to do a movie about Fletch , but couldn't for some unknown reason. I believe the success of Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop (one of my favourite movies) was the main reason why Fletch was finally made. It was a green light for the movie,I believe. There's only one year of difference between them , so the timing couldn't be more right. Also , Chevy Chase (the main star) was at peek of his career with Caddyshack and National lampoons Vacation - two commercially successful movies that are classics today.Other similarities to the mentioned Beverly Hills Cop include catchy music by Harold Faltermeyer ( the same guy who did music for BHC. The Fletch theme is just as good as Axel F ), nice little detective story ( why rich man wants to die ?) and overall cheerful mood . Fletch doesn't have such strong soundtrack as BHC , but the opening and ending credits Stephanie Mills song  Bit by bit is great , and really helps to set the mood. I'm not saying that Fletch is a rip-off , I just want to recommend this movie to everyone who liked Eddie's movie and is looking for something similar. I love them both.Chevy Chase is great as Fletch. His finest performance will forever be that of Clark Griswald , but I can't imagine any other actor who would fill the role better. Chase feels very natural here . He even improvised in few scenes with good effect ( the Moonriver scene ). Irwin Fletch Fletcher is a lovely character. Narcissistic , overconfident , master of disguise , playboy and journalist. He isn't very strong , but when he gets into trouble you can be sure he will be okay. His brain and mouth are his weapons.The rest of the cast gives solid performances , especially Joe Don Baker and Dana Wheeler Nicholson. Watch out for Geena Davis in a small role of Fletch's co-worker.Anyway , don't miss Fletch - one of the greatest comedies ever. I give 8/10.

Irwin Maurice Fletch Fletcher is a hot shot investigative reporter whose curiosity is aroused when smooth rich man Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) approaches him with a proposition murder Stanwyk for a nice five figure sum. Stanwyk claims to be already dying of bone cancer, but Fletch rightly senses something suspicious and snoops around, despite the fact that he was supposed to be working on an expose of the drug traffic at a beach. There is a certain kinship between Fletch and Beverly Hills Cop in that they feature unflappable main characters who often manufacture scams in order to get what they need from other characters; in Fletch's case, he takes it a step further and dons various disguises as well. You have to hand it to Fletch - this is a guy who rarely loses his cool, even when guns are being pointed at him. Chase knows this is a fun role and is clearly just having a blast, firing off wise ass one liners left and right. As a result, the dialogue is often quite funny and the movie does have a certain energy to it, moving along quite nicely. The supporting cast is great, including Joe Don Baker as the police chief, the lovely and appealing Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as the leading lady (she easily could have had an even better career in film), Richard Libertini as Fletch's long suffering editor, M. Emmet Walsh as a cheerful doctor, George Wendt as beach bum / drug pusher Fat Sam, Kenneth Mars as Stanton Boyd, Geena Davis in a perky early career film appearance as Fletch's co-worker Larry (!), and William Traylor as the unfortunate Mr. Underhill, with a bunch of familiar faces in small parts George Wyner, Tony Longo, James Avery, Burton Gilliam, William Sanderson, Bill Henderson, Beau Starr, and Ralph Seymour; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's cameo role as himself is actually quite fleeting. Comic highlights include Fletch's visit to Dr. Dolan (Walsh), wherein he gets a rectal exam, the mystery element of the movie works pretty well, and there's some good action to boot, with an impressive climactic car chase. The aliases are hysterical, as Fletch will refer to himself as Ted Nugent, John Cocktoastin, and Arnold Babar, among other names. For fans of Chase and director Michael Ritchie (Downhill Racer, The Bad News Bears, The Golden Child), this rollicking movie really does deliver the goods, maintaining interest for a solidly entertaining 99 minutes.

I like this one cause it is funny, but the crime being committed is realistic. The second one is just a tad more crazy and goofy, but that worked for me too. This one follows a news reporter named Fletch that goes under the alias Jane Doe for the paper he writes for. He is currently investigating some drug trafficking going on at the beach. He is approached soon by a man who mistakes him for just another bum on the beach and takes him to his very nice home. There he has a proposal for Fletch, that he wishes for Fletch to murder him for a large sum of money. There is more going on though and Fletch must go undercover to find out what is going on. Very funny movie as Chevy Chase is at his finest here. The man was an incredible comic talent back in the day, it is kind of a shame that he has virtually fallen off the face of the earth. The movie has loads of funny scenes involving Fletch posing as other people to get information, including getting it from the wife of the man who wants Fletch to murder him. The movie is not all laughs though as there is a rather good chase scene, though actually that was rather funny too. Joe Don Baker is in the film and he is rather good in this one too. I always find he does a much better job as a secondary character or villain than he does as the lead in a film. The movie also has an interesting conclusion. All in all a winner from Chevy, I just wish he did not disappear as he was one of the better comic actors back in the day. There is no one even close to what he was now.

Larry is about the only one who laughs at Fletch's jokes. Fletch takes place in reality. Fletch is involved in serious work, and he is also serious about solving his dilemma. That adds to the humor of the ridiculous things he says and does. Everything he does is well thought-out, yet he always winds up having to improvise. Hilarity ensues. There's a one-liner in almost every sentence. Almost every line of the movie made me laugh. The narrations were great. They keep you up to speed while keeping you laughing.

Not only did each one give me an opportunity to have laughs and popcorn, it introduced me to a slew of comedies that would continue to hold a special place in my heart for years to come. But lest I get lost in nostalgia for the next seven paragraphs, allow me to cut to the chase. Fletch may not be the timeless gem that has long inhabited my fond memories, it may not pack the same punch it did two decades ago, it may not even hold up as well as Chase apologists would have you believe, but, as I discovered this week, revisiting director Michael Ritchie's tongue-in-cheek romp was the comedy equivalent of coming home. Based on a series of mystery novels by Gregory McDonald, Fletch follows the misadventures of Irwin Fletcher (Chevy Chase), a quick-witted investigative reporter who gains notoriety with several scathing exposés published under the name Jane Doe. Going undercover as a homeless man to root out drug traffickers in Los Angeles, the all-too-clever writer is approached by a millionaire (Tim Matheson) offering a chunk of change to anyone willing to kill him before his cancer leads to an untimely and agonizing death. Suspicious from the start, Fletch hits the streets and works a variety of angles, eventually uncovering a link between the terminally-ill stranger, his cash, a stretch of lucrative real estate, and a corruption plot involving the chief of police (Joe Don Baker). With the help of his research assistant Larry (Geena Davis) and his newspaper editor Frank Walker (the indomitable Richard Libertini), Fletch shuffles through an endless assortment of disguises, cozies up to the millionaire's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), and pursues the truth at all cost. Easily screenwriter Andrew Bergman's finest work, Fletch gives Chase the chance to walk the same fine line between arrogance and charm that made him such a bankable star in the '80s. He plows through costumes, hairpieces, and oddball props with the fervent enthusiasm of a kid digging through his parents' cluttered closet. His delivery is sharp and precise at all times; he never allows his character's smarmy attitude to overwhelm Ritchie's sight gags or undermine the light-footed talents of his supporting cast. Instead, he tackles each line and flashes his every expression with a burning desire to endear himself to anyone watching. Even his deadpan narration -- a tried-and-true risk that could have been a total disaster -- adds another dimension to every fit of whimsy that bounds and bounces across the screen. The story itself has to occasionally slam on its brakes to unload several minutes of all-too-necessary exposition, but Chase manages to fuse his character's misgivings and behavior with the plot in such a way that he retains Ritchie's momentum even when the director is forced to slow the film down. Sure, a few jokes fall flat, some pop culture references lack context, and the duh-dump-tiss nature of several punchlines hasn't aged as well as I had hoped, but Fletch strikes me as the sort of definitive time-capsule comedy that has the ability to win over modern filmfans who've never partaken of its well-seasoned goods. And while Ritchie's take on McDonald's popular protagonist will never sit perfectly well with purists, Chase and company have nevertheless created something fresh and funny. In the end, newcomers should give it a shot and fans should pay it another visit.

Much more subtle when compared to the follow-up. Oh there are plenty of quotable lines of dialogues basically around every corner though. Not only are the physical/verbal gags present, but the stemming mystery side of the story is a real twister as it unfolds with many tactical sub-plots seeming to find their way together at the end. Chase shows that his having a field day with the role/material, moving from place to place in many disguises, aliases and more than the occasional wise-crack. Playing the bad guy of the piece is a classy Tim Matheson&#x85; his appearances are minor, but very important in the scheme of things. Also Jon Don Baker barks loudly as a police chief that might know a little more to what's going than he lets on. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is impressively appealing as the girl caught in the middle of the web and Richard Libertini is fine as Fletch's down-trodden newspaper editor. Showing in smaller support roles are Geena Davis, George Wendt, George Wyner and M. Emmet Walsh.Director Michael Ritchie cooks up compelling and snappy exchanges, never letting the on-the-move jokes take over what was a very solid framework of a story penned by Andrew Bergman (taken from the novel of Gregory McDonald). It's a perfectly unpredictable and clever mixture of wittiness and murder. Streaming through it is a pumping score that simply reminds you of the times.

The keys to Chase's success with this are two the effective use of the supporting cast (the opposite of this would be Falling Down), and Chase's stance in relation to us. You see, no one -within the movie- laughs at his bantering (George Wendt excepted); the idea is show how far and fast Fletch goes over everyone's head. Chase really is playing in a space no one else here is allowed to occupy, that rich area between us and the movie 'reality'. The other (and more consistent) master of this within comedy is Bill Murray. Bruce Willis knows how to do this too, having forever altered the action genre in the process. A rapid-fire flummoxing of the actors, who can't keep up and of us, who can barely keep while the next successive joke hits us. We're in on the joke and the actors don't know they aren't. It's sublime.Along the way, we get the McCrocodile Speech from 'The 39 Steps' and a brief interlude through '...Walter Mitty'.

And it's not a film that insults your intelligence like a lot of other comedies these days, with underdeveloped, recycled plot material. This film allows you to have your cake and eat it. It's a comedy, but it takes itself seriously, in a way. Outside the ridiculous humor of Chevy Chase, we get a plot that's worthy of a serious crime thriller.The story follows Irwin Fletcher or Fletch (Chase) who is an investigative reporter trying to get to the bottom of a drug trafficking plot on the beaches of L.A. Meanwhile, Fletch is approached by a terminally ill millionaire who asks Fletch to murder him for $50,000. Under the bizarre scenario, and seemingly unrelated events, Fletch does a little snooping around and finds more to the picture than what he had anticipated. Chase puts his best comedic efforts to use as Fletch dons multiple disguises as he encounters different people and environments, in an attempt to uncover the mystery.It's a lighthearted comedy with a hint of darkness to it, and the combination gives us a package full of laughs, action/adventure, and intriguing suspense, and I'd also like to note a classic, extremely catchy, synthesized 80s score. Granted, there are some moments that are a little silly, and there are parts in the script that seem to rely too much on Chevy's improv and perhaps could've been polished a bit. But there are few laugh out loud comedies that allow you to get engaged in the story and characters as much as this one.

It's a mystery how he could waste his talent is so many lackluster movies, starting with the abysmal European Vacation.The plot is nothing special. Actually, it would have been a crime thriller if somebody didn't come up with the idea that the protagonist should be a wisecracker. The writer, Andrew Bergman, has a lot of the credit for making this such an enjoyable time-filler. He is responsible for the original laugh-riot The In-Laws and the more uneven spoof of The Godfather (can't think of the title right now).Otherwise, the film totally belongs to Chase and it is hard to explain what he does to make you laugh. Sometimes you asked youself Why the hell was that so funny? because Chase doesn't crack a single smile himself and most of the time seems above the lines he is saying. There is also an amusing bit part for Geena Davis and Chase would later return the favor with a cameo in hero but the female lead played by Dana Nicholson is mostly a supporting part in itself. Then we have Tim Matheson as the sleazy millionaire who has an unusual favor to ask of Chase and Chase then tries to figure out if his story is on the level which of course it isn't.All this described seems rather boring when being described in written words but that is not to scare anyone away to see it because this is by far one of the best comedies of the 80's and the 80's were full of them. The only minus is that many of the scenes seems rushed through and poorly edited but that's a minor complaint.

Its easy to think of Fletch as a white version of Axel Foley and he's every bit as watchable. The focus is mostly on the humour and it works a treat with Chase's easy charm conning the crooks and the odd big headed rich boy along the way. The plot is fairly incidental but involved enough to keep you going (even though there are some convenient coincidences in there), and the jokes are rapid fire with some asides being similar in style to Bob Hope's dead pan one liners.

I had already seen the sequel, Fletch lives and thought that Fletch was the much duller first offering. I now realize that this boredom I experienced was because this film had a much better story and wasn't purely a succession of different disguises and predictable mugging by Chevy Chase that I found funny as a child. I now fully appreciate Fletch as the better of the two. It has an interesting and original story that has the right amount of suspense and humor and manages to tie up all the loose ends nicely. Having recently read the book the film is based on I have to say I preferred the film, as I found it took the main themes and story of the book but made it far more fast-paced an entertaining.While you can see the character of Fletch in the film is certainly 70% Chevy Chase, he even does his Look at the wristwatch that isn't there that he does in the caddyshack films, he still makes the character more believable than any of his other roles. Some of the humor is very dry and alot is clever word play and the observation that most of the time people aren't listening to what other people say. Some of it is very broad and slapstick but all these styles of humor are perfectly meshed into the very serious plot of murder, drug smuggling and adultery. The only negative comment is that there is an unnecessary car chase about half-way through that really doesn't need to be there but this is a minor blip in a great film.The supporting characters do just that and are never overwhelmed by Chase and the film is very refreshing when compared with most comedies that usually forget about the story to make plenty of room for the jokes. Fletch gives the right amount of time to both. I was so impressed with the film and it's sequel that I have since read all the original Fletch books and am really looking forward to seeing the Kevin Smith adaptation of Fletch Won. This is a really enjoyable film that should have been as popular as Beverly Hills cop in it's day but was overlooked for some reason. This is well worth watching just for the Moon river scene.

The viewer gets his first indication of how good this film actually is during the opening theme when the fantastic 'Bit by Bit' can be heard.

It needs to be watched more than once, as the one liners are so humorous you miss half of them on your first viewing. Fletch's array of hilarious costumes as well as Chase's facial expressions also mean that the film has a great visual effect although never stooping to cheap physical comedy. The sympathy that Fletch shows to the female characters in this and Fletch Lives means the film also has a visceral effect as we can literally feel our hearts warming to the protagonist.In conclusion I would like to highly recommend Fletch to any Chevy Chase fans or infact anyone who likes to laugh.

Fletch","Date":"4 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":"  `Fletch', a tremendously good film in its own right, is part of a breed of Eighties films that doesn't seem to be made anymore.  Much like the original `Beverly Hills Cop', `Fletch' isn't an overly humorous film, but rather a film featuring a comic star reacting to serious situations with comic responses.  The film itself deals with some serious subjects &#150; murder for hire, police corruption, and drug trafficking &#150; and apart from the hero of the film, Fletch, a.k.a. Irwin Fletcher (Chevy Chase in his best role ever), every character treats the events of the film with great seriousness.  Only Fletch himself treats everything like it's a comedy, albeit a dark comedy.  Because of this, the film `Fletch' can't properly be termed a comedy; instead, it's more an action/drama with heavy doses of humor from its star.   If a movie like this were made today, it'd probably be just an action film with a few good wisecracks, or a slapstick comedy that couldn't treat anything seriously.Irwin Fletch Fletcher, the title character and driving force behind `Fletch', is a Los Angeles reporter who delights in tormenting the establishment with scathing exposé articles.  While conducting research undercover for an article about drug dealers, Fletch is approached by millionaire Alan Stanwyck (Tim Matheson), who has a strange proposition for the disguised Fletch he wants to pay Fletch fifty grand to murder him.  Intrigued by the proposition, Fletch starts digging into Stanwyck's past, and starts to uncover a strange case involving tax shelters, drug dealers, and a large number of people to suddenly want to kill him.The story's flawed, but at least it's interesting &#150; there's enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing throughout the film as to what's going to happen next.  What makes the film, though, is Chevy Chase as Fletch.  Unable to treat anything seriously, the know-it-all Fletch is completely believable because so many other characters despise him.  For all his great one-liners, snide comments, and sarcastic remarks, the other characters treat him the same way `real' people probably would &#150; they'd respect his work, but they'd hate the man.  As for the audience, Fletch comes across as abrasive, but his dogged persistence to find the truth makes him endearing, and Fletch always manages to come up with the snappy comebacks most people only wish they could think of.  Chevy Chase also gives Fletch enough idiosyncratic quirks &#150; his love of the Lakers, his often-sloppy work &#150; to make Fletch be human, and not some superhuman caricature.  Fletch's sarcastic nature also makes the film unpredictable &#150; just when you think you know where a scene's headed, Fletch blurts out a line that sends it spinning in a completely unexpected direction.  `Fletch' is a film completely defined by its title character, but that character alone is enough to make the movie highly enjoyable.`Fletch' is an amusing, underrated movie.  If you find Chevy Chase to be completely self-absorbed, smug, and unfunny &#150; and some people do &#150; don't bother with it.  However, this is Chase's best film by far, and if you like Chase, or have no opinion about the man's brand of humor whatsoever, see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.

The dialogue itself is top notch, and Chevy Chase does a great job with delivery.  The plot, in my opinion, while not the point of the movie, is interesting enough to add dimension to the movie separating itself from a lot of the other comedy movies of a similar type. It sort of helps that the main character isn't exactly a hero, but sort of a scummy guy himself as we watch him procrastinate at work and attempt to dodge his alimony payments (in perhaps the funniest scene in the movie), all the while using all sorts of ridiculous aliases and stories to further the plot.  At the same time, those same dodges are what make Fletch all the more charming to the viewer.

When a rich, strange young man approaches Fletch with an offer of $50, 000 to murder him, our hero soon finds himself involved in more than he anticipated.Ritchie's film relies entirely on Chase's ability to make us laugh with his irreverent investigative technique, and his many and varied disguises. The pair do a reasonable job with Andrew Bergman's script (from McDonald's novel), and the result is a satisfying picture.Being a Chevy Chase fan will certainly help audiences enjoy this movie, so if you've no time for this former star of Saturday Night Live, then give Fletch a miss. Director Ritchie was unable to lift proceedings any higher than Chase's performance or Bergman's screenplay allowed.

It was easily accessible for a kid, but I was originally disappointed when I first saw Fletch because it was more serious and a lot of jokes just went over my head.As a result Fletch appeals to the adult in me while Fletch Lives appeals to the kid barely concealed inside. There's loads of great one-liners from our man Chase and even if that doesn't float your boat Harold Faltermeyer's score is just plain awesome. It's unfortunate that Irwin F never became as famous or iconic as Axel F.I've read the book, and it's as different as it is similar to the plot of the movie, except for one major difference; Fletch's cases are not connected in the book but they are in the movie. Gregory MacDonald had the final say on who they cast as Fletch and rejected Burt Reynolds (no way) and Mick Jagger (say what???) before approving Chase. Along with Clark W. Griswold he's his most famous character (Ty Webb coming in at 3rd place).It's not aged so well though, the film is clearly very 80s, unlike the sequel which doesn't use any pop songs, But even if the pop tunes anchor this in 1985 it's still one of the best comedies of that decade and no one can call themselves a film buff without owning/watching.

The approach, in this case, was broader but no less effective (with especially agreeable infusions of noir) &#x96; and the film stands as possibly the star's most sustained vehicle, where Chase is a columnist with a penchant for undercover work (often under heavy disguise!). His latest scoop concerns an intricate drug deal (incorporating bigamy and land-grabbing!) which eventually reveals at the bottom of it the county's Chief of Police (Joe Don Baker); harassing his editor but supported by a colleague (a pre-stardom Geena Davis), he becomes involved with the 'official' wife of the chief suspect (who, claiming he had only weeks to live, actually hand-picked the hero &#x96; while posing as a junkie beach-bum &#x96; in order to assassinate him!).

The bum agrees to do it but the reporter in Fletch takes over and he tries to figure out who this guy is and what his plan is. I had heard a lot of good things about this film over the years and I'm really not sure why it took me so long to check it out but I'm certainly glad I did as I can see myself revisiting this film every so often. The screenplay by future director Andrew Bergman is pretty straight-forward, simple and I'm sure followed the novel pretty well but the real key to this film is Chase and his masterful character of Chase. I always try to say there's no movie without a good screenplay but there are exceptions to the rules and I think this is the case because I seriously doubt a lot of what we're seeing was actually on the page and I'm fairly positive it's all coming from Chase's wacky mind. The mannerisms are one of the best things in the film as Chase is constantly getting into one mess after another and many of the best laughs don't come from dialogue but instead his reactions to what is going on. Whether he's getting busted for charging food to someone elses account or having police chase him, old Chase does a masterful job just reacting to everything and this delivers so many laughs throughout the film. We also get countless situations where Chase has to act out as different characters and once again he handles this masterfully and never misses a touch. Ritchie's direction is also very good because it really never feels like you're watching a movie. Instead, it really seems like you're just following Fletch around on this journey and the film runs so smoothly that you'll feel as if you're watching a documentary of the events or just watching them live. How the film constantly cuts to the next sequence of events comes off so fresh that you can't help but enjoy the ride and be excited for what's going to come next. Matheson is as fun as usual and we get nice supporting work from Joe Don Baker, M. Emmet Walsh, George Wendt and a young Geena Davis. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is extremely charming as the love interest. Outside the bad 80s soundtrack, this film has enough laughs for two movies and it's the perfect example of how great Chase could be.

The National Lampoon Vacation series is a perfect example of good comic talent being criminally under-used. Fletch is a witty, enjoyable, refreshing comedy-thriller and it is also far and away the best film that Chase has ever done.Fletch (Chase) is an L.A newspaper journalist who works under the pseudonym Jane Doe. He is busily trying to expose the source of illegal narcotics on a local beach when he is approached by a mysterious rich guy (Tim Matheson) who wants to arrange his own murder. Fletch investigates both cases and uncovers a whole can of worms, including high-level police corruption, bigamy and more.The film breezes by at a cracking pace and has some inspired gags. Fletch stealing a car only to find that a car thief is in the passenger seat (Fletch pretends he is a carbon dioxide emmisions-tester!); Fletch raiding a party and causing a stir by doing an off-the-cuff speech; Fletch disguising himself as a roller-skating rabbi; Fletch bluffing his way out of danger by telling a gunman the story of The Godfather; etc. All these - and more - stand out as wonderful comic moments.

One day, Fletch is addressed by Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson), a rich man, who asks Fletch a favor. For the sum of $50,000, Fletch should kill poor cancer-ridden Mr. Stanwyk with a gun, so that his wife will get the insurance money. What the guy didn't think of was Fletch's real profession. Returning into normal life, Fletch instantly takes up research not only to find out that Mr. Stanwyk is healthy as life itself but he also runs into certain connections between drug dealing at the beach, Alan Stanwyk, his private jet, the police and a very expensive piece of Land in Utah.The 1985 comedy hit Fletch, which spawned a less successful sequel, is an above average eighties comedy with just enough laughs to entertain.Chevy Chase is not a favorite actor of mine. I always preferred Akyroyd over him in the old SNL days, and the only film role I feel he fit into perfectly was the Clark Griswold persona in the Vacation movies. However, even though he's not great, he is a good choice for Fletch (I guess) because he brings that dumb, stuck-up, know-it-all quality to the character of Fletch.The laughs do fall short sometimes, but overall, Fletch is a worthwhile film. It is entertaining, if not a bit flawed. I am surprised that another sequel, directed this time by Kevin Clerks Smith, called Fletch Won is being made, but then again, we're seeing a lot of remakes/postponed sequels these days. I hope Fletch Won isn't as bad as the new Star Wars 'Epics'.Fletch gets 3.5/5 stars from me. It's definitely worth seeing.
