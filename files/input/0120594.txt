The reviewers have once again missed the ferry -- what we have here, folks, is an honest to God(ard) B-movie tone poem, an exercise in sensual, physical, SURFACE beauty that will send any self-respecting Keatsian aesthete straight to Hyperion ( the palace of visionaries, not the Miramax book division. )  Thanks to director Michael Radford -- who I wrongly assumed to be eighty or ninety years of age on the basis of his last movie, Il Postino -- B. Monkey is as seductive as the single bar of red neon that illuminates the opening shot.  The movie will surely gain minor but devoted cult status in the years to come, while its lead actress, Asia Argento, will probably have to buy a house with very tall gates.  ( Because I'm quite tall myself, and a good climber. )How to describe B. Monkey without resorting to banal adjectives like you'd find on cartons of Haagen-Daz, luscious and velvety?  Well, I see it as sort of a disreputable cousin to Bertolucci's ravishing Besieged; other people, no doubt less pretentious, will compare it to the kind of movie Steven Soderbergh has been making lately -- a cool, jazz-inflected, proudly inconsequential genre flick.  But Radford has his own style -- impossibly trendy -- and he's a genius at evoking the loneliness and beauty of big cities everywhere.   This is a director's movie, to be sure, but make no mistake  Asia Argento is no slouch when it comes to decorating the frame.  She's compact, tough, and fierce-eyed, her unconventional beauty only enhanced by a strong nose that would look terrific underneath a centurion's helmet.  Like Louise Brooks or Anna Karina, she's a vamp for the ages, mesmerizing for no good reason ( much like the movie itself. )  It doesn't hurt that she's matched with the brilliant Jared Harris, whose interior performance perfectly complements her exterior one, or that the atavistically lordly Rupert Everett is on hand to do his Wilde thing.  Even pretty boy Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is a bit more animated than usual; he throws open car doors briskly and with conviction.    Yes, the plot is inane.  No, it doesn't really matter.  B. Monkey, in the end, amounts to no more nor less than the sum of its impressionistic moments.  The world is a glittering tomb where we all languish in oh-so-gorgeous isolation, or something.  As Jared Harris says early in the movie, deejaying at a local hospital  This next one is for all you romantics out there.  Get well soon.

Story is about a woman named B. Monkey (Asia Argento) who moonlights as an armed robber and she works with a couple of drug addicts named Bruno (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) and their father figure Paul (Rupert Everett) and a local gangster named Frank (Tim Woodward) is the one who sets up the scores. One night Bea meets Alan (Jared Harris) who is a school teacher and he asks her out on a date. She accepts and soon she falls in love with him and wants to leave her sordid past behind. Alan gets another teaching job in the country and Bea goes with him and they start to live the quiet life but one day Bea calls Paul and he traces the call back and finds out where she lives. Paul is in serious trouble with Frank and they follow him to where Bea is. One of the main problems with the story is how much Alan puts up with to be with Bea. Her friends are criminals, she was responsible for him losing his job and she displays a pretty bad temper. Maybe it's time to move on, buddy! But the strong point for the film is Argento's performance. She's a very brave actress and it appears that she would do just about anything on camera. There are several scenes in this film that require total nudity and Argento seems very comfortable doing this. Argento is Italian and grew up in Europe and European actress's seem to have a different attitude towards nudity in films. I first noticed Radford's direction in the highly underrated 1984 and also Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Both of these films along with Il Postino are superbly directed but his talent wasn't evident in this film. It's adequately made but besides Argento this was a pretty tepid viewing experience. I had heard rumors that it was heavily edited but I'm not sure thats the problem. The whole film feels flat and labored and really has nothing special to offer. Argento does make it watchable though.

Monkey (at the Ghent Film Festival in 1998), I was amazed at how many people had come to see this action movie starring Asia Argento. Of course it wasn't because of Asia's charismatic performances this movie was so popular, but because it was the latest film by Michael Radford, director of Il Postino (together with Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulin the longest running movie in the last ten years - well, in Antwerp anyway). From Il Postino to B. Monkey was a weird step and perhaps one of the reasons why B. Monkey gets so many negative reviews.I'm well aware that this movie is a male-oriented vision of escapism, but when the result is a movie like this, one wants to take a lot for granted.B. Monkey was based on a novel by Andrew Davies who has been writing since the late 60s and has penned many scripts for well-known productions such as the script for the Bridget Jones Diary and the lesbian BBC drama Tipping The Velvet. He knows how to tell a story and perhaps this is why, in my opinion, B. Monkey is so much better than the usual drama where a delinquent girl meets an honest man and decides to better her life (genders may be changed here). Even though you can predict the big lines of the story, you're still surprised at certain plot changes.Alan (Wayne Wang favourite Jarid Harris) and Beatrice (Asia 'daughter of Argento) couldn't be further apart she's a bank-robbing criminal, he teaches poor kids and has a jazz show on hospital radio. Once again something that makes you realize that this movie walks a thin line between good cinema and a third-rate tv's movie of the week. Believable acting by Harris, Argento and, not to forget, Rupert Everett helps the movie to stay on the right part of that thin line.

Seeking more excitement in his life, he takes an interest in a collection of people in a local pub who the barman describes as criminals. Despite this Alan approaches the woman of the group &#150; the sexy and charming Beatrice, but is surprised when she responds to his advances. As he gets to know her, he uncovers a damaged soul with a murky past and dark present that perhaps he would be keep out of; however, as much as he is put off he is drawn in and soon finds himself involved deeper than he had ever planned.I'll be honest and say that I was only drawn to this film by the strange title; other than that I had no idea what it was about but decided to give it a stab anyway. However the film seems to be aiming for a mood rather than a narrative and, as a result, this film is more about the tone and feel and thus it fails to really engage because the story isn't there. Well, there is a story but it comes second to the mood and it isn't well developed, is full of illogical holes that just don't convince and feels like a mishmash of other films' ideas. It is interesting at points but ultimately it doesn't work. The film tries to be seedy and introspective, using smoky rooms, jazz and crime as motivators and the normal guy as our way in, but even this doesn't totally work and elements of it failing make it feel like it has all been forced from the start &#150; certainly the choice of the jazz music is way off.However, as the title suggests, the film is more about Beatrice than the other characters and, as such, it is interesting enough even if she isn't as well developed a character as a character driven film would usually require. The performance from Argento is good and she has a real sexy presence that is more than just her taking her clothes off for the cameras &#150; it is an aspect of her character that the film uses well. Harris is every bit as bland as the music he plays and he is the reason why I never bought the main relationship once &#150; OK, she's after a nice guy but would she go for someone so very bland? The rest of the cast are colourful enough and do OK work with very basic material; Rhys-Meyers is good, Everett does his usual lazy, bi-sexual performance, Hart has a small role and the rest are just basic East End thug sorts.Overall this is a film to watch for the sexy, dark presence of Argento and that alone. Outside of her, the narrative is pretty weak and never really convinced me or involved me; the dramatic fireworks come and go without really doing much and by the end I was pretty bored by the whole affair. Argento and some of the support cast make it worth a go but, like Harris and his type of jazz music, this film is consistently bland and uninteresting.

Monkey chronicles the stormy relationship between an impulsive female cat burglar and a conventional male school teacher. Dario Argento's super sexy daughter Asia plays the eponymous character with relish in this beautifully photographed, well-acted, but ultimately forgettable epic. Indeed, you'll have trouble keeping your eyes off the lovely Asia who shows no qualms about showing off her delectable body in tastefully lensed full frontal nudity. An assortment of criminals floats into and out of her life as she struggles like an old western gunfighter to cease her life of crime. Beatrice explains in voice over narration how she came to acquire her name I can get into anything. One day in a pub, a lonely English teacher at a primary school, Alan (Jared Harris) approaches Beatrice. Initially, she rebuffs him because she neither knows nor trusts him. Finally, Alan convinces Beatrice that he poses no threat to her so she agrees to a date the following evening at eight and stands him up. Beatrice's low-life friends&#x97;they might be more accurately described as accomplices--include homosexual Paul (Rupert Everett of Cemetery Man) cut from the same cloth as Noel Coward and a lunatic young hoodlum boyfriend, Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of Ride With The Devil), who is prepared to die for her. Meanwhile, ordinary Alan teaches by day and serves as a disc jockey by night at a local London hospital.Eventually, Beatrice and Alan get together, but Beatrice discovers that the young school teacher cannot get it up. Whether Alan cannot gain an erection in the warm company of the comely Asia--who resembles a brunette Venus on a half-shell&#x97;or because he is too overwhelmed by her abrupt behavior is never established. Eventually, Asia gets him back into shape and the two fall in love. Anyway, Beatrice refuses to work for a local mobster, Frank (Tim Woodward), but complications arise that force her back into crime. Alan has trouble with a student who accuses him of slamming him against a wall after the student stabbed another student in the face with a pencil. The boy's surly mother prefers charges against Alan, but Beatrice and Bruno pay her a visit and change her mind. Naturally, Alan is outraged and manages to get another teaching job far out in the country. Beatrice leaves London and her friends, but she cannot truly leave them and the consequences of her criminal activities come back to haunt her in the wilderness.The performances are tops and director Michael Radford keeps things moving along so the action never stalls out. The chief problem is that none of the characters are interesting. They are either goody-two shoes like Alan or obnoxious criminal types like Bruno. Radford stages a couple of credible jewelry heists, largely smash and grab affairs, and gives his average, unexceptional film more polish than it deserves. Those who must have happy endings will love B. Monkey. This movie breaks the clich√© about the ready-to-have sex mentality of men. When Beatrice knows that she is about to have sex with a guy, she jumps in bed and peels her clothes off quicker than the man can get his pants down. Typically, the man is the ready-to-have sex partner with the woman showing some reluctance. Again, aside from Asia's gorgeous body and some good acting, B. Monkey is like a banana peel. You watch this movie and you will feel like you've make a slip-up.

Monkey is half serious drama about how the past can catch up with you, half violent, all-out action flick, and the combination of the two just doesn't come off. Mainly due to the film being really quite ridiculous.Beatrice (aka B. Monkey) is a jewel thief. She inexplicably falls head over heels for an extremely boring school teacher called Alan. She quits the crime game and tries to be nice and normal, but her past comes back to haunt her and she's forced to go on one last job. This doesn't please Alan, who whines for a bit. They make up and go and live in the countryside, before that troublesome past resurfaces once again in a climax that is neither thrilling nor touching.None of this is helped by Jared Harris' awful acting as Alan, or a script that bores incessantly and is full of huge, gaping holes. The only thing that saves the film from being a total disaster is Beatrice herself, or to be more precise, Asia Argento. She has more screen presence than everyone else in the film put together, and steals pretty much every scene she's in. When she leaves the screen (such as in the horrible, tacked-on subplot about a young boy who's being abused by his mother), you're left begging for her return. Overall, definitely not worth the effort.

B.Monkey rushes by at high speed and tries to combine an apparently impossible romance with gangster-movie elements and black comedy. A guy, who is quite possibly the most well-behaving citizen in all England (grade schoolteacher. serving as a volunteer in a hospital.classic radio DJ.) falls deeply in love with his female opposite (armed robber.tattooed and high-spirited.nymph) and they want to build a new life together. Unfortunately, the girl can't leave her infamous past behind her. Even when the couple flees to the middle of British nowhere, the girl's former partners and enemies follow them at all times. B. Monkey merely depends on a few powerful sequences and a couple of intriguing characters. The creativity and goodwill is there, but the whole finished product still looks like one big muddle. Also, the entire film isn't exactly plausible which makes it even harder to digest. Strictly seen as a black comedy and social satire, it does deserve a bit of praising. Multiple 'human interest'-topics are spoofed here which lifts up the film to a slightly higher dimension (to me, at least). And then there are the acting performances.Especially Rupert Everett impresses as the addicted homosexual friend. Everett is good in portraying `weirdos', like his previous `Dellamorte Dellamore' already stated. Asia Argento is just one adorable angel.Dario's daughter owes a lot to her looks but there's obviously quite some talent present as well in that ravishing body of hers. Thank goodness she's not one of those pretentious actresses who don't take risks in their careers. She's speaking with an incredibly sexy Italian accent and her nude scenes contribute in making this nice little film more memorable.All together, B.Monkey isn't top priority to check out, but it guarantees fun and action from start to finish.

The novel by Andrew Davies was a joy and it's translation to the screen suffers because of the adaptation we see in front of our eyes. It appears this movie has been badly chopped up as indicated by comments by Mr. Radford.This is a film about opposite characters that attract one another in ways that in other circumstances, they wouldn't have met. We meet the nerdish Alan Furnace, a teacher who also volunteers at a hospital where he loves to play jazz at night. He is fond of the great Django Reinhardt, a legend guitarist, whose records one hears on the background.Beatrice is a young woman with a past. She is trying to get out of that life and the unsavory characters around her. When she meets Alan, she has no clue of what is going to happen to her, but she falls for him. Alan wants to get out of London to a quieter and more subdued atmosphere in which he feels Beatrice will feel happy too.Beatrice's past gets in the way as Paul and Bruno come to interrupt the idyllic home life Alan and Beatrice have made for themselves, but in spite of the dangers, in an ironic twist, the couple finally manage to find peace in their newly found paradise.Jared Harris is perfect as Alana. Asia Argento gives a complex reading on Beatrice a role that offers her a lot of opportunities. Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make good contributions to the film.The original film score by Luis Bacalov, a contributor to Mr. Radford in Il Postino, is easy on the ears.

If you want to appreciate the European art/sex film elements of this film, such as full frontal nudity and wild sex scenes, then it will entertain you in that way for a while, as Beatrice and her new lover struggle with his impotence, bad oysters and getting to know each other.When a friend of B's, played by the luscious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers comes into the scene, suddenly there's an actual 2 way plot going somewhere, but this is not until at least 1/3 or 2/3 into the movie.

She has not been given the easiest of parts to carry out in a realistic fashion, so what the hell, she sets her own terms on the character.  And  I loved it, and swallowed the lot.  More than that I came to see the characters and situations as very well drawn,and  well observed sketch on the human condition, and started to recognise and  identify.  The twist at the end had a classical feel to it - she finally becomes camouflaged in the most unlikely setting. (Hope that's sufficiently cryptic.)I loved the sense of place, both of the City and the Yorkshire countryside, the rather made-for-TV style with occasional echoes of documentary. And the very competent cast.  And despite the lead spending quite a bit of time with her clothes off, she does this in a good cause, never gratuitiously, always advancing the plot. I was seduced. A good seven.

Well this film was a great little love story. It seemed to be some kind of crossover between LA FEMME NIKITA and STRAW DOGS, yet just as original as the two. I'm glad to see that a director finally put Argento in a role that could really demonstrate her range as an actress. She pretty much dominates the film with exceptional support from Rupert Everett, Jonathon Rhys-Meyers, and especially Jared Harris. It's slow at times, yet never loses its suspense and intrigue. The cinematography and locations also add to the film's overall experience. It will appeal to fans of struggling love-stories with a nack for danger and intrigue. This is the role Argento was made for.

Starring Asia Argento and Jared Harris in lead roles and Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in supporting roles, it is an unusual cross between a thriller and a melodrama, with equal amounts of love scenes, violence and suspense. This was my introduction to both Argento and Harris and they both pleased me with their performances, especially the lovely Asia who looks so sultry and seductive here. Also Everett and Rhys-Meyers make this film more interesting with their love/hate relationship that ultimately ends with blood. Everett is at his most seductive here as well and he even gets a brief love scene with Asia.B. Monkey is a quite enjoyable film and the storyline is pretty well-crafted, keeping the suspense until the very end. In contrast to many other such sex thrillers, this film also works well as a drama, especially from the angle of the male protagonist. Harris' character is not a traditional hero, but an impotent teacher who is trying to help a violent child. This part shows how noble and caring men are often getting trampled at by loathsome persons, in this case the child's abusive and utterly despicable mother. This makes B. Monkey a mixed bag that aims to please fans of both drama and thrillers.

If she were a blond, even Hitchcock would have used her. She is strong,fierce,bold,kind,unafraid to expose her nice body for passionate sexual interludes.She falls for a nerdish British third grade teacher,Jared Harris, son of late Richard, and is a truly marvelous actor who falls IMMEDIATELY for moll Asia Argento. It has handsome photography in London,Yorkshire,Paris, and in spite of Argento's strong presence,there are some good bits by Rupert Everett who adds class even in this sleazy role.An the young actor/hood is excellent as the rejected lover turned gangster.There is almost too much going on, making the ending a little too pat but it is one of the few crime love stories I have seen with such an engaging actress as Argento.She photographs beautifully and her transitions are so good, one is reminded of the great screen dames like Gloria Grahame, Jeanne Moreau and Tuesday Weld in PRETTY POISON.

Monkey is a showcase for Asia Argento's acting skills and screen presence. What you also get is a lot of britpop, from when it was cool and in. However, the idea that lively girl at the edge of society can't do better than shack up with a straightlaced primary school teacher who lives for the most bloodless 40s jazz and to boot retires to the Yorkshire Dales... That takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.Wisely, the knight in shining armor, who looks like David Caruso and talks like John Major isn't featured on any of the video covers or movie posters. Asia Argento, on the other hand, bares all and looks kind of attractive, but it's the beauty of youth. She also needs to work on her elocution, which at first is cute, but is going to limit her as an actress.Rupert Everett is reliable as the bisexual toff heroin addict, but he never jumps out and runs away with the script. Patrick Rhys-Meyers is a young actor to keep an eye on, though, one of those guys who have bit parts in loads of movies, while you never notice them because they act so well that they blend into the background like chameleons (John Seymour Hoffman is one example, or Donal Logue).On the whole, this movie is as bland as the music the lead listens to. Understatement can be taken too far.

We fall in love just like the usually helpless guy in the story. Events surround and threaten, all designed to highlight the specific charms of the focus and show that we (through our representative) will stick with the girl.Its a simple narrative fold, a trick to engage us in the story. The story is the girl, and the tighter we follow her, the more we are drawn into the story. The problem of course is that its all designed to pull us in, with nothing of value happening while we are in. The usual solution is to acknowledge that and make a point of the future being empty, deliberately so. So Deckard goes of with Rachel into a void. Its about the staying, the belonging.There are only three real values in this. Does the girl charm? Is the story and the charming integrated? What's the world they send us into at the end?This girl is the daughter of a filmmaker who specializes in doing violence to such characters, layering heavy noir dynamics on them. So there's that. She's particularly seductive in an aggressive way, not at all say, like Dalle in Betty Blue, where we the viewer are complicit in the seduction. Dalle matters. We carry her away after the film.Our girl here is nude a few times as if that matters a lot. The hapless guy is a radio storyteller, teacher, musician, champion of social justice as if we needed more than one anchor.She's also a wonderful thief, as if we needed some Ms 45 seduction, that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before, this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. (I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli.) Our girl turns lovely in the country. But its the sideshow with two gay friends that makes this worth watching.These guys are played by Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. If you study narrative, you'll appreciate how this backstory supports the whole. Its quite lovely because she is most sexual, nude and loved when in the company of these men. It gives her an excuse to show us that she is inherently seduction, not deliberately so. It provides a footing for love that is outside of sex, and though based on obsession and addiction transcends them by using them.Everett really seems to understand this. Its his best performance by far. You almost fall in love with him instead of her by misdirection, because that's where the passion is. So it works, sex without sex, love by capture.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

I wanted to watch Rupert Everett's films after reading his extraordinary auto-bio. There are some excellent reviews here already , far better than anything I could write. I have never seen Jared Harris in anything but he is perfect in this roll. He even tries to talk down psychopaths with primary teacher talk. The pencil in cheek scene was particularly amazing for me as it happened to my daughter so she was home-educated as a result. The chaos of an inner-city school is perfectly portrayed. There probably is too much sex but I wasn't bothered it probably brought in a few viewers and frankly having breasts myself they don't bother me. Rupert Everett was excellent as the louche drug addict who seemed to be giving up on life bit by bit. Towards the end he is frightened but is too far gone to really know how to help himself. The channel had a discussion on addiction on before which made it rather more poignant. The cold killer gangsters were good , Bruno was chilling because as a Mum I wonder how easy it is to become a rent boy/gangster desperately seeking love .

I'm a huge Asia fan but I think some of her films stink (XXX and Red Siren leap to mind). I've heard rumors that this version of the film is heavily chopped and that director Radford isn't all that pleased with the finished product. But I don't think it shows that easily, it's damn fine as is.Asia is simply radiant in the lead role and pulls it off well. All others do a splendid job as well, particularly Rupert Everett. I think the story is quite nice, could have used some more complications but overall good. You really get to know Asia and Harris's characters and they grow quite nicely on you. It's mostly Everett's and Myers's characters that are somewhat left unexplained but the film doesn't suffer for it. I'd say this is a nice, effortless film to watch. You don't gain any greater knowledge from it, it's just entertaining, particularly if you like Asia.Overall I'm very satisfied with the film.

Italian women are very attractive, but Dario Argento's daughter is more attractive than most. Luckily for her fans, she isn't too bothered about public image either, which is always a bonus. Asia is well known for pushing the boundaries by doing things such as admitting to taking drugs and having no problems with posing nude for photo shoots and doing nude scenes in her movies. And this movie features plenty of Asia!Unfortunately though, Asia is about this film's only asset. It's true that it is well directed, but that is somewhat lost under the unlikely and predictable storyline. The film tries to blend too many different elements; thriller, romance, feel good and crime most notably and it doesn't blend too well and ends up rather messy. It also doesn't feature too many stand out moments and overall it feels very much a B-movie. The movie tries to lend itself a heart with the way that the two main characters are the complete opposite of each other and yet they still find romance. However, even this aspect of the movie doesn't feel quite right, as in real life a hardened criminal would be very unlikely to fall for a dorky schoolteacher. Another major flaw with this movie is the dialogue, which at times is a little suspect, especially some of things Asia says, they just aren't right for her character. Still, any movie with an often naked Italian babe, sporting an angel tattoo across her stomach has got to be worth a watch, even if it poorly plotted, badly scripted and on the whole, extremely unlikely.

While some plot dynamics are typical of the genre, I disagree with the claims some have made that the plot itself is weak. There are, in fact, some plot elements that constitute unique dramatic formulations, at least relative to English-language films. There are numerous social and cultural themes that are woven into the storyline. Substance abuse and other modes of addiction are incorporated. Domestic violence, too, comes into play. The film itself does not offer much in the way of commentary on these sociocultural facets, and the portrayal of broader social themes appears primarily to serve as a vehicle for character development.The soundtrack is excellent and incorporates quality jazz instrumental tracks as well as contributions from the critically acclaimed band Portishead. The presence of jazz on the soundtrack is paralleled by its presence in the story, so much so in fact that jazz itself takes on thematic and symbolic values.The cinematography is of a high quality, and is characterized by rich, vibrant images. The selection of images and their composition serve several purposes, one of which is to orient the viewer to shifts within the direction of the story. Such mechanisms enjoy considerable subtlety and their use strikes me as neither pretentious nor overly ambitious.Asia Argento deserves special mention, and not just because she is easily one of today's most attractive actresses. Although she is not the only exceptional actor in this cast, it is Argento that really makes the film.

To make her (even) tougher they made her say f*** about a hundred times, yet every time she said the word it was as funny and fresh as the first time. Fortunately, she takes her clothes off nearly as often as she says f***, and she does look good in the nude. Harris is his usual ugly, uncharismatic, untalented self, so the fact that he's miscast is a mere irrelevancy; although the fact that he plays an impotent man does have a ring of truth about it. This nepotistic thespian shouldn't B. in movies, period. Everett lacks credibility and overplays his cool cat routine too often.The movie is absurd, has some rather duh dialog, and the only things going for it are its nice visual quality, the fact that it isn't too boring, and, of course Asia's nudity. With a cast like this, it would have been naive to expect a better movie.If you want a complete listing of Hollywood's nepotist actors and actresses, with pictures and explanations, e-mail me.
