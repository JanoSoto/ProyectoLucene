Of course you will have more depth to the warlock character, if you have seen it, but you will not miss out on anything if you haven't.This sequel is as good as the first movie in the series.Again, the role of the sinister warlock is portrayed by the charismatic Julian Sands. And in this movie the character is much more dark and evil, far more twisted than the warlock portrayed in the first movie. Julian Sands is so perfect for the role of the warlock.The cast is good, and the roles of the druids are good, both for the young druids and the elderly druids.The movie has a bunch of cool effects and wicked magics, something that have to be seen. However, it is not all good though, the scene with the knife went horribly wrong. That knife is perhaps the worst CGI effect I have seen to date.For fans of adventure genres or for people who like to play D&D games, this movie provides good entertainment. And like the first Warlock movie, this also have enough entertainment for more than one watching. I never grow tired of it, at least!

The rules are all changed around here and in many ways it is almost an entirely different movie.  The Warlock in this movie seems nearly indestructible than in the first, and instead of the puritan types that were the ones to try and stop him in the first one, here he must be stopped by druids.  This time the Warlock makes a most memorable first appearance, and then he goes after these magic stones so he can release Satan into the world.  This makes the druid angle seem rather dumb as I don't think they believe in such things.  However, it still is a rather good movie, just not as good as the first...in fact this movie might have seemed better if the first one never happened.  The movie though does follow a certain pattern.  You see scenes of this kids coming into terms with their special powers to stop the Warlock, then a scene of the Warlock finding one of the stones, finally whoever has the stone is killed in an unusual way, and then repeat.  This happens till the end and the big showdown occurs.  I do so enjoy the shotgun scene.  That is about all there is too it, but then the Warlock does kill people in vastly different and interesting ways.  Not a great movie, but it is okay and worth checking out, though it is rather gruesome at times.

The original Warlock was only a modest success but that was still enough to justify a sequel two years later. Warlock The Armageddon has a more ambitious story then the original, a more comedic tone, and is simultaneously more fun and less satisfying then the first.Only loosely connected to the first film, Warlock II builds a wildly different mythology around the titular villain. There's some typical nonsense about lunar and solar eclipse and how the wall between Earth and Hell is thin during this time. This is a opportune moment for the Warlock, upgraded from merely a powerful witch to the literal son of Satan, to reemerge. A sect of druids protect the five rune stones the villain needs to bring about Hell on Earth. A prophecy marks two of their children as the true warriors that will prevent the end of days. The film follows the druids training their youngest members for battle while the Warlock travels across the country, collecting the remaining stones and committing magically-assisted murders.Warlock The Armageddon is essentially two movies stapled together. One is campy but incredibly entertaining while the other is campy and boring. The Warlock's killing spree provides the trashy thrills horror-fans are likely looking for. The film beings with the evil witch being reborn, in a sick and twisted moment, and continues in similarly outrageous fashion. The Warlock comes across each owner of the stones, offing them in ways related to their personality. The death scenes are high-pitched and ridiculous. A gas station attendant has his eye torn out, a snooty art collector is bent into a piece of modern art, a hooker gets scalped, not to mention a lengthy stop at a carnival sideshow. Julian Sands is having a ball. He hams it up, digging into each cheesy one liner the script gives. Sands never winks, maintaining the seriousness of the Warlock character, while letting the audience know what a good time he's having. Gory, silly quasi-slasher thrills like this are probably what you'd expect from an underachieving sequel to a sorta-popular eighties horror movie.The other movie Warlock 2 also is doesn't entertain in the same way. The tale of the druids raising two new warriors is snore-inducing. The audience certainly doesn't care about Chris Young's protagonist, a gee-shucks young kid named Kenny. His romance with Samantha, played by a wooden Paula Marshall, is of no interest at all. The storyline, involving rune stones and ancient prophecies, is horribly clich√©d. It's the kind of mythological story we've heard hundreds of times before in horror and fantasy films. Any time the movie focuses on this plot line, the audience really wishes it would be back to the Warlock killing people.Director Anthony Hickox had previously directed the Waxwork films, Sundown The Vampires in Retreat, and, most pressingly, Hellraiser III Hell on Earth. Like Hellraiser III, Hickox has made a movie about a formally serious villain suddenly performing over-the-top kills and cracking wise about it. Luckily for us, the Warlock is a far better fit for this style then Pinhead. Hickox's direction is energetic, with multiple tracking shots of bodies flying through the air. His creativity, which has always been fun but undisciplined, is best displayed during the final fight. The Warlock explodes a building, walking back to Earth on an invisible staircase. He dismembers enemies with his hands and shoots them down with his finger. However, the climax proves a bit underwhelming. Not only is the bland hero pitted against the far more charismatic Sands, the way the villain is defeated comes out of nowhere.I've never gotten around to seeing Warlock III but the lack of Julian Sands doesn't make me quick to check it out. Warlock The Armageddon probably wouldn't be half as much as it is without Sands' camping it up. It's a fairly undemanding flick for horror geeks and certainly would have prospered from a more balanced and creative script. But, then again, what can you expect from an in-name-only sequel to a sort-of obscure movie.

The first relied heavily on the story, which was a about a unfortunate 90's working girl who is tormented by the son of the devil when a witchhunter chases him through time to the present day. It sounds far fetched, but it is surprisingly well-written. This one is about the return of the Warlock, this time he's trying to collect 7 coveted runestones that, once collected, will spell out the true name of his demon father and ultimately destroy the world (hence the title, The Armageddon). This one is much campier and much, much gorier than the first. I love Anthony Hickox though, I just can't help it. He's like Brian Yuzna, crazy, far-fetched stories, campy dialogue, tongue-in-cheek humor (check out Waxwork 2) and lots of over-the-top (but tasteful enough to usually avoid being unrated) gore. A boy learns that he is a descendant of a long line of druids, a group who has been covertly fighting the evil and superhuman for centuries. Instead of brawn, he must strengthen his mental power in order to face a final showdown of good and evil. Julian Sands once again hams it up and makes you hate him, while unleashing his unholy rage in some of the most creative kill scenes ever. I won't give much away, but he is reborn through a beautiful woman in a very painful manner, and the folks possessing the runestones get put through hell, let me tell you. The deaths are very gory, SFX-filled and creative, just watch what happens to the art collector. He becomes part of his own collection, so to speak.If you liked Children of the Corn 3, Hellraiser 3, the Waxwork series and can take campy dialogue with a grain of tolerant salt, then rent this movie for solid entertainment (for 85 minutes or so.)

Today, high school teen and future warlock Kenny Travis (Chris Young) is having a series of problems involving his girlfriend Samantha (Paula Marshall) and the school bully Andy. (Craig Hurley) Kenny's father Will (Steve Kahan) tells him of his destiny, but he would rather get along with Samantha. The Warlock (Julian Sands) is reborn and goes off in search of the five sacred stones that are needed to bring his father back to Earth. One of the stones is held by fashionista Paula Dare (Joanna Pacula) and acquires it forcefully. Kenny learns that he comes from a long line of druids who protect the world instead of destroying it and that only he can defeat the Warlock. Will and his Warlock friend Franks (R.G. Armstrong) teach him to learn the ways of the druids to fight the Warlock, who continues on a bloodbathed path to find the stones. With Samantha coming along to help, Kenny takes on the Warlock for the fight of mankind.The Good News I'm really glad this one is a bloodbath. The first one was a very decent effort that featured very few gore effects, but this one contained several impressive kills. Being impaled on a series of spikes from a torture chamber, having an eye ripped out, having more than twenty slash marks all over their body, and being dropped over thirty feet onto a skylight, then falling trough with blood splattering on the onlookers are just some of the scenes which are more violent in here than in the first one. The elevator scene, with the stabbing, was the real killing highlight because of the suspense it involved. Because there was a couple false movements where something didn't happen when it was believed to have been, then it suddenly happens does shock the first time viewer. However, than is the only main jump in the movie. Sands really seems to have fun in the role as he actually kills people in this movie. He almost becomes a sort of Freddy-ish killer in this movie, as he does have a few pretty funny comments to his victims, but they just don't seem as good as Freddy's lines. He does kill with abandon, so it does come as a surprise when he kills them. The actual method of killing the Warlock was pretty creative, with the whole scene carrying out pretty entertaining way. The battle shifts back and forth as no one has a clear-cut advantage over the other and it never loses your interest.The Bad News There was a serious lack of jumps in this movie compared to the first one. The first one was pretty clever in how it build up suspense in it through the use of camera, scene layout, lighting, etc. This one simply abandoned that in favor of simply showing images that could've been scarier, but instead seems rather dull. If you get used to the violence, this becomes a very shock-less movie over time. The Freddy lines do need some work, as only a few are actually pretty funny. If only they would've taken the same approach, then part three would've been the laugh-fest it could been.The Final Verdict It could've been a whole better than what it was, but as it stands, this is a very entertaining film. It has a lot more blood and gore than the first one, so gore hounds will love this one. Seek it out if you like the first one or if supernatural films about witches and warlocks are up your alley.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.

However place it within the genre of comedy, and it is up there challenging with the best of comedy films.The basic storyline made it easy to understand i.e. did not have to concentrate, which is good because i was crying with laughter too much.It follows the old theme of the evil being lead back to the main characters at the end, via the collection of 6 stones, randomly placed around the world, from Circuses to museums.Excellent acting from the son of the devil, made me believe that he actually was the son of the devil and his ways of murdering the stone holders was humorous to say the least, except for the one in the circus where that brought genuine fear to my mind.A well written script with such instances as rabbits being run over and hair being pulled off makes for an exciting and humorous viewing of one of my favouritist films of all time.Simply an 8.5/10 due to effective blood ridden moments, great acting and funny moments.Hail the guy that created this masterpiece  "},{"Title":"MORE VIOLENT MORE EVIL!!","Date":"27 December 1999","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Okay this wasn't a great movie but Julian Sands is great as the warlock. more violent that the original, Part 2 shows the Warlock as a much eviler being which I liked.

The narrative begins as such 'Throughout time, people known as Druids have used their mystical powers to protect the Earth from evil. Once every millennium, when the sun aligns with the moon, these guardians summon the magic of their sacred rune stones in the quest to prevent the birth of Satan's son...' Druids would be working hard to prevent untoward events, yes. But the birth of Satan's son is not a concern to the Druids, who also realize and understand that Satan is a Christian heresy and invention, and not one that any pagan would hold in high regard. Therefore, the entire plot of this movie is moot and negated, as far as learning or 'getting' anything from this movie.However, it is an entertaining thriller with a few surprises, turns and even a twist or two. Classic 'B' movie horror, again starring Julian Sands, and as sequels go, I find this one to be a more entertaining endeavor than the flick from which it spawned. The idea of the Druid Stones is ancient, though they had nothing to do with the birth of Satan's son. As legend has it, the Druid Stones were the only keys to the seven World Gates, leading to seven different areas within the three dimensions of this World; IE Primordial, Psychic, and Ethereal planes. Therefore, the signs and omens utilized within the context of this movie are quite good and well used. The story centers around two young people, Kenny (played by Chris Young *Buck of Candy/Aykroyd's 'The Great Outdoors'*) and Samantha (Paula Marshall, who's had a rather...obscure acting career, so far). Both are children of Druid heritage and blood, and although neither have been trained, taught, nor raised within the magickal system, now they must realize their powers and abilities in order to prevent the end of the world. A bit far-fetched, if you ask me. What's also a bit far-fetched is the very idea that a Druid's power comes from 'God.' Druids were here thousands of years before christians and the Hebrew god YWYH. That was just stupid. Outright ignorant. A small listing of well-seasoned actors makes this movie quite enjoyable, regardless of the puerility of story line/plot. This production is full of 'B' movie effects and classic horror fare. The mirror scene with the carny has a very strong 'Dean Koontz' feel to it with the end of that scene finishing out in an almost Hellraiser style. All in all, not a bad way to kill ninety minutes.This movie rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend .

W2 is much more gorier if going by the first half of the original, with some real over the top blood spilliages, like Ms Pacula's demise.

He's infatuated with a girl, Sam (Paula Marshall) acting in a Romeo and Juliet play, who also possesses the same talent. What I liked too about this one, was the humour, caused mostly by Sands, delivering some killer lines, while also looking cool spewing black blood. Him breaking out of his mother's vagina, near the start (very icky) has him saying, the most memorable line, where you have to hear it for yourself. Director, Hickox, still fresh off the heals of Hellraiser 3, which also starred Marshall, makes a name for himself with these super entertaining flicks (the sexual psychological C Thomas Howell thriller, Payback came next) with some nice ECU shots, like one involving a smiling, and very much in love Marshall. The battle to the death between good and evil is very suspenseful, and I guess was a but overlong, but I couldn't go back to ever watching the original, as this is super entertaining, with a lot of yucky blood, and great effects, and that great warlock humour.

So basically Warlock (human) didn't fail in his quest, to which comes debate if this movie is a sequel as Warlock is now more of Demon and not human at all...But intro story is now different, and again debatable, why would Satan stop at only one plan to destroy humanity... Thus we are greeted with Druids, their sacred stones and rituals to stop the evil. And again Warlock comes to play to take something and bring back to Earth the very evil that was stopped in 1st movie...Unfortunately as story is not that bad at all but actors and visual effects are, with Blu-ray version out you can clearly see many defects of visuals, mostly when Warlock is steeping down the invisible stairs, when he is burning with badly rendered pixel fire and when Kenny (the 1st warrior) is thrown onto some sort of pipe that magically isn't static in the concrete but moves while he's breathing.But overall if you like sadistic movies where bad guy tortures his victims with supernatural powers and cannot be stopped easily, you will enjoy this B class Horror flick.

The Druids as someone else stated had no beliefs even remotely akin to Christianity at all. Neither did those who practiced witchcraft at any time.

Julian Sands, still the king of horror.  He's better than Sting and Bruce Payne.  I was kind of sad because he wasn't in the 3rd Warlock film.  I kind of missed Julian Sands in the 3rd.  I really wish I would the copies of Warlock, Warlock  The Armageddon, and Warlock III  The End of Innocence on vhs and dvds.  I love to watcht them all the time if nobody else would mind letting me know on where I could find them somewhere in America and some other users would just write me an email about this.  The 2nd one rocks, I have to admit, Julian really had a hot body and being covered with blue ooze while he was walking towards to the false creator.  Julian still is really cute about the whole thing.  It was kind of funny when he was dancing around and then splattering the place with black blood.  I think Julian has the greatest taste for this film.  Another thing I love the movie was when Kenny and Samantha were fighting against the warlock at the same time.  Julian really looked pretty damn good with an earring in his ear, but his smile still rocks to me.  He's a super hot babe.  If he reads this thing, he might go out of his mind.

Given all that it was still a very watchable film. I have noted one error in the listed credits. Charles Hallahan is listed as Ted Ellinson, the father of the female lead in the story. Actually that part was played by Bruce Glover(best known from Diamonds are Forever.) Hallahan actually played Ethan Larson. The opening scene was somewhat confusing.

When I say  Movie  I was convinced it was one of those made for television movies ( TVM ) since everything was so brightly lit and plastic looking . Unsure what I was getting I picked up the TV guide which informed me the movie was WARLOCK THE ARMAGEDDON . I`d seen the original WARLOCK and found it disappointing but after seeing the sequel the original was some kind of masterwork in comparisonThe first problem is with Anthony Hickox directing . After seeing HELLRAISER 3  HELL ON EARTH I had some reservations about Hickox ability as a director and after seeing this I do hold the view that he`s not much cop as a director . As I said everything about this movie is far too brightly lit and plastic looking just like you`d see in a TVM while the cast are either poor actors or they`ve been poorly directed . Hickox also insists on filming sequences in slow motion for no other reason than it seemed like a good idea at the time . I also think we could have done without blood splashing everywhere The script too is very bad with the characters being nothing more than cyphers . It lacks any type of idiosyncratic dialogue too . Take this scene for example where the warlock approaches a New York taxi driverWarlock  I want you to transport me to Chicago Taxi driver  Get the f*ck outta my face buddy So there you go the only written scene that features anything resembling characterisation revolves around a stereotypical view of NYC cab drivers . But my major problem with the script involves the plot - I`m not sure it actually has one . What happens is that the Warlock is born ( From a scene stolen from XTRO ) and he goes on a journey which involves him killing people in a bloody way every five minutes . I criticised the original movie for not using its great potential but this sequel had no potential to start with I suppose gore hounds might like it but anyone expecting a coherent story and good acting should give this a wide berth   "}{"Title":"What does the Warlock and the biblical Samson have in common?","Date":"27 March 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The original &#x84;Warlock-movie had much going for it it had a compelling storyline that seemed to have jumped straight out of a comic book. Director and crew were obviously enthusiastic, producing a film that had all the best traits of cheap, yet dedicated horror-flick. And last but not least, it had an excellent cast, the chemistry being near perfect. Especially Julian Sands as evil incarnated had a charm and presence that one couldn't help but to root for him, despite all his mischief.Indeed, Warlock has the stuff that made it a cult-movie. Sadly, same cannot be said about its sequel. First, apart from Julian Sands, none of the original cast has returned. The well-worn though charming time-travel aspects (works almost every time, doesn't it?) are not present, the warlock has even lost his ponytail! It's almost like we're watching a similar, though not the same character as the super-smooth male-witch of the first part. It's not that the rest of the cast is bad either &#x96; having veterans like R.G Armstrong, Joanna Pacula and Zach Galligan &#x96; but Lori Singer and Richard E. Grant are missed greatly.Same goes for the special effects true, Warlock II is slightly gorier than its predecessor and, true, the effects where still pre-CGI and hence had a more natural feel than 99 percent of the SFX today, but none of the scenes could match the magic that the original Warlock had.Speaking of Zach Galligan, compare Gremlins to Gremlins 2 yes, the sequel was disappointing because it couldn't live up to the first part, but in the end, alright, it wasn't a bad movie. In the end, what saved the movie is the direction of Anthony Hickox who is in the same league with Miner; a veteran of cheap, straight-to-video horror flicks with a heart (minor trash-gems like Waxworks, Full Eclipse and Spaceshift are testament to that).In retrospect, it's not even a bad movie if it had stood on its own. Especially if compared to the horrid Warlock III which, if you're a Warlock-fan and haven't seen it yet, I can only recommend avoid it like&#x85; well, like a warlock avoids salt! I'll join the general consensus (of the time of writing &#x96; things may look different if you happen to read this in a hundred years or so), and give the film five points from five &#x96; and if I'll watch a few more contemporary horror flicks, infested with CGI and lifeless actors, I may even give it six or seven.

How about this when a woman dons the wrong necklace during an eclipse the usual process of impregnation, gestation and delivery are amalgamated and fast tracked to a 40 second process &#x96; I wouldn't be surprised if the Japanese were involved, they make everything run more smoothly &#x96; imagine her surprise (if all that wasn't shock enough!) that her new child is immediately adult sized and can speak.In a further miraculous turn she instantly regains her pre-baby body (Hollywood stars = JEALOUS!!), only to have the unfortunate news that she is about to die and have her own skin turned into a map.The upshot of W2 is that once again the Warlock is trying to bring about naughty things, this time the birth of Satan's son. He has but 6 days after his 'rebirth' to collect 6 precious stones in between eclipses while God ain't looking.Of course he can't have it all his way, two I know that guy from somewhere character actors and an old guy turn out to be modern day druids hellbent on stopping the Warlock from succeeding, only they can't do it alone so they conscript two young teens named Kenny and Samantha to be Druid-Warriors (what a combo that must be in Dungeons and Dragons) to do most of the leg work for them.So again we have a situation where the Warlock fangs around collecting things while the good guys prep his downfall from a remote location. This is because realistically there is no way known that two kids could take on a Warlock, so they must keep the two sides apart until the finale, by which time the audience no longer cares and will believe anything if it helps end the movie.Training for the young witch-fighting duo consists of learning to deal with dodgy CGI &#x96; seriously this was made in the 90s and Star Wars puts it in the shade as far as FX go &#x96; and tension is created by them repeatedly being told the same facts about the Warlock&#x85; he's dangerous, he'll kill you, blah-blah-blah.The amusement on the other hand is created unintentionally by a Reverend and father of Samantha, through his overacting and hamming up every scene that he appears in. I know this was never going to be a serious drama but surely someone better than him was around? Final Rating &#x96; 4.5 / 10.

The acting is acceptable, and the script is alright.It's kind of funny how the premise of this movie has the Warlock moving from east to the west coast, opposite of the first film. But there was no interaction between the lead heroes and the warlock until the vary end. That is where this film falls short.

Gone where the rubber reality movies from the eighties, we now had wacky morphing shots and lame digital back drops in every other movie. Good bye `Videodrome', hello `Lawnmower Man'.`Warlock 2', (also gone were the roman numerals after the sequel's title, because whoa the shame of being a crappy part two) has these really bad CG effects that used to look so amazing and fresh when you where a teenager raised on rubber, but now, man oh man are they dated and corny. Personal favorite CG moment the morph into art sculpture. Hilarious.There are also some early nineties keystones. For one thing this is a Trimark film, and Trimark really produced some bad movies back in the day. `Death Wish V' was garbage, as was `Leprechaun Episode 1'. Also notice the lead wearing flannel in the middle of summer in southern California. Yes, people did that, I did that.This reminds me of why Scream took off as it did. From '88 on all we had where campy Nightmare on Elm Street rip offs that had no horror or suspense and only offered hokey effects and surreal death scenes. `Scream' at least put things back into a reality teens could identify, and didn't bog the plot down with pointless mumbo-jumbo.I can say this about the film. Anthony Hickox is a slick director that is better then his movies allow him to be. He makes interesting choices with camera movement and performances. I love his style, very polished. Most of his movies suffer from the lazy scripts he's handcuffed with. You can only paint a turd so much, and Hickox is a great painter, but this script is so bad, he can't razzle dazzle his way above it. It sinks his ship as he shoots off fireworks.I give this movie at east 2 out of 10 for Anthony's kinetic style, but the rest of it is a laughable bore. Sands is not scary, the hero is a wimp that does nothing but complain, the girlfriend is too old for him, and the druid angle did nothing but pad the action out with some half baked plot conveniences.Besides the above, I can't recommend this movie because it has a magic dagger in it, and once you put that in your movie, all is lost. Never put a magic dagger in your film. Bad Bad Bad.FHTEVL "},{"Title":"Thinking Caps off??.... Good....

During this short period of time, the Devil has the chance to take over the earth if &#150; and only IF &#150; his son, the Warlock, manages to bring together five magical stones and involve them in some sort of satanic ritual. The only individuals that are able to prevent the Warlock from raising the Armageddon are carefully selected druids; people that have to die in their human form and get reborn as Godly warriors. What the hell?!? The biggest advantage of low-brained cheese horror is that you never require seeing the original in order to enjoy the sequels. I recall seeing Warlock long time ago, but I don't remember much, except that the basic plot outline was entirely different than the events featuring in Warlock The Armageddon. Julian Sands (still a regretfully underrated actor) once again stars as the Warlock, and he emerges &#150; fully-grown &#150; from the womb of poor woman just because she disposes of the first stone. His journey starts in New York, and our anti-hero has to travel all across the USA for gathering all the stones before he's expected in sunny California for the actual showdown. Warlock Armageddon is a surprisingly entertaining B-movie, mainly because it's fast-paced and featuring quite a large amount of gory killing sequences. Julian Sands' performance also contributes a lot to the fun-factor of this movie, as he portrays his Warlock character as a truly obnoxious bastard who walks up the catwalk in the middle of fashion shows and deliberately runs his fast car over cute innocent bunnies. Naturally the script contains a lot of stupid dialogs and absurdly grotesque situations, but still one particular sequence is effectively eerie and disturbing, namely when the Warlock enters the traveling freak show to collect his third stone. In the House of Wonders he encounters a creepy midget and some genuine medieval torture devices. The 'heroic' characters are pretty lame and their extended druid-trainings (reminiscent to the Jedi-Knight training) are the least interesting moments of the entire film.

As stated in earlier comments, Sands plays a super Warlock who is neigh indestructible, which takes away from the movie, at least to me.  I would like to know if he is playing the same character as from the first movie, or another one entirely, which never gets answered. Sands has some good lines, but, since the Warlock could not be killed, he just kinda hung out, killed some poor shmoo, took his trippy rock, and continued on his merry way. The heros were both annoying, and the plotline about druids and God and saving the world from an imprisoned Satan are all rubbish. What self respecting lord of all evil get's imprisoned by frelling druids in the first place? The part where the guy get's turned into a sculpture was cool, as was the secondary character played by the dude from Friday the Thirteenth The series. It is good to see him play a hero type for one. Also, it was funny to see Zack Galliger in it from Gremlins. I hope I spelled his name right. Joanna Pacula must have need the cash, as she was in this movie for all of five minutes before she got axed. The deaths in the movie, and there were many, were rather novel, but it did not save it from being Bollex.  "}]
