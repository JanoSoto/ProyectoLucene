I think I'll pass on that.  Well, I went into the theater not thinking it was going to be bad, but I expected more of an amusing film that isn't really high on ingenuity.  True, Varsity Blues has those standard teen elements like wild drinking parties, the school slut, etc.  But it never overuses those elements.  It's more of a compelling comedy-drama about football that delivers a fine message about sportsmanship.  You have a pretty good idea how it's going to end up, but it's the way it's executed that makes it special.  Jon Voight is absolutely terrific as the no-nonsense coach.  He's the kind of character you want to stab in the chest every minute he's on screen, and Voight was a perfect choice.  The film dabbles with elements of the sport that probably hit home to some high school football players.  Voight's character has only one goal winning.  And he doesn't care how he gets to that goal.  If he has to shoot drugs into every one of his players, he's going to arrive at that goal.  And I'm sure there are coaches out there who have that selfish goal.  Then James Van Der Beek comes along, and his character is not really concerned with winning or playing football in the first place.  But he likes football, has fun with it and simply wants to play a good, honest game.  If the team wins, good.  If it doesn't, so what.  He has a good locker room speech at the end of the movie.  Varsity Blues is funny, moving and wonderfully acted.  It might appeal more to teens and young adults, more than the older ones, but I still suggest everyone check it out.

Well, it's not -- it's actually quite good.  It deals fairly realistically with the trials and tribulations of Dawson . . . sorry, Mox (James Van Der Beek), the backup quarterback more interested in Catcher in the Rye than in his own playbook, who is forced to become the starter for his team.  The movie's filled with cliches  the town obsessed with the football team; the overweight, goofy lineman; the slutty cheerleader with the heart of gold; the arrogant coach; the teacher straight out of an early 80's Van Halen video; etc, etc.  Surprisingly, there's enough twisted and wrinkles thrown into these cliches to make the story seem pretty fresh, if not entirely original.  You know how the story's going to end, but you're not always sure how it's going to get there, and that's what keeps it interesting.Van Der Beek is very good, much better that I ever thought I'd give him credit for.  Also good  Paul Walker as the original starting quarterback, and Amy Smart as Van Der Beek's smart girlfriend.  They played real characters as opposed to stereotypes, and I thought their performances really made the movie.  Surprisingly, I thought the weakest link was Jon Voight as the head coach.  He was a cardboard villain, no substance to him whatsoever.  I kept waiting for the film to explain why he wanted to win so bad, why he'd push his kids with such inhuman cruelty . . . and besides because he wants to win, an answer was never given.  Too bad, although I think this was more the fault of the script than of Mr. Voight.It's certainly not the best movie ever made -- for that matter, it's not even the best football movie ever made -- but it's still good. It has heart, and most of the performances make this film a cut above most of the Teen Films that are out there.

The starting quarterback runs the town, the coach is considered a God (as long as he's winning), and the parents all live vicariously through their children. And most of the time, the kids actually playing football love the game too. But in the small town of West Caanan, the kids are running rampant, and the coach (Jon Voight) doesn't care. James Van Der Beek stars as Jonathon Moxon (Mox), the backup quarterback of the high school football team. And he's happy with his situation. He gets to sit on the sidelines and read, hang out with the cool kids, and basically just wait until he can get out of this one horse town and head off to Brown University. But one day he sees the coach injecting pain killers into the knee of the starting quarterback. Then one of his best friends, Billy Bob, seems to have a concussion, but the coach makes him play. When the starting QB goes down, Mox is handed the team and is forced to decide whether to be the King of West Caanan, or to live his life the way he wants it to be lived. I guess it wasn't a bad movie. The football scenes were done extremely well, and I generally liked the people I was supposed to like, and didn't like the people I wasn't supposed to like. But the movie lacked a certain focus. There were too many other things going on that didn't seem to have anything to do with the movie. The whole stripper/teacher thing didn't do anything but make me think back to my high school years and realize I didn't want to see any of those teachers naked. Then there was the black running back who claimed that the coach was a racist. He said that whenever they got near the goal line, the coach would always give the ball to a white guy so he could soak up the glory. While that may have been true, there was nothing in the movie to show that the coach was a racist. The only thing in the movie that said he was a racist was the black player saying he was. The whole race issue seemed to be thrown in there just for the sake of having it, rather than serving any purpose. Some of the characters were too stereotypical. Mox's girlfriend for instance. As soon as Mox became the starting QB, his life started to change. In the town of West Caanan, starting QB was a position of popularity. But instead of letting Mox enjoy himself, even for a second, she started telling him he had changed. I figured that was going to happen, but don't you think a girlfriend would allow her boyfriend to enjoy his moment in the spotlight for just a few minutes before telling him he's not the man she fell in love with? Jon Voight's character was another one. I never played high school football, so maybe that's the way a coach is, but actually willing to ruin a kids life by making him play with a serious injury? And actually choking another player? I thought that his character went a little too far. It made him look extremely bad when that point had already been made.My last rant has to do with the character of Darcy. She was the cheerleader who was dating the starting QB. As soon as he got injured, she started hitting on Mox. When she finally got him to come over to her house, he resisted her. Then she broke down and cried, and Mox solved all her problems in a few seconds. Much too quick a resolution for her. But I must say, I'll never look at whipped cream the same way again. Overall I did enjoy Varsity Blues. It was fun to watch, even though it had a lot of script problems. The actors seemed to be having fun with their roles, and that made the movie better. So even though it had a lot of problems, overall it was enjoyable. And now, I'm off to find some whipped cream.

OK, so we know who will win the Big Game, and that the Hero won't sell out to the mean and selfish 23-District-Championships-Coach (Jon Voigt).  The movie is well paced and a pleasant diversion; (many in the audience actually applauded at the climactic scenes in the final moments).What I find most interesting about the fact that this film was produced in association with MTV, is that for a Network ostensibly dedicated to iconoclastic themes and attitudes (i.e., anti-establishment and counter-culture), this movie is remarkably old-fashioned in the adherence to values espoused by the hero.  After he becomes the starting quarterback, he resists the come-ons of his predecessor's beautiful girlfriend, and he will sacrifice his own scholarship to Brown University (an Ivy League school in Rhode Island for those of you not familiar) rather than let another player be used and potentially physically damaged by the unscrupulous coach.Some of the scenes are reminiscent of other football films The Longest Yard, All the Right Moves, North Dallas Forty, and so on, but I guess there are no real surprises these days after decades of the same essential stories in Hollywood.  This is not just a football movie or a guy movie however, and it's well worth a look.

And that is the compulsive, hereditary, obsessive behavior that peers and parents have towards their kids playing sports.  I have lived in Canada all my life in what would be considered somewhere in between a city like New York and a town like West Canaan.  Take a look at Springfield Illinois (pop. about 300,000) and that is about the size of the cities that I have grown up in.  And when I have been to and played hockey at local small rinks, parents become stupid.  They yell at the refs, there is sometimes the threat of violence and really it is sheer luncacy that prevails at events like this one.  Is it that they try to live vicariously through their kids?  That they want to see their kids do something that they never could?  Besides Kilmer being an idiot and a control freak in the film, I thought Varsity Blues' central issue was to show how obsessed we all are when it comes to sports and our kids achieving greatness, at any level.Varsity Blues is a great film.  And what I enjoyed most about it was the acting and the football scenes.  James VDB shows that he is capable of playing someone other than Dawson Leery.  And his range in here is perfect.  It also has to be mentioned that if this film was taken more seriously than it was, then I really think that John Voigt would be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as the control freak Bud Kilmer.  He is the embodiment of an American football coach that seems to care only about his reputation and not his player's welfare.  His southern, red neck twang, his pretencious gum chewing, his snarl when he barks orders and his domination of the entire town just by a simple comment made in a local diner shows how versatile and understanding of an actor that Voigt is.  Coincidentally, I had just rented Anaconda two days before I saw this on Viewers Choice, and I was truly amazed at the range by Voigt.  He really is terrific in this film. I also have to mention Ron Lester who plays Billy Bob, the guargantuanly over weight line backer with a heart of gold.  At first when we meet him he is a caricature of every other over weight star athlete.  He eats fatty foods like they were going out of style, he is the life of the party as he pukes and then comes back for more and he is one of the guys.  But later in the film we see his character grow.  There is more to his character than we initially see, and when he is given an opportunity to act, he is perfect as we see how he feels and how hurt he is.  This really should be a breakout role for him.  Varsity Blues has some of the best football action I've ever seen filmed.  The plays are realistic looking, the hits are violent and the symmetry of the completed plays are awesome to watch.  This is a film that makes you feel like you are really watching a high school football game.There is really nothing wrong with Varsity Blues and if you enjoy highschool themes like relationships and humour then you will probably love this film.  And there is one more thing to love about this film, well two actually, if you are a guy that is.  Ms. Davis and Darcy Sears.  That whip cream bikini is something I'll never forget.  What a dish.

This movie does a good job at holding my attention and bringing back some good high school memories.Brian Robbin's film is about a Texas football team in the town of West Canaan. After the star quarterback is injured, the back up guy, Moxon is forced to deal with his relentless coach Kilmer, his disapproving girlfriend, and his football-loving parents while starting in his new role that is all strange for him.The acting is pretty good. This is the first time I saw James Van Der Beek on film because I refuse to watch Dawson's Creek, but he does a pretty good job. Jon Voight gives a masterful performance as Kilmer and he just made me despise the character. Paul Walker does a good job and he does not even drive any cars! Overall, this may be a clichéd sports film, but there are some subtle differences such as scenes involving whipped cream, religious little brothers, and a health teacher who is much more than that. Despite some flaws, I couldn't help but root for the Moxon kid. I rate this film 9/10.

All the well-worn clichés are here, along with the pathetic ethos of sexual ethics and substance abuse that will only continue to carry American society further down into the gutter of self-depravity. The context of football is seemingly irrelevant; any kind of activity that attempts to distract such low-life people from the sad reality of their empty lives would suffice. The inter-mixture of patriotism, religion, sport and hero-worship is so confused as to further weaken and destroy any sentiments that may be engendered within the viewer. Although the final scenes are vaguely heart-warming, the trollop that has preceded them only ensure that the viewer really can't give a stuff about any of the characters...

This definitely isn't 'Beavis And Butt-head Do America' or 'Jackass The Movie'. The serious approach never really feels like it is taking itself too seriously, there is still obvious satire and blatantly crude gags littered about. 1999 was a long time ago now, and just taking a fast glance around this film we see a whole bunch of recognizable faces nowadays. Jon Voight who we all know from his seemingly endless slew of good performances, Paul Walker of 'The Fast And The Furious' fame, Ali Larter, Amy Smart, Scott Caan. But what about James Van Der Beek? This guy is a decent enough actor, he really gives off the right vibe as the kid who would rather read Vonnegut on the sidelines rather than play football, and I think it's quite shameful that he isn't in more films like this, he was almost generation-defining with his fame garnered from 'Dawson's Creek'. I guess the fact that he pretty much disappeared from the face of the Earth after he made 'The Rules Of Attraction' just helps to ensure the cult-status of films like 'Varsity Blues' in the first place. We have two people working on this project who also worked on 'Good Burger' a few years prior, our director Brian Robbins and Ron Lester who plays one of our more memorable characters here, and it's nice to see them all stepping up the maturity level a little bit. They went from graduating middle school (Nickelodeon) to graduating high school (MTV) in just two years.I remember when this film first appeared in 1999, and I remember it being quite a popular teen movie at the time, and I'm only slightly disappointed in myself for having not watched it for a good 13 years after it was made. The film doesn't make you dig deep, it can be slightly predictable, but you are sure to walk away from this one feeling good about what you've just seen.Also, every time I see Jon Voight, I can't help but think of Jerry Reed from 'The Waterboy' one year earlier.VARSITY BLUES -----8/10.

I was surprised at how engrossing and entertaining Varsity Blues is, much more so than similar films, like Remember the Titans (2000) and scores of others.The story revolves around a second-string quarterback, Mox (James Van Der Beek), who doesn't take football too seriously because he's consigned to the bench, but when the team's star-quarterback is seriously injured (Paul Walker), Mox rises to the challenge and begins to experience all the perks that come with being the football hero of the town.I'm not a huge fan of sports film, unless they successfully tap into other genres. Varsity Blues does this and is part high school dramedy. The movie features everything you'd want in a film of this ilk -- the sexpot cheerleader (Ali Larter), wild schoolmates (Scott Caan, Ron Lester), the smart girl (Amy Smart, no pun intended), wild parties, miscellaneous coming-of-age antics, megalomaniac coach (Jon Voight) and everything that goes with intense sports competition.Some people complain that the film's unrealistic because of all the extreme things that occur, but the team in Varsity Blues represents the typical champion high school football team and therefore they experience the various crazy things these types of teams encounter in real life. It was the same thing with Platoon. Veterans of Vietnam say no one platoon would undergo all that this platoon experienced, but the group is a microcosm of all platoons throughout the Vietnam war. It also might come across as too much because filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame.Others complain about the lack of assistant coaches in the second half of the final game, but we'll have to assume that they went with a certain person and the film just doesn't show it. I rate Varsity Blues as high as I do because it's a stand-out sports film and high school dramedy.

There was one major theme in this film, and if the moviemakers wanted to show that they had something to say to teens, they would have pursued it. That theme, how teenage athletes are pushed to exceed the expectations of their loser parents, is valid and would have showed that teens in the 90's are smart and sophisticated. But this plotline was superficial at best, and instead we were treated to drunken teens driving around naked (remember when drunk driving was bad? I guess not if your a teenager) and their stripper-by-night teachers. All of this is geared to cater to the overactive hormones of the mindless under 18-year- old-males in the audience. The result is a film that glorifies the very behavior it claims to be chastising.

There is, for instance, the maniacal coach, driving his players to dangerous extremes on the field and circumventing sound medical advice for his own personal glory; the overbearing fathers obsessively attempting to recapture their former glory through their pumped-up progeny; the crybaby fat boy who throws up buckets of food at the seemingly numberless drunken orgies the boys participate in; the sensible boy whose head is not turned by sudden fame and fortune; and the supportive football-hating girlfriend who tries to keep her sweetie in tow despite his sudden ascension to the rank of football hero. All this doesn't take into account the bubbleheaded sexpot sex ed teacher who moonlights at the local strip joint; the befuddled cops; the drunken, smart-mouthed jock who hijacks a cop car and spends the evening joyriding through town with a bevy of naked, nubile girls from the neighborhood; or the horny young lady who dresses down and splashes on a whipped cream bikini only to be rejected by the pure-in-heart hero.Then we arrive at the final game and the unconvincing showdown between the villainous coach and the righteously rebellious players led by the hero Moxon. Who will be victorious? If you have to ask, perhaps this is your first time at one of these movies. As this is an MTV movie production, the football scenes are, of course, pumped up with a blaring rock soundtrack that tries in vain to get the adrenalin flowing or the emotions charged.

For 17 years, I avoided seeing this film, I figured it would be a steaming pile full of good looking people with their shirts off, but after catching the ending on TV, I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. In Texas, football is everything, even at the high school level. The West Canaan Coyotes are one of the best teams in the state, thanks to a hard nosed, old school coach, and an NFL bound Quarterback, but their perfect season takes a turn when the Quarterback goes down with a serious knee injury. The Coyotes are left in the hands of John Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a kid who hasn't taken a snap in three years, who is only on the team because of his father. The coach hates him, the town doubts him, but something amazing happens when Mox is on the field, he's actually good. James Van Der Beek stars and honestly, I always felt that he was too much into the whole teen-heartthrob persona, I never took him seriously as an actor, or envisioned him being good in a role like this. Just as the town was surprised by how good Mox was on the field, I was just as surprised by how good Van Der Beek was in this role. When you add Jon Voight to the equation, as the hard nosed coach, things really come together. The two men hate each other, but are forced to work together, it's this dynamic and tension behind the scenes that really makes the off the field action as interesting as what's taking place on the field. Varsity Blues is produced by MTV, stars actors I normally wouldn't watch, and as it turns out it is one of the most exciting and intense sports films I've ever seen. One of the things I love about films, is that you can never judge them based on anything else other than their content. On the surface, this is something I'd never watch, but happenstance brought me to it, and it's honestly one of the best football movies I've ever seen.

It regards a football team that has lost its star quarterback to a leg injury and how James Van Der Beek steps in becoming their star player. His parents jerk him in several directions. His relationship with his girlfriend is in pearl. His best friend's girlfriend presents herself with whipped cream covering her vital areas. Sounds like he has his dating life well in hand. Coach Bud threatens to terminate his scholarship. Despite its familiar grounds this film is a must for football fans. Huge improvement for director Brian Robbins who previously made an embarrassing ham handed mess called Good Burger. Van Der Beek is effective as he attempts to figure out where his life is headed. Jon Voight steal scenes as Bud whom Van Der Beek confronts regarding particular conduct that moves the team ahead. Paul Walker plays the injured quarterback whom Van Der Beek replaces. Ron Lester brings comic relief as Van Der Beek's friend who ended up with more concussions than needed. Another comic performance is from the wild antics of Scott Caan that are this side of breaking the law. Great combination of football action combined with screwball comedy and a strong theme regarding the illegal operations to succeed.

His girlfriend Julie Harbor (Amy Smart) is the sister of the star quarterback Lance (Paul Walker). Offensive lineman Billy Bob (Ron Lester) passes out and Lance gets hurt being sacked.

The difference is that this movie keeps trying to play the outlandish for comedy. The movie misunderstands the inherit dark drama and tries to make a funny high school comedy out of it.

"},{"Title":"Doesn't stand out from the crowd","Date":"22 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Varsity Blues is about as predictable a movie as you will ever see. It's a movie about high school football which is pretty much like every other movie about high school football. Every cliché of the genre is here. The overbearing coach. The football-obsessed town. The parents living vicariously through their children. The players who see football as their only means of escape. The intellectual player who realizes there's more to life than football. The cheerleader who just wants to be with the star, whoever the star may be at a given moment. The big, fat guy who's there for comic relief. The injury that changes everything. The big game at the end. Did I miss any? Oh yes, of course, the biggest cliché of all...Texas. Where else would you set a movie about a town where high school football is the only thing that matters?So you know what you're in for with this movie. Nothing is going to surprise you here. But as predictable and formulaic as it is Varsity Blues still provides reasonably decent entertainment. The characters may all be clichéd but a number of them still manage to be compelling. James Van Der Beek is the star of the movie, if not the football team. He plays the intellectual backup quarterback, Mox, a guy who plays football not because he wants to but because it is what he is expected to do. Mox's situation changes, how Mox responds to that change is the crux of the movie's rather simple story. Van Der Beek's performance is by no means extraordinary but for this movie it works perfectly fine. He creates a character we can relate to and root for. And Jon Voight, playing the thoroughly detestable Coach Bud Kilmer, does an excellent job creating a character we can despise and root against. Kilmer is a hard-driving jerk, a man who cares only about winning football games. He cares not how many young bodies he must destroy to win another district championship. The conflict between Mox, who gets what life is really about, and Kilmer, who most certainly does not, is quite dramatic. And if a high school football movie can give you some good drama that's really all you can ask. There is nothing spectacular about Varsity Blues. There is nothing that really sets it apart from all the other movies of its type you have already seen. But it is at least entertaining enough to be worth your while. There are good dramatic moments, a few good laughs, some compelling characters. And some rather inventively used whipped cream. It may not rise above its genre but for what it is, and all it was ever meant to be, Varsity Blues is a success.

This is how the movie Varsity Blues begins. It instantly lets you know that the town of West Canaan is somewhat different and it runs by a different set of rules. These rules are the rules of footballs and the players in the Coyotes are gods.Varisty Blues shows us a town where football fever has become a religion and the football oval is the temple to their god, but their gods change frequently for when the star player becomes severely injured, he vanishes to be replaced by another hero, and this time a reluctant one. What we see in Varsity Blues is a religion that exists - but the movie forces it out. Every football season here in Adelaide everybody goes Crow fanatic (the Crows are one of Adelaide's two football teams).The thing with football here is that there is a lot of hypocrisy - when the team is on a loosing streak everybody hates them and have even booed them off of the field, while when they are on a winning streak, everybody dresses up in red, yellow, and blue, and goes hysterical over them. When confronted with this they claim that they followed the Crows through thick and thin - though we know that this is not true. What I don't like about football is that people will literally throw their responsibilities away when a game is on.Back to Varsity Blues - this movie emphasises the hypocrisy that surrounds football. The religious aspect is brought out with Mox's younger brother who is really deeply religious. He creates his own cult and his father's reply is I don't want to see any more of this - you are going to play football like your brother. Parents fight over who's son is the better football player, and all of them had the same coach - who literally runs the town.Mox is an interesting fellow because he loves football, but detests the way the town idolises it. He states that what he is watching is a corruption of a good thing. He is more interested in a college degree in something that he likes, but his brilliant throw is forcing him to play football and to go down a career path that he does not want to go down. Moreso the coach is forcing the players to play until they are useless. He does not care about his team-member's health he is more interested in winning. Unfortunately for the players, they are becoming crippled and being placed in very complicated and expensive surgery - and once they are gone then they have fallen from grace this is clearly seen when Lance destroys his knee and his girlfriend leaves him for Mox.Varsity Blues is a bit of a slutty movie, but it addresses a very important issue in our society - the way we idolise a sport and place mere mortals upon a pedestal, only to throw them away when they are no longer needed. I agree with Mox - sport is fun and enjoyable, but it becomes corrupted when people start treating it like a religion.

Keg parties around the football team? Absolutely. Anyone who denies this is kidding themselves. A high-school football coach having more power than the local cops? I've seen it personally. The black player being treated unfairly and like a workhorse? Yes. In small Texas towns, racism is more subtle than it used to be, but too often, black players are loved only during football season, then are ignored, discarded or worse when their playing time is up. Fathers being overzealous about their son's football? Yes, although in this movie, concentrating on the next game over getting accepted to Brown is a little much.Unrealistic The whipped-cream scene? Unlikely, or I lived a more sheltered life than I thought! Drugging kids up so they keep playing? I've never seen a high-school football coach be that heartless, but it isn't beyond the realm of imagination. The teacher stripper? Maybe the stripping part, but drinking with students afterwards? It's a stretch.MILD SPOILERThere are two scenes that are bothersome.The mother thinking it's cute that her son has a cult. After the tragic events in Waco in 1993, no mother in Texas would ever act like this. The kid and the mother should see psychiatrists!Worst of all ...WHERE WERE THE ASSISTANT COACHES IN THE SHOWDOWN SCENE? No way in hell that happens in real life.Still, for entertainment value, it's worth a rental. The intensity of football is captured in the game scenes. There are enough comic interludes to make things interesting, with kudos to James Caan's son. Ali Larter and the stripper teacher are nice eye candy. 6 1/2 to 7 stars out of 10, less if scenes that wouldn't happen in real life bother you.

Furthermore, Van Der Beek needs to be kept as far away from Texas as possible in future movies after mutilating a Texas accent in this one.  The other actors, to their credit, do a generally decent job, though.  I realize that there is a federal law requiring there to be a funny, crazy fat guy in every football movie, Billy Bob is far too fat to be believable.  He would -never- survive a football game.

After seeing it, however, I have considered this movie to be one of my favorites.As most people well know, the movie displays the pressure of fame and achievement in a small football-oriented town.  The coach is feared and respected by most of the community, including the town sheriff, and insists that everything is done his way alone.  If the kids do everything he says, he pats them on the back and tells them how wonderful they are.  If anyone does anything differently from what he says, he publicly badmouths and threatens them.  Throughout the movie we see the teens begin to see the coach for whom he really is.  And some of the characters who initially don't seem to have much depth --- such as Darcy and Tweeder, in my opinion --- have their serious moments to where one might have more respect for them. Throughout the storyline they learn that they don't necessarily have to follow a single set of rules in order to become successful.However, I do have some criticisms as well.  I felt that a lot of the nudity displayed wasn't necessary.  Plus, the issue of whether Darcy had actually left Lance or whatever she had decided to do was unresolved.  Also, I felt it was a major character flaw that Jules was so set against fame and football throughout most of the movie and then suddenly told Mox to step up and play the hero.  And finally, since Mox's father knew how much of a jerk the coach was, why was he as obsessed with football and winning as the rest of the town was?Having grown up in a highly populated community, I can't judge whether the town displayed in the movie is realistic compared to actual small football towns.  However, a friend of mine in a small Texas town has told me that it is similar to her town...so I'll have to take her word for that.  In any case, what I like best about this movie is how the teens work together and give it their all in order to shine for at least that period of time. Although for obvious reasons I didn't play football in high school, I can remember that same concept in other extracurricular activities I was involved in. I especially like Mox's statement, We have the rest of our lives to be mediocre, but we have the opportunity to play like gods for the next half of football.  Having been out of high school for several years now, I can still think back to the people who stood out in my high school. Of course, I remember those who were popular, but I also remember those who weren't necessarily part of the in crowd but still made a difference somehow.I would definitely recommend this movie; although the language and nudity might be somewhat offensive, there is a lot more to it than that.

I didn't quite realize that this was basically a football fantasy until the very last few minutes of the movie.

I played high school football at a large midwestern school and I at least really hope it was intended to be this absurdist, because otherwise this is a remarkably stupid movie.  Taken as satire and jock fantasy, it works in a strange way--the sex education teacher is secretly a stripper with a killer body.  All the girls at high school are incredibly attractive and throw themselves at the footballers.  The entire town worships the jocks, who essentially can do whatever they want--drinking, wenching, and contemptuously abusing the local law enforcement officers. In this movie, the mean football coach is REALLY mean, he makes Lombardi look like a creampuff; the stupid and selfish parents wanting to live vicariously are REALLY stupid and selfish; the fat stupid offensive lineman (a stock character in football movies) is  REALLY fat and REALLY stupid.

Strangely enough, during the big dramatic rebellion--there aren't any assistant coaches, virtually any football team, particularly one in Texas, would have probably three assistant coaches.

Didn't he realize that if you don't take players out of the game when they are hurt, they won't be able to play later?  Hmmm.  I guess since it was the last game or something, he figured he could go for it.  Also, I take offense that all teachers are portrayed as evil or foolish. I thought the scene where Mox reads Kurt Vonnegut instead of the playbook was humorous.  Huh?  Ok.  Horrible coach is depriving this poor boy an education and exposure to the arts, but he manages to read literature on the sidelines.  And then he goes to a strip joint, right?  Mox is pressured by his parents to play football and be a star.  Poor guy.  He's only been accepted to Brown, even though he never studies anything throughout the movie except Kurt Vonnegut and only learns about football and sex in class. But he has a large vocabulary, right?  We know that because he seems to have memorized the thesaurus entry for erection.  Unfortunately, most of those words are not on the verbal portion of the SATs. Older females, such as the teacher, are to be pitied and made fun of, while girls are there to satisfy the boys' sexual appetites.Almost all the adults are portrayed as mean or bumbling idiots, I'm surprised Mox turned out so wonderfully without a single adult role model.And guess what?  The boys are going to frustrate the coach by winning!  Or at least that seemed like what the movie was saying. I'm sorry for any error in my comments; it has been a long time since I saw this film.  I do not plan to see it again in order to make my comments more accurate.

The rest of the cast is mediocre at best, with some of the worst southern accents this side of a high school production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in Maine.The football action is some of the best ever captured on film, as far as I'm concerned.  It is probably the football fan in me that drew me to this movie in the first place.One element that I found particularly disturbing was the Tweeder (Scott Caan) character's comments about women (the little song he sings at the first post-game party and the panty-droppers speech at practice.)  I realize that the comments are simply meant to add to the over-the-top character, but I feel that they were unnecessary and downright silly.

The movie is refreshing as well, in the fact that the injured quarterback does not become the bad guy, and the blonde ambitious cheerleader becomes a somewhat sympathetic figure. As far as the football scenes are concerned, they are done very well, the only nitpicking thing that I could find as a football fan, is that on a long pass play the clock did not stop for a first down.  In high school and college football the clock stops to move the chains, no big deal.And sure, we probably could figure out that the black running back would score a big touchdown, and that they would run the the five receiver set, and that the hook and ladder would come into play at the end, but it wasn't overly obvious like in some sports movies.

It was good to see the human aspect of what treating people like they were treated like the coach can do.  Also, I think too many kids will be able to identify with Mox's situation with his father.  It's too bad that what kids want vs. what their parents want for them is so different.If you enjoy nothing else in this movie, you'll get a kick out of Mox's little brother's religious zeal and his mother's reaction to it.

So I didn't have to feel like a complete loser for wanting to see it.

We gave it an A- overall, with the minus due to the un-inspired, but necessary, ending.  Well done, all around.  I just wish they'd hyped it for all that it was, not all that it was expected to be.  Those going primarily to see James Van Der Beek would have gone anyway, and I'm afraid it lost out on a large slice of audience that would have truly appreciated it...

James VDB may lapse into Dawson mode on occasion, but really shows some great talent in the role of Jonathan Moxon.

That was not the case at all with MTV's Varsity Blues.Now to the movie itself...the plot is very, very underdeveloped.  We get basically no character background on anyone in the movie, not even James Dawson VanDerr Beek's character Mox.  The script should have been written with much more character development.  We could have cared much more about Tweeder, Billy Bob, and Wendell if we knew ANYTHING about them. Not even the reason behind Kilmer's pure ruthlessness was discussed.The two female stars of the film, Ali Larter and Amy Smart, were basically just eye candy. The relation between Mox and Jules was so underplayed that i don't think a single soul in the theatre i was at cared whether they got back together or not.  Neither character was even needed or helped the film any.. well, except for Jules being covered in only whip cream.What the script did cover, was entertaining, but probably more so if you're a fan of either football or Dawson's Creek.

It is the story of a football team, and the players start realizing that most of the people who are near to them only care about them playing football and winning football. The star quarterback is the first to see this when his girlfriend leaves him when he gets injured enough to have to quit. The new quarterback John Moxon (James Van Der Beek) also realizes that even his own parents care more about him winning and being the best player on the team than they care about him as their son. Jon Voight slithers on the screen as (SURPRISE!) the film's 'bad guy', the team's coach, who wants nothing but to win, and to win his way.  Voight was a good choice for the role, because he's already gotten to where you despise him as soon as he's on the screen, which is basically the impression you get with his character, coach Kilmer. Although Kilmer has been coaching for years, this is the first team with someone who cares enough to actually stand up to him.  This type of movie has been done before, but this still does a good job with this type of story. It has the typical girl-kisses-someone-else's-boyfriend-who-suddenly-realizes-his- girlfriend-is-watching scene which has been done so many times in cheezy sit-coms and dramas, but at least it doesn't follow up with a studio audience ooo-ing at it. It leads up to the final confrontation between the team and the coach, where we see how much guts the players have between them to stand up to someone like this, and how far they are willing to go. This film is lots of fun, with some laughs saved up for the right places, instead of just a bunch of random cheap laughs you find splattered everywhere in The Waterboy (1998), which was only enjoyable if you really wanted to like it to begin with.  Varsity Blues is definitely a feel-good movie, although you probably shouldn't take the kids.

But it seemed the kind of mindless comedy that I might enjoy. Hardly.  It was funny, but only because the concepts rang all too true.  The movie follows the end of the football career of Jon Moxon, or Mox.  The scariest part about the film is that it is honest, high school sports, regardless of what, are typically placed too high on a pedestal and the concept of winning is all that matters.  This is clearly the case in West Canaan, Texas, the setting for the film.  I walked out of the theater shuddering, as the events in Mox's life resounded with some of those from my own.  I would emphatically recommend this movie to anyone who does, or recently finished playing competitive sports in school.  My hat goes off to MTV and director Brian Robbins for a job well done.

The thin premise consisting of a battle between the one dimensional well intentioned kid (John Moxon) and his equally one dimensional evil nemesis (Coach Bud Kilmer) made for a predictable plot and outcome.The ridiculous pressures put upon high school students to excel in sports while ignoring injuries and academics is a topic ripe for commentary, but this attempt failed to show that struggle.  John Moxon didn't struggle at all.  He knew from the beginning that the pressures were ridiculous although he had been playing football since he was in the Pee Wee League.  We don't see how this character, born and raised in a Texas football town, reaches the maturity of his perspective. He simply knows that he is right without any inner struggle.  Without this struggle, the movie tends to preach to us by telling us that these pressures are bad instead of showing us the roots of the problem and why they are destructive and difficult to fight against.

James Van der  Beek plays a compelling character, a second string football hero more interested in his future than the immediate glory of small town Texas high school football.  The portrayal of members of his father's generation as football-obsessed rednecks made for some comic relief (and is probably not altogether inaccurate).  Plenty of light-hearted moments made this movie entertaining, but ample time was spent selling the message of to oneself be true.  James Van der Beek does a capable acting job as a likeable scholar-jock who, as a reluctant hero, defends his values against those seeking to exploit him (a tyrannical coach, well played by Jon Voight) and consequently finds himself to be a natural leader.  His fatso lineman buddy is great to watch, whether he's drinking maple syrup straight out of the bottle or losing his lunch.  I recommend this movie to those who find the trailer compelling but aren't sure whether they are the target demographic.

This movie, for me, is one of those. I love football flicks, and this was a good one. In terms of the football scenes, it may not quite be the equivalent of North Dallas Forty, but the latter is the finest such film ever made. The performances of the actors playing the primary six high-schoolers, along with Jon Voight, were all engaging and well-performed. And besides the drama and the story, there were two other aspects of this presentation which I thoroughly enjoyed, as a bonus.1. Jon Voight, whose work I have always enjoyed, with another performance or two leading a sports team, may win a title I never thought could be taken from the current holder. He could surpass the fine actor, G. D. Spradlin, as the greatest horse's ass coach in the history of film! (Spradlin was splendid in this capacity as the coach in both the fore-mentioned North Dallas Forty, and as the basketball coach in Robby Benson's One-on-One.)2. In The Natural and The Rookie, baseball movies starring Robert Redford and Dennis Quaid, respectively - each played a character (one fictional, one real), about 10 years younger than the actual age of the actor. This, however, is not surprising, given both of their good-looks and fitness. And makeup, lighting and camera work permit performers to regress or advance in ages portrayed (e.g. the great age span of Hoffman's character in Little Big Man). On the other hand, I found it engrossingly fascinating, viewing the six primary high-schoolers here, versus the actor's real ages at time of the film's release. Footballer Van Der Beck was the baby at 22, Caan 23, Walker 25 or 26, and Lester 29, perhaps 30. The two female leads, Amy Smart (Van Der Beck's girlfriend), and Ali Larter (the little sexpot cheerleader) were both 23. Overall, everyone in this group would have been out of college for more than a year or two, and two of them in the post-college workforce long enough to have received a promotion or two in their jobs. But also interesting is that all of these were believable as high school seniors - neither detracting from the enjoyment of this fine movie, nor the fascination of this age discrepancy.

Moxon, unlike most high school athletes, isn't playing for an athletic scholarship but an academic one to Brown University. He is not nearly as good as the starting quarterback, Lance, in practice, but comes out of nowhere to shine on the big stage.Kilmer is vile, racist, introverted and selfish.

The girl, Collette Harbor, strips off her shirt and prepares a hot fudge sundae, on her breasts for Mox, including whipped cream of course.On the eve of the big game Mox and teammates get drunk at a strip club where they meet their sex education teacher, as one of the strippers. This incident, along with their ensuing hangovers at the big game, cause Kilmer to explode.Varsity Blues is a very similar movie to television's classic from the 1980's The Dukes of Hazzard; childish, stupid, funny, with a southern flair.

Van Der Beek plays a character who is treated like he is really terrible in football. But after one of the players has an accident due to steroids, Van Der Beek is called in to play. The coach (Voight) still treats him like he can't play, but when Van Der Beek makes plays of his own, he suddenly becomes the star and everybody wants to know what it is like.This movie had some really good acting, for example Van Der Beek played his character really well. I liked how his character treated everyone in the team fairly, even though they were kind of in his shadow. Voight did a great job playing the coach, a really tough guy who was determined to make his team win at all costs. But at the same time, we get to see some signs of sensitivity to his character.

It's got some funny moments, but it mostly seems like a really bad ripoff of All the Right Moves.  Of course, Tom Cruise has got it all over James Van Der Beek.  The only quality acting in the movie was from Amy Smart.  If you have to watch it, try to focus more on Paul Walker and less on the movie itself.  It helps the time go by.

Mox (Van Der Beek) is a football player on a high school team in a small Texas town where the only thing anyone cares about is high school football.  An accident with the quarterback gets Mox promoted to that position, and suddenly he is worshiped by his town and the head cheerleader.  However, all Mox wants to do is study and get into a good college.  This deeply upsets his coach (Voight) who is played with such pure evil, that one has to wonder why he has kept his job.  He threatens Mox's chances to get into Brown unless he plays, and Mox's parents are indifferent, they only seem to care about high school football.  When the push comes to shove, you can guess what actually happens.  While all the actors try very hard with this movie, the movie itself is so wrapped in formula that it makes it completely unbeleivable.  I realize there are towns that live and die with high school sports, but the people of this town are presented as such simpletons that they overlook incredibly abusive and dangerous life-threatening behavior of a coach because he wins football games.  So if you can suspend your brain for two hours you will enjoy this movie.

James Van Der Beek of TV's Dawson's Creek is very good in his first big movie role as Jonathan Moxon, or Mox for short, the second string quarterback who takes over the starter position after the starting quarterback gets injured. The thing I like best about Varsity Blues is the acting by the young actors. In addition to Van Deer Beek, there are good performances turned in by Paul Walker as Lance Harbor, the starting quarterback and Mox's best friend, Ron Lester as the huge Billy Bob, Amy Smart as Jules, Mox's girlfriend and Lance's sister, Ali Larter as Darcy, Lance's girlfriend and a cheerleader who starts to put the moves on Mox, and especially Scott Caan as the wild and crazy Charlie Tweeder. Oscar winner Jon Voight goes over the top as Bud Kilmer, their mean-spirited head coach. I would have liked it better if the writer hadn't made Voight so mean. His temper tantrums got on my nerves at times while watching this film. At times I wanted to scrape him off the screen with a spatula. Nevertheless, Varsity Blues works because of the performances by the young actors. There are some silly comedy moments that are rather unbelievable, but who cares. Varsity Blues is a winner.*** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"What a waste of time...","Date":"23 April 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This film, in my opinion, seems as if a bunch of executives at Viacom (parent company of MTV) were sitting around in a meeting one day and said... I got it... we'll make a movie about high school football.  Throw teen heart throb James Van Der Beek in there, put the MTV logo on it and we've got a cash cow!  This movie was terrible.  I watched this for free on TV, and still think I should have gotten a refund.  I rated this movie a 3 out of 10.  And it's lucky it even got that much.  First, let me point out it's good qualities, before I tear into it.It got one point just because of the fact that whole movie is about a town in Texas where the entire community bases its existence on high school football.  I related to this because in my hometown, or at least in my school district, it's the same thing.  It's not as extreme as it was in Varsity Blues but it is just as pathetic.  I laughed because of the fact that some of the characters are carbon copies of the community from my alma mater.It got another point for Jon Voight.  Voight's character may be a little far-fetched (the evil football coach who is hell bent on winning regardless the safety and welfare of his players), but was played to a T by the veteran actor.  In the entire movie, he was the best actor, and it was a pleasure seeing him perform.And the third point is the cinematography.  Granted, the actual movie itself isn't all that visually stimulating, but the football scenes... were tremendous.  Out of all the football movies ever made, the scenes for this movie were expertly well done with some excellent choreography, lighting, and photography.Other than that... this film SUCKED.  It is full of so many flaws that it's hard to narrow it down for the purposes of this critique.First, the casting.  With the exception of the phenomenal job down by Voight, the acting in this movie is laughable.  Van Der Beek falls in and out of his Texas accent so frequently, it makes Keanu Reeves' southern accent in The Devils Advocate sound authentic... ok... well, maybe it's not THAT bad, but bad nonetheless.  The casting for this movie (again, with the exception of Voight) was badly done.  Van Der Beek as a star quarterback?  Give me a break.  He's way too much of a pretty boy to seem like he ever even put on shoulder pads.  There were also some points in the script, where you know the scriptwriter wanted a point to be made, but Van Der Beek's lackluster performance didn't drive the point home.  The rest of the cast was adequate, but nothing spectacular.  The character Billy Bob, I must say though, was well cast... because he was a disgusting pig which I never want to lay eyes on again unless he sheds a couple of tons.The script, too, was horrendous.  First of all, the characters were all one-dimensional.  The quarterback who gets all the glory but is still of noble heart.  The slut cheerleader who's not as happy as she lets everyone beleive.  The low self-esteem fat kid.  The football-obsessed father who wants his son to have what he never could.  I could see right through all theses charcters.Another problem with the script was that it was full of holes.  First Moxon (Van Der Beek) doesn't like football because he's pressured into it by his father, than he loves it when he becomes a star, than he hates it, than he loves it... etc, etc.  There's one point where Moxon is trying to cheer up the depressed Billy Bob by telling him to quit the foot ball team... than... NOT TWO MINUTES LATER, he says (and I'm paraphrasing) Come on, Billy Bob... we need you.  Jeeze!  Make up your mind!  This is just one of the many plot holes in the movie, but to discuss any more might cause me to reveal some spoilers.  (although this movie does a pretty good job of spoiling itself)And the kid who's always changing religions, this was supposed to be a running gag, but somehow I found myself not smiling.  Not because I'm offended mind you, but it just wasn't funny.Regardless, this movie, from what I'm told, did pretty well with all the teeny boppers, which isn't surprising.  Again, the actual football scenes in this movie are the best I've ever seen.  If you take every scene that doesn't take place on a football field and throw it away, this is the best football movie ever made (at least from the ones I've seen.)  But if you're looking for something other than eye candy, than look elsewhere.

While James Van Der Beek manages to project some level of believability in his quarterback on the rise, Jon Voight's evil coach (he thinks nothing of jeopardizing the health of his teen-age players with mysterious injections to keep them playing through injury) is laughably conceived.

However when brutal Coach Kilmer pushes Harbour's knees too far, Harbour injuries himself and is out for over a year pushing Moxon into the spotlight.

On TV however I'll try anything and decided to watch this last night &#150; although I'm still not 100% what feel it was aiming for &#150; there is an abundance of drama but there is also a mix of standard teen humour and some inspired touches.  The plot is familiar to anyone who has seen sports movies recently &#150; apparently there is a lot of pressure in sports, oh &#150; and apparently it starts when they are young!  So nothing really new or shocking here, but that doesn't mean it is a bad film &#150; just a familiar and unmemorable one.  All the standard stuff happens and the ending is no surprise to anyone who will has seen a movie of this genre before.The film isn't very funny and focuses more on the drama side (albeit with the usual light `coming of age' approach).  The only consistently funny bit was Moxon's young brother who is `very religious' and experiments with various faiths throughout the film (the film's first scene has him walking around the house on a small cross!).  I found this much funnier than the other teen goings on and T&A action as this stood out as the sole unique touch to the film.The cast do what they are required. I've never seen Dawson's Creek so am not familiar with Van Der Beek, but he does seem to be very bland (although he appears more interesting by sharing his scenes with Paul Walker!).  All the rest of the teens fall into their stereotypes roles as various classes of jocks etc.  Voight is good as the coach but it's not like he really exerts himself &#150; it is a role that requires little work as it is the same performance as most actors give in the same role.  The cast fit the material as both are OK but not memorable.Overall this is a solid sports film that makes a good point.  It stays firmly on the rails set by many other films in this genre and never really seeks to do anything new to make itself distinctive or memorable.

I mean, it had a lot of great bands including Green Day, and Foo Fighters. Some of the songs during games got you pumped, and there was soft songs when there was a little unhappiness going around. I especially liked the preview with Jon Moxon(James Van Der Beek) running the ball with the song My Hero playing during the slow motion clip. That just stuck in my head forever.And in conclusion, I believe that Varsity Blues was the best movie that i saw this summer.

And it has absolutely all the defects of these films the kids are unthinkable non-thinking machines. At first at least. The coach is a brute that dopes his players or gives them unethical injections for them to play even when they should not. He is a gross character who treats his players as if they were in a marine training camp and he were a training sergeant as depicted by some films about the Vietnam war. Gross language, blackmailing, violence even are some of his skins on top of the illegal stuff and unethical actions.But the film reveals two elements that are essential to understand this sport is not exactly and only that. First the fathers are shown as being pure idiots who want their children to play football for only two reasons because they played football when they were going to that particular high school themselves. They are frankly undrinkable nostalgic-spirited bigots about football. And the second reason is that their sons can earn, or win, a full scholarship in college, alleviating the expense for the family. That transforms football into some kind of narrow-minded culture, not to speak of open institutionalized moral prostitution or slavery.The teenagers are well obliged, willy-nilly for some, to play the game which means violence, superficial clichés and attitudes including racism against the only black on the team, sexism and hefty male-chauvinistic attitudes, some girls overplaying the game by becoming the prize of each game for the winner. Not to speak of alcohol and other inacceptable practices including public or semi-public sex, driving under the influence, drinking binges and challenges, and even some open and gross misdemeanor. This film becomes then some kind of a manifesto against that absurd and inhumane culture.But the film also shows how the initial quarterback is the victim of some medical mishandling from the coach, and how he will in the last game of the season support his substitute that leads that game to a direct confrontation of the whole team with the coach. This coach is on the point of forcing the only black player to accept an injection in his knee to go back on the field. The substitute quarterback tells the black player not to do it and he quits when he is menaced by the coach. But he had built a new spirit in the team putting the black chap in the front and using several other tactics that were creative and valorizing for other players than himself, or the coach. The team then refuses to go back for the second half of the game and the coach is forced to leave. The players then take over the ex- and the new quarterbacks together, the ex- assuming the coach's position. And the rest is the good ending.Football, like all other sports, could be a beautiful adventure for the players all the time if some coaches did not use the system to valorize themselves by over exploiting the players. But apart from what I have said, yes it is another high school varsity football film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID "},{"Title":"Varsity Blues comparison to Grisham book","Date":"15 April 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" HI there, I got to see this movie by chance and only once it got to the last scene did I become aware to the thought that this movie is similar to a John Grisham book called Bleachers.The end scene on the football field resembles that of the storyline in the book.There are a number of story lines which seem very similar to the book, the only thing is Grisham doesn't play out a happy ending as in the movie In the book, the coach was Eddie Drake and the football team was Messina Spartans with Neely Crenshaw the player I felt I had to mention this to see whether there are any others who agree?

While dealing with these pressures, his grades and girlfriend(Amy Smart) suffer as he searches for his meaning.Varsity Blues is an original type of high school football movie in the way that shows the struggles that high school football players face and the pressure put on winning. It realistically shows how the majority of coaches treat their players and how little they care of their future. The problem is that it was not realistic with every other part of the movie. For being such a dramatic story, Varsity Blues shows some of the most unrealistic football games ever shown. It shows high school life as being one giant orgy and focuses too much on relationships as if it was Dawson's Creek. It frequently loses sight of what it promised to be. Varisty Blues' humor was as dull and tasteless as something shown on a teen-based T.V. show although it repeatedly tried for a laugh. Varisty Blues took a relatively good plot and turned it around into a teen drama that fails in about every aspect.If you are interested in crappy teen dramas that switches its focus sporadicly throughout the movie, then this your movie. But if you are interested in a dramatic high school football movie that it portrays to be, watch Friday Night Lights instead. The acting is not only unconvincing but is even bad for actors such as James Van Der Beek and Paul Walker. Trust me, that is bad. The climax of the movie starts off wonderful but ends more cheap and stupid than anyone could imagine. It is totally unpredictable but incredibly stupid. Overall, Varsity Blues will leave you disappointed and fails as a whole.I do not recommend this movie.

The film has little audience appeal either. American football isn't a topic that has taken the world by storm so `Varsity Blues' main audience would be the fans of this sport. The fact that it's a teen flick pretty much rules out all other age groups aswell. The acting isn't much worth special notice. James Van Der Beek doesn't try hard enough to shed his more popular `Dawson' image. The rest of the performances seem dwarfed by the presence of Jon Voight. He's the most experienced and famous actor of the bunch. I don't know why he'd agree to do a film like this in the first place. Paul Walker was 26 when he took on his role as a high school student in the film. For God's sake you can't stay 16 forever, sounds like someone's in self-denial. Towards the end they hit a rock bottom when they attempt to manipulate the audience into believing it's an epic with a `Chariots of Fire' esque battle sequence. This is something that the film could not accomplish in its already limited range and fails miserably at. Overall, if you like American football or are into that sort of thing, then `Varsity Blues' is the film for you. For everyone else though, this is bland, uninteresting and rather pointless. 4.3/10.  "},{"Title":"Yet another routine football movie.","Date":"21 July 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Varsity Blues is the sports version of the recent barrage of teen horror movies that we've been flogged with over the last decade or so. It is a completely recycled version of the age-old sport film plot, with a hero at the top of his game who becomes injured just enough to allow an underdog to come in and become a hero himself, but not quite enough to prevent him from retaining some hero status by coaching the team to victory. I'll go ahead and give the obligatory spoilers warning now, although Varsity Blues is one of those movies where you really know what's going to happen from the beginning. Given that, we should concentrate more on the way that we're told a story that we already essentially know, but even that is not very interesting. We get to see plenty of actors in their mid twenties pretend like they're high school kids doing freaky high school things, but we are never for a second able to look away from the fact that these are actors. Nothing is real in the film because none of the actors are fit to play the roles of high school kids. Let's consider a few ages, James Van Der Beek was about 22 years old when he took on the role of Jonathon Moxon. Amy Smart is 23 years old in the film, Ron Lester, the charmer who played Billy Bob, was 24, Scott Caan was also about 23, as was Ali Larter when she donned the infamous whipped cream bikini, and for crying out loud, Paul Walker was freaking 26!!  It's easy to see that they wanted to cast more well known actors to play the roles of these kids in the movie because they wanted to guarantee a certain box-office value, but these actors ended up removing any sense of believability from the movie. It should be kept in mind that often the greatest films are the ones that go out on a limb and cast unknown actors in extraordinary situations. It's too bad that familiarity was deemed more important than believability in this movie, because with only a little bit of plot work, Varsity Blues could have been an enormously better film. The movie is peppered with frustrating situations that don't fit with the rest of the movie. Jonathon Moxon is a high school kid who is more mature than any high school kid in the world. I guess they wanted to deliver a message about getting a real education rather than just focusing on something like football at the expense of your grades, but no high school kid on the planet would hesitate for a second to be the starting quarterback on the school football team, especially when the football team is the biggest thing in the town, just so he can concentrate on his grades or his girlfriend or anything else. I played high school football, and being one of the best players on the football team in high school is like being a rock star (although I don't know this from personal experience!). In general, although I am definitely a red-blooded American male, I tend to frown on unnecessary nudity in the movies. There is a place for unnecessary nudity &#150; hell, there's a whole friggin' genre for it! &#150; but the problem is that there are way too many movies released these days that use nudity to pull along a weak script, and the script of Varsity Blues is so weak that it's pretty much a guarantee that this is why we saw so much nudity in the film. I can't say that it was entirely unappreciated, but it was obvious that there was a whipped cream bikini and a stolen cop car full of naked high school girls and a stripping teacher in the film because the story and plot were little more than recycled garbage. Besides that, the movie doesn't even seem to want to have nudity in it. It's like it wants to show just enough to keep our eyelids from drooping, but not enough to allow us to notice that it knows how weakly written it is. Any scene involving nudity is accompanied simultaneously with awkward discomfort, hinting that the movie doesn't know what to do with nudity or that it doesn't really want it to be there at all. There's nothing new presented in Varsity Blues, it is yet another presentation of the same old thing that we've seen in countless football movies before, and in this case, it is even acted universally by actors who don't fit their roles. The only person who pulls any weight in the film is John Voigt, which is rather unfortunate because of the person he plays. Voigt is one of the better actors working today, and he is amazingly good at playing people that are wonderfully hate-able, it's just too bad that the only person that is at all convincing in the entire movie is a character that is meant to be disliked. Leaves you with a bad aftertaste, which is unfortunate for the staying power of the film, but not exactly unfitting with its quality.

By the time they have to play there next game though, the star quarterback, Lance Harbor played by the BRILLIANT Paul Walker suffers an injury on the field and is forced to pull out of the game. The Coyotes now have to regroup under the leadership of John Moxon played James Van Der Beek, a second-string quarterback who is really not THAT brilliant at the game. The movie is obviously straight down just a football movie and shows what teams can really be like and how much pressure is on them to win all the games they play. Now, the cast in the Varsity Blues. I'll start with Paul Walker. The guy is a brilliant actor and extremely good-looking. He had a good part in the movie which suited him well BUT he really should of had James Van Der Beeks part. James Van Der Beek is an okay actor, I guess. (I thought he was better here than he is in Dawson's Creek.) But he really didn't deserve this big part. (It's like with She's All That. Paul really should of gotten Freddie Prinze JRs (<--- Now, that guy is BAD.) part.) Amy Smart stars here as Lances brother and Johns girlfriend. She was quite good in Road Trip and I thought she did a better performance here, than she did there. She also looks MUCH better with brown hair here. John Voight gave a good performance as the coach too.Anyway, I guess Varsity Blues is okay for an MTV produced movie. They don't really seem to be doing an such amazing job on movies, nowadays.

Some of the blocks and hits that happened wasn't as loud, very up close and so fiecre in Oliver Stone's pro football epic Any Given Sunday.Varsity Blues isn't great, yet it's a solid and interesting football tale of Mox(James Van Der Beek) a local teen who is given the opportunity of a lifetime - becoming a well-known high school quarterback during one game when the team's first string QB and team leader, Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) is knocked out of the game (and season) with a torn knee ligament (ACL or MCL).  The team's fiery head coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) has no choice but to let Mox in as the QB.Unlike any other quarterback who follows the coach's orders, Mox takes matters into his own hands.  I could say it looks like it's not a big deal, but after seeing Kilmer's reaction after Mox scores the game-winning touchdown.  He clearly sees Mox as a threat to take his team in another direction.One of the tactics that Mox uses is absolutely funny when he intentionally throws the ball right at an opposing team's mascot. Although it wasn't nice, it is funny, that I'll confess.The film's second half is good as the first as Mox tries to convince one of his friends, Billy Bob (Ron Lester), a Gilbert Brown-like offensive lineman to stop drinking and suit for the season's last game. How Billy Bob admit that he failed to protect Lance when Kilmer told him to do is very touching.The last game is fun to watch even though there's the typical last minute drive and the speech by Mox, which is seriously good and very understanding.The last scene that Voight has when he's alone in his office and he sadly looks at a trophy that he earned.  He's not only saddened and heart-broken, but shows a look of regret and it's quiet yet powerful.Van Der Beek gives a decently good performance and Voight is terrific as Kilmer.  The supporting performances are fairly good, most notably Lester, Scott Caan, Amy Smart, and Ali Larter.  Director Brian Robbins made a serious and worthwhile effort to make this film look good and he does with some beautiful shots of the stadium by Chuck Cohen, the cinematographer and the editing by Ned Bastille.  Those shots were neat and well-done.What could have made Varsity Blues a better movie if it didn't show some very sickening jokes and a few amusing pranks that try to mock Animal House.

So I wasn't neither surprised nor disappointed with this movie. It centers around Moxem played by James VDB who is pressured to play football by his father. He is constantly harassed by his football coach who is considered a State Legend and decides to rebel against him. This movie has several major flaws. First of all, there are some parts of this movie that had nothing to do with the entire plot. Like the sexual education scene, if they would have cut it out, they might have gotten a PG-13 rating. Also, the scenes with Mox's little brother, I thought were kind of stupid and pointless, too.Second of all, the characters other than Mox were shallow and one dimensional. You have the pretty boy star quarterback, the cheerleader slut, the rowdy beer drinking troublemaker, etc. Also, they never really tie up all the loose ends in this movie. Like what happened with Darcy? Did she break up with Lance or find another quarterback to go with? Or did Mox's dad finally accept the fact that he didn't want to play football? Or what was wrong with Billy Bob? Did he finally seek help? I could go on and on with questions that aren't resolved by the end of the movie. However, the biggest problem with this movie is that you're not sure whether it is a serious movie about an obsessed high school football coach who crosses the line or just another stupid and shallow MTV teen movie. I liked the storyline about a legendary coach who will do anything to enhance his reputation and win a state title. Anyone who lives in a small town where high school football is king can definitely identify with this movie. Jon Voight steals the show with a great performance as the ruthless Bud Kilmer who cares more about winning state titles than his players. However, it is the childish and stupid attempts at humor that destroy this movie's credibility. Had they eliminated these scenes, this movie may have actually been more highly regarded.Having said all that, I would still recommend seeing this movie as even with all of it flaws, it was still enjoyable.

I love Dawson's Creek and so I assumed that James Van Der Beek would be good in this one.  However, Varsity Blues was one of the biggest disappointments.  It was your typical sports movie about teenagers who drink and have sex.  I did not like these kind of jocks in high school and I did not like them in the movie.  I respected Moxon and Billy Bob because they were not like the others. I was also disappointed with the scene where Billy Bob is shooting at his trophies and Moxon comes to comfort him.  this scene, in my mind, was only added to try and make the movie somewhat serious.  The ending was way cheesy too.  How many times have we seen the hero let the underdog win the championship game?  Too many times I think.  The only really good thing about this movie was Moxon's little brother who was quite funny with all of his religious costumes.  I do not think the actors did bad jobs but I think the plot has been done before.  I also think that it was unrealistic for Jon Voight's character to just quit after the team told him off.  If he was so hardcore on football, he would not have quit and become nice all the sudden.  Overall I think MTV needs to stop making these kind of idiotic movies that just glamourize typical jockish-male-dominated-sex-drinking movies.

This guy was totally insane about winning the championship for his team that he didn't give 2 craps about his players' conditions or feelings. Kilmer craves respect as if it were oxygen, and he even more wanted victory. You might as well call him Coach Hitler!! Voight portrayed Kilmer greatly, with extreme enthusiasm, and I think he was one of the few saving graces for this film.Other silver linings for this movie in my opinion were the hot girls, whether it were the cheerleaders or Moxon's girlfriend. Even the stripteasers were great, too, though they didn't do much for the film.Now, here are my pet peeves about Varsity Blues, care to hear 'em? Good! Here goes I really didn't care much for Van Der Beek's role except for the final 15 minutes of the film, where his team finally wins. You could tell I'm no Van Der Beek fan, and I don't like Dawson's Creek! Another turn-off for me in this film was Billy Bob, the fat guy. Oh my God, he is drop-dead UGLY!! When he took off his shirt in the bar scene, it almost made me puke. I had nightmares from that one particular scene for days!!! Varsity Blues would have been much better if they had worked on the dialogue. Everybody had a Texas drawl!. In fact, this whole movie, with the exceptions for a few actors, needs tons of improvement.

The only problem I had was the light hearted way the sickness of the town was portrayed. Scenes of drinking, partying, young men, ran rampant, while the disturbing reality and imitation of the real world were put on the back burner.  In modern day society, sports heroes are paid more than doctors and teachers. This theme was echoed throughout the movie, with the whole town orbiting their lives around a football team.  The only person who seemed to keep his head through the conflict was Moxon, and even he had trouble.  This movie was more about a fathers need to relive his own lost glory days through his son(s), than the facade of a teenage us against them theme flick.  I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie if it had chosen what it wanted to be, rather than trying to appeal to almost everyone.  The scene that did me in was while grabbing a coffee in the local cafe, a police officer was discussing the insane behavior of the members of the football team with a local, and the coach interrupts their private conversation and threatens do you have a problem with my boys?  The sheepish no sir answer made me ill. Here you have a group of teenage boys who steal cars (police cars...that is), drink, hit people in the crotch with a baseball bats, amongst many other things, all in the name of fun, and that's portrayed as O.K. behavior.

The tackles are suitably violent and the filming is fairly inventive. Grid Iron is after all ideal for this sort of thing because it's so stop start. Sorry about the bias but Aussie Rules is my game.The sub plots are pretty good and out of the ordinary showing a fairly wry view of the game and of American small town football culture from director Brian Robbins (Good Burger).The star quarterback (James Van Der Beek of Dawson's Creek fame) wants an academic rather than a sports scholarship to University and his fat mate Billy Bob (Ron Lester, the cook in Good Burger) is remarkably likable. He's a star forward prone to crying, reminiscent of Australian Football's James Hird.Breaking with tradition, the no 1 Quarterback Lance (Paul Walker) is a nice guy rather than a big mouth idiot and his girlfriend hunts for a replacement boyfriend when he's injured due to insecurity not greed. The parents are fools in keeping with what teenagers know to be true and along the same lines, teachers tend to be either dumb or hypocritical.Yes there is a heart hiding not far beneath this sports jock extravaganza but there's still a lot of shouting and drinking.

It didn't make quite as big a splash as Varsity Blues, but it was a much better movie in terms of quality, and it had far more realistic characters and settings. Being a former high school football player, I get very picky when it comes to high school sports movies, especially about football. Varsity Blues had some good qualities, but was an overall miss for me.The biggest problem with Varsity Blues was that to me it was less of a sports movie and more of a frat house comedy knock-off with cheesy dramatic elements thrown in for desperate attempts at artistic credibility. As much as I like Jon Voight, I really didn't buy him as the coach. He was just too over-the-top; too unnecessarily evil to the point where he was a cliché. Sure he's concerned with winning. I mean, what good coach isn't? But did he have to be a steroid-injecting racist too? I also didn't buy the fact that he seemed to be the only coach on the team. For a team that big, you would think there would be some assistant coaches.James Van Der Beek is an actor I also usually like. He does play a likable guy in this movie, and often times plays his naivety very well. However, he completely lost it for me during that stupid attempt at an Oscar nomination (I don't want your life!). Plus, the part in the movie where he takes his teammates out to a strip club the night before a big game was never explained. He was supposed to play a smart kid! Smart kids don't do that! In relation to that, there were so many things wrong with that strip club segment of the movie. For one, they lost the game that came next (despite the opposing team appearing to be super human and making some hits that pale in comparison to most NFL teams), yet still made it to the State Championships in the end? That doesn't happen. Also, no one seemed to have a problem with the beginning part where the football player who got drunk, naked, and stole a police car with four other nude women in it. Yeah, it's funny, but if that happened in reality, the football player would have been convicted on five felony accounts. That would have been AFTER he was kicked off the team too.If the producers wanted to make a good high school football movie, they could have. Instead, they made a cheap flick which appealed to the MTV Generation with football players who were too perfect, and scenarios that would be almost guaranteed to never happen in real life. Friday Night Lights was to me a much better high school football movie, and not necessarily about beautiful people with problems. Varsity Blues is just a fluke.

You make the choice.5/10 "},{"Title":"I don't know anything about football.  And why do we call it football if we don't play it with our feet?","Date":"20 March 2006","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" While staying with a family in Queretaro, Mexico, in summer 1999, I saw Varsity Blues in the local cinema. Since I'm totally numb to anything sports-related, I only half absorbed the movie (I spent most of the time reading the subtitles). Teenage boys are likely to only take interest in the whipped cream bikini scene. But I do know that in Texas, football is king; my mom had unpleasant experiences with that growing up in Galena Park, Texas. Obviously, the problem with calling it football is that we don't play it with our feet; that's why most of the world calls football what we incomprehensibly call soccer. All in all, I'll mainly remember James Van Der Beek and Ali Larter for co-starring in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. "}]
