[{"Title":"One of the best-ever depictions of evil","Date":"28 October 1999","Score":"59 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This movie has no physical violence, but it's truly scary. Chad is evil. He hurts others' feelings for the pleasure of showing himself that he can. He has an explanation for his cruelty, but that's just to draw Howard in to play his game. Without that explanation, he'd still find reasons to be cruel, because his pleasure comes from seeing others in pain. Worse, he can get away with his cruelty, because he is charming, charismatic, and effectively manipulative in his dealings with people. Except in the central plot, he manages to hurt people without taking the blame, by making his victims blame themselves.Howard is both a victim and a willing participant in Chad's evil plot. Without people like him, people like Chad are much less able to hurt others. But people who are too weak to stand in the way of bad people are fairly common. Even those weak enough to be drawn into the plots of bad people are common enough. Even a person strong enough to foil Chad's plot could only have done so if he had known about it, and Chad knew not to trust his plans with such a person. Howard had a chance to be the hero, but he was too weak and became another villain.The central victim, Christine, started out suspicious, but was drawn in by Chad's skillful manipulation, and to some extent Howard's real interest in her. Chad was also good at choosing a victim who would fall for the plot, just as he chose an accomplice effectively. Other victims had other weaknesses that Chad found ways of exploiting, like the man whose speech he mocked in a way that made that victim feel like he himself was to blame.Most people have never met a serial killer, but many have met people like Chad, who enjoy hurting others. The fact that Chad is an example of a more familiar type of evil makes him much scarier. He's more chilling because he doesn't have a clear reason for his badness -- he just enjoys being cruel. What is scarier than an evil that one can imagine falling victim to in everyday life?

On the surface, the film, expertly written by Neil Labute in his first feature effort, seems to be a cruel tale of misogyny. Lurking beneath the surface, however, is the film's true message, one which depicts the business world as a battle of survival of the fittest, a harsh world where men sacrifice their integrity and compassion in favor of oneupsmanship and greed.Fed up with their failures with members of the opposite sex, two co-workers, Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) decide to play a cruel prank on an unsuspecting female victim.  They will both date her, and then after a six-week period, they will dump her, a plan they've devised after years of being tormented and unlucky with women.  They eventually choose their prey, a deaf typist named Christine (Stacy Edwards) and begin their quest, asking her for dates, sending her flowers, and sharing intimate moments.  All this seems like a pleasant surprise to Christine after years of no dating--but, of course, she doesn't know the plan the men have hatched.I don't want to reveal too much more about the plot than this.  I will say that the film has two climactic scenes, one expected and the other inevitable in retrospect.  The first climax makes the movie a success, the second makes the film great--only then do we see Labute's true intent.Labute's cast of no-names is uniformly excellent.  Eckhart, who has since become a Labute staple, delivers a fascinating performance as a truly despicable character, the smooth and fast-talking Chad.  Matt Malloy is excellent as Howard, the weaker of the two men, and Edwards is great as the hapless deaf typist, presenting her character as likable, intelligent, and sensitive, not just a stereotypical handicapped woman.  But the real star of the film is Labute's script.  Judging by this, and his three more recent films (Your Friends and Neighbors, Nurse Betty, and Possession--all quality films), Labute is a writer-director to monitor for years to come.A noteworthy comment about In the Company of Men is that it has been marketed as a comedy.  Those of you expecting slapstick humor and romantic charms might be better served seeing another movie.  In the Company of Men is NOT comedy.  There are elements of black humor, especially one particularly depraved scene involving one of the men and an office intern. However, In the Company of Men is more tragic than comic, a look into the tarnished male psyche brought on by years of corporate stress and paranoia. I couldn't help but think of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, another film about corporate greed in today's world when I was watching this one. However, while Glengarry plays as more of a character-driven mystery and morality play, In the Company of Men is much more insidious, and it offers no solutions in the end.  In fact, the final shot of the film is, in my mind, one of the most memorable in modern cinema.  Just who exactly has the upper hand?....9/10 "},{"Title":"Why was this movie so controversial?","Date":"16 November 2003","Score":"50 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  When I first heard about this movie my main motivation for seeing it was related to the controversy that surrounded it.

I didn't see this until it came out on video, and I had heard a lot about it of course, but luckily I was in the dark on the twist LaBute throws in at the end.  Most people got that this was a study of male-female relationships from a wildly off-kilter view, and that was powerfully done.  But I think most people missed this is also about the workplace, specifically the Alpha Male in the workplace, and how he got that way.  Is it any wonder that Chad and Howard decide to make a game of their seduction of Katherine when it's clear they've had to plan their whole careers as if they were competing in a game of some kind?I think I agree with an interview I saw with LaBute where he said he thought Howard was actually the more despicable character, because Chad is only in it for the game, where Howard starts to take those feelings seriously. Nevertheless, Eckhart's performance makes Chad one of the most chilling characters I've ever seen in movies.  Where a lot of movie villains indicate to let you know they're just acting (which does work when it's done right), Eckhart gives away nothing, so you never know what he's thinking, even if he tells you what he's thinking.  I hope he goes on to bigger things.

The first man is named Chad (played by Aaron Eckhart). He is seemingly cordial to talk to but behind the smiling facade lies a loathsome, callous, spiteful fellow - one who is ruthless without showing any sign of remorse - in fact, he seems to derive great pleasure and pride from inflicting anguish on others, especially women. The other man is Howard (Mike Mallory), Chad's colleague at work and also a former member of the same college as Chad. Howard is a quieter chap, and seems to just go along with Chad's comments. The two men have just arrived in a new town on a six week stay regarding their office work. Chad suggests that they date the same woman for the duration of the six week stay then dump her. Howard eventually agrees. The woman they pick is Christine (Stacy Edwards), a deaf woman who works in their office block. Chad thinks Christine is the perfect victim, with her being deaf, and mocks her distorted speech to Howard, and refers to her as a 'freak'. The two men start to date Christine, but problems start to arise when Howard bumps into them both in a restaurant. The film displays the start of each of the six weeks with a title and a burst of chaotic music. There are a few memorable scenes towards the conclusion of the film. The film focuses on the dog-eat-dog materialistic corporate world, and some of the envious and vindictive people that exist within it. I don't want to reveal any more, but I recommend you see this troubling film.

Frustrated by the women in their lives they decide to use the time to seduce an insecure woman and make her feel loved - only to destroy her before they leave. They pick Christine (Stacy Edwards), a deaf girl from their office and set the plan in motion.This is a fascinating black comedy looking at the macho world of American businessmen - although it is a look at the shallowness and competitiveness of men generally. The plot may sound simple but it is very powerful and insightful - although the men are exaggerated versions of reality in order to make clear points. The film doesn't totally satisfy but it is a great character piece.Almost to a man the leads are all excellent, Eckhart is almost pure evil as the man who we all recognise or know, while Malloy is great as the man who wants to be in the game but is getting to the point where he longs for simpler values. Edwards is beautiful as the vulnerable Christine who gradually opens up with confidence as she is made to feel more and more special.Labate's direction is spot on for this - most of the action is dialogue based and the sets are made like theatre sets. As such the direction is quite static but the camera is often set in very interesting shots. Labate's writing is the real strength with the whole dialogue strong, perhaps exaggerated and yet totally believable.A wonderfully harsh drama that will make you aware that will carry you along effortlessly.

I disagree.Chad and Howard were deliberately playing a 'game' (albeit a nasty and mean one) to strike back at the opposite sex for what they perceived to be inter-personal injustices perpetrated against them by the female gender. In doing this both Chad and Howard pursue Christine, despite her handicap, but whereas Chad continues the ruse until the bitter end, Howard actually does let his better sense of humanity prevail and falls in love, for real, with Christine.But Christine chooses Chad over Howard, clearly because Chad was more cute and charming in her eyes. By contrast, she more than once breaks Howard's heart before anyone has a chance to break hers.So, I would argue that HOWARD, not Christine, is the real victim here he is set-up and manipulated by Chad, whom he reluctantly plays along with from the very onset, and has his true emotions trounced by Christine, whose vanity leans her toward Chad, who is heartlessly playing a cruel joke on her all along.The movie is an excellent social commentary and is impeccably cast and brilliantly acted, all the way through. The real victim here, though, IMHO, is basic human decency.

This is my favorite movie of the past decade and it easily makes my top five films of all time. First off, don't come in expecting a stylish, extravagant film with excellent cinematography. Neil Labute's direction is the epitome of minimalism, with virtually no camera movement and entire scenes played out in one shot. I'm not totally sure, but I'd say there are maybe two or three medium close-ups in the entire film, and that's it. The characters are always viewed from a distance, reflecting Labute's background in theater (if you like this, by the way, read Bash, it will blow your mind) and allowing his actors to be as realistic and naturalistic as possible. Contrary to popular belief, stage acting is more natural than film acting; Labute's distance and long takes create a realism that is rarely seen on celluloid.This film is pretty much all dialogue, but this is some of the best-written dialogue I have ever heard. I don't think any man can watch this movie without recognizing some of the conversations that take place in this film. Aaron Eckhart and Matt Molloy are pitch perfect as the chauvinist, attractive, and ultimately evil Chad and the nerdy, pathetic, and ultimately emotionally doomed Howard. Stacy Edwards as the deaf Christine is also very strong; in fact, when I saw her in another movie speaking normally I almost fell out of my chair. I won't say much about the plot, for this is one of those movies that's really better to go in knowing nothing and watch the sickening events unfold. Let me just say that this film has a twist ending that marks one of the few moments in film that truly shocked me. In fact, I challenge anyone to sit still through this scene; I've seen the movie five times and it still makes me squirm in my seat. If you're looking for a big shock, look no further than this masterpiece, but don't expect a cheap thrill. Next to Vertigo, I don't think any film has hit me with a greater psychological impact. Oh, and if you're a female, and you don't want to become a lesbian, don't see this movie.

I have thought about the films I've seen over the last 5 years and tried to come up with some of the most significant.  This film is one of them.First of all.  First-rate acting from the three principle characters. Chad (Aaron Eckhart), Howard (Matt Malloy), and Christine (Stacy Edwards). Particularly on the part of Stacy Edwards.  Its very hard to imagine that she isn't hearing-impaired.Hopefully people will see this film and it will open their eyes to what happens in the corporate society we live in.  People like Chad and Howard exist in 90 percent of every office you have worked in and will ever work in.  If you and I walked into any corporate workplace, I could point out the Chads and the Howards in the office.  Chad that guy's a Chad.  Howard that guy's a Howard.  They may not fulfil the role exactly, but trust me it's them.  The difference between what I point out and what you see, is that they have adapted to their roles better than these caricatures in the film (I'll explain this further with my impression of Chad).  Neil LaBute presented us these simple characters, so its just a little easier for us to define.Chad.  Aaron Eckhart (poor sap -)) had to walk the streets for a year with people hitting him over the head about his role in this film.  He played it excellently, but over the top.  Most of the Chad's I've seen aren't so obvious about their intentions.  The Chads I know keep it hidden.  That is one criticism about the film.  Maybe LaBute told you to play it that way, so the blame may be elsewhere.  However, one criticism of this film is that performance.  Howard would have been a complete dimwit not to see through your machinations.  Heck, upper management(management doesn't like the obvious) would have seen through you and not given you that promotion that you so desparately wanted.  You are a sociopath.  You are a lion that feuds with the other alpha male lions to achieve status in the food chain. After the end of the fight, you are nothing.  You will be nothing.  The corporate ladder that you so desparately want to climb, will lead to nothing.  One hundred years from now, the Chads of this world.  They will be exactly that, nothing.  Just like the rest of us.  The problem with people like you is that you are too stupid to understand this.  This isn't a statement of Aaron's performance (which is very good).  It's a statement about that character and what LaBute intructed.Howard.  Matt, you played the role as well as anyone could have played it. However, you got what you deserved.  You allowed Chad to manipulate and ultimately control you.  Of course, this was the only way.  You are the weak.  You are the people that are stepped on each and every day of the week in this corporate world.  I would feel some sympathy for you, but you had selfish reasons for wanting Stacy.  My sympathy would be with you if only you weren't so pathetic.  Maybe LaBute wanted us to feel this way. LaBute was making this statement in the film, so maybe I'm justified in my opinion.Christine.  Wow.  Stacy Edwards you are a terrific actress.  I really, really hope you are able to shine in many other films.  I can't quite remember the way I was so entranced with any performance in a film.  I just thought you were totally capitivating.  I couldn't believe you weren't hearing-impaired.  Very good performance.  Pains me to say this, because I thought you were excellent.  However, you are far too beautiful for this role (I'm not complaining too much though!).  Maybe LaBute could have lessened your looks somewhat, although thats doubtful.  Its just hard for me to believe after 2 seconds of screen time that I (or any man) wouldn't want to date you -).  You were simply gorgeous.* Observations *I've read that this movie is misogynist.  This is very untrue.  It's clear to me that Labute's contempt was directed towards Chad and Howard.  True, Christine was devastated.  However, she is a survivor more than these men could ever be.  Yes, she learned a lesson at the end of the film, but it only made her stronger.  It was a lesson that Christine needed to learn. Howard learned nothing and will continue to be as weak and pathetic as he is.Where does it end?  There are no answers.  That is the truth folks, sorry. There are no answers.  Neil Labute gave us only a piece of our lives.  A piece of how we live our lives today in this society.  What you do with that life is up to you.One of the best films I've seen in the past five years.I very highly recommended film from me.If you are young and entering the corporate world for the first time, SEE THIS FILM.

I decided to reevaluate my first view, and I did not change my original opinion that it is a gem of cruelty. The character Chad is actually the personification of evil, not those caricatures that we usually see in other movies, but a very real one that we face in our jobs, clubs or social lives. Chad is charming, handsome and charismatic on his outside, but rotten, ambitious, cold and malevolent inside, manipulating and destroying other people for his self-satisfaction and promotion. Howard is also a very real character, that type of stupid guy with lack of personality and self-esteem that is easily used by others, becoming a loser in the end. And the poor Cristina is the innocent victim of this nasty game with her initial pure and later broken heart. The game is actually against Howard and she is the tool. The performances of Stacy Edwards, convincing that she is actually deaf, and Aaron Eckhart, with his cynical character, deserved a nomination to the Oscar.

The constant attention towards competition, survival of the fittest, and determination towards top performance can easily drive the sanest employee into an early stage of insanity. Thus, due to these pressures, employees are constantly found in a heated battle for the top spot or the illusive management position. Many will step directly onto your abdomen to ensure a promotion or pay increase. This form of random competition in Corporate America is very rare to capture, much less on film, but famed director Neil LaBute did a bit of the impossible. LaBute took the pressures of competition in Corporate America and camouflaged them using some stereotypes linked to men in the workplace. While some will argue that LaBute is doing nothing but exploiting male sexism/egoism and only built a stronger glass ceiling for women, I saw this completely different. Much like others, In the Company of Men initially enraged me due to the harsh treatment and depiction of women in the workplace, but then it occurred to me, that isn't what LaBute wants to show. As I watched this film a second time, I saw the real reason that LaBute created this picture. He wanted, and successfully accomplished, to show that you have to be smart both in your personal and business life if you want to succeed in this demolishing corporate world.LaBute's approach to this ingenious subject reminded me of how Soderbergh used sex to debunk his story in sex, lies, and videotape. From the opening scene, we think we know what this movie is going to be about. We think we understand that this is just going to be another dark comedy about how cruel the corporate world can be to women, but wildly LaBute (like Soderbergh) will pull the hypothetical wool over your eyes if you are not careful. This is not a movie about sexism (while it is used quite often to hide the real truth), but instead the power of manipulation, the power of emotion, and the ability to use your friends to reach the top. This is the ultimate betrayal film. After watching this film, I read some reviews that discussed how viewers hated LaBute for doing what he did to Christine, and that made me a bit angry. I too was disturbed by Eckhart's performance, but by being upset about what happened to Christine, you miss the truth behind this film. When I finished watching this movie, I was more upset with LaBute for what he did to Howard (Matt Malloy) than with Christine.How did this dramatic change occur? How could a viewer feel more sympathy for Howard than with the weeping Christine? LaBute has this amazing ability to cast believable actors that mold themselves well within their roles. Matt Malloy plays the perfect ying to Aaron Eckhart's yang. The two could not be closer to polar opposites, but the chemistry between them keeps us connected and glued to the screen. Their relationship reminded me of every Hollywood movie where the popular jock is great friends with the insecure geek. Malloy and Eckhart's relationship reminded me of the frat boy who happens to be a friend with the computer nerd. There is no initial understanding of why these two are friends or why they have anything in common. Sure, they went to the same college, but does that constitute life-long friendship? I believe from the beginning of this film, and possibly further into the pre-text, Eckhart has Malloy on a plan. We don't see the plan initially, but when it comes into light at the end, it hits us deep within our gut, giving us more pain than the Christine incident. How did LaBute set this up so well? Again, I state, Malloy and Eckhart. These two were methodical, malicious, and very close to perfection with their characters. We believed them. They sold us on themselves, which needed to happen for LaBute to make his point. Stacy Edwards is decent, but honestly LaBute could have had anyone in that role and we would have bought it. Why? Again, Malloy and Eckhart.LaBute did not just give us impassioned characters with devoted actors, but he also gave us an amazing story. He used the power of language to give us our opening, plot, downfall, climax, and twisty ending. It is not often in Hollywood that you see this technique used. It takes a combination of both a great (and engrossing) story with sublime characters. We already know that we had the characters, but what about the story made it worth watching over and over and over again. Having seen American Psycho several times, I felt like LaBute had read Bret Easton Ellis' novel over and over. He embodied the spirit and insanity of corporate America nearly as well as American Psycho director Mary Harron did. The pacing was tight, the six weeks seemed to fly by because we were glued to the results. LaBute kept us glued to the screen by shocking us with sexist remarks, macho thinking, and corporate taboos. Then, when he thought that we were not paying attention, he gave us the ending of a lifetime. The writing for this film was quick, powerful, and thought provoking, which nearly symbolizes this film. LaBute should have won an Oscar for this powerful and intelligent piece of cinema.Overall, I thought this film was vile, belittling, and grotesquely unsettling &#133; which is why I cannot wait to add it to my collection. LaBute proves to us once again why he is a master behind the camera as well as a commander with his pen. I read a comment that stated that Eckhart's Chad is the epitome of a villain, and I could not agree more. Neil LaBute has given us his first in a very long line of challenging, yet beautiful, cinema.Grade ***** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Monsters in suit and tie","Date":"18 July 2006","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" In The Company Of Men is a simple story that is told in a simple way.

From the early suggestion by Aaron Eckhart's character Chad to seduce and then dump a vulnerable woman to all the rest of his obnoxious comments, LaBute paints a picture of a vulnerable corporate ladder-climber afraid of losing control in his life. His bottom line is getting the one up on all the people in his orbit before they do. He knows how to play this game better than anyone around him also, especially better than his wimpy boss/friend Howard (Matt Malloy). Aaron Eckhart is absolutely astonishing as the corporate reptile with no conscience. Matt Malloy is just as perfect as Chad's boss/friend Howard, who has no idea that he's in over his head with Chad until it's too late. LaBute presents the wimpy Howard and the amoral Chad as corporate male bookends, who are finding it increasingly difficult to negotiate the corporate environment and female relationships.Clearly the Howards of this world will fall through the cracks, if they don't at least occasionally consult with their inner Chad. What disturbs some viewers is that LaBute is right and they know it. They just don't want to believe it. Surely, they frequently see exactly the same kind of behavior transpire unabated both in workplaces and in social circles. The Chads of the world win out over the Howards of the world a vast majority of the time; wimpy does not win in the workplace or in love. Perhaps if LaBute provided some introductory exposition, a la Michael Douglas in Falling Down, it would be easier to understand how Chad came to be. However, that would have lessened his impact in the film significantly and reduced him to a disenfranchised caricature. Maybe there is no reason for Chad being the way he is, and that idea is frightening.Admittedly, this is not a movie for all tastes, but there seems to be an abundance of misguided perceptions thinking this film is just some misogynist exercise. Perhaps the reason for this is those viewers' mistaken notions about who the real victim is in this movie it's really Howard, not Christine. He's a victim of his own weaknesses, not so much of Chad or Christine, and his inability to realize them. Christine is victimized, but if it wasn't for her willingness to simultaneously date two guys as long as she did, the plan never would have turned out the way it did. However, she is far more assertive and able to address her mistakes than Howard. The ending makes this very clear, utilizing her unique perspective to have the final say. The ending also disturbs many viewers, but it's very consistent with its characters, who they are, and how they behave. One problem with the film is that Stacy Edwards is too beautiful to be believable as a wallflower type, but she is very good as the deaf, shy Christine. As with many low budget, independent features, the film's strongest elements are the screenplay and the acting. This is a bold effort, especially for a first film, making no apologies for its provocative assertions that are all too real too often. ***1/2 of 4 stars.

Just a couple of days after seeing his superb 2003 effort The Shape of Things, I decided to watch his first film and Sundance hit In the Company of Men. This makes the bleak, misanthropic The Shape of Things look like Singin' in the Rain. The IMDb plot summary says it all Two business executives--one an avowed misogynist, the other recently emotionally wounded by his love interest--set out to exact revenge on the female gender by seeking out the most innocent, uncorrupted girl they can find and ruining her life.The avowed misogynist is Chad, played by Aaron Eckhart in one of the most subtly effective male performances of all time. Chad, this character, is probably the most purely evil character ever portrayed on film. Sure, there are psychos, sickos, nuts who chop people up, but they're really not all that real, and sometimes it's because they're not sane. Chad's real, and Chad's sane. When asked why he did it near the end of the film he says, coldly, 'because I could'. That's pure evil right there- a phenomenon we'd love to think is rare but which really isn't.The film is not a 'comedy' as the IMDb page suggests. I find the suggestion to be absurd and idiotic. Sure, there is dark humor here, and it is ultimately satirical, but it is at least as much a drama as a comedy and in my own perception far more significantly a drama. The film confronts head-on the male-driven workplace and its victimization of women, it confronts head-on the brand of misogyny that isn't uncommon among the white male businessman in North America today. That's not to say these characters, and the situation, aren't exaggerated. Sure they are, but that's a perfectly conscious, acceptable decision by the writer. The important thing is that the characters feel real, and that it is entirely possible for something like this to happen. Like The Shape of Things LaBute's screenplay is in-your-face and clear-cut about what it's trying to say. That there are people out there still having indignant 'it's so misogynist!' reactions to this film is amazing, they have to be either incredibly stupid or maybe they just weren't paying attention. Oh, I'm sure guys like Chad loved watching the film in spite of what it was trying to say because they supported his actions, but that doesn't change the fact that Chad is the villain in the film. Howard's a victim as well, not to the degree that Christine is, but still a victim. Without any overacting or psychotic antics, Eckhart embodies a significantly real, cold sort of evil which the movies rarely feature. This movie may feel a bit pointless in the end, because it's basically about how incredibly awful us human beings can be to each other, and how naive the victims amongst us are, but it's a terrific screenplay and film regardless.

Howard is unconfident,disorganized, short and overweight but intelligent and successful at the same time. Christine, the deaf typist, is vulnerable as her disability makes her self conscious of the way she speaks. The two men, both bitter about recent break ups with their girlfriends, decide to date Christine so as to build up her confidence (which due to her self consciousness about the way she speaks is understandably fragile in social situations) and then dump her in an attempt to break her belief once again. Therefore they will be striking back against the female community which they feel has wronged them. The results are fascinating and somewhat upsetting.As for my one line summary above.This is the moral of the story. It would seem on the surface that the conclusion is that Christine is the victim. But this is wrong. Howard is the true victim here. Chad not only gets promoted while Howard is demoted but illustrates his superiority over Howard in terms of sex appeal and in his ability to constantly gain control over situations in the work place. Chad can sit back in a boardroom and call everybody a c**ks**ker or f**ker behind their backs to everybody else's amusement and get away with it.Howard meanwhile struggles to even introduce himself to co-workers.I think it should be noted that as the relationship between the men and Christine develops, Howard begins to make mistakes and slip ups which lead to his eventual demotion. Chad though is able to maintain his cool exterior and continues to treat the relationship as a game.In the end Howard is a broken and lonely man with nothing. Chad meanwhile has become stronger and more powerful yet his attitude remains the same.Eckhart is awesome as Chad. Anyone who knows anything of acting will tell you that such characters are a joy for an actor to play but the role is executed wonderfully. Its no surprise that it is on such a performance that Eckhart has built a pretty stellar career. There are also some shades here of his excellent recent portrayal as a tobacco industry spin doctor in the wonderful 'Thank You For Smoking' but the difference is that this one is in no way played for laughs.Matt Malloy portrays a much more difficult role very well and the portrayal of Christine is also very impressive.The people who criticised the acting in the recommendation section must be watching the wrong movie. I found myself enjoying the performances as much as the material which was very basic and offered characters which we have seen before in other films with a 'big business' backdrop ie.-Wall street.Overall its a somewhat bluntly executed but engrossing portrayal of relationships in the workplace and how as much as we may despair some people are just plain no good. The ending is also worthy in that it contains a twist that you really won't see coming.You will ponder it after viewing and if you like Eckhart it is somewhat essential viewing. "},{"Title":"Women.

In fact I was utterly shocked when I heard it wasn't based on one. It should have been, and I would go so far as to say it should be adapted into a stage production. The reason I say this is because the film relies on the dialogue, acting and character's emotions to move the storyline, and not action or explosions or nudity. Nope, 'In the Company of Men' is like a 90-minute play following three key characters. The first is Chad (Aaron Eckhart - in his feature film debut performance), a young, good-looking cocky businessman who's a crude and cruel misogynist. His partner/boss is also his best friend, Howard (Matt Maloy) a semi-geeky quiet guy who's very shy, especially around women. Distraught about their incredibly back luck with the ladies, the two decide to go through with a plan (initiated by the devilish Chad of course) to find a woman, both target her and trick her into loving both of them, then just leave her with nothing. Howard goes along with the plan with doubts, while Chad warm-fully embraces the idea. During a six-week business trip, Chad meets a beautiful, kind, understanding and affectionate office worker who happens to be deaf (Stacy Edwards) -- Chad's perfect mark for this plan. The rest of the film is pretty much Chad and Howard trying to score this chick and zeroing in on their torturous plan. It doesn't sound very interesting and entertaining, does it? A lot of the film drags, but I really liked it for three reasons -- the three main characters.The characters in Neil LaBute's 'In the Company of Men' are miraculous -- the three are very detailed and the actors who play them are phenomenal. Malloy is great as the nervous sap that is Howard and Edwards is always a pleasure to watch, but Eckhart steals the show by a mile. Astounding doesn't even begin to describe young Aaron Eckhart's performance in this as the sadistic and menacing power-hungry creep, Chad, who makes Stalin look like 'Mickey Mouse'. Chad could be described as a socio-path in that he doesn't give two sh*ts about anyone except himself and sneers at the thought of helping anyone out. For me, Eckhart was 100% believable during the entire runtime of the feature and he does such a fantastic job of reeling you into his mindset -- in other words Eckhart should have received an Oscar nomination for his work in this. Like I mentioned prior, Neil LaBute's writing has it's ups and downs and some pacing problems, and his directing is nothing impressive in the slightest. I'd say after viewing 'In the Company of Men' I was more interested in the greatly talented actor Aaron Eckhart then I was the filmmaker, Neil LaBute.In conclusion, I recommend this if you could enjoy and appreciate a film based solely on superb acting. If not, don't waste your time with 'In the Company of Men'. If you can fully appreciate acting at it's best, be sure to check it out.

It is a simple, cheap film with (like most low-budget indies) a small cast, but there is enough going on to really keep you enthused, and probably, with this arrangement of story and characters, really blow you away (if not disgust you at the same time).The story is about two different coworkers, Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) who are in town for some brief work at that office for their company. What looks like a regular business trip soon becomes a lesson in cruelty.Chad is quite a sadistic character who prides himself on being able to sell anyone, no matter what the cost. Despite appearances (and they're really hard to get past at times because he pulls this off so well), Chad is really a heartless character out to prove that he can sell anyone and in the end, do whatever he wants once he's in charge. He's not so much a control freak as he is a vicious character who simply partakes in trying to dominate others simply because he can (whether or not he really wants to doesn't seem to matter). Chad is one of the most hated characters that I have ever seen, and quite brazen and proud of his misanthropic attitude.The sickening thing is, that with Chad as a main character, I am not sure if the filmmakers intended the audience (probably males more than audiences in general) to allign themselves with Chad. To see Chad in themselves and actually, kind of enjoy what he can do. It's pretty sick to be tempted to find some of yourself in Chad, particularly if you find this the one moment you can openly bear that attitude, simply because the movie may encourage you to do so (through Chad's character). Whether or not the filmmakers intended this, or whether it just happens to some of the audience involuntarily (and you wind up agreeing or applauding some things Chad has done) is something I am not yet sure of.Chad's counterpart is the sometimes ambiguous, Howard. He is a weaker man than Chad, despite being his superior (only nominally speaking) at work. If Chad is the 'Id', Howard is, to some extent, the ego (and even at times, representative of superego). He doesn't seem very aware of Chad's cruelties, and sure isn't a strong enough person to put a stop to them either. Worse, we're never sure when Chad's games of cruelty end, or whether they're really games at all.Chad and Howard get together and plan to take out all of their revenge on life by hurting one person (psychologically and mentally rather than physically brutality) as much as they possibly can. Their target is a deaf coworker, Suzanne (Emily Cline). Howard's character, still attached to a conscious, isn't sure how far Chad is willing to go with this game (the way Chad talks, you can be sure he's in it for the long haul), and starts backing out after falling in love with Suzanne. He let his feelings get in the way, and so Chad is left to his own vices. And that doesn't seem to bother him at all.It is quite an interesting movie, as far as a character study goes, and quite a dark comedy that will you leave you feeling sort of detached and disturbed when it's all over (you might need a real comedy to recover) when you see just what an incredibly cruel person Chad is (in more ways than one) and how he is comforted and proud of it all. Though, Howard doesn't exactly come off as any sort of hero once he finally does come to his senses (though, he was always very doubtful of Chad). In fact, I don't know if Chad is supposed to look like some sort of hero towards the end of the movie when he reveals his true nature. (And I think it's pretty sick to say that he was). So, essentially the most interesting aspect of this movie is how we view Chad more than anyone else. What are your perceptions of him? Does it change as the movie continues along to the very end? The story is done quite well and simple enough to illustrate it's point and draw you into the characters (although it does go slow at points). The workplace setting is always convenient for black comedies such as these. I recommend watching it. It really is something quite different.

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to begin with a simple three-letter word wow. Wow, wow, wow. Out of the thousands of films I have seen throughout my life, very few stand apart as being incomparable -- but this may just be one of those films. It is one of the most powerful motion pictures ever made. Period. The story has an almost inevitable inclination to be mercilessly cruel, but set aside every preconceived notion you might conjure upon reading this synopsis a sexist businessman (played with cunning callousness by Aaron Eckhart) convinces his susceptible boss (a subtly brilliant performance by Matt Malloy) to play an unbelievably malicious practical joke. The two plan to seduce a deaf co-worker (a heart-breaking Stacy Edwards) only to dump her once she's fallen in love with them. The premise sounds like a Farrelly movie that went too far, but if there's ever a moment when the film (or its pitch black humor) is tasteless, it is only because the characters themselves (with the exception of Edwards) ARE tasteless. The first half-hour of the film was extremely uncomfortable viewing for me (as was the rest of it, actually), and at first I was worried that Labute was just doing controversy for the sake of controversy. But as the plot started to unfold as masterfully as a David Mamet play, the film's message became increasingly apparent. What exactly IS the message, you might be asking? To be honest, I couldn't really say. In the Company of Men belongs to that high category of art in which the message is so provocative and important that it cannot be expressed in mere words. But one of the most vivid points involves sheer cruelty why is it that some cruel things -- when presented appropriately -- we deem acceptable, while others -- such as the situation depicted in the film -- we find unthinkable? Labute isn't attempting to condemn his audience or exploit his characters, and anyone who tries to support this criticism will surely find himself without evidence rather, Labute exposes us for who we really are, and challenges us to become better. After typing that last sentence, I can't help myself from expressing yet another wow. The screenplay is ingenious. The performances are impeccable. The direction is elegantly simple. And the over-all experience is utterly unforgettable. In the Company of Men was completely ignored at every major awards festival -- proving, once again, that the Academy doesn't know ANYTHING about cinema. But luckily, enthusiastic critical support has helped this picture attain the larger audience it deserves. In his unforgiving portrayal of INhumanity, Labute has tapped into that other side of us that isn't nearly as popular the human side. Watching this film will undoubtedly be painful, but if your feelings are crushed, consider it a good thing. Because if you don't feel anything by the end of the movie, then you are just as heartless as Eckhart's character himself. In the Company of Men is one of the year's few films I believe will stand the test of time, and that is indeed something worth saying wow for.Grade A+ "}{"Title":"A different but truly good movie","Date":"26 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This great movie is very different from most other movies.An intelligent but also raw movie in the sence that it is cruel on a psychological level.

A colleague, who, not coincidentally, is black, says, on learning that Howard is dating the deaf girl, You're a bigger man than I am. He explains that such a bold variation is dangerous in their corporate culture! Howard is taken aback at the man's admiration of his daring; this new perspective astonishes him. It doesn't sink in, though. He has a chance to be a real man, and he misses it through his own brand of deafness to the invisible man (who has just paid him the compliment of confiding in him and assuming that he's not a shark).There is a subtle implication at the end that Chad may indeed get what's coming to him. His live-in girlfriend has the upper hand emotionally; he explicitly asks her for love.

As usual, lots of people seeing this movie were looking for characters to relate to, and feeling jaded because not only is there a dearth of such characters, but the film also forces the viewer to re-evaluate his or her personal belief systems. If the movie was not as successful as it is (in terms of stirring up deep-seated emotions), then there wouldn't be so many poor ratings on this BBS.The aspect of this movie I think gets overlooked is the character of Howard. Of course he is not the manipulative misogynist that Chad is, but in this manner his character reveals a more subtler objectification of women. He goes along with the wager, and although not as active a character as Chad, is every bit the misogynist Chad is. He just doesn't have the mettle to act on it, to utilize it like Chad. The fact that he falls in love with Christine in no way makes up for his earlier actions. If anything, his character is more repellant because his personality is not the overblown, cartoonish behavior of Chad. Howard represents the average man, the type who likes to think all people are equal, but in his heart things are always stacked in his favor.

Worse, it is a stupid movie that thinks it is a clever and insightful movie. Worst still, it is a stupid movie that somehow has duped people into believing it is a clever and insightful movie. The film features Chad and Howard, two corporate clones working temporarily at an out-of-town branch of some nameless, generic company. Griping about how badly women have treated them, they conspire to get revenge by finding a vulnerable woman who they both will romance and then dump. Showing not the slightest iota of logic, they conclude that this will vindicate men. How? Why? Don't ask; the film doesn't. Their victim of choice is Christine, a deaf typist who works at the company. So basically, they are saying they will prove they are not afraid of lions by abusing a kitten.The film got a lot of praise for its original premise, though in reality its plot is little more than a variation on the lady's man and the virgin plots (which were themselves drawn from The Taming of the Shrew), wherein Rock Hudson or Tony Curtis sets out to seduce Doris Day or Natalie Wood. In those sex comedies, the underlying theme is the same as in COMPANY OF MEN Men who resent women hope to put them in their place by seducing them and abandoning them. But in films like PILLOW TALK or SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL among many others, the women represent a challenge to the men. That is the power and the magic of the traditional Hollywood sex comedy the men and women were portrayed and accepted as being on, at least, equal footing and more often than not with the woman being seen as socially, ethically and/or professionally superior. And whether it was Hudson and Day or Curtis and Wood or Tracy and Hepburn or Powell and Loy, the battle of the sexes was basically a battle of equals. And the irony and romance of those comedies is that while the male plotted to drag the female down a notch or two to his level, in the end the opposite happened, she transformed him through love into being a better person. And any one of those films would be a thousand times more honest and progressive than a tired and hateful piece of dreck like IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. Writer/director Neil LaBute is of the breed of contemporary filmmakers who thinks that if he strips characters of their basic humanity and shows them to be loathsome creatures then he has achieved some sort of honesty. Nothing could be further from reality. In COMPANY OF MEN, LaBute has characters who are little more than dreary post-feminist stereotypes man as sexist predator and woman as hapless victim. He does neither gender justice. He apparently assumes that in portraying the white American male as being morally sub-human he somehow absolves himself of the sin of being a white American male. (And in a heavy-handed aside, LaBute kicks in a totally irrelevant scene where Chad humiliates a black man, just to let us know that white American males are racist as well. Yawn!) Anyway, the film has been accused as being misogynistic, when it reality, it aims to pander to the Gloria Steinems of the world with its politically correct gender bigotry.Yet, the film is appallingly contemptuous of women, not because of the attitudes of the two male characters, but because of LaBute. In making Christine deaf, i.e., handicapped, the implication is that as a woman she is handicapped as well. If Chad and Howard are corporate everymen, than Christine is presented as an everywoman, and therefore the implication is that women in general, and especially in the business world, are vulnerable, defenseless outsiders. This may seem like a legitimate statement to proponents of victim feminism, but it should be insulting to most working women. Creating a character who inspires pity is not the same as creating a character who inspires respect. The film goes even further with a twist ending that reveals that the whole plot involving Christine's seduction was just a ruse, thus saying that she is not only handicapped and vulnerable but inconsequential as well. A film about sexual politics is suddenly revealed to be a film about office politics, thus further degrading a character who otherwise has been the film's moral center. It is to Stacy Edwards credit that she is able to create in Christine a persona that is warm and genuine, given that the film itself treats her as nothing but a sad little joke.   Perhaps if the film had been a genuine comedy or satire, it might have been able to use its anti-male/anti-female feminism for self-satire. As is, the film takes itself oh-so seriously, even though its plot is as absurd as anything found in the Hudson/Day comedies. But devoid of real humor, not to mention humanity, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN reveals itself to be a shallow, tiresome film about shallow, tiresome people,...no, it's about shallow tiresome caricatures.

Except here, rather than bored aristocrats a wealthy kids, we have people whose lives are so mundane that the only joy they can find is attacking those below them... there may be satire here, but it seems all too real.

But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too.This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events.The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are.The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed.Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. Let's hurt somebody, alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded.Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his friend Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's workplace flicks, Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which business is seen to be neutral and mutually beneficial.Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive.La Bute penned The Shape of Things as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of Company. Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality (Fat Pig, Reasons to be Pretty, Shape of Things). Massive spoilers ahead.The Shape of Things initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming fit, attractive and healthy, and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam &#x96; she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of In The Company of Men - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh.Unlike Company, we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in Company, the relationship in Things is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of Compny? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see Vertigo)? Is Adam now a beautiful work of art despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes.The film features a shot of the sentence There is no morality in art. The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance it's all subjective, she says, moralists have no place in an art gallery. The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. You stepped over the line, Miss, curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that there is no morality in art, in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that there is now, no longer, morality in art. Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role.Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore.Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise.The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else.I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him.How does it feel to really hurt someone? "},{"Title":"The perfect example of how ruthless people can be...","Date":"20 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's victims of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend.In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine.Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well.As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position.As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature.The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience.The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the villain is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done.This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him.There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is.Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, Why did you do this? He answers, Because I could? Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you could&#x85; I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse. Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, They never got me the way we got her.The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings.As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too far&#x97;they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sport&#x97;but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result.LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad.Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

Splitting critics right down the middle, it's been called everything from a misogynistic rant to an astute modern day masterpiece, the truth is that it's neither of those things. Tho the crux of the story suggests misogyny is its central axis, both men here are painted in less than favourable light, and in fact the central female of the piece wonderfully played by Stacy Edwards is far stronger than most female characters in modern day cinema. Cheaply made and set in some nameless corporate company, director Neil LaBute crafts what is in essence a black comedy about corporate suits who backbite with carefree abandon, the men versus women arc is merely a strand in LaBute's intriguing picture.It's a film that most definitely is memorable, if not just for Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Chad, one of the 90s most despicable characters, but also for its cheeky and unexpected finale. The performances are strong and those who enjoy a dialogue driven pictures will revel in what is on offer here. It also serves as an interesting reference point to LaBute as a director, this being his debut feature, it showed a great deal of promise, but has that promise been realised? Nurse Betty, Possession and the ill advised remake of The Wicker Man suggest LaBute may need to stick to the basics of his talent, I shall be an interesting observer of Lakeview Terrace & the upcoming Death At A Funeral. 7/10 "},{"Title":"In the Company of Men","Date":"31 March 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" From directorial debut of Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty), the premise of the film sounded a very interesting black comedy drama, and being five stars, I wasn't going to miss it. Basically work buddy junior executives Chad (The Dark Knight's Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are on a six week business trip, and have both recently been hurt by women. They plot an horrible to find the most naive and vulnerable women they can as revenge to all women, to find her, date her, romance her, and then dump her, with her feelings and self-esteem being completely destroyed. They choose their perfect victim, deaf secretary Christine (Stacy Edwards), who can only understand people by reading their lips. It goes according to plan, especially for Chad who she is most smitten with, however it is complicated for Howard who has genuinely fallen for Christina. Howard cannot stand to see Christine being hurt and tells her the game that he and Chad has formed, and she obviously tells Chad she knows, only slapping him, after he leaves crying on the bed. Weeks later, Chad's real girlfriend Suzanne (Emily Cline) hadn't actually left him, like he had told Howard earlier, so no real change to his life, and the last thing Howard does is try to talk to Christine, but she ignores him, and the film ends with him constantly shouting listen. This independent black comedy drama is brave, hard-hitting, controversial and in some moments deliberately uncomfortable viewing, so I would definitely recommend it. Very good!

A series of set-piece dialogues in which it is very rare to see even three people in any given scene. Set in a non-specific 'corporate' world in nameless locations the film suggests that these people could be living near you... Chad and Howard are colleagues and friends, embittered with the world. Women, work colleagues, the system have all conspired to hold them back, nothing is their fault, they just haven't got them breaks. Chad decides to play a cruel game in which while on a six week relocation they will both 'romance' the same woman then dump her. Break her heart just for the hell of it. In their dotage they can bask in the glory of her humiliation. Though Howard appears the weaker of the two men he agrees to play an active role. These are not easy people to like, but the sad thing is they probably *do* exist somewhere near you. Chad is charisma and charm while spitting venom in private. Is Howard simply more easily led? I cannot decide, but he is no saint. They want a 'vulnerable' woman so a deaf typist is to these men ideal, they look down on women, a disabled woman even more so. I will not go any further with the actual story, it is worth sticking with despite it being at times difficult viewing. Refreshingly different.

"},{"Title":"Review","Date":"6 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" In the Company of Men is an incredibly disturbing exploration of men, woman, relationships, race, and corporate America. Neil LaBute's debut film as writer and director was billed as an independent dark comedy but may just as well been a Monster Movie. Chad played by Aaron Eckhart is one of the most haunting characters ever put on film. He is no creature or serial killer however but far more frightening. Chad is a good-looking, successful, charismatic, businessman who has absolutely no regard for anything or anyone in his life. Eckhart's portrayal is extremely convincing. You believe him when he is trying to be sincere and are sickened when he reveals his true nature. The film takes place when Chad and his introvert friend and coworker, Howard, have to go away on business to a small town for 6 weeks. Chad having just gone through a break up along with Howard decides the two should simultaneously date an innocent unsuspecting woman while on the trip. After they both win her over they will break her heart and go back to their normal lives with the satisfaction of hurting a woman the way they have been hurt. Chad finds the perfect candidate almost immediately in the quite pretty deaf girl Christine at their temporary office. The plot seems so translucent at this point. The two will obviously start to have real feelings for Christine, she will find out about the game they were playing and leave them before ultimately realizing she really loved one of them and then they will kiss on a beach in the last shot. Sounds like a job for Zack Efron and Hillary Duff. Fortunately this film is not all the way it seems. There is layer after layer of development. The friends and their disgusting plot of misogyny is only the surface of this film and without revealing any details it is far from the happy ending I expected. The film delves into the world of corporate America and the class and racial structure of business. The employees shown on the big project are white males and the lone young black businessman is forced into a brutally humiliating act to prove his worth. The women are secretaries or typists. It is also fitting that the company and there actual area of business is never even mentioned. The filmmakers disclose no details on the project or even the locations. This story isn't meant to show a small minority of a certain type of company or employee but a broad depiction of the structure of American business. Neil LaBute is brutally effective in this film and it should not be missed.

"},{"Title":"(Human) life at its most basic level","Date":"27 July 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I could write a litany of observations, meanings, and impressions of LaBute's screen writing and directorial debut product, In the Company of Men (ICM). I had seen the film a few years after it came out and, to be honest with everyone, because of my habit to gloss over a lot of things in years gone by, I really only extracted from the film what it superficially displayed hardened corporate men doing cruel things. However, very recently I re-visited this film while it was making a glorific return via cable TV and am now more cognizant of the incredibly diverse layers of psycho-dynamic dissection one could perform on the characters, especially the main ones, of this film. Since then, I have written intently on various ICM message boards, trying to sort and clarify the incredible amount of controversy and confusion this film sometimes elicits. One thing is for sure even though this film has been billed in various circles as being a comedy, nothing can be further from the truth. This piece is one of the purest dramatic character studies set on film - truly a masterpiece. Many people can easily be turned off, even repulsed, by the frat-like shenanigans the two lead male characters attempt to pull off in the film. However, if you can get past this most superficial perception of the film, you will find, in a stepwise fashion, progressively deeper insights of how human behavior is successively governed by innate human needs and emotions. Many themes and messages should be easily conjured by the viewer of ICM including, to name a few, corruption of power, psychological control and manipulation, and the accountability and culpability of human behavior. People could debate ad nauseum who the most evil character of the film was - and interestingly, in a very uncharacteristic-of-a-film way, all would be right. The main characters presented in ICM are certainly flawed in various ways and certainly some have lost any semblance of a societally acceptable moral compass. LaBute goes to great lengths to make no bones about this; in fact, perhaps the only criticism I have of this film is that at points some the acting is a tad over-the-top but, in retrospect, I see now why this was necessary. I hope that people that get to watch this film (and, in my humble opinion, I believe every adult should watch this film, no matter what station in life they're at) will ultimately use this dynamic presentation to discern, at the most basic levels, what the human interactions portrayed in this film are all about. Biological needs and drives - preservation of the body by food and shelter facilitated by work and preservation of the individual genome facilitated by sexual relationships - are, in fact, the most powerful life forces on this planet (in front of the psycho-dynamic and socio-dynamic forces). Societally, we see intensely cruel and evil actions being perpetrated in this film which I'm sure most non-sociopathic people would agree are just that. However, let us not forget that at the most basic levels, humans are biological creatures that, on an individual basis priority, fervently work on self-preservation - whatever it takes. Sometimes, as portrayed in this film, this really involves extending beyond the bounds of what society would deem as morally and ethically acceptable. I guess this is probably what has laid the foundation in creating that very memorable, and, I believe in the particular instance of this film, very appropriate saying All's fair in love and war.

Perhaps it's just my familiarity with films that take misogyny to a more disturbing plateau (I Spit on Your Grave is a standout example) that Men comes across as neither revelatory nor a masterpiece. That's not to say it isn't a good film. The plot centers around Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy), two handsome white-collar office guys who have been consistently spurned by women; Chad hatches a sinister plan that will take place over the course of a six-week company trip wherein the two men will seduce one woman for the sole purpose of crushing her at the end. Their prey is deaf secretary Christine (Stacy Edwards). Writer-director Neil LaBute's film is filled with incisive observations on the male manipulation of power and the shifting dynamics of relationships in the name of business and pleasure--Chad, Howard, and Christine become three-dimensional participants in a 'game' where the cruelty incurred is hardly one-sided. While In the Company of Men is impressive in that regard, one almost wishes LaBute would have pushed things to an even lower level of emotional devastation and degradation...I didn't feel as hurt as the characters, and I felt that I should have.

The final scene (which I won't give away here) is particularly heavy-handed and crass. This film doesn't so much make a point as beat you over the head with it. LaBute seems intent on using cinema as a vehicle to show everyone how precious and sensitive he is. You can picture an arthouse cinema full of beard-stroking twentysomethings all shaking their heads grimly and muttering Oh, how awful as the events on screen unfold before them.Undoubtedly, the behaviour of Chad (and, to a lesser extent, Howard) is disturbing, but the characters in the equally reprehensible AMERICAN PIE were far, far worse, and we're invited to laugh at those dummies. In the words of the late Bill Hicks, I'm getting mixed signals here. No wonder some people think this is a dark comedy.LaBute's script is full of clunkers. That is the key to the entire universe. What the hell? Life's for the taking, is it not? Well, yes it is, Mr LaBute. It's also too short to waste on pompous, self-conscious dissertations on the behaviour of macho louts who want to boost their egos by treating women like garbage. As hard as this may sound, the antics of Chad don't amount to a hill of beans when you consider that there are neanderthal slobs out there whose idea of a fun night in is beating up their wife and sexually assaulting their own children. Wake up and smell reality, Mr LaBute.The film also *looks* bad. The photography has a strange, grainy, 'shot-on-video-and-transferred-to-film' look about it, the direction is practically non-existent, and the actors often seem terrified of making any kind of movements in case they slip out of frame. I sat there playing that ever-popular game, If only I was the director, constantly visualizing more interesting angles and shots in my mind. Also, notice the heavy symbolism when the camera zooms in on yellow construction tape with CAUTION printed all over it. Subtlety isn't this film's strong point.In all, this was a wasted opportunity.

Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are business associates, ten years out of university (they attended the same school), and are about to embark on a six week special assignment in another city for their company.  As they wait to board their plane, Howard reveals to Chad that his girlfriend has just dumped him; aboard the plane, Chad shares with Howard that his girlfriend has just dumped him as well, in a quite insensitive manner, at that.  No warning, no note, just one day&#150; gone&#150; end of story.  Chad muses to Howard that things seem to be getting out of hand; women have the upper hand in relationships, and even worse, seemingly in the workplace, too (not to mention the competition from the younger guys coming up and already snapping at their heels, career wise).  `You can't even tell a joke in the workplace anymore,' he tells him.  And it's time to do something about it.  Toward that end, Chad hatches a scheme through which they can get back on top and `regain their dignity.'  And for the rest of their lives, no matter how bad their relationships go or what `they' do to them at work, they'll always have this one thing, something that's worse than anything anyone will ever have done to them.  At first Howard isn't sure, because it's so `out there,'  but Chad sells him on the idea, and they go to work.  Their plan is to do it over the next six weeks, then it's over and they're on their way home.  Back on top.  Forever. 	So begins what can only be called a study in abject cruelty and humiliation and, moreover, of a sick mind that in many ways is more telling than anything gleaned from movies such as `The Silence Of The Lambs,' or `The Cell.'  What's so unsettling is the fact that Chad is so `normal;' the young, clean-cut, charismatic all-American role model type, and to discover that such a person is capable of such unconscionable behavior is enough to awaken the paranoia in even the most jaded observer.  The mere concept of Chad's scheme is so despicable even to contemplate, that to see it actually played out becomes almost unbearable at times to keep watching.  But you can't help yourself; LaBute's deft handling of his own material makes it so engrossing that you simply can't look away.  He takes you right down the path to where he wants you, and knows exactly which buttons to push along the way to keep you there.  Even against your own will. 	Aaron Eckhart gives a remarkable, almost chilling, performance as Chad; to be able to create such a loathsome character, someone who can evoke such utter contempt, bespeaks his ability as an actor.  This is a guy you will not soon forget, and  may make you think twice about more than a few casual acquaintances and co-workers, while wondering if things or people are ever actually as they seem.  That Chad is someone with whom you can so readily identify (at least on the surface), makes this brush with him all the more disquieting.  To have to acknowledge his perverse power over others is even more so.  As ultimately one of the pawns in Chad's game, Matt Malloy gives a good performance as Howard, but it's a character for whom it is hard to muster much sympathy.  The most notable performance in the film, however, is turned in by Stacy Edwards (Christine).  It's a tough part, and she plays it to perfection with just the right touches of strength and vulnerability that gain her the empathy of the audience while making her an entirely sympathetic and memorable character. 	A hard-hitting drama punctuated with a driving score (that is especially effective during the transitions of the passing weeks), `In The Company Of Men' will get your adrenaline pumping and make your blood boil at the same time.  It's a sad commentary on society, but a wake-up call with a moral just the same.  It's a case of acquainting oneself with ugliness, that one may then recognize and appreciate true beauty.  Be forewarned, this is a movie that will get under your skin; but at the same time, it's going to make you know you're alive.  You may not like it, but you're definitely going to feel it.  I rate this one 8/10.

They do this because they are sick of failed relationships and are sick of everything in general.  Eckhart comes up with the scheme and Malloy reluctantly agrees with Eckhart's twisted views on the opposite sex.  The target of their assault is a beautiful young secretary who happens to be deaf (Stacy Edwards).  The game starts and Eckhart proves to be a merciless competitor.  However, Malloy still cannot help but feel sorry for the young woman.  He continues with the game anyway.  As the game progresses, the stakes get higher and the costs become greater.  Everything will come to a head at the end and there will be a twist that will both shock and sicken the audience.  In the Company of Men is an intensely strong film that is hard to watch because it is so realistic.  The screenplay is amazingly insightful.  I have been around men who act and talk just like Eckhart and Malloy do in this film.  The first time I encountered people acting this way was in high school, with what I always referred to as locker-room talk.  However to be fair, there are some women who play this sick game as well.  Neil LaBute's direction is just as sharp and intelligent as his writing.  The three key players are all superb.  Eckhart is so menacing and evil throughout, he plays the part to the paramount.  Malloy has a very difficult role as he plays the man in the gray-area.  He is not totally gone like Eckhart, but he is not totally there either.  He is walking a dangerous line that is going to change his life forever.  With all that said, it is Stacy Edwards who is the revelation.  She plays a deaf woman perfectly.  Many people thought that she was really deaf after seeing this film.  Her performance enhances everything else that is going on in the film and she should have received an Oscar-nomination for this role.  Heart-wrenching and difficult to sit through, In the Company of Men is an intense character study that was easily one of the best films of 1997.  4.5 out of 5 stars.

He gets a black worker to pull down his pants and show him his balls. He says he needs to see if he really has the stuff to be recommended for a promotion. He tells him, the guy who wins is the guy who has the nastiest sack of venom. In case the guy doesn't know he's been humiliated, as he pulls up his pants, Chad tells him to get him a cup of coffee, black.Christine (Stacy Edwards) is a pretty girl in her twenties, a lightning fast typist in the secretarial pool. She's very nice and caring. Problem is she's deaf and talks funny. Chad spots her and decides she is perfect for this little game of broken hearts he wants to play with Howard (Matt Malloy), his slightly nerdy friend, co-worker and sometime boss. We'll both date her, he says, and then dump her. That way we'll get back at all the women who have done us dirt. He has an ulterior motive as well. He wants to destroy Howard, just to prove he can.What makes this film work is the sheer brutality of Chad's bloodless methods, and Director Neil LaBute's suffocating depiction of predatory life in the corporate structure.

As they progress, one character initiates a game wherein they will each date the same woman with the intended goal of emotionally wrecking her once their time in the field done. They select the most defenseless of women, a deaf girl who wished no harm to anyone, and upon whom the attention they lavish is welcomed doubtfully, then completely.Then, as per plan, they break her heart.The movie, however, is about more than the plot. The plot serves as an allegory for the whole of male relationships and the way corporate culture breeds monsters. Monsters that feed on the appearance of control, the appearance of power. The two men can be defined in the simplest of terms - the stud and the geek. The stud controls the geek through subtle manipulation (the stud lies about the status of his current relationship to gain the geek's confidence and compassion), and the geek goes along, seemingly out of fear of appearing 'uncool' to his friend.The movie is technically sound - nothing special, nothing less than quality. The acting is very good. The two men fit their roles aptly - which is somewhat scary. The stud is a horrible man, the worst of men; the geek is the weakest of men, striving to find his own power somewhere, anywhere. The woman is window dressing - anyone could have played the part.My curiosity is whether Labute, who wrote and directed, hates men or women, or both.

There can't be a person out there who hasn't at one point deliberately taken an action that has had similar repercussions. Emotionally cruelty is the worst cruelty of all.The performances are straight out of reality and when coupled with the direction it made me feel that I was a fly on the wall.  That's what hurt. Chad's character is not over-the-top as suggested elsewhere in here.  You can pick a Chad out in plenty of places.  Unfortunately the stereotyped male leads (superstud and nerdy) spoil the film a bit and whilst a deaf girl isn't exactly a character you can despise, her deafness becomes increasingly irrelevant as the film goes on (as seen by the emotional bonds that develop between the nerd and Christine).Ultimately it doesn't say anything about the male psyche or relationships, but it does show an extreme version of the kind of emotional cruelty of which we are all capable.

It is a social commentary that takes a good hard look on what we in society like to call relationships. It's about the way women really do set themselves up for disappointment when they always fall for the bad boy. It's about the way men aren't really men unless they are hard-hearted, unemotional, and unreal. Let me explain.In the end, it's Chad who starts and ends the entire ordeal- it is he who drives the final stake into Christine's heart. And yet it is also Chad who makes his way upwards through the corporate ladder, Chad who charms his way into Christine's life, Chad who goes home to loving wife. Why? Because he is what society looks for in a man. And the only one to ever figure it out is Howard. The only one who really feels anything for Christine is Howard. The only one who ends up alone and broken (throwing up in a stairwell) is Howard. At the end of the movie, he screams at the top of his lungs, trying to get Christine's attention- but he is not heard. Neither are we.The truth is, any man who has the independence not to become a cold, unfeeling b*****d gets the short end of the stick from society. And in modern society, it takes a man of great will not follow Chad's example and come out on top. The moral of this story is simple nice guys finish last.The entire movie is thus built upon a central metaphor. In essence, the modern corporation is a manifestation of LaBute's Company of Men, it is an entity that calls for fundamental male-ness. The corporation is a modern day battlefield, and there's no room for  politeness.

I think that In the Company of Men (ICM) is a great movie. Everyone gives their reasons, but I think people did not pinpoint it. I will try to do just so.First, it is a movie about men. Not that the movie would have been any different if the leads (Howard and Chad) were played by female. The point is that the movie would have been much more complex and probably too difficult to comprehend if not for flat females. Basically, there are only three females in the movie and even though Christine (deaf girl) occupies quite a lot of screen time, she is just a filler.Second, the movie is anti-political correctness in the most intelligent way. Nobody gets killed, there are no unnecessary profanities but it packs a punch to PC and to the whole Hollywood machine of producing happy movies. The movie says things that we all already know Sometimes the worst people get everything. With the sense of escapism surrounding most American movies, this is a refreshing movie that actually plays by the rules of Hollywood. It makes people feel bad because they got used to feeling good. This duality of screen and real life became so much the part of our lives that we are shocked when we are shown the life as it is.Third, the camera work, editing, music, dialogue, etc. are not that great. You do not see great effects, there is no edge in editing, the movie has a sleazy-tv-soap-opera feel to it. Nothing more. And this is the whole point of the movie. The surrounding, the people, anonymous bars... we unconsciously associate with all that. There is nothing to prevent us from doing so. Gummo, Kids, Tetsuo... even Blade, they are all non-PC, but their plots leave an element of escapism, the situation seem unreal or at least too far away to worry.But ICM scraps all the escapism in order for you, the viewer, to finally engage into the movie that actually makes you feel bad.This, I think is the greatest achievement of ICM.

They decide to have a revenge on women and will both seduce one, they will expect her to fall in love with one of them and they will give her up. We spend our time asking why they really decide to do that, do they really want to hurt someone like that for such reasons ? we try to find a concrete reason to their evilness, but we can't, we want to leave our seat because that's too disturbing but the questions we're asking ourselves can't let us leave it. The conclusion is very hard, but we've got there a reflection about power in general, not only about men and women,about those who have power (like Chad and Howard) and those who don't have the sanme power (Christine and Kif). we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism.

It is a twisted film of a twisted man (Chad) who cares for no-one, convinces another man (Howard) into emotionally ruining a woman (Christine), and succeeds in ruining both of them.Rare is the movie where the villain is the central character; rarer is the movie where this actually works. In The Company of Men is one of those rare movies.Now, this movie has been called a comedy. If it is, it is a joke far too bitter to laugh at. It is though-provoking, it is sweet at times, it is indeed amusing at times, but in the end, this movie is VICIOUS. Chad is cruel beyond description, and enjoys nothing more than twisting people for his own pleasure, simply because he can (he even brags about this).My personal opinion? I utterly despised this movie. It was well-done, and I hated every minute of it. This must be the ugliest film I have seen in my life, because I know Chads, I know Howards, and I know Christines. All Neil LaBrute need to do is make In the Company of Women, and show how women destroy men.No, this movie is no comedy. Not because it isn't funny, but because in the end, it is profoundly UNfunny. Movies that are not funny simply have their intended humor fall flat; movies that are UNfunny are quite simply never intended to be humorous in the first place (or at least seem that way).And I cannot see any way this movie was intended to be funny.

With an obviously limited budget, this first-time feature from writer/director Neil LaBute really turns its characters inside out with a visceral potency that could not have been attempted by the major studios. The plot focuses on two middle management types, Chad and Howard, who are on a six-week project in the company's Midwest branch office. On the surface, Chad is a smooth-talking braggadocio who after breaking up with his girlfriend, claims to be fed up with the neediness of women. But underneath is a dark sociopath who is unfathomably cruel to anyone in his path. Watch the scene where he makes a black co-worker pull down his pants to prove he has the balls for a higher profile assignment.Having just been dumped by his fiancée, Howard seems like the more benign of the two and looks toward the cynical Chad for guidance at the office and with women. However, his insecurities reveal an innately pathetic figure who wants to be able to exert power over someone defenseless. Realizing their mutual bitterness toward women, the two decide to make a disreputable pact to romance the same woman during their business trip only to dump her at the end. Enter Christine, a pretty office secretary who happens to be deaf. You can figure out the rest, but the way LaBute relentlessly reveals the characters' weaknesses, including Christine's, is piercingly honest to the point of painful. Even the twist at the end is well-justified, as LaBute's perceptive script makes the situation hauntingly cathartic.In his first important role, Aaron Eckhardt, with his square jaw and cocksure manner, is superb as Chad, and it took him several years (probably until his heart-of-gold Hell's Angel in Erin Brockovich) to recover from this impermeable persona. In fact, he tweaks it as the unapologetic tobacco lobbyist in this year's Thank You for Smoking. As Howard, Matt Malloy certainly makes a most convincing dweeb, while Stacy Edwards (who is not deaf) elicits the right emotions with Christine, obviously the only sympathetic role in the movie. The DVD has two commentary tracks - the first with LaBute, Eckhardt and the crew, and the second with the three principals and again with Eckhardt. Both are quite insightful with the latter particularly entertaining for the contrast between the actors and the characters they play. Be forewarned that this is in no way a feel-good film, but it does make for seductive viewing.

The film, which premiered to great critical acclaim at 1997's Sundance   Film Festival, initially had trouble obtaining a U.S. distributor (for   the record, Sony picked it up). The reason is simple because of its   brutally-direct depiction of certain aspects of the current North   American social climate, In the Company of Men is anything but   entertaining. It's virtually impossible to sit through this film   without suffering bouts of intense discomfort, and therein lies its   power.    The picture begins as something much different than what it concludes   as, and the metamorphosis occurs so gradually that it only becomes   apparent in retrospect. Shortly after In the Company of Men opens, the   intent appears to be to center on the conflict between the sexes.   Ultimately, however, this only a small piece of the much larger pie   into which Neil LaBute's directorial debut slices. In the Company of   Men widens its focus to encompass the falseness and gamesmanship that   underlies many aspects of everyday human interaction. It's a cynical   perspective that's all the more disturbing because it's grounded so   deeply in reality. The characters here aren't cardboard cut-out   stereotypes -- they're the kind of people you can find anywhere inside   or outside of the workplace.    Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are two very different   guys with a great deal in common. They attended the same college, work   for the same corporation, and have a history of bad relationships with   women. Their combined romantic record reads like a litany of injustices   perpetrated on them by females. They have been duped, rejected,   neglected, and intentionally misunderstood. Chad, ready to go to war   against the entire gender to restore a little dignity, has a simple,   vicious suggestion for revenge. They will find a woman who has trouble   getting dates, both take her out, then, after duping her into falling   in love with one or both of them, they'll dump her at the same time.   Howard is initially reluctant, but Chad talks him into it before   locating the perfect target an attractive-but-deaf typist named   Christine (Stacy Edwards), whose disability has caused her self-esteem   to erode.    Have you ever seen anyone leap from the top of a skyscraper? Or perhaps   watched as two cars collide head-on? The revulsion and horror are   indescribable, but the compulsion to look is too great to ignore. No   matter how deeply the experience tears at the soul, we can not avert   our eyes. It's a base reaction, but that's human nature. Sitting   through In the Company of Men is a cleaner, more guilt-free experience,   but it's not entirely dissimilar -- much as we dread viewing what must   happen, we cannot tear ourselves away. As painful as this film can be,   it is never less than engrossing.    The film doesn't follow a linear path; it evolves continually, which is   untrue of many lesser motion pictures. At the beginning, everything   seems deceptively simple, but there are layers of complexity underlying   each move. As the story unfolds, it becomes difficult to discern a   genuine action from a duplicitous one, and once-clear motives grow   murky. Slowly, however, the truth begins to assert itself, and, for   those who really understand what drives these characters, the ending   will be inevitable, not surprising.    Much of LaBute's script is about manipulation and deceit, but he's   smart enough to show the characters manipulating each other without   turning that manipulation on the audience. Nevertheless, because we   become so involved in the interaction between these people, it's   impossible for us not to be enflamed by what's transpiring, or to hope   that justice comes from heaven in the form of a lightning bolt. Part of   us wants a deus ex machina resolution; however, LaBute's solution is   more true, albeit less cathartic. And, considering the overall impact   of In the Company of Men, it's hardly worth mentioning the   writer/director's few rookie mistakes (static camera placement,   occasionally stilted word choice).    The lead actors, none of whom are well-known, give impressive   performances. Aaron Eckhart, who has slightly more camera time than his   fellows, brings a surprising depth of humanity to the   charming-but-vengeful mastermind of the plan. As Howard, Matt Malloy   does a good job emphasizing his character's internal conflict. The best   member of the trio, however, is Stacy Edwards, who brings fire,   passion, and fragility to Christine, and wins our hearts in the   process.    If you want every movie that you see to be Sleepless in Seattle, avoid   In the Company of Men. This movie doesn't take prisoners, and feel   good is a term no one will ever use to describe it. But In the Company   of Men deserves high praise because what it does, it does   extraordinarily well. Finally, here's a film with the guts to tell this   kind of the story without turning it into a fairy tale. It's rare for   any motion picture to generate such a profound sense of disquiet, but   the path traversed by LaBute's characters is so bold that it's   impossible not to be affected.

Man, what an unsavory experience! It may also make one think about the deeper underlying issues. The question of what kind of cultural, social or family circumstances could possibly breed this specific brand of monstrous behaviour towards a fellow human being. In Chad, we truly get a completely different sort of a movie villain. Are there really people like this out there - sporadically engaging in such elaborately horrific acts and then happily resuming their regular, socially sanctioned activities without as much as a second thought? And if so, what made them that way? Without intention of getting all sociological on yo' ass the answer to above question depends on which popular theory of human behaviour you subscribe to - biological determinism or its opposite, cultural determinism. The former locates the key to explaining human behaviour in some aspects of human physiology (that is, anatomy, hormones, genes, and so on), while the latter identifies contact and interaction with our surroundings as things that over time make us into people we become. In reality, human behaviours are a mixture of both these concepts - result of a complex interplay of biological drives (nature) and social learning (nurture), with each feeding back on and altering the other in a never-ending process.Truth be told, in Chad's particular case I'm leaning towards nature. To reach that level of evil, I think one has to already bring a lot to the table in terms of his/her brain's faulty wiring and other such built-in hereditary features. No amount of gray-tiled corporate corridors, cramped cubicles or lack of love as a child can mold you into a beast this cold and calculated. Or at least, for the sake of humanity, I hope so. Then again this IS a movie and these ARE fictitious characters created by Neil LaBute and as such are probably greatly exaggerated.If nothing else, 'In the Company of Men' will definitely give you something to talk about.PS Movie was made on a $25,000 budget (IMDB data) and, oh boy, does it ever show. Boom mic made so many unwanted appearances it should have gotten an acting credit at the end. Extremely poor sound quality is another par for the course.

As it is, it's like watching Joan of Ark burn at the stake for an hour and a half.Two guys decide to get even with all the women who have hurt them by finding one innocent bystander, pretending to court her, then abruptly dumping her. One of the guys, Chad, is the instigator -- clean-looking, smooth, a moral idiot -- who succeeds in dethroning his friend, bedding the victim, and winds up happily ever after lying back on his bed, staring at the ceiling, and wearing a big smirk as his girl friend goes down on him like some Yemeni hooker. The other guy is something of a schmuck, looks a bit like Tommy Dorsey, and goes along with the gag at first. Then he finds that he is actually falling for the victim and tells her the truth about the game being played on her, handling the whole nasty business very badly. I mean, when you're giving someone the bad news like that, it's generally not a good idea to grab her by the shoulders and shake her vigorously back and forth while screaming at her, Can't you understand? Are you stupid? Stacey Edwards as the girl is not at all dumb but she is deaf. And innocent and helpless. And when the two guys begin hitting on her at the same time and one of them plays hurt, she blames herself for it. (My kind of woman; where do you find them?) She's attractive too, and is able to generate just enough of the sort of voice that hearing-challenged people use as to be believable yet comprehensible. Her head darts birdlike from side to side as she tries to follow a speaker's lips so she can read them. At the end, Tommy Dorsey comes back to her and begins to shout at her again because he's still in love with her -- Listen! But from her point of view, all we see is some unprepossessing little guy flapping his mouth in silence. The oily, bitter guy, Chad, by the way, is really a no-goodnik of the first order. Once he has displaced his friend and assumed charge of the project he calls in a black guy for an interview for a possible promotion, and humiliates him by making him drop his pants and reveal what kind of testicles he's got. Well, it's ridiculous, sure. That's where any normal job interviewee would say, This interview ends right now, and would walk out the door. But the whole low-budgeted talky film is ridiculous. Men and women don't act this way. Oh, some women may act as gracefully as Stacey Edwards does here; and some guys may be as dumb as Tommy Dorsey. But anybody of either sex acting like Chad would be found out quickly enough for the psychopath he or she is. It's unrealistic in another sense. I'm not sure any human being would flay a hearing-challenged person with such venom. You'd have to comb the ridges.And although if he's handsome, like Chad, and a convincing enough liar he might have a plenitude of girls around him, he would have no depth on the bench in the way of friends or job prospects.

If these men are 'evil', they are simply doing what they must to survive. As the last line testifies, 'I can sell pretty much as well as anybody' - selling is about winning at somebody else's expense definitively so.The strong emotional response to the film that many viewers have is entirely controlled - not only is it intended to generate a localised disgust for the behaviour of the protagonists but it is further intended to satirise the culture that rewards such behaviour we are being encouraged to generalise our moral disgust.So every scene is shot like a glossy sales pitch, smooth surfaces, corporate anonymity, we buy the dream, we become complicit (if we are not already) so become as morally decrepit as Chad, as Howard.It is a mistake to see Christine as the final victim - she is not. She is merely a victim. The ultimate victim is of course Howard who Chad deliberately played in order that he might triumph, in order that he might take the other man's job, in order that he might win. The suggestion is implicit he destroyed his colleague's work so that he would be demoted, he 'played along' with his heartache so that he could be rendered mute.So we see Howard and Christine through the windows of a card, through the windows of an Office, as animals in a zoo. Just as when Howard first entered he looked in the mirror, so he is left finally blinded, muted, destroyed. All those tall buildings with all that glass and we can't see inwards perhaps that is the reason why.Show me your balls. Sadistic only as far as any of us are 'responsible' for our own selfishness - that here is portrayed as another myth. Rather, such selfishness is exposed in a highly intelligent and thought-provoking film as no more than a manifestation of the behaviour necessary, expected and highly rewarded in a fundamentally amoral capitalist system.As a work of cinema, the film suffers, as do so many good films, from being too clever by half for the majority of its potential audience. If his film is emotionally bleak, LaBute is seeking only to reflect the amorality of his subject.

And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes.Unfortunately, times have changed.Yeah, I still like the film &#x96; I am a sucker for super-human characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes.Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement.Here we have two gentlemen, Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together &#x96; one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time &#x96; as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie revenge against women.Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeah&#x85;there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf.They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect.What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimney&#x85;not that it's relevant &#x96; it's just probably thrown in as you simply can't trust a smoker I'm assuming.In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad &#x96; who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing.And finally Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and speech is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting.It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie lie approach that always leads to the cliché revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a yeah, this could really happen story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors.I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes &#x96; such as, show me your balls &#x96; were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

The film is as much an indictment about the pathological pursuit of corporate profiteering as it is an indictment of modern day misogyny. In fact, it enables the viewer ( if he/she is perceptive enough to see) to understand the horrors of corporatism ( horrors many people are, sadly, paralyzed to) by presenting an account of the horrible, malicious trick they play on a deaf woman (something most people will readily feel for) as the horrifying intimate male/female relationship equivalent. The women&#150; really only represented by Christine&#150; are not represented harshly in the workplace but are only treated, obviously, very harshly by Chad's scheme. It reveals the misogyny that some men are capable of, but also depicts the juggling of men's emotions that Christine and many other women, whether you like to hear this or not (and I don't know why you wouldn't because unless you are completely deluded you know that it's true), are capable of, as Christine leads Howard&#150; the other male lead who is lured into the scheme by Chad, and is just as a much a victim in the story as Christine&#150; on by toying with his emotions, having him spend money on her, and dating him long after realizing she did not want to be with him. While the viewers are not expected to sympathize with the male leads at all but actually abhor them (certainly this is appropriate for Chad), Howard shows that he has human concerns and feelings toward others and is more of an inadequate, easily led whelp than abhorrent, and remember that he is being led on by Christine (although certainly not as deceitfully, and not maliciously).Chad is not at all what the majority of men would want to identify with, at least in any ultimate or meaningful way, and if the director and screenwriter were intending to make the viewer believe that Chad in this film is some kind of ultimate man then this is more sexist toward men collectively than sexist toward women, which this film is, of course, an indictment of that very sexism (indeed any film made in 1996 would probably not even be allowed to be released if it were actually advocating misogyny). Overall, an original, thought provoking, and daring indie pic that shows some definite guts (yes, I deliberately avoided balls) among the creators. You have to admire a film for that.

Even the put-upon female is never defined as anything more than a victim. And because we feel nothing for these cut-outs, the would-be 'emotionally devastating' twist barely registers, revealing the whole thing as little more than an overlong 'Tale of the unexpected'. Rather than the supposed exploration of males in the workplace alluded to by the punning title. Indeed, it appears that the film-maker sees this not as merely just an expose of the corporate mentality. But of men (bad, insensitive, manipulative creatures) in general, and throughout adopts an irritatingly detached god's-eye-view of events in an attempt to lend his work some authority. This approach merely makes the whole thing seem rather hysterical and smug. We can almost hear the director congratulating himself on his own cleverness during the unintentionally hilarious finale. A finale which renders LaBute as misogynistic as his creations. Watch the powerful 'Glengarry Glenross' for some real insight into the theme.

People just like the two main characters exist, I know people like that, and it's refreshing to see a film that looks so unflinchingly at how pathetic men can be.

If you think the film is at heart, misogynistic then think again, the two male characters come across as weak, petty and at times evil, whereas the female protagonist, though wounded and vulnerable is the only character with any goodness.  I also found myself laughing throughout, thus calling into question my own misogyny, something I didn't want to admit to, but I think all men must own up to in at least some small form.

Like many films if its type - A Clockwork Orange, Natural Born Killers, etc. - it has been misunderstood by some as a glorification of this type of behavior. Although it is not violent like films such as Killers or Clockwork, it is a terribly misogynist film about two sexist male chauvinists who embark on a business trip for a few weeks after both experiencing heartbreak due to women, and decide to take out their anger and frustration upon the female sex by coercing a kind deaf woman into relationships and then leaving her emotionally dead after both leaving to go back home without telling her anything in advance.The plan is orchestrated by Aaron Eckhart's character, who is one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen in a movie. He has virtually no redeeming qualities whatsoever.This film is very character-driven and relies heavily on dialogue. The summary for my review is The Big Kahuna because it reminded me very much of the Kevin Spacey/Danny DeVito movie, which basically had a cast of only three actors (four if you count a bellboy on screen for a few seconds). The Spacey character in that film is a bit like Eckhart's here.If you like satirical films and can understand the difference between a movie that is criticizing something and glorifying it, then you should definitely check this out. It's one of those films that the critics understood for the most part, but got really bad press on behalf of some female rights activists and conservatives who decided to jump on the bandwagon and brandish this film cruel and insensitive before actually seeing it, and as such in the public eye it failed miserably. Although it isn't a flawless movie and isn't as strong as other satires, I found it to be a fascinating and brutally honest character examination that revealed a lot of truth about society today. Not all men are as utterly vile as the two leads in this film, but to a lesser extent they exhibit a lot of the same traits as these two men, and also treat women as sexual objects.In the Company of Men is an unreserved insight into the minds of two bitter, sexist people - and if you think you can stomach some rather upsetting sequences of dialogue referencing women in a less-than-positive light (to put it nicely), this is definitely worth a look.
