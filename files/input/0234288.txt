[{"Title":"Just incredible...","Date":"13 March 2004","Score":"31 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Review":"  Just saw this on BBC4 - extraordinary - it's the kind of achievement American (and British) screenwriters should practice for years to emulate. Robert McKee, see this film!The writing, directing and acting are all superb, and in the service of a supremely human story beautifully constructed around timeless epic themes of man's inhumanity to man, war, and all the other big stuff. To separate these from the movie itself, though, would be to do it a great disservice. The mix of laugh-out-loud humour, gripping thriller, and finally a well-earned and unsentimental tear-jerker of a last 15 minutes is the zenith of a movie-watching experience. Divided We Fall is very funny from the outset, but it doesn't take long for the filmmakers to skilfully tighten the knot with sudden character twists and brilliant writing early on. Once we're immersed in 1943 Czechoslovakia, we're not only rooting for the lead character Cizek, played immaculately by Bolek Polivka - a winning combination of contemporary earthy Brit character actor Philip Jackson and 20th century comedy genius Alistair Sim - we're feeling like we're there with him. He and the ensemble cast play every beat of the story just right (there's even one moment midway through where the audience are maybe allowed to get a bit too far ahead of Polivka's character, but it's remedied by the performances). The visual flourishes, especially the effects of switching between film speeds and using a DV tape look, all enhance the narrative without intruding into it, and thus heighten the tension at unexpected moments. The costume and make-up designs bring the human stories to warm life; and set against war-torn 1940s backdrops, the production design could hardly go wrong. A great treatment of a much depicted time and narrative that manages to make events feel fresh, real, scary, funny, dramatic, ultimately hugely moving...somehow many more people should get a chance, and be urged, to see this film.

The car stops, and three men get out to pee. Two of them play a little prank on the chauffer. In the next scene, the chauffer is in charge, and the family of the boy who played the prank (the bosses who happened to be Jewish) are being evicted of their big house.And this is just a very minor aspect of the film. There are selfish people, and there are selfless people in this film, and more often than not they are the same people. Of course, those who want things spelled out for them would like to know if Josef makes the decision that is central to the plot to save his skin, to save David's, or to make his wife (who wants to have children) happy.This is not a Hollywood film. I like American movies, most of the time. They are great for entertainment, but if I want something for my mind and my soul, something that can make me laugh, cry, and think, then this is the kind of movie I want.

It is interesting to note that the names of the couple, translated, is Joseph and Mary.  David is the Jewish friend they are hiding.  If you have not seen this film you may not want to read on but I will try and be discreet about the plot.  The Jewish friend the couple is hiding is named David.  The Old Testament makes clear that from the line, or seed, of David would come redemption.  This redemption came both for Jews and Gentiles.  The child born in the film, from Mary and David, brings about salvation from evil for most of the central characters in the film.  The final vision at the end of the movie is one of Jews, Germans, Gentiles (and yes even dogs) sitting down and the banquet table of heaven together. One other thought about the film is how  often the church criticizes such films for the content.  The typical would you lie about a Jew in the closet ethical scenario is heightened in this film.  I do not believe the filmmakers are trying to suggest the act b/t Mary and David is o.k. but I believe it is interesting to see any story (breaking the waves another great example) disgust people for showing the nature of sin and evil to be thrust upon an innocent character and not realize this is the same idea of the Suffering Servant on the cross.

It is rare that a movie be harrowing, funny, sweet, and heart wrenching without being contrived.  What distinguishes this movie about wartime loyalties and collaboration with the enemy from well worn cliches is its finely nuanced portrayal of each character.  Not every collaborator is deserving of punishment and not every so called resistance fighter is a hero.  It is an emotionally rewarding movie and it shows that human behavior cannot be reduced to a Manichean struggle.

And instead of revenge in the end, which would only follow a boring good vs. evil plot, people not only forgive each other, they FEEL, that they actually always will somehow belong together. In the end, David Wiener, who was 2 years hidden in a small closet space says about Mr. Prohaska, the Nazi-collaborator He was a decent man, because he never denounced on his friends. Divided we fall. A big congratulations to the director & the script - details and traces always find a fitting match later in the movie. And for once we have liked the various camera effects.

Musíme si pomáhat had its Perth première at the Festival Film season held at a wonderful open-air auditorium at the University, a place which has for me always represented a celebration of life, and each visit on a balmy summer night is an expression of my great joy to have this beautiful sunny city as my home. My father, now nearly 84, loves coming here, expresses his joy at being alive, having come through unspeakable horrors, and sees each year he stays fit and healthy as a gesture of defiance to those who were so eager to snuff out his existence more than six decades ago.In watching Josef wheel the pram in that final sequence past the ruins of his war-devastated home town, I could see his great joy to be alive, to have come through the horror which ultimately had one of his own countryman put a pistol to his head and tense his finger on the trigger. All the sacrifices he made, having to put at incredible risk the lives of himself and his wife, withstand the grossness of the Nazi toady Horst (Würst), submit to associating with the loathsome German occupying forces, and ultimately insist on his wife having sex with David, have yielded their great reward. He has his son, biologically David's son, but in all reality his. He has his marriage, and they all have a future which they will now carve out of the ruins. It is an incredibly hopeful ending.Reading some of the other comments on imdb, I feel a few missed the point, especially the Californian guy who thought it was German language film (it's Czech, mate!) and those who were troubled by the camera shakes. I could clearly feel that these were expressions of Josef's moments of utter panic, when time for him seemed to distort into flicker-frame slow-motion and he was clearly struggling hard just to retain control of speech and movement. At one point he says that he had shat himself. I think I'd have done the same, and my mental camera would certainly have shaken.Ten out of ten. If you haven't yet seen it, do!

Particularly, non-Jewish, non-Nazi Czechs, although each of those groups are represented as well. The last few scenes of the film are ultimately a relief because, in light of the film's title 'Divided We Fall', the viewer half expects a pro-Communist forces message. This is not the case. The united Communist army representatives are shown as just as cruel to Nazis and Nazi sympathizers (even those who concede without a fight) as the Nazis were to... well ... nearly everybody. The title is, mercifully, not a political agenda, but a call for love and forgiveness - in this case, within what was once a peaceful and functional Czech community before Nazi occupation.My only qualm with this film regards the way that the camerawork becomes unsteady and at a lower framerate whenever there is potential fatal danger to any of the characters. I appreciate that when we apprehend a very real danger, our perspective does indeed change to a nearly surreal state. However this cannot translate into the cinematic device employed in this movie, simply because the technique is used not only for when one person becomes scared, nor even only for when any character is scared, but when the AUDIENCE becomes sympathetically scared for the character(s), whether the character(s) knows what's happening or not! Thus, it seems pointless - or at least, it doesn't give the audience enough credit to know when they should be scared simply by how the story is unfolding. Personally, I'd rather a filmmaker flatter my intelligence by assuming I know the score, rather than point it out to me every time.That qualm, however, is not as dire as it seems. Throughout, the movie retains its gracefulness, its fine pacing, and its delicate and unnerving balance between serene and severe, poetic and panicked. As an example, for a moment the picnic scene seems quiet, peaceful, lyrical, until we are suddenly (but without being hit over the head by daunting music or fast editing to drive the point home) reminded of the sickeningly casual scrupulousness of so many Nazis.The movie is also extremely well acted. In one scene, Josef, Horst, and a high-ranking Nazi show up suddenly to the apartment which is central to the film. David, caught out of the pantry, dives under the covers with Marie to hide. Horst, probably a little drunk already, comes in and hits on the supposedly bedridden Marie, whose face succesfully commingles her disgust with Horst, her fear of being found out, and her discomfort (physical and ideological) with David lying right on top of her. This is immediately followed by another fine piece of acting when Josef steps into the doorframe, sees what's going on (i.e. that David is under the sheets), and goes from shock to fear to panic to decisiveness, suddenly breaking into a manic drunken look and dancing foolishly and singing a 'funny' Nazi song. His pretended drunken revelry is a ploy to distract Horst and the Nazi officer. Here, as many other times in the film, the line between life and death is suddenly, palpably a hair's breadth away - and yet without any guns fired, pointed, or even drawn. Another interesting theme throughout the film is the lies and deceptions by the good people in order to save one another, contrasted with the situations in which someone's honesty would condemn his friends. Sometimes it's ok, even necessary, to lie.I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending of the film is a little odd. Yet I wholly embrace it. Film is an art form, and so it is allowed to employ a non-literal ending for the purpose of meaning. If you are put off by such unreal scenes, I suggest you watch less Jerry Bruckheimer movies from now on.This film is, overall, a masterpiece. It is visually beautiful, has a moving and well-crafted story, and is certainly the best Europe-during-the-holocaust film that never shows you a ghetto or a concentration camp. The other best Europe-during-the-holocaust films, which do show these places, are Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and The Pianist. I recognize that Divided We Fall is much harder to find for sale or rent than these other 3 films, but really, everyone should watch all 4. I firmly believe that the more well-made films you see on the subject, the more understanding you'll have, and with these four combined, you get four different flavours Czech, Polish, Italian, and American (about a German, among others). Divided We Fall is not to be missed.

Which is of course true, but often forgotten in our easy condemnation of those who picked the wrong side in past wars. To have been a baker in occupied France, say, and to have continued with your work, draws no retrospective judgement; to have been a senior civil servant is to earn today the label of a Nazi. Of course, Nazism was almost uniquely repugnant, and yet could have been stopped had no-one collaborated; but those of us lucky enough not to have lived through the war need also be careful about setting up standards that we ourselves could not have met. 'Divided We Fall' is a Czech drama set in World War Two, whose strength is it's honesty is portraying both the courage of ordinary people, and also the limits of that courage. It's heroes become reluctant enemies of the Germans when they shelter a Jewish fugitive for initially just one night; and are then forced to follow through on their actions. Director Jan Hrebejk is rather too keen on the peculiar trick of shooting film with a reduced refresh rate, rather like an old silent movie, so that his characters' movements appear odd and jerky I'm not too sure what this is supposed to achieve. The gloomy nature of the central protagonist also leads to a lack of tonal variation in the piece, he is terminally depressed even before he gets into trouble, and this pervasive mood of hopelessness takes some of the zing out of what at times feels a slow-paced movie. But the merit of this work is it's portrayal of real human beings, doing both good and bad things, for mixed motives, at times of intense pressure. 'Divided We Fall' might not be a great film; but it is a true one.

Life Is Beautiful awkwardly shifts between  scenes that are supposed to be funny, and scenes that are supposed to be meaningful or sad or intense, as if Benigni was making a joke, then apologizing for it, then apologizing for being too serious, and making a joke again, and so on. This movie plays it straight pretty much, and everything just works. Particularly the scene with the hands in the bed, and the scene where Josef is taught how to make Nazi-like facial expressions are hilarious.  The characterizations are very well done, particularly Horst, the horny scumbag of a Nazi who you get to like in the end. The movie is sometimes surreal. In many scenes the images are very jumpy and distorted, but that shows us what the characters are going through, effectively. The ending is maybe one of the greatest movie endings of all time.  It's very surreal, and you can interpret it in many ways. Its abstraction is what helps to make it powerful. When many people create art that has to do with the holocaust, they often go out of their way just to show us that they are making a statement about how horrible the holocaust is, as if theyre afraid that we won't think that otherwise. Even the classic Schindler's List does that, I think. But this movie is a different kind of holocaust movie. It doesn't try hard to show us that the holocaust was bad, but it doesn't neglect how serious the holocaust was, either. The only complains I have about this movie is that it is often slow, and a little confusing at the beginning. It's not a completely perfect movie, but it's definitely a masterpiece of holocaust movies. All the schools that show kids Life Is Beautiful should definitely switch to this.

Czech authors know well how to make a great comedy, and they proved it in 70's. Most of them do not cause loud laughing, it's more a smile inducing type of movies. But going closer to present these movies become rare, and even smile is either vanishing or becoming bitter. I almost don't find any reason to consider this movie a comedy. It's surely not a Czech version of 'La vita e bella'.The reason I send this post is kind of Byblical metaphor present in this movie, and (only) one poster (i_nealhoward@yahoo.com) wrote a good remark about it. There are some more examples I'd like to add.Joseph and Mary, of course, have these names purposely. Mary has a child to save a world, at least their own small world. Joseph in movie is not a father of Mary's child, but she became pregnant with his knowledge and permission. David is the real father of Mary's child in the movie, and according to Bible Jesus is a descendant of king David.Horst isn't Juda. He is more like a Roman soldier (centurion) played so great by Ernest Borgnine in Zefirelli's 'Gesu di Nazaret' he works for occupation army and fights against Jews, but he doesn't know the truth, and in the end (Jesus' death in Bible, child's birth in movie) he understands and starts believing. But there is Juda it is Frantisek Simácek, the neighbor who tries to betray David to Nazis, but later works for communists and accuses Joseph (and others) for collaboration. He survives being always with the winners changing his attitudes (if having any) the way it's most convenient, profitable and safe. Kepke is Pilatus, once he understands his power is gone he apologizes (washes his hands), but too late to change the evil he's done. It might be going too far, but you can imagine the communist leader to be a kind of Herod, putting in jail or killing all the suspects just to be sure no enemy will escape. Also, he sends three co-workers to see the baby and check Joseph's story, like Herod who sent the Three Kings to find truth about birth of Jesus.And the end scene can also have a religious aspect in the world that needs hope, Joseph shows a child to surviving, and due to a holy child we can see dead that forgive each other and enable building the world of tolerance and forgiving - the world of love, hope and peace.

The Holocaust and the Nazi menace have certainly inspired numerous fine films, with Schindler's List and The Pianist and The Tin Drum and scores of others covering the subject exhaustively. Why then another? Perhaps we can never be reminded too often to look at humanity's recent history, and perhaps because the subject of civilized man treating his equals in such subhuman ways can , in careful hands, perhaps impart still another needed reminder. And sometimes a repeated story has subtleties not covered heretofore. Divided We Fall is a story similar to that of Anne Frank's, and the idea of community is examined with quirky humor under great stress, and the concept of friendship is questioned in a way that may make you examine your own ideas.This is a thoughtful film with many surprises in store, and an ending that does not disappoint; because you probably will not will not recognize most of the performers, there is a feeling of truth in character that pervades this often-tense, sometimes oddly funny study of a society assaulted.

I like this, as too often films of the Nazi occupation are very black & white in their views. Now I am NOT defending the Nazis, but talking about those who worked with their Nazi overlords--who played the system yet, in some cases, managed to retain a bit of their humanity. I appreciated this very much and it reminded me of another very good film of this period--The Shop on Main Street. It, too, managed to show an overlooked side of this period in Occupied Europe.In addition, the film had nice acting, an original script and was well worth seeing.

The storyline is really about how people can stick together despite their differences and this is where it shines. The initial credits start by showing us a strange segment passing thru three years where nothing really happens except the introduction of the Jewish character who is ratted on by a neighbor so that their own family will not be harmed. We then are introduced to the main couple in the story entertaining a Nazi friend. They decide to house the Jewish friend and the conflict begins. The conflict is the real possibility that the Jewish person will be found and the couple will be punished as well as the entire town. The wife is the most stable person while the husband almost takes on some of the nazi's attitudes during the period while they are housing their friend. The movie shows how fragile the entire period was with the fear imposed by the Nazi's and the ability they had in changing the culture to becoming suspect of everyone. The couple want a child but are unable to have one themselves, but then end up telling a nazi that they are unable to house him because the wife is pregnant. The husband then makes the Jewish friend pregnate the wife to cover up for this lie. So, the Jewish character, is in some ways still imprisoned even though he is not in a camp. In the end, the four main characters work together to survive after the Czech's take back over the country and this is how the movie got it's title. The excellent performances and story and the opportunity to visit another time and place are just part of the reason to watch this wonderful movie.

It's not your typical Holocaust film, despite the fact that it is realistic about the fears and horrors. There is humor and irony aplenty.Josef and Maria are a typical Czech couple longing for a child. Through early clips, we see that Josef worked for the a well-to-do Jewish family who falls on hard times. Although Josef and Maria help their friends as best they can, the family is sent to Thereisenstadt, not knowing it is certain death. Josef is rather lazy, world-weary man with a cryptic sense of humor. Maria, blonde and beautiful, prays she will become pregnant. Their world is turned upside down when David, a young man from the previously mentioned family, escapes from prison and makes his way back. The couple decides to hide him in their home.While I must confess that this film was a tad lengthy, the story was worthwhile in many ways. It never totally pegs one character completely. They're all quite multi-dimensional. Horst, a friend with Nazi ties, acts like a jerk on the make for Maria most of the time. But in the end, he's not quite the villain he seems. Josef, meanwhile, must juggle hiding a Jew while appearing loyal to the Reich. His neighbors don't understand. He's afraid of what will happen if David leaves and what will happen if he stays.All in all, this story heaves an emotional hammer on views. You can feel the fear, the uncertainty, the anger and frustration in the characters. You know that at any moment, David could be discovered. That the facade could be destroyed in a heartbeat. Nobody is a total saint and nobody is a total martyr. They are human beings with human feelings and fears during a terrible time. I think that's what makes this movie so incredibly moving for me. I'll never forget it.

The film itself has fine acting from all the members of the cast, in particular Polivka who looks like the foreign version of Harold Ramis (also much more nervous), Kassai who gives some small yet very effective moments as David, and Dusek as the snooping and annoying yet also angry nazi friend of the couple.  The movie also has some very heart rending scenes with a fine script keeping things tense and well brought throughout.  Unfortunately, cinematographer Jan Malir diminishes what could've been a great holocaust film by including uneeded camera shakes and odd choices of camera movement of the characters in tense and important scenes (the last 20 minutes has this type of camera movement) and might make some nauseous.  But still, if people could take Blair Witch doing that, I'm sure people can take it here.

The three live in comfortablemiddle-class surroundings, and in a series of perhaps overly confusing quickcuts from 1937 to '39 to '41 to '43, we see how Jozef and Horst work together  for a prosperous Jewish family, the Wieners. These scenes fly by so quickly that  it's hard to make sense of their significance, and my girlfriend had to point out  one crucial relationship afterward. By the time we reach 1943, the Nazis are in  full control of Prague, and Jozef and Marie chafe silently under German rule,  while forcing themselves to host Horst during his frequent unannounced visits.  This tableau is overturned when the solitary survivor of the Wieners'deportation sneaks back to his hometown, threatening Jozef and Marie's safety  and imperiling them with reprisals for harboring a fugitive Jew.While the film starts slowly, and perhaps too muddled in the first crucialscenes, the dramatic intensity picks up during the second hour, with the struggle  of Jozef and Marie to protect themselves while behaving decently, withsometimes horrible personal choices to make. The most fascinating character is  Horst, who has suffered his entire life being ridiculed as a German-speaker in  Czechoslovakia, and revels in Nazi superiority at last while still proclaiming  himself a loyal Czech citizen acting with his country's interests at heart. I  found the ending overly sweet, under the circumstances, but it does wrap up all  the endings and demonstrates how a simple division of good and evil-doers in a  complicated war may not be possible.

The story begins with a series of three short vignettes starting in 1937, and then skipping two years ahead twice until we're in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1941. During these short scenes, we witness the falling fortunes of the Wieners, a well-off Jewish family, who are about to be shipped out to extermination camps in Poland. David Weiner, the son who is in his late 20s, naively believes that his family will be taken care of at Thereseinstadt, the model Nazi concentration camp which he later learns is a transfer station to the gas chambers.The inciting incident occurs when David turns back up in his old town after escaping from Auschwitz, looking for some kind of shelter and protection. Josef, formerly an employee of the Weiners, finds David hiding at the Weiner family's old villa. Josef tells David he can't stay there as a German family is about to move in there the next morning. Josef brings David back to his home where his wife, Marie, gives David some food, and they try and figure out what to do. David informs Josef that he plans to meet a friend the next morning so Josef drives him to the appointed meeting place in the pouring rain. When the friend fails to show up, Josef just cannot abandon David and drives him back to his home, where he and his wife agree to shelter him in a hidden pantry until the war ends.The tension in the plot comes mainly from the most unusual character, Horst, who worked for the Weiners before the war and reported directly to Josef. Born in Bohemia, Horst is an ethnic German, who is married to a German woman. Horst has a secret crush on Marie, who is the main object of his visits. Horst is a Nazi collaborator who eventually conscripts Josef to work with him in his primary job&#x97;confiscating Jewish property from the Jews who are about to be shipped away to Poland. Josef agrees to work with Horst since the job will take away any suspicion that he may be hiding a Jew in his home. The down side is that the neighbors come to believe that Josef is now collaborating with the Nazis.Divided We Fall is an unusual film as the Holocaust is treated from a comic viewpoint. It's been said that comedy is almost like tragedy, but at the last moment one looks away. Thus, as Andrew James Horton says in his review of the film, director Hřebejk portrays the German occupation as relatively peaceful, albeit a tense peace. Tragedy intrudes only directly once when David tells Marie about how his sister was given an opportunity to become a Kapo (Jewish police officer) in the concentration camp, but she was required to beat her parents to death, to obtain such a promotion. The Nazis' cruelty is presented with subtlety&#x97;during a raid when they're looking for banned foodstuffs, a Nazi officer shoots a Czech woman's dog; another example is the remark about Dr. Fischer, who sterilized 1,000 Roma (gypsies). Horton sees Divided We Fall as a a ground-breaking film, in that it challenges Czechs, a nation that always likes to think of itself as a passive victim, to consider the actively inglorious aspect of its past. Horst alludes to the fact that he was mistreated as a child before the war, due to the fact he was an ethnic German. And after the war was over, many Czechs didn't want to be reminded there were sinister, bloody reprisals against the ethnic Germans, whom they regarded as collectively guilty. In a brilliant scene toward the end of the film, as Josef runs through the streets seeking help for his wife who is about give birth, the reprisals are underway, including a glimpse of decapitated heads inside a hearse.Divided We Fall proceeds fitfully in a series of plot reversals that bring the narrative to a dazzling climax. Horst's charge, the commandant Dr. Kepke, falls from grace after his young son deserts from the German army, and Horst must find him another place to live. After being rejected by Marie (after the two go on a car trip to the countryside, where the boorish collaborator attempts to rape her), Horst gets his revenge by insisting that Josef and Marie take in the now depressed Kepke. Marie stymies Horst's plan to have Kepke move in with them by claiming she's pregnant; Josef realizes however, he's just been certified sterile so their only hope is for David to impregnate Marie.Earlier Horst comes to believe that Josef and Marie have been hiding a Jew in their home (after hearing the voices of Marie giving French lessons to David through the drain pipe), and is about to expose David's hiding place, when a German raid begins. So it's Horst who protects the family as a citizen of the Reich. Nonetheless, after the town is liberated by the Russians, Horst is imprisoned and beaten as a collaborator. In the irony of all ironies in the film, Franta, Josef's neighbor who was going to turn David in when he first appeared in town after his escape, is now part of a citizen's brigade who is responsible for sitting in judgment on all his neighbors during the wartime occupation.The theme of the film's denouement is forgiveness. Josef anoints Horst as the doctor who delivers Marie's baby. Franta, feeling guilty over how he treated David, overlooks Horst's past indiscretions and he is accepted back into the community. And in a classic moment of redemption, Josef holds up the newborn and gazes toward a table where the deceased members of the Wiener family along with Kepke's deserter son, sit. Out of the darkness, there is hope. Divided We Fall is a film that must be seen!

The worst aspect of the film is the god-awful frame dropping technique the director employs through about a third of the film, which makes the action on screen jerky and nausea-inducing.

The screenplay has many ingredients for vaudeville situations the presence of an inconvenient friend (Horst); the logistics of hiding someone in a house; Josef and Marie's difficulty to have a baby, but director Hrebejk tries to explore them with a light hand, never abandoning the dramatic aspects of the story.

Divided We Fall is a deftly orchestrated tale of humanity and how it is compromised.  The characters are both shameful and endearing.  Somehow, all atrocities are rationalized and the lowly redeem themselves.  Don't overlook the implications of their names.  Clever direction and concise cinematography give the movie just enough to be thought-provoking without being preachy. "},{"Title":"Charm is not enough","Date":"15 December 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Review":"  	Depending upon your point of view, Divided We Fall is either charming or maddeningly slow as it develops at a leisurely pace.  The movie is contradictory in a number of ways.  For instance, the first four scenes take place at two year intervals (which altogether take 5 minutes of screen time at most), and despite the time span covered and the drama involved (Jews being run out of town, the Nazis taking over, an escaped Jew) the story unfolds rather slowly.  This is the story of Josef and Maria, an ordinary Czech couple swept up in the events of World War II.  Josef has planned to malinger his way through World War II, sleeping on his day bed.  His friend Horst, an enthusiastic and obnoxious Nazi will have none of it.  Horst has prospered under the Nazis and sharing his good fortune with his friend is a way to control/manipulate him - and to further Horst's desire to bed Maria. 	In the end, the movie would have you believe that all the characters are compromised and flawed and that there is some good and some bad in all of us.  (Actually this overstates the case a bit.  The movie waffles a bit in the case of Maria and is not quite sure whether she is a Madonna figure or not.  Maria = Mary Get it?)  But here the movie trips up.  The major crisis of the movie is precipitated by Horst when he tries to place a fallen Nazi in Josef and Maria's apartment.  The problem is that Horst is either aware of David, the Jew that Josef and Maria are trying to hide, in which case this is a horribly manipulative way for Horst to try to destroy them or he is not aware of the Jew, in which case Horst can claim no credit for the fact that David survives to the end of the war.  In the end the attempt to put all the characters on the same moral plane comes off as too pat and movie like.	The movie has problem that I have never encountered before some of the subtitles were flashed quicker than I could read them.  For those who are inclined to steer around movies with subtitles in the first place, I suspect such a flaw would be sure to damn the movie from the get go.	The movie ends with a surreal scene that one might find in a Fellini movie.  For a movie that had for the most part developed in a realistic manner, this final and last scene was absolutely false.  My family reacted to the scene by screaming and yelling at the screen, What was _that about? "},{"Title":"Flawed but quite involving","Date":"21 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Review":"  In nazi occupied Czechoslovakia, Josef and Marie watch the Jewish family that employs them slowly have their liberties taken from them before eventually be shipped out to a camp.  A few years later, David Weiner is the only member of the family left alive and he escapes the camp and returns home.  Despite the extreme risks involved, Josef and Marie take him in and let him stay in a hollow cupboard.  However with Josef's job with the Nazi's and their friendship with collaborator Horst, detection becomes increasingly likely.A comedy/drama set around the Jewish suffering of World War II? Strangely this concept is no longer an unique one as it has been done several times now, albeit along different lines.  Here the film sees a Czech couple hiding a Jewish friend despite the risks involved, the film has a few very comic moments but generally it is rather a bittersweet tale where Josef and Marie have to go to extremes to keep their secret.  The thrust of the film is about human nature and, in this regard the film does a reasonable job - although it is a little too subtle and gentle for my tastes.The comedy is at times almost farcical but is mostly gently comic more than anything else.  It relies very much on the absurdity of the situation; I did have a problem with the fact that I always find the situation difficult to find amusing in the way the film expects me to.  Direction is not much cop here.  I have no problem with handheld cameras but in this film it used a sort of blurring effect where it feels like everything is running just a fraction too slow; the reason for this is not clear and it only serves to annoy as an empty stylish gesture.The characters are interesting and the main ones are quite well drawn. Polivka is good as Josef - a character it is difficult not to feel for; he is well supported by Siskova.  Kassai's David is not as well used as I would have liked - in fact, marginally less screen time would have turned him into the human equivalent of a noir mcguffin!  Dusek has one of the thankless roles but does very well with it - being a bit of a fool but still being human enough to hold sympathy.Overall this is a flawed film but is still worth seeing.  It's comedy is occasionally funny but mostly it is just amusing in a bittersweet sort of way.  As a more human tale it works quite well - or at least does near the end, you just need to stick with it a bit.

I must say that the script from Petr Jarchovsky is perfect. Think that Musime si pomahat is something like Life is beautiful directed by Roberto Benigni. I hope that this movie will be awarded by the Oscar!!!

A sensitive, thoughtful, and human Oscar winning drama of technical and artistic excellence, DWF has a peculiar sort of personality which capriciously meanders from moments of terror or suspense to blithe drama and comic relief. Characteristically European in flavor, DWF will have limited appeal among American audiences while being well received by those who appreciate Europix.

Sometimes it's chocolate and other times it's fruit. Rarely do I eat oranges because I hate the sticky juice on my fingers. And that is what this film is. Sticky juice that you want to wash off right away.Not for many a year have I seen such a terrible film except for the nonsense of Beligni's La Bella e Vita.I curse myself for wasting minutes of my 'life time' in watching this totally useless film. How it was given an Oscar nomination I shall never know. The implausible story aside, the filming techniques were an utter disgrace. Hand cam is not the right word. It seems like it was filmed by someone with a serious neurological disease. Panning, close focus, long shots etc were thrown out of the window and substituted with a manic frenzy of out of focus close ups and wavering mid shots. And as to the scene cuts? I can only assume that all members of the crew were given a pair of scissors. If not I can only assume they had a break for drinks every three minutes. Compare this film with The Return I you will know what I mean. Listen folks, if the story is good, let it speak for itself. No amount of trickery will make a bad plot into a good one. If you want to know the secret of filming watch Paper Moon. Better still watch real life. How often do you walk around in circles while having a normal conversation.And then there's the lighting. I don't think the subdued lighting shots were intentional. I guess they needed the candles for the dinner table scene. As for 'contre jour'. The words and method escaped them I think. Clichés. This film has so many you could release a second copy DVD showing them all. How many more films will I have to see without wanting to scream as the camera pans/jolts upwards to reveal a Gestapo flag? In this film they spared no measure. They did it three times! It was good to see that they used a Jack Russel terrier as a continuity link for the street scene. Something must have happened though because when it was having to do some night time barking it changed into a rotweiller. How odd?I was very impressed with the sole German soldier who was on duty in the street. Obviously the budget couldn't go beyond a Jack Russel, its food and one member of the Wehrmacht. As to the acting. If it hadn't been for the main character it would have died a death in the first ten minutes. Hold on! It did. This film wasn't satire nor was it dark humour. It was farce with a badly written story line, appalling filming and casting. It is on the same level as Benigni's La Bella e Vita. Which is to say - banal. Finally. Remind me never to watch another film with Janslav Du&#154;ek, In his character role he would, as a collaborator, have been shot by the resistance. As it is, he can take part responsibility for the film being peppered with holes from start to finish. If you are going to film a subject which directly or indirectly relates to the extermination of 6 million people then do it with taste and elan.Would someone please inform the director as to what real satire is as opposed to Benny Hill/Mr. Bean comedy. For example Apocolypse Now or Dr. StrangeloveIt fully deserves a minus 100 rating. It would have been given a minus 1000 but some credit needs to be given to the dog. "},{"Title":"We Fell.

Feh.I H-A-T-E-D this movie. It is contrived, grossly inaccurate, implausible, cliched, trivial, stupid. Hated the intrusive music. Hated the meaningful gazes heavenward. Hated the hit-you-over-the-head-with-subtlety juxtapositions of Madonna and child.Hated David the Jew who looked like no Jew I've ever seen. Hey, for me any you it's acceptable (well, understandable anyway) to run in stereotypes, but if you are going to make a movie ABOUT Jews you'd best learn at LEAST what they LOOK like in the real world. I mean, could they have GOTTEN a bigger nose for the part? C'mon Jan - take a glance at your daily paper - see all those Israelis? Loads and loads of Jews? With blonde and red and brown hair? Some with noses some without? Jan, if you've never met a Jew in real life, go take a look at Tod Solondz's Storytelling where you will see a BELIEVABLE family of Jews, complete with blonde hair, blue eyes, some schnazzes, some without.  Jan, you just do NOT know subtle. Every character, and everything else about the movie - the camera work, plot, music - everything screams stereotypes. Jan, you don't know from three-dimensional.And that cutsie, self-conscious switching between film to digital video to hand-cam! SCREAMING at me (cause I'm too dumb to notice) FEAR!! HAPPENING!! NOW!! Hated it.Hated that utterly stupidly impossible everybody-happy-now ending. Hated the whole plot come to think of it - what a DUMBO story to begin with.Hated the lack of consistent voice - what in the heck was this thing trying to be anyway - Comedy? Commentary? Some sad or moving something-or-other? Triumph of human goodness? Oh We Are So Valiant Amidst The Chaos??? What was this thing about?!?Yech. Just yech yech yech.
