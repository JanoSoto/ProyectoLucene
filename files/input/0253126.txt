Brought to us by the veddy British, Fragile Films, the same people that brought us Spice World and is currently between two Wilde takes; 99's &#145;Ideal Husband' and next year's &#145;Importance of Being Ernest.' Girls just want to have fun.The overall theme is that old-time-Hitchcock-religion where Joe Everyman becomes unwittingly entangled into crime and intrigue. The stars are Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack as a nurse and thespian respectively. These are the two Joanne Everybodies with a UK twist of sophisticated slapstick like Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau.These women are presented as smart, strong and beautiful. Yay. And all the guys are either corrupt or useless. Just like real life. Min has a dumb boyfriend who's electronic eavesdropping picks up a cell phone mid-bank heist. Mary, the actress, fresh from a looping session with an animated tomato, sees the overheard phone conversation as an economic opportunity to squeeze the bad guys. `They'll never listen to a woman,' insists Driver. Mary says, &#145;This is the twenty-first century and we do all jobs now.' Minnie crosses with `Do you want to extort money or raise consciousness?' Mary's answer, `Both!'The rehearsals for the blackmail phone calls to the bad guys are a hoot. The writing comes from two comedy vets from the BBC, Km Fuller who cut his teeth on &#145;Red Dwarf' and Georgia Pritchett from the sassy &#145;Smack The Pony' and nicely directed by Mel Smith who did &#145;Mr. Bean.'Highlights include a very nice travelling matte midsection when both sides rally to battle reminiscent of the opening title sequence to Knots Landing and a smashing performance from Sir Michael Gambon, the great character actor which is another word for interesting.

Which may make for some great laughter, but with no real menace to make you wonder why they're criminals to begin with.Not this film - the balance between menace and comedy is carried out perfectly. The criminals are allowed to be menacing and intelligent (for the most part) while the two leads get on with the job of comedy. At least until the end, when it goes just a bit too far...My major problem with the film is the relationship between Driver and McCormack. It never quite gels - although that could just be my inability to see McCormack's performance as anything other than Donna Air with an American accent!All in all, worth a look - but not exactly an Oscar winner.

Happily, `High Heels and Low Lifes,' directed by Mel Smith, is one of those rare gems of a little, just-for-fun movie that succeeds in being exactly what it was meant to be  Highly entertaining, and most importantly, fun-- and in a way that's not only memorable, but quite accessible and one that lends itself to multiple viewings, primarily because of it's stars, Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack, who make one of the most winsome and engaging teams to come along in quite some time. After a fight with her boyfriend, nurse Shannon (Driver) is left to celebrate her birthday with her best friend, Frances (McCormack), an aspiring actress.  Departing as he did in a hurry, Shannon's boyfriend leaves behind his recording equipment and the scanners that enable him to pick up telephone conversations he can record and use to create a kind of urban, new age music.  And after a bit too much to drink, the girls start to fool around with the scanner, and happen across a phone conversation between a gang of crooks committing a robbery.Driven to action by purely altruistic intentions (of course), the girls realize this is a chance to pick up a big chunk of change real quick, and they decide to contact and `negotiate' with the thieves for a part of the take.  The girls tell them to cough up or they'll go to the police.  Big mistake, as they have no idea who they're dealing with, or how big (and bad) the organization behind them really is.  But Shannon and Frances are about to find out, and before it's all over, they just may wish they'd never heard of a `scanner,' or for that matter, a telephone.  Then again, maybe not...Mel Smith succeeds in crafting and delivering a high-energy, often hilarious romp through London and the surrounding environs, as he puts his stars through their paces in a way that generates plenty of laughs and makes his audience glad they came along for the ride.  Smith sets a perfect pace that makes this a lively comedy, enriched by witty dialogue, wry British humor and the iridescent performances of Driver and McCormack, all of which makes this film more reminiscent of such fare as Michael Caine's `The Italian Job,' or any of the early Peter Sellers movies, rather than the more contemporary Farrelly Brothers/'American Pie' type humor that is so prevalent today.  And, as such, it is refreshingly fun AND funny, and leaves you yearning for more of the same.Since her auspicious motion picture debut as Benny in the heartwarming `Circle of Friends' in 1995, Driver has successfully filled her resume with films that run the gamut from black comedy (As Debi, `Grosse Pointe Blank') and straight drama (Rosie, `The Governess') to action (Karen, `Hard Rain').  Not all of her projects have been a success critically and/or at the box office, perhaps, but one would be hard-put to find a single performance of hers among them that is not engaging and credible.  She's demonstrated time and again that she can hold her own with the big boys in the high profile films (alongside De Niro in `Sleepers,' Damon and Affleck in `Good Will Hunting'), and one of her most memorable performances is in what is arguably one of the best romantic comedies of all time, `Return To Me,' in which she plays Grace.  All in all, in a comparatively short time, Driver has accrued some impressive credentials, and she never fails to live up to her promise-- and her portrayal of Shannon in this film is no exception.  Using to great effect her quirky good looks and winning personality, combined with a discernible intelligence that points up a beauty that is much more than skin deep, here as always, she is a delight to watch.Perfectly cast, as well, is Mary McCormack, as she succeeds in capturing the very essence of Frances, while proving to be a perfect complement to Driver's Shannon.  McCormack has that same kind of well-rounded beauty as Driver, which indicates there's always something going on behind the eyes, and cinematically speaking, as a team it makes them a force to be reckoned with.  Most importantly, McCormack brings Frances vividly and enthusiastically to life, and it goes far toward enabling the viewer to suspend disbelief long enough to just go with the flow and enjoy the high jinks of these two young ladies as they cut their swath across the English countryside.In a terrific supporting role, Michael Gambon, as Kerrigan, is wonderfully droll, espousing that oh-so-wry-and-dry British humor in a manner reminiscent and worthy of Noel Coward at his best.  Indeed, Gambon has some of the funniest lines, delivered so subtly as to evoke purely spontaneous bursts of side-splitting laughter from the audience.  And when an actor can do that, he has without question succeeded in doing his job; which is exactly what Gambon has accomplished here.The supporting cast includes Kevin McNally (Mason), Mark Williams (Tremaine), Danny Dyer (Danny), Darren Boyd (Ray), Simon Scardifield (Tony) and Len Collin (Barry).  By definition, a comedy is a `movie (or play) of light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending.'  Therefore-- by definition-- `High Heels and Low Lifes' is a `comedy' in every sense of the word.  Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable, it's a film that makes a promise for a good time to be had by all, then goes on to fulfill that promise.  The magic is alive and well in this one, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

But the setting is Britain, and although one of the women is American, the other is more conventionally English.  The mix makes for enough reasonable doubt that the story seems at least imaginable.  Otherwise, plots in which two women are the central characters in a send-up of gangster films are rare, and this one is treated intelligently.  The two women are smart and quick witted.  In contrast, the bad guys are not just goof balls, like the title would seem to imply.  They are creepy and dangerous, and the two gals soon find themselves in over their heads.  The tension sometimes approaches real drama, but it is ultimately a comedy,.  It is well worth watching, although the ending may seem a bit abrupt.

Have you gone completely Tonto?","Date":"10 November 2004","Score":"8 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Comedy","Review":" It is not often that I use this word in film reviews, but High Heels and Low Lifes was a very cute movie. While it did follow a very formulaic caper approach, there were elements that were very original and stood out in this film. It had a crisp semi-humorous story coupled with two actresses that were very into their roles. There were some dark elements that I was not expecting when they were dealing with the gangsters that kept my attention until the very end. This was one of those films where you knew exactly how it was going to end, but you still had fun watching your characters get there. This film was a no-brainer, but in a good sense. If you are looking for a fun, caper film that takes no energy to watch than this is the film for you. That is exactly what I was looking for when I watched this film, and it worked perfectly. Let me tell you why.My biggest satisfaction from this film came from the very unrealistic portrayal of London's dark underbelly. It begins with a very sinister retrospect on the crime in this populated city with images of hardcore robbers doing what they do best. That is the last glimpse we have of that world because by the end of the film the darkness sheds to light and we are handed a fantasy world all our own. The bad guys go from their darkened world and into mansions full of color, ambition, and cartoon blunders. It is this sense of unreality that kept me focused on this film. Here we have two women that are having this 'movie' adventure while hiding in bushes, wearing dark sunglasses, and fighting with guys in the cow pastures, yet on the other hand we have these criminals that truly want to kill them. There are huge guns fired, people get shot, and there are even some literal explosions. It reminded me of when Elmer Fudd was hunting for Bugs Bunny. There is some horror to the realization that Fudd only wants to 'kill the rabbit', but there is humor in the unrealistic events that occur due to Bugs' outlandish style and Fudd's ignorance. So, when you look at the cover of this film, do not be fooled. What I am trying to say here is that the unreal story is what kept my attention. I don't know if the writers wanted to create a real world with these heroes, but in my eyes they didn't. This was a fictional story, and I couldn't see this happening in real life &#133; and that worked for me.I must say that Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack are not at the top of Hollywood players list, but they seemed to carry themselves well in this picture. I think the reason that they worked was because it was a small film. Driver and McCormack do better in these small budgeted films than they do in the blockbusters. I don't think I have ever seen a big-budget Minnie Driver film that I would say was 'amazing', and the same goes for McCormack. High Heels and Low Lifes is their type of film. Thankfully, director Mel Smith knows that and knew what he had to work with. He keeps the tone low on this film, making the humor not laugh-out-loud, but grinable. There wasn't really anything spectacular about the direction of this film, and that was perfect for this film. At times directors of these smaller films try to reach out and become to artsy with their craft, this was not the case here. Smith stayed on the path of this film and worked his magic with the greatest of ease. He was not trying to go over the top, but yet successfully kept this film from sinking.Overall, this was a 'cute' film. I will use that word again because I cannot think of a better way to describe this simple film. It was easy on the eyes and on the mind, and if you are in the mood for that style of film than High Heel and Low Lifes will provide it. Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack play off each other exceptionally well while Mel Smith eases behind the camera. There is nothing spectacular about this film. I probably will never see it again, but it was worth watching once. It is always good to have these types of films around. Those that do not try to go overboard, yet give you exactly what you went in looking for.

Trying to report it to a police station snowed under with muggers, pushers and drunken yobs, achieves nothing and the next day they hear on the news that the robbery has taken place. With the telephone number of one of the gang still written on her hand from the recording equipment, Frances comes up with the idea of blackmailing the robbers for a cut of the cash. Unfortunately for her, she forgets that the gang are criminals and soon the stakes are much higher than Shannon or Frances bargained for.Everything about this film put me off it &#150; the fact that it was a UK comedy, Mel Smith, the cast of British TV comedians and the poor reviews, but anyway I decided to give it a go when it came on television recently. From the very start the plot lacked any sort of credibility, relying on some very forced points to start the story and to keep it moving throughout. At times this is annoying but for most of the film the rough energy of the film just about covers just how very silly it is. The film is meant to be a comedy but it rarely made me laugh, but it did have just enough rough humour to it to make it reasonably enjoyable as a sort of brainless piece of entertainment. Of course it is not a great film but the undemanding viewer will at least find it is easy to watch.The cast are a mixed bunch, some of them make the film better but generally the majority are given little to actually do. Driver and McCormack are enjoyable and fun to watch and they make good on what could have been stupid roles. They play it larger than life and, although never funny, are a big part of the film being at least a bit of fun. The support cast throws up a lot of well-known faces from both acting and comedy, but none of them really make a mark other than showing their face. Dyer, Gambon and McNally just show up and do their best but comedians such as Sessions, Williams, Eldon and Simpson don't really have any material to show what they can do. Director Smith makes a cameo and as director he does an OK job without really ever doing anything unique; I suppose he at least makes it look more professional that some British comedies have &#150; shame he couldn't find the laughs.Overall this is a poor comedy if you are looking for consistent laughs, but it has got just enough rough energy to keep it moving and it never made me feel like the laughs were missing so much as just not there (if you see the difference). Of course it is basic and simple but I was sort of in the mood for that and, meeting it on these terms, it made for passable entertainment but I'll forget it soon enough!

At one time the crooks are in a gun battle with the girls, who are using an arsenal of fully automatic weapons they stole from the crooks. The girls have the bad guys totally out gunned, but Shannon insists that Frances give her a chance to use an assault rifle, which she has never used and turns out can't control. That childish behavior is not consistent with her character. SPOILER - The film never explains how Frances was not shot when Shannon repeatedly shoots her with one of the bad guy's weapon. Nor does it explain how Shannon, who is acting dead in the same room as the other players, somehow steals a large arsenal from the crook's weapons storage and gets outside behind a hedge before the others exit. It also isn't explicit about what happens to Kerrigan, the Don of the gang, at the end. It also doesn't explain why the police stop looking for the two attractive girls who reported the crime while it was in progress. - SPOILERI would have rated it higher if not for all those goofs, because I did find it enjoyable.

It appears High Heels and Low Lives, directed by comic actor Mel Smith, must have gone directly into video, or at least, we don't recall it having played commercially in the States.The film offers an unusual pair of Thelma and Louise wannabes, who learn about a gang having a great fortune gotten from a robbery and decide to take things in their own hands to outsmart the criminals in order to steal their cash without much effort. Shannon, a nurse, befriends a struggling American actress, Frances, even teaching her how to speak with the proper accent. Both women succeed in unexpected ways to get away with the loot.The film works because of the chemistry between Minnie Driver, who plays Shannon, and Mary McCormack, seen as Frances. This was a felicitous pairing because of the fun they must have had making the movie. Kevin McNally appears as Mason, a criminal without any redeeming qualities and who deserves to be outwitted by the women. Michael Gambon has a great time impersonating Kerrigan, an aging gay mobster. Mr. Gambon usually seen in heavier parts, contributes to the success of this movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but a fun time for the fans not looking into a complicated time with a DVD.

The comparision to Snatch is somewhat legitimate because it doesn't take itself seriously, each character is played to comic effect, and it has its violent moments. All the same, it isn't as violent or profane as some Snatch type movies ... it restrains itself, and that's good ... the lightness of the movie makes it enjoyable fare. The leads, including Minnie Driver in a nice role, are good ... as is on the whole the writing and all that other stuff. Nice English effort.

I had hoped that Minnie Driver's presence might have meant a sharp, incisive script and some inventive plotting.  No such luck.  For some reason, the vast majority of British comedies end up as periodically slightly amusing in a light, gentle way.  Why this is I have no idea as we can boast some of the world's brightest comic talents.Ms Driver is fine and Mary McCormack as her partner in crime is adequate, if slightly annoying.  Mark Williams is the best on show here as the put-upon detective.The director Mel Smith said this was the film of his he was happiest with - I suggest he go back to The Tall Guy, which is far superior.  Ending a film like this with the Eurythmic's 'Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves' was also a cliche too far.A good effort, but could have been so much better.

It may well have been written for TV and without the participation of director Mel Smith and lead Minnie Driver it may have had a brief but happy life as a special TV holiday treat.  It's just too small scale in all respects.  The Lock Stock .. films it gently parodies are small and parochial, too, but they also have Hollywood action movie energy.  The performances are mostly good, and genuinely funny, but often too subtle. Mark Williams as the lead cop continues to prove how talented and under-rated he is with a performance so under-stated it defies you to notice it at all.  The lead actresses are, as one running joke continually reminds us, a blonde and a brunette, quite attractive, eye-candy and funny at the same time.

Ten years on and it pops up on sky movies at an ungodly hour.An undeserved failure when released, one feels that this suffered due to the fact that it looked too much like a 'Lock, Stock' rip off, which at the time were a dime a dozen. so i guess the public steered clear, which is a shame because despite all it's flaws, it's a very entertaining film thanks to the energy given by McCormack. Driver plays the straight woman to her mad woman and gets sidelined in the proceedings, just looking very pretty.Plans go wrong and get worse, and the film is ably supported by some great comic talent, good settings and Danny Dyer, when he wasn't an annoying cockney villain.The leads are ferocious and give the film their all, and one feels that this wouldn't have worked be it two other actresses.

The first is Michael Gambon. If he was making the attempt to counter any type-casting associated with his Harry Potter character, Albus Dumbledore, he was 100% successful. This performance is gritty, hard, and even rough. But he is also great in this role.The second impressive element is the story itself. It generates enough intrigue to hold your interest. Usually with a plot such as this one, I need some suspense to do that, but this story generates the interest enough without the suspense.

Yet this is a movie that just has no laughs in it and it's as if they even did tried hard enough.It's of course a movie with a very simple thin story, that also on top of that is an highly unlikely one, even for comedy standards. The way the entire movie progresses is also rather predictable, which makes this a very little uninteresting and unoriginal movie to watch. It's of course not a movie to take serious in the first place but in that case the movie should had had some more comedy and entertainment in it, which it just simply hadn't. Instead it also tries to be more moralistic, which often is an annoying approach for any comedy. Mel Smith obviously has some comical talent but he yet still needs to proof himself as a good comedy movie director.Problem is also its two main characters. They are being presented in this movie as strong, smart, independent women but yet they do all these stupid things. So something is wrong here with the approach. And no offense but lets be honest here for a moment, can you at least name 5 good movies that has 2 female characters as the movie's main leads? It's just something that rarely ever works out successfully. especially when you have a movie with a non-serious approach. Females in comical roles also always tend to overact more than males in the same type of roles. This often works as sort of annoying, even though this movie is still bearable with its acting, thanks to the professional acting by Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack, who unfortunately just weren't given a better script to work with.Also the supporting cast is a good one with actors such as Kevin McNally, Mark Williams and Michael Gambon in it. They still also give the movie some extra flair but you can debate about it if most of their roles were actually really necessary for the movie at all.It's a movie that has the right style, uses the right actors but yet just doesn't work out as a good and successful enough comedy. The movie seriously lacks laughs, which is especially disappointing for a British comedy and could had used a more clever and originally written script and possibly a different director at the helm.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"High Marketing Budget and Low Expectations","Date":"10 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Mel Smith has the physique of Alfred Hitchcock, as well as the tendency to make cameo appearances in the movies he directs, but I'm afraid the resemblance ends there. High Heels and Low Lifes (what an awful title) is a mildly entertaining, mildly diverting romp that slots neatly into the jolly British crime caper genre which also includes Shooting Fish and Lord knows how many other movies. At one point, Minnie Driver's character says, This is real life.  `Real life' being the place where gangsters can start blasting away in broad daylight without anyone seeming to care one way or the other. The place where a deserted park in the middle of the night can suddenly be full of people and cars and yet the three gangsters can just vanish, leaving witnesses only able to identify the two attractive women at the scene. Hmmmm... With a top-notch cast which it doesn't deserve, the film gets away with its inconsistencies and inadequacies. Driver, Ian Williams and The Actor Kevin Eldon are excellent, milking a very thin script for every possible laugh. The pace never lets up, which also helps, so that while watching it, you might never notice how tenuous and slight the whole thing is. Using every trick in the book (pointless split-screen, padding-out aerial shots of London, etc.) Smith manages to keep things never less than interesting. It would have been nice to see Driver and the awful (though the script doesn't do her any favours) McCormack given more to do with the whole Women taking on the blokes at their own game theme, only occasionally hinted at, in shots of Driver putting a gun into her bra, blasting away with machine-guns, etc. What effect does all this immersion in crime have on our heroines? None, really - they prove themselves to be sassy and level-headed in certain scenes, but dotty and scatterbrained in others, but it's all okay, because they give all the cash to the hospital, anyway. The fake death towards the end is all-too obvious, the massive shoot-out is cranked up to top volume presumably to try and disguise the fact that so little is going on, and any hints at character development or depth are given very little attention. It's a shame because on one level it is enjoyable, it's just that there's nothing to it, and it could have been a lot better.Without the aforementioned very talented cast, this film would be an awfully hard slog. But with them, it's just about worth your attention when it turns up on TV. Here's hoping Minnie Driver makes some more real classics soon - Grosse Pointe Blank 2 anyone?

Rather than being swept up in events, the female protagonists doggedly pursue a reckless course of action without adequate motivation. The cartoon violence, in which despite hails of bullets no-one actually gets killed, contributes to the lack of edge. We never really care about the heroines, because we never feel they are actually in any danger. A further problem is Mary McCormack, who just does not have the comic chops to carry off the demands placed on her. One would have hoped in any case that British cinema had got beyond the point of importing Hollywood C-listers in the forlorn hope of sales across the Pond. It might have been interesting to see what a talented British comedienne, such as Jane Horrocks or Sally Phillips, could have done with the role. The jolie laide Minnie Driver puts in an acceptable performance in a less demanding role, without doing anything to suggest that a career in comedy lies before her. Michael Gambon lends some much needed menace as a camp East End gangster, and Kevin McNally and Len Collin astutely play it straight as the heavies, but for laughs the film relies on the comic coppers, Mark Williams, as the acerbic inspector, and Kevin Eldon as his property price obsessed sergeant. Other familiar Brit faces, such as Hugh Bonneville, Paul Bown and Julian Wadham, do the best they can with blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos. It is harmless enough way to pass an hour and a half, and will raise the occasional smile, but you will find yourself easily distracted.

These include the dopehead from Human Traffic (guess what - he plays a dopey guy), Mark Williams (from dreary comedy The Fast Show), one of the guys from Big Train and sleazy Kevin McNally. Oh and Michael Gambon stars as the stereotypical elderly gay gangster.The plot is wafer thin (and highly implausible) and you can see the visual gags coming a mile-off. There are some pieces of dialogue which sum up the film. Perhaps Smith deliberately included them as some type of in-joke. for example, one of the female leads says, Do you think this is funny? - the film definitely is not. She later says,You're not even a good actor. Well, that was pretty apparent. You could apply that to most of the comedy bit-part players masquerading as actors in this garbage.Mel Smith makes a blink-and-you'll-miss-him appearance. Just like Mr Hitchcock used to do. Well Smith is no Hitchcock, let alone a Hancock, but this film is utter poppycock. At the test screening I went to, the only people laughing were a load of eighty-year old women.
