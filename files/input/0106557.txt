And reporters and residents from Hemingford the neighbouring town have descended upon Gatlin, with the surviving Gatlin kids being farmed off to new families so the carnage can start again.Coming to join the corn party is a teenage boy with a horrible haircut, Danny, his daddy issues and his daddy. They stay with 'attractive hostess with no real story' who has taken in a Gatlin kid called Micah, who also has daddy issues, so of course a friendship springs up between Danny and Micah that eventually leads to sacrificing people, as is the natural course of things.Nothing much really happens after that. The Gatlin kids shuffle around town in a group staring at stuff. I've decided that Micah is the best starer &#x96; he really tries at it. And blah blah blah &#x96; people start dying. I'm bored already.My favourite death (so few times you get to start a sentence that way) would be the old lady under the house, with all her howling and honking and crappy acting I was hoping one of the five year olds would just run up and start kicking her in the stomach &#x96; alas not to be, but she was crushed and the kids stood in their group and stared. Followed closely by the man who just started haemorrhaging blood all over the church. (Micah did some of his best staring in this scene &#x96; watch out for it) During this time, Danny has found love with a pretty young girl called Needy McNeederson. His daddy starts making sweet sweet love to 'attractive hostess with no real story' and there's some weird back story stuff thrown in about the corn and poisons and old Indian legends etched into rocks. None of it really makes any sense &#x96; doesn't fit in with the story in any way but it is told by a wise old American Indian man &#x96; so that lends some serious weight to what is being said.It all ends where it should &#x96; in the corn. Attempted sacrifices are abound, professions of love and apologies are made. Micah's yelling all over the place and doesn't seem to be staring as much which makes me sad. He Who Walks Behind the Rows turns up briefly and does his thing. It's just another day with the Children of the Corn.All in all, a pretty crappy sequel &#x96; but if you watch one, you gotta watch em all. Next up; Children of the Corn 3 &#x96;Gangsta Corn.

Although having said that the movie did have its good points, the children were good actors/actresses, the violence was realistic and in moments semi chilling. Unfortunately this sequel shares none of these traits.*spoilers*The first death scene is quite surprising, I mean the guys are killed by corn, well that is dodgy. In the Stephen King short story the corn was there to serve as the vector for the children's pagan blood lust. They were killing to make it grow, though it is fantasy/horror it makes more sense than killer corn leaves that can smash through glass by simply being blown in a gust of wind believe me. Not only that but this scene reminds me so much of The Omen it's unbelievable, and what's with the Friday the 13th sound effects and Predator visuals? Hell this monster in the corn even has Return of the Jedi force powers!And what's with the old woman's demise, crushed to death by her own house? Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly. Someone slowly being crushed under their own house, nobody finds the body, nobody even knows she's dead, until finally the smell of muddy hair, rotted flesh and mushed bones greet the next visitor on that hot summers morning.Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films. The lady goes under her house after her precious cat. When she is directly in the centre the children surround it, take the cat out and release the device raising it from the ground. The house slowly starts to come down on her and she wiggles backwards trying to escape. The children just stand there trying to look creepy, she almost gets out, why aren't they kicking her to force her to crawl back under? In the original at least the kids were violent; in this they just try to be mysterious. Well luckily for them she is too old to escape certain death and the house reaches the ground level crushing her lifeless&#133; and leaving her legs poking out from underneath. But even that isn't enough for the cheesily poor script writers, who wrote in that her last words should be oh what a world!? seriously they need to be slapped. All realism is thrown out the window at this point, that is if you hadn't done so already what with the Journalist mentioning in a almost tribute manner Jones Town just to be controversial (or maybe its just that all American news reporters are inconsiderate slimeballs) and the killer predator in the corn bull.And how many times is the word corn used in this film anyway? Every time uttered its like a needle being drilled into my brain. Just stop already we get it.The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets the worst death ever, and I mean worst, luckily he gets a lolly straight after. I wish I could tell you more but unfortunately I fell asleep, well it was 5am so it could have been that, but let's put it this way I'm an insomniac.This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest.If you're a fan of the original maybe you should ignore my small analyses, it's possible you might like this. I mean the Freddy films became a bit silly, humorous, comic book and people still enjoyed them (I know I'm one of them) But the fact of the matter is, if your looking for a serious, creepy, dark horror film then your best bet is to stay away from this horrid sequel.

This has all the makings of a lame duck in classic 1990's style.The same cult that destroyed the lives of adults in the first film are rescued and adopted by a modern American housing estate town. What this means is, plenty of adults die and He Who Walks Behind The Rows is mentioned approximately once every one minute thirty seconds and frustration ensues. Surely any god is going to be embarrassed at such a crap name, but these Amish kids are not only stupid but ugly as well.Finding laughs with this film is like shooting fish in a barrel, albeit unintentional. Surely finding death amusing shows an unhealthy mind, but the victims in this must surely deserve death for their stupidity. A prime example being an elderly woman who's house is somehow propelled by a lift, who just happened to be misfortunate enough to become crushed by her own house rescuing her moggy. Or how about the wheelchair-bound granny that conveniently crashes through the window of a bingo hall at the shout of full house. The drinks are on him! Oh, how this movie has something against the pensioners. There's also some great acting by the church vicar who manages to patronise even the cult who worship the thing named He Who Walks Behind The Rows.So as you can guess COTC2 doesn't really require much intelligence to watch. It's basically a rehash of COTC, with elderly people being picked off in their dozens and lots of kids reciting Shakespeare incorrectly.2/5 "},{"Title":"Pointless","Date":"19 July 2013","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" The second film in the monotonous maize-based horror series takes place soon after the events of the first film, with reporter Terence Knox trying to discover what happened in the now empty town.

It's the same mixture as before - various characters are killed by a group of spooky kids and their cornfield - with the addition of perfunctory romances and boring troubles between father and son. The film is repetitious beyond belief, seems twice as long as it really is, and as the plot revolves around Knox piecing together what we already know it's also entirely redundant.

Strangely enough is this movie made 8 years after Children of the Corn (horror sequels often tends to be released soon after the first movie) so the children from the first movie was probably too old for this movie, so we get bunch of new ones, this time on called Micah steps up to lead the corn cult worshiping children. I can't say i'm a fan of this new character, I would rather had seen Isaac and Malachi, two characters I find a lot creepier than Micah. It's not only Micah pretty much every character in this movie was bad, they were so bleak and boring that I couldn't care less if they died. The plot isn't much engaging either, and there is so many plot holes! Even this movie progress the storyline from the first one, it doesn't fit well. There absolute nothing suspenseful or scary, no atmosphere either, something i really appreciate in the first one. I'm not a huge fan of the first one, but it's better than this. David Price, the director, didn't impress much, and coming from a movie called Son of Darkness To Die for II says it all, Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice was just a cash-in with poor film-team, equipment and no love.

And I loved it. Then again, I hadn't seen much horror at the time. However, over twenty years later and I find myself realising how little I knew about decent cinema when I was a teenager.Don't get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed Children of the Corn 2 yet again, but now I found myself laughing heartily all the way though. Seriously, some comedies don't make me laugh as much as this film did (now, in the cold light of my adulthood).If you can ignore the use of the word 'final' in the title (there are about four more Children of the Corn films afterwards) and be prepared not to take this story that seriously, you may just enjoy some of the most ludicrous death scenes ever committed on the elderly. The story follows a boy and his single parent father, coming to the nearby town in search of a story as to what happened to the adults who were now found to have been murdered by the children of the town. Once this pair arrive, both instantly fall in love with beautiful women and discover that a young lad by the name of Micha, leads a group of local children to stare intently at adults before dropping houses on them. If you watch this movie you will realise it has some of the most intense staring ever committed to film. Besides the beautiful women and staring brats, there's also a wise old native American, some 'Predator-vision' from the monster (or 'he who hides behind the rows') and a sheriff who tries to kill people like he was a Bond villain.How this film was supposed to be taken seriously, I'll never know. Just know what you're getting before you watch this. Take the biggest pinch of salt you'll ever take, suspend your disbelief like you never have before and sit back and enjoy one of the most daftly funny horror films ever made.

Ryan Bollman did a great job of preaching warped beliefs to the kids while John Franklin made you want to laugh. The deaths were too comedic at times but the special effects were equivalent to any big-budget film. Of course, we knew from the start that John and his son would escape. Still, the film maintained some suspense and tension. Plus, we get an explanation as to why the demon harbors hatred towards adults.

These are just some of a few lessons to be taken from the sequel nobody expected that snowballed into the franchise nobody wanted, Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice. Picking up after the events of the first film, a tabloid-journalist and his teenage son are passing through a small neighboring town of Gatlin, Nebraska shortly after those corn-husking little munchkins laid it to waste. Looking for his big break, the father/journalist decides to stay in town for a while. After merely a few days in town, he receives his fair-share of white-man's guilt from the resident Native America, uncovers a moldy corn conspiracy (a plot point which goes virtually nowhere) and plows the field of a innkeeper. Meanwhile, his son attempts to sow some seeds of his own with the girl-next-door who appears to the only one under the age of 18 in town who isn't under the trance of the mysterious maze.It must be said that by no means is Children of the Corn II a particularly great film. Like the first, it's pretty basic and predictable. It seems as if the script for the first film was tweaked just slightly to concoct a sequel and it shows with plot-holes the size of Nebraska (see what I did there?). Director David Price -- whose resume is as equally unimpressive as the film's script -- loves to inject a lot of ridiculous gore into the film, but forsakes logic in doing so. You'll see corn husks slashing throats, a nosebleed that somehow turns into an earache and a house falling on a woman who doesn't seem to understand she can either try crawling out or hide in between the beams. Nevermind that, though. You don't come here for logic, and Price knows that. With his made-for-TV movie cinematography, you can be rest assured you'll know exactly what you're getting into within the first five minutes of the film.But what about the cast? Kudos must go out to Ryan Bollman who does his best to look as menacing as possible as the leader of the kiddy cult. Someone ground that kid! On the other side of the coin, you have Terence Knox, resembling what would happen if Bill Pullman and Alec Baldwin gave birth to a bloated baby. Knox seems to be apathetic about the whole thing, as best evidenced by his reaction to the death of a friend by the end of the film. He steps it up a notch when he is caught sinning rather vigorously by his son, but this scene is so uninteresting, you'll feel the same sort of apathy toward it as the actor does the film. I guess you just can't expect Academy Award material with these films, but would it hurt to have actors who care about more than cashing in their paychecks carrying a film? When all is said and done, in spite of its glaring flaws, Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice is easily the best sequel in the Children of the Corn series, but that's not saying much. When you consider the films that followed in its wake, it's almost a back-handed compliment. Then again, the first Children of the Corn wasn't ground-breaking cinema by any stretch of the imagination, so the fact that any sequel to it can deliver the most basic entertainment is a miracle in and of itself. To that end, The Final Sacrifice is a rather schlocky but suitable guilty-pleasure follow-up. If you've suffered through enough Amityvilles or Howlings then there is no reason you can't sit through this one as well.

It's a cult classic. But like me, if anyone else loved the original film, it may take you a while to realise how absolutely dreadful this pointless sequel is. It has a nonsensical plot, no characters, dreadful acting, dreadful music, dreadful script, no scary moments. It is an abomination.The film involves the town of Gatlin being discovered, the children rescued and fostered by the adults of neighbouring town Hemingford. Then somehow, He Who Walks Behind The Rows possesses Micah &#x96; this sequel's terminally constipated-looking excuse for Isaac &#x96; and the children begin their cult again.COTC II is just plain offensive. The plot shares less in common with Stephen King than it does with a particularly violent episode of Home and Away. Lead actor Terence Knox doesn't seem to be concentrating on his acting skills, and seems to be directing every ounce of his attention to not moving a single facial muscle in his skull. Paul Scherrer on the other hand simply looks like he's on a special day out.Where the first film brilliantly explores the isolation of the victims from the rest of the world, its first sequel offers nothing more than a clueless slasher movie, with the soap opera moments hastily strung together by too-stupid-to-be-funny death sequences involving ridiculous characters that deserve everything they get.One can easily understand why Stephen King does everything in his power nowadays to disassociate himself with the Children of the Corn franchise. If this first offering is anything to go by, God only knows the stream of grime that followed in the other five sequels.You can actually simulate watching this film at no expense by sitting in front of a blank TV screen and repeatedly poking a finger in each eye for an hour and a half.

In the opening moments, we see police discovering all the remains of the dead adults which is quite a disturbing image - these grey corpses look as lifelike as possible. It's the same with the scene in a cornfield where a couple discover even more strewn human remains scattered around. The special effects are good, definitely, but the plot? Oh dear.Essentially, it's just a remake of the first film but with better special effects and less suspense/atmosphere. Unfortunately for us, the special effects are indeed the only things which have improved, for the first film had superior acting as well. This cast look like they have walked straight out of a television movie - the father and son heroes also have an ongoing feud, which culminates in some sappy sentimentalising at the end of the film where they make up - as if we couldn't guess. It's true, the acting is extremely poor in this film, nobody is remotely realistic and the camera is more interested in lingering on the physiques of the female characters rather than exploring their, well, characters.Another fault lies in that they had to add a totally irrelevant subplot in - something about growing toxic mould on the corn and selling it - which almost ruins the whole story. This is about supernatural stuff, not some underground crime scheme. It's just cliché after cliché - a Native American turns up, and, surprise, surprise, talks about mankind harming Mother Nature and the rest. We've heard it all before, pal, and we're just not interested. They try to make some scenes spooky but the child actors are poor and unrealistic - especially the lead, who is no match for Isaac from the first film.And so, as I am finding with so many '90s horror movies, the special effects are the only worthwhile things in the whole film. There is a high gore level here, and the violence is surprisingly sadistic - witness one old man being stabbed to death with needles in his legs. Of course, if we cared about the characters these gory moments might have been powerful and moving, but as it is they're just wince inducing. One man bleeds spontaneously as a kid stabs a wooden effigy of him in the film's bloodiest moment, and another guy has a piece of corn impale his throat (as ridiculous on screen as it sounds here). The biggest disappointment, though, is the boring, predictable ending where we don't even get to see the monster (only some rip-off PREDATOR POV shots). Just some people fighting and burning. Was this the end of the franchise? Well, maybe it should have been, but CHILDREN OF THE CORN III URBAN HARVEST followed shortly afterwards.

Reporter John Garrett who works for a National Enquirer like magazine, arrives in Hemmingford Nebraska with his teenage son whom he is trying to get along with, in order to write an article of the Gatlin massacre of the first film. He then meets native American anthropology Professor RED BEAR, who shows John a drawing by his native ancestors that tells of a spirit possessing children to turn against their parents when the adults go to far in polluting the land. Unfortunately for John & those people of Hemmingford that took the surviving cult members into their homes to raise them, the kids are still determined to worship He who walks behind the rows & gather at the site of the first films massacre to figure out what to do, since both their leaders are dead. At the same time, teen Micah is travelling through the fields at night looking for the rest of the kids (why is never answered). However it turns out that the spirit that the hero's of the previous film thought was dead is very much alive yet in these fields & chases down Micah possessing him, whereupon he steps into the role of leadership from Isaac & his right hand man Malachai. Picking up where they left off, the children begin to slaughter the Hemmingford residents one by one & eventually set their sights on Danny to join them. Sequels are rarely better than their original outing, but occasionally a sequel will come along that either surpasses the original, or comes very close to it, such is the case with CHILDREN OF THE CORN II THE FINAL SACRIFICE, which is a highly enjoyable continuation of the original film! In many ways I somewhat prefer CHILDREN OF THE CORN II to the original, at least in terms of story & special effects, it's a better movie. The gore is plentiful here & the kills are pretty creative, such as a person who dies from what has to be the worst nose bleed in history. A doctor stabbed to death with needles, a victim has their own house fall on top of them, a wheelchair bound victim is tossed through a plate glass window, when her wheelchair gets controlled by a remote control device, a throat slit with corn stem & a husk through the throat. All courtesy of HELLRAISER 1-3 special effects artist BOB KEEN. In terms of it's story, the plot is really none to different, in fact the film- makers (many of whom worked on HELLRAISER III) have taken the route that so many film-makers take when creating a sequel, create the same story, but yet add something new to it, to make it different from it's predecessor. In this case, the film offers up a few interesting idea's & subplots with two reasons why all of this might be happening, such as an native American spirit rising from the earth to possess children, driving them to slaughter the adults due to their mistreatment of the land & the other being poisonous dust off toxic corn, that the sneaky resident of Hemmingford (led by the local sheriff) is hiding in a barn, with the dust having blown over the fields & into the town of Gatlin, which may or may not have been the cause of the massacre in the first place, since the children inhaling it would go insane. Not surprisingly, in the end it's revealed that the reason for the massacre is purely supernatural & a father & son constantly being at each pother's throats & trying to work things out between the two of them & the after mentioned subplots about native American spirits possessing children & toxic dust off old corn that the townsfolk are tied up in & I really liked the direction David F. Price took this film in. The film was never boring & that's mainly because he knew what horror fans were looking for in their horror movies & delivers all expectations on a silver platter. The killings here are rather inventive & oddly funny, such as when an elderly lady gets killed by having her house, that has been jacked up to be moved to another town, fall on top of her & her shouting What a world, what a world! her wheelchair bound twin sister, being hit by a truck & tossed through a window, at the same time a guy wins on a bingo card & he takes cover & then getting up says Bingo? a doctor stabbed to death all over with needles, while a little girls talking doll says things like My mommy say's I'm smart We like to play & then after he has been murdered, the kids take a lollipop each & then put one in his mouth before leaving. Apart from that, the film is really just an extension of the originals plot. Easily the best sequel to all of the Corn outings that came out after the first & makes for a nice companion piece to the original film. Highly recommended to fans of the first. This sequel is a lot of fun & highly entertaining. A real fun film for horror fans. Only a silly romantic teen subplot that add nothing to the films story, between the hero's son & a local girl, brings down the film. Other than that, this film is nicely done.

This film was made eight years after the first, but we are led to believe it takes place mere days after Linda Hamilton survived the vicious attack. So with all the parents dead, there are a lot of kids without anyone to look after them. To help out the kids that didn't participate in the murders, the neighbouring town of Hemingford offers to foster some of them. We are then introduced to a tabloid reporter John Garrett and his son Danny who do not get along. John is travelling to Hemingford to get a scoop on the story of the murders. They end up staying at a bed and breakfast run by who has taken in a child of Gatlin, Micah. Micah eventually becomes the leader of the resurrected corn cult and he along with a group of kids under the influence of he who walks behind the rows go onto kill adults. The gore in this sequel is piled on compared to the first. We gets slashed throats, a man who bleeds out of his nose and ears until he dies. Some pretty decent special effects for a lower budgeted horror movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Terence Knox and Paul Scherrer as father and son are good, a young Christie Clark of Days of Our Lives fame plays the heroine Lacey perfectly. And although Ryan Bollman (Micah) is no Isaac from the first film, he does a nice job as the evil cult leader. Can Micah be stopped or will he enlist Danny into his cult of adult hating young people?These Children of the Corn movies get a bad rap; but as a fan of the first one, I thought Children of the Corn II was a pretty good entry to the franchise. The plot is obviously not believable and has many holes in it, but for these kind of films I try to take reality out of the equation. The one problem I have with it is that at the end of the first one, the main characters destroyed the demon in the corn and at the start of this one, there's no explanation as to how it came to be again. We also get an interesting opinion from a few characters in this that suggest the kids are killers because the watch too many horror movies. I thought that was a nice little touch. Overall a decent sequel. 6/10 "}{"Title":"Who defileth the corn?","Date":"25 June 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" (I've loosely combined the whole series into this review, but it's primarily for the original and 'Final Sacrifice'...) Excellent follow-up to the 1984 cult-classic Children of the Corn, based on the short story from Stephen King's 'Night Shift' collection (and despite the criticism, probably one of the better King adaptations).'The Final Sacrifice' picks up in the aftermath of the original, with the surviving children of Gatlin (which, except for the one's that turned nineteen, as well as Isaac and Malachai, was pretty much all of them) are fostered to families in nearby Hemingford. Before you can pop a kernel, another child, Micah, is chosen by He Who Walks Behind the Rows to take out all the useless adults in town. A tabloid reporter and his estranged son (and Frank Redbear, local professor of anthropology! Ned Romero is great in this role) are in town for the story of the previous massacre, and they get drawn in to the nefarious plot about just what's making the sweet children of Gatlin flip out and start He Who Walks Behind the Row death cults. Not a bad explanation, because the fact that they're under the influence of chemicals doesn't really make 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' NOT real, it's just that kids are highly susceptible to his will in altered states...The subplot of the estranged father and son investigating phenomena in a small town is lifted from another unauthorized King sequel (and probably a million other movies), 'Return to Salem's Lot', but the dynamic between Terrance Knox and Paul Scherrer here actually works well, as opposed to the total misfire that was 'Return to Salem's Lot' (they should've gone with King's story 'One For the Road' for material).Daniel Licht's score is excellent, quite lovely actually, and very fitting given the nature oriented them.A very good sequel. The first two films are definitely a great watch, but with the exception of 'The Gathering', I detest the other sequels... and I usually love b-movies. I've seen good reviews for 'Urban Harvest', so maybe you'll see something I didn't if you wanna give it a shot. 'The Gathering' is watchable, but it's definitely lacking. I stopped at 'Fields of Terror'. I'm sure I was sober, but all I remember is a guy's head splitting open to reveal a flame-thrower nozzle and I'm still trying to figure out where the hell that came from. I'm seeing a remake of the original slated for 2009, and two more sequels followed which I've yet to see. Dare me? What separates 'Children of the Corn' (1984) and its underrated sequel, 'Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice' (1992) are really their consistency to the theme... but, what is the theme? Anarchy of a sort. An Old Testament-style rebellion of people, in this case children, under the influence of a higher power. King's short story is excellent as well.No ROOM for commitment! A-MEN!

Among the reporters arriving to find out what happened where John Garret and his obnoxious son Danny from NYC. But they were too late. Luckily they found lodgings from Angela Casual, who had adopted one of the children, Micah.          Two other bumbling reporters, Wade McKenzie and Bobby, decided to check out the corn fields. What they didn't count on was a huge storm and SOMETHING watching them. They tried to run away but their van wouldn't start up. They were gruesomely murdered by flying corn sticks.                    Danny rebels against his father and takes off. He meets Lacey Hellerstat, an attractive girl who lived in the area. Well, Micah traveled to the corn fields to take Isaac's place. He decreed that the children must murder all the adults in town because He Who Walks Behind the Rose commands it. One of the children, Mordichai, looks and dressed like Malachai, but it isn't him. The children proceed causing poor David Simpson to bleed to death in church in the grossest scene in motion picture history; poor Mrs. Burke is crushed by her own house; and the evil Dr. Appleby was killed with his own instruments. Why is he evil? He called the feds when John Garrett began asking questions.         Garrett met up with Frank Redbear, who told him a little bit about the kids. They go to investigate a barn that's full of corn with some kind of toxin. They believed the people of Hemingford were up to something, but just then, Sheriff Blaine showed up and tied them up in the field and caused a giant harvesting machine to roll after them. They escaped just in time, thank goodness. That night at a town meeting, the remaining adults there were burned alive. Luckily Sheriff Blaine was there so he got his commuppance. Micah became good friends with Danny and wanted to recruit him. Their first sacrifice Lacey. But Danny couldn't do it. Just as the kids were about to sacrifice him, John and Redbear came to the rescue. Poor Redbear never made it. They offed some of the kids and escaped. Micah met his fate with the giant harvesting machine.        Our story has a happy ending. A pretty good movie. Better than the first. Terence Knox was good. The scenes with Garrett and Redbear are good. One of my favorite scenes is McKenzie and Bobby stuck in the cornfields. Followed by Children of the Corn III Urban Harvest. Also good. Four is good too.

For one, you do not get the creepy abandoned looking town you found in the first movie, which is a shame as it is what made that film for me. You also do not have really much of anything as far as development goes as this film is for the most part very forgettable. The story centers around what are supposedly survivors from the town in the last movie and for some reason it seems the corn is infecting them in ways that once again make them into bad children, or bad teenagers for the most part.

That really added something to it... unfortunately, at my age of 20, it scares me no longer. Namely, the scenes that I saw was that old woman getting crushed under her own house, that guy in the church bleeding to death, and the good doctor of the town getting beaten to death - all by the children. Yes, this is ludicrous.The plot is crazily uneven. But, the one thing that messed up this film the most (for me, anyway) was the acting was grossly overacted. The leader of the Cult, Micah, was probably my favorite actor in this film. Unfortunately, he too overacted... but not nearly as much as the others.As a reviewer before me said, this film has a much bigger budget and better actors than the original '84 movie, Children of the Corn. That does count for something, and it shows in the special effects. The film does have artsy touches, which add to the movie. Lighting, direction, colors, camera angles. These were all very, very well done.Overacting aside, this is a good film to check out if you're bored, or just want to see an old-school horror flick.

The children are adopted by the townspeople and everything seems peachy. At the same time, a reporter is trying to uncover the story of the massacre while trying to deal with his angry son. Soon enough, the children have found a new preacher, and the adults of Hemingford are all meeting grisly demises.Yes, the story is clichéd and not at all good, but it is enough to keep the movie moderately interesting.

The cornfield attack is one of it's best scenes, since it involves a great amount of suspense with the approaching storm, a couple of really good action moments and a few really great deaths packed in. There's a really tense moment later on where a couple make a particularly gruesome discovery among the corn that provides a good shock that comes out of nowhere. That all of the film's deaths come off as quite good is something to applaud, and the moments provide some fun at certain points. The scene in the Church is great, as is the wheelchair death, and it's nearly impossible not to be entertained where the house comes into play. Even better than that is where the remaining adults are trapped inside a burning building, which is one of the better scenes in the film. The last big plus is the finale, which is just all sorts of good cheesy action-packed fun, some wonderful ideas and an overall really great way to end the film. All-in-all, this is just cheesy good fun.The Bad News This one wasn't that bad, but there were a few problems. The most obvious one is the flaw concerning the back-story. It's implied to be a continuation of the first one, where the survivors are bused into foster homes of a neighboring town, yet that raises a few problems. Firstly, it's never stated whether or not this was true, despite giving plenty of evidence that this was the case. The events of what happened there were well-known, yet the children here are allowed to go away without being questioned, as well as having a method of still getting in touch with each other quite easily. Those doesn't make any sense at all and are quite annoying. The pacing is a little off, as the romance angles cut into the middle of the film when the mysterious stuff starts happening, and way too much times goes by before anyone thinks anything is going wrong. The biggest one, though, is that it's way too cheesy. The film's concept and several of it's big action scenes do reek of cheese, and the film as a whole does reflect this. These really keep the film down somewhat.The Final Verdict While not a completely worthless sequel, it does have enough to make it interesting without being all that terrible. This is really more for fans of the series, who will find the most out of this one, while the others are pretty much left to take this on their own, even though it's better than expected.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and mild sex scenes "},{"Title":"Not as good as the first, but not bad","Date":"16 November 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  While I liked the first one more, this wasn't really bad... it had some pretty good, more imaginative, death scenes, a decent attempt at explaining why the kids go around killing adults, and better effects.

I have no idea what tempted me into buying this tosh, I think it was a £4.99 online deal, plus I'm the sort of person always interested by the sequels, even if I thought the first movie was terrible.It's actually a mixture of things which make this so bad. The first is that you could read the back of the box, skip straight to the ending, and still have quite a good idea of what happened. A film with a lot of characters can be done of they're all developed properly (Needful Things for instance) but that wasn't the case here. You witness about five or six quite gruesome murders, then a few more are killed in a fire, and apparently after that, 'all the adults are gone.'The main problem is that the film lingers about for ages and ages, then the whole conclusion is about fifteen minutes long. The script isn't really that great either, although there are one or two good moments in it (the Indian's quotes followed by his explanation, for instance). For example, after the first death of the old woman, when the other old woman approaches and suddenly proclaims 'She's my sister!' you can't help putting your head down, closing your eyes and cringing. Just watch it and you'll see what I mean.The acting was..... so-so. I think Ned Romero was probably the best, and the fact that he was playing an essentially needless character shows how well he must have done. Paul Scherrer, Terence Knox and Christie Clark all seemed natural enough, but Ryan Bollman was perfectly awful as Micah. He looked like he was trying far too hard, and the end result was a very shaky character who looked like he was having a nervous breakdown. The other children weren't a lot better (Was his name Mortachai? I have seldom seen worse).On the plus side, the film was quite disturbing in places, which is the next best thing if it doesn't manage scary. The fire death scene was quite disturbing (watching people die slowly often is) as was watching the children kill the guy who'd been so nice to them as he examined them....But that's about it. There was some ridiculous sub-plot as well, but I'm not even going to take the trouble to mention it.2/10The worst thing is, I'll probably still watch the third one....

The creators of this second chapter luckily didn't make the same mistake. The 1984 original tried to be an ambitious occult thriller while this film merely is a light-headed slasher with a typically 90's touch and goofy gore effects. The opening sequences are rather atmospheric, with the authorities and the press discovering the tragedy that took place in Gatlin. The surviving children are placed in foster families in the neighboring town Hemmingford where they reprise their murderous habits in the local cornfields. Newsreporter John Garrett arrives in town along with his estranged son Danny who finds both love and satanical commitment in the little farmer town. The script attempts to bring forward some possible explanations for the children's vile behavior (economical conspiracies, spiritual Indian theories...) but it's very poorly executed. So, you better don't pay too much attention to the brilliant plotting as there are silly but gruesome death-sequences to enjoy! An elderly lady get crushed by her own house (!), while another is killed when her wheelchair goes out of control! The best kill definitely is the guy who bleeds to death inside the town church! Good stuff! The music is also good and there even is some female eye-candy to admire! Christie Clark and Rosalind Allen are both fine looking ladies and their characters even are the most intelligent ones of the whole bunch. There are about seven films in the entire Children of the Corn-series, if I'm not mistaken, although I only saw the first four.

Frustratingly, neither gal gets nekkid for the camera, although Angela does hop in the sack for a brief nudity-free romp with tabloid hack John Garrett (Terence Knox) and lovely Lacey takes a shower under a waterfall in her bikini top, much to the delight of John's son Danny (Paul Scherrer).Sadly, the lacklustre plot itself isn't all any where near as memorable as either the splatter or the eye-candy, and as the story develops, too many elements are introduced that irritatingly conflict with each other&#x97;toxic corn that induces hallucinations in children, a psycho cop, He Who Walks Behind The Rows, Indian mysticism&#x97;by the end of the film, not only did I not know what was going on, but I didn't really care.

It's a bit difficult to compare the two movies, since the original definitely wasn't aiming for gore or spectacular kills. The first CotC tried to build a bit of mystery and played it a little more creepier. Sure, by today's standards that might very well translate to 'a little more goofier'. But truthfully, upon re-watching CotC II, I couldn't help noticing it also has its fair share of (unintended) goofy moments. Like the two old sister characters, whose deaths are more funny than terrifying, really (one gets crushed by a house on pillars, the other gets catapulted with her wheelchair into a room full of Bingo-players). And where did that Indian mumbo-jumbo explanation all of the sudden come from? Christie Clark was an enormously cute teen-babe at the time; just thought I'd mention that.After this first sequel, 4 others followed each other rapidly throughout the '90s, so CotC II is much more responsible for starting up the whole franchise than the original was. And all sequels are pretty much on par with what all other sequels from other franchises were being cranked out those days (the '90s installments of the Amytiville series, for example). Hardly great horror movies, but they always managed to entertain me, trying to come up with some original & amusing kills time after time or desperately hoping to bring a new twist to tired concepts.Noteworthy is that Bob Keen & Gary J. Tunnicliffe did the special effects on CotC II. But then again, it's not exactly their most impressive work ever. At any rate, I did have fun re-watching CotC II. I like the musical score by Daniel Licht also. He's a talented composer, though people hardly seem to know which (horror) movies he was involved with.

Instead of trying to find the children's, who should have been the #1 suspects in their murder, parents killers the children are shipped off to Hemingford to be adopted by the unsuspecting people there. In no time at all deaths starts occurring at Hemingford with the elders, that's those over 20 years old, being targeted by an unknown force of nature that happens to be the zombie like children themselves.To make the movie interesting we also have a parent & son dispute involving supermarket tabloid newsman John Garrett, Terrance Knox, and his bratty and foul mouth son Danny, Paul Scherrer. Both Pop & Jr. don't see eye to eye in their very shaky relationship with each other that involves Poppa leaving Momma and taking Jr. with him when Jr was only an infant. This soon ends when Danny on his way back to New York runs into sexy and recently arrived, to Hemmingford, Lacy Hellerstat, Christie Clark.

We also have a strange side-plot in the film involving the town physician Dr, Richard Appley played by Ed Gradey, who's a dead ringer for the former NY State Senate majority leader Joe Bruno, and Sheriff Blaine, Wallace Mark, who are both involved with the dirty goings on with the town's corn harvest. The two had secretly stored away the corn for over a year that resulted in it becoming infected with the deadly Aflatoxin virus! That's what happened to the corn harvest when both Blaine & Appley left it hidden and didn't burn it! The rotten and infected corn is now slowly infecting the entire town which in the end will kill far more people then the children of the corn ever will!***SPOILER*** It's only when university professor and Native American Frank Redbear who's actually gray, Ned Romero, shows up later in the movie that it finally starts to make some kind of sense. Redbear soon gets the totally mixed up John Garrett to go alone with him in his attempt to put an end to the children of the corn and their deranged leader Micah in carrying out their evil plan; That's in them killing everyone over 20 in town. Redbear in an effort to stop the harvest moon human sacrifice gets a hold of a mechanical corn picker and steam rolls through the cornfield picking apart the crazed and demonic Micah and turning him into human cornmeal. That's before he himself finally expired from an arrow shot into his gut by one of Micah's followers.In the end we finally get to see the mysterious One who walks in the Rows the real power behind Micah who happens to be some kind giant gopher or prairie dog who only works by night and underground.Despite all the blood letting and violence in the movie it's only good for laughs and nothing else. The spaced out and zombie like children of the corn are so ridicules and unbelievable that you can't take them seriously for a second even if you try to. With all the hysterics in the film the one who really takes the cake, and steals every scene that he's in, is the local preacher Rev. Holling, John Bennes. Rev. Hollings is so off the wall and at the same time comical that it's hard to believe that he, in his constant talks and sermons about and against the evils of sex and fornication, could take himself seriously!

He is disassembled molecularly(..I'm not kidding)and reformed by the demonic force in the field. Micah will instruct the children(..much like Jacob did in the first film)to do the work that needs to be done as many will perish for the fields of the harvest moon. Listen to the death list..(a)a news guy gets a corn stalk thrusted through his throat(b)one lady gets crushed underneath her houseWhat a world! What a world!(c)one man hemorrhages blood from the orifices of his facenasty bit of business this is(d)one doctor is repeatedly stabbed with syringes..the kids finish the job with a nice touch by placing a sucker in his mouth(e)an elderly woman in a wheelchair is sent through the window of a bingo parlor, & (f)a town meeting goes up in flames. There's a little sub-plot concerning poisoned corn which might have a hallucinatory effect on children and cause many innocents simply breathing it to die and how certain well-noted citizens of Hemmingford might corruptly be turning their heads so that the town will flourish economically. Will John and Frank be able to stop the evil which awaits in the corn? Do they bark up the wrong tree and discover that certain members in town want them out of the way. Will Micah complete the cycle of violence and sacrificial offerings so that this beast that awaits can rule the earth? Does anyone really, really care? If you bask in the joy of pure rotten cinema..as I admittedly did, then COTC2The Final Sacrifice is perfect entertainment. The ending with Redbear only puts a stamp on how the filmmakers wished for us to take it seriously, but I just giggled with amusement. "},{"Title":"Awesome, gory fun!!!

It has at it all baby. Gory death scenes that will make the kids and ladies puke. Eye candy for both sides of the sexes. A stupid story. A fast pace that will never bore you. One scary musical score (think The Omen). And, oh yes, neato special effects. It's not Shakespeare, it's not Kubrick, hell it's not Tarantino. But you know what? IT'S A BLAST!!! Anybody and everybody will have fun watching this. Duders, bring your girlfriends to scare em'. The death scenes are awesome, the performances are fair (nothing great but nothing that would make Mariah Carey proud), and the direction's OK (althought the house falling felt TV-movie flat). Overall watch this film for a good, memorable, blood-drenched time. And check out part III for more gory, kiddie fun in the 'hood! For all the uptight cinema snobs, get back to worshiping 2001 A Space Odyssey... can't handle this! Oh yeah!

As an horror movie this movie is actually quite a good and effective one.The movie works out way better than Children of the Corn, from 1984. It's not only due to the better written story that the movie works out but also because all of the elements in it do. The children are far more convincing and kind of scary this time, because they actually get to do some very evil stuff this time. There are quite a few killings in this movie, of which some are quite graphic to watch as well.I can even say that this movie is more Stephen King like, even though Stephen King was not involved with this movie or its story at all, unlike the first movie, which got based on a novel by him. This movie its story, characters, horror and even humor reminded much more of King's style than the first movie really.The movie also does a far better job at explaining stuff. In the first movie basically nothing what happened got explained. In this movie we get to learn a bit more about the past and why things happened the way they did in the small town of Gatlin.I also like how the actual corn in this movie does play a prominent role. The corn in these movies should always be an evil and perhaps even scary thing, you don't want to go into, during night or daytime. The corn is actually a part of the movie its horror. I also liked the score by Daniel Licht, which was simply a great one for an horror movie. He's a composer that has never really broken through yet, though he's getting some fame and attention now for his work on the hit-series Dexter.Really much better than the first movie.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Silly, though enormously superior to the original","Date":"7 April 2007","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" I found the first Children of the Corn to be a useless movie with pretty much no redeeming features. Right from the beginning this is a superior effort in every way, although its still no classic, it is at least continuously diverting and has some memorable moments. There's a crazed sense of invention to several of the kills, which are occasionally quite nice and grisly, and in one occasion even mildly spooky. A couple of early deaths are pretty silly, but to be honest I was just pleased to see decent on screen killing, which doesn't seem really to happen at any point during the original. The pacing was fairly compelling, although the ending was slightly underwhelming, and the acting was of a reasonable enough standard to maintain interest. At every point in this movie, I was feeling pleased that it wasn't anything like as bad as its abysmally stupefying predecessor, and ultimately I would recommend it to any horror fan who wishes to see a passable attempt at the Children of the Corn concept. Not as entertaining as part 3, but still offers some mindless, silly good times. "},{"Title":"Fornication my friends is a pestilence. I quite liked it.","Date":"13 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice starts as the authorities discover the gruesome secrets of the small American town of Gatlin in Nebraska where all the children there had murdered their parents... All the children are taken to the neighbouring town of Hemmingford where they are taken in by the kind townsfolk, meanwhile newspaper reporter John Garrett (Terence Knox) & his troubled teenage son Danny (Paul Scherrer) arrive in town in the hope of a big story. They pitch up in the local B & B run by Angela Casual (Rosalind Allen) who herself has taken in one of the children from Gatlin named Micah (Ryan Bollman). It's not long before evil spirits possess Micah & he becomes the new leader of the cult who worship 'he who walks behind the rows', the children of Gatlin start to recruit the children of Hemmingford who all turn on the adult population. As unexplained 'accidents' begin to happen John does some investigation together with anthropology professor Frank Redbear (Ned Romero) & discovers ancient Indian legends that predicted the events of Gatlin, he also discovers that his son Danny is being slowly initiated into the cult...Directed by David Price I actually rather liked Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice although having said that I think it puts me in a minority as it seems to get a lot of negative reaction. Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice is the sequel to the original Children of the Corn (1984) which I also liked & to date there has been a further five mostly straight-to-video sequels the last of which was Children of the Corn Revelation (2001). The script by AL Katz & Gilbert Adler is based on the short story by Stephen King which was only about fifteen pages long in the first place, anyway I thought this was a pretty decent horror film overall. It moves along at a fair pace & I never found myself bored although I have heard other's who disagree on this point, I thought the kills were cool & a few showed a bit of imagination to them & I didn't think it was as clichéd as most horror films are although once again I'm sure many would disagree. The character's are decent, it doesn't take itself too seriously, the boring soap opera-style melodramatics & romances are thankfully kept to a minimum & I thought it passed 90 minutes harmlessly enough. It was definitely better than I had expected that's for sure. Although one plot point does bug me, why did the police let the children from Gatlin go to Hemmingford without any questioning, couldn't they figure out that it was the children who killed all the adults? Surely they would have found some physical evidence in Gatlin that the children had been responsible, surely?Director Price does a decent job with a low budget, the film looks nice enough although I wasn't that impressed with the Predator (1987) style infrared demon point-of-view vision. There are some good corn related deaths, corn slitting someones throat, a corn stalk stuck through someones throat, death by combine harvester & there's a scene in which someone is stabbed with lots of syringes, there are some mutilated corpses & the best special effects scene set in a Church where someone dies from a seriously messy nose bleed while the Reverend reads a scathing sermon out on violence & bloodshed in horror films!I must admit I was a bit surprised when I read the supposed budget for Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice was only $900,000, I personally though it looked higher budget than that. Some of the optical effects look a little dated but apart from that it's a well made film & looks better than it has any right to. The acting was OK, nothing special but nothing to bad either. All the 'children of the corn' have that inbred freakishness about them, where on earth do they find these people?!I liked Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice & at the end of the day that's what it's all about, your own person opinion on a film & whether you enjoyed it or not so I'm going to go against the 'popular' opinion & say I thought Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice was a good horror film. Enough said. Followed by Children of the Corn III (1995). "}]
