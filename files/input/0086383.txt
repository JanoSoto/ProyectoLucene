[{"Title":"Dirty Harry is Back, Big time","Date":"6 July 2002","Score":"38 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts.  It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan (as played by Clint Eastwood) so popular.  He carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, Harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing.  But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen.  And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `Sudden Impact,' directed by and starring Eastwood, so successful.  In this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception  Whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.In his own inimitable way, Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time.  So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can.  In a small town north of San Francisco, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator.  Unaccountably, Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief, Jannings (Pat Hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere.  Not one to be deterred, however, Harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke).  Gradually, Harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?Eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `Dirty Harry.'  It had been seven years since the last `Harry' offering (`The Enforcer,' 1976), but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor.  And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4.  As with all the films he directs, Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end. The screenplay, by Joseph Stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `Dirty Harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith) is the most engaging since the original `Dirty Harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action.  The characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catch-phrases  `Go, ahead-- make my day...'As Harry, Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular  He lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today.  Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before.  No matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry, or at least have him around.  `Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.'  She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre.  Even amid the violence, Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life.  Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.In supporting roles, two performances stand out  Paul Drake, as Mick, creates the best `psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `Dirty Harry.'  With actually very limited screen time, Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience.  This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end.  Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan, who makes her character, Ray Parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city.  It's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell (Horace), Mark Kevloun (Bennett) and Nancy Parsons (Mrs. Kruger).  With a perfect blend of drama and action, `Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience.  9/10.

Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry films to be made in the 80's, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films. This doesn't mean that it's quality is any less.

However, after the rather flat and comic-book heroics of the third film, The Enforcer, it's good to see some changes to the formula. Sudden Impact is quite a dark, moody piece of cinema with big emphasis on character. Yes, there's action, but the action in this one is only one piece of the jigsaw whereas in some of the other Dirty Harry outings the action was everything. Harry Callahan (Eastwood) is in hot water with his superiors for carrying out an illegal search on a suspicious car. The young thugs he arrested are released because of the lack of evidence, and they set out to take revenge on Harry. However, Harry is a tough nut to crack - and pretty soon he is striking back in his own destructive style. Harry's boss decides to get Harry out of town for a while to avoid further bloodshed, so he assigns him to a quiet murder investigation in an isolated coastal town. Harry pieces together the mystery and discovers that the killer is a female artist (Locke) who is bumping off a bunch of drop-outs who gang-raped her and her sister years previously. Should he arrest her for the killings, or should he turn a blind eye and let her do away with these repellent scum-bags? The film is probably the second best in the series (the original is always going to be considered the best). Peculiarly, it is the only Dirty Harry movie upon which Eastwood also doubled up as director. It isn't a whole success, with some needless scenes (what's the point of the sequence detailing the hold-up of a coffee shop?) and a couple of overly hammy performances by the main villains (especially the trailer trash redhead). On the whole, though, this is a very interesting and unusual addition to the series which gets by on the strength of being totally different to all the other four episodes.

Ugly, that is the first word that comes to mind. What an ugly, gory, gross out, piece of crap. Let's grant the shaky morality of returning murder for rape. I will not go there. It is certainly debatable. The film glories in head and genital bullet shots. Yes, I love seeing bullets into heads; it makes my day. First, when you shoot someone in the head it is not that nice; see brains and blood fly all over in a lovely gore explosion. Think of an exploding watermelon. The film desensitizes the costs of violence; it is all neat and clean. Neelan's performance is without equal in the most gross, disgusting character even depicted on screen. Look, I am sullied after wading though the sewage that is modern film; this, even though made in 1983, is flat out disgusting. It is full of cringe worthy moments, yes the make my day scene is one of them. First, if his reflexes were any slower they could have painted a mural waiting for the old geezer to pull his piece. In real life he would have been riddled with bullet holes before grandpa even got the piece out. How about the romance between him and the 25 years younger Locke, yuuuuuch! Please, at least it was off camera. He arrives in a small town and there is a robbery right in front of him what a coincidence. The whole shooting up the mafia enforcers, yes now there was a realistic scene. Look how far down from DIRTY HARRY we have come? Even THE ENFORCER was a masterpiece compared to this. Sondra Locke was one of the most beautiful actresses of the 1980's but she could never act. Psycho boy gets old very fast. When Sondra said her lines, in my theater in 1983, people were laughing. Again, watching her tool about shooting men and one women in the genitals and the head just is not my idea of a good time. Instead of the great Harry Guardino, we get some faceless, bad acting stand in. This really was close to the nadir for the Dirty Harry franchise. Sondra took out the monkey movies with her abysmal singing which makes her acting seem like Bette Davis. She is on screen here way to long and her acting wrecks the movie. The supporting cast is just awful. Pat Hingle is the only actor among them. The film is unrelentingly non stop violence, gross out dialogue and really ugly imagery. If you enjoy some bad acting tart driving around shooting men in the genitals and head, this is the film for you. Again, the morality is quite dubious. We revoked the death penalty for rape about 50 years ago. BRING A BARF BAG AND A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.

A rather unconventional detective, Callahan is put on the case.. but whose side will he take?This is one of the most brutal films I've seen in quite some time. Virtually every scene seems to be a set-up for some punks to make the mistake of annoying our hero, who then proceeds to beat the living daylights out of them, or simply blows their heads off. I am 100% convinced that if any serving officer did what the Eastwood character gets away with in this film, he would not only be stripped of his badge, but also be looking at a considerable stretch in prison. Another striking aspect of the picture is the violence used against the fairer sex. The female cast members get punched in the face, kicked when on they're on the ground.. And that doesn't even include the constant flashbacks we get of Sondra Locke's sexual assault ordeal (We get one every time she carries out one of her revenge attacks on her aggressors). The misogyny displayed on screen is incredible and is unlikely to endear itself to anyone concerned about domestic violence.So why am I recommending it? Well for a start, the film is well directed, with some very exciting gunfights and car chases which will keep you on the edge of your seat. But the main reason for watching is Clint himself, the evergreen icon giving us another classy performance as a veteran cop who might not share the ethics of the modern police force, but tends to do the job 10x better than his colleagues who do it all 'by the book'. If only we had someone like that here in Britain, perhaps this country wouldn't be the crime hotspot it is these days.. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Harry Meets The Worst Woman Since Ann Savage","Date":"5 April 2006","Score":"16 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" The fourth in the Dirty Harry series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females I have ever seen on film Ray Perkins, played by Audrie Neenan.

I thought the first one was great, the second was an interesting reversal of viewpoint, and the 3rd and 5th were adequate action thrillers.So what of the 4th? I never shared Eastwood's fascination with Sondra Locke, and that's probably the reason why I never caught this movie until last night. So what did I find? I found a rape/revenge movie which, when all was said and done, didn't need Harry Callahan in it at all. I found Harry's activities pretty nearly exclusively limited to a) the usual falling out with authority (mostly plot-relevant) and b) the usual quasi-vigilante schtick - normally limited to a single encounter early on (viz, the diner in this movie) to establish character, but here repeated seemingly without end and with hardly any plot relevance. I found a film full of unsympathetic characters. I found an irritating unconvincing cackling psycho and an irritating unconvincing foul-mouthed dyke. I found an irrelevant farting dog. I found the usual atmospheric San Franciso locations replaced with a new but decidedly unatmospheric location, presumably 10 minutes down the road from Carmel so that Eastwood could nip home for lunch and Council meetings. I found a great deal of unpleasantly misogynistic violence. And I found Sondra Locke, who I didn't like any more in this film than I did in Josey Wales, Any Which Way 1 and 2, The Gauntlet, zzzzz.....I'm glad Harry came back once more after this.

Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary Go ahead, make my day line that Eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. Very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7/10Rated R for violence and a rape scene "}{"Title":"lacking in some ways and stronger in others, it's a good- if mixed- Eastwood bag","Date":"8 September 2005","Score":"8 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" It's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly (if only in comparison to other films in its legacy), and others in a 'sub-plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong. Sudden Impact is one of those cases, where Clint Eastwood as star/producer/director shows when he can be at his best, or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime/mystery/detective story in his Dirty Harry fame. We get that 'make my day' line, and un-like in the first film where his 'do I feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails, here it's switched around. He gets into another shamble with the department, as usual, when he tries to fight crime 'his' way, in particular with a diner robbery (inspiration for Pulp Fiction?) and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus. He's told to 'take a vacation', and that's the last thing on his mind. This whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration. But soon his story merges with the sub-plot that Eastwood develops from the start.Enter Sandra Locke's character, Jennifer Spencer, whom we soon learn after some (appropriately) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel, unjust sexual assault (err, outright rape), and is sleekly, undercover-like, getting revenge. Her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film, the most intense, and finally when it goes into Callahan's storyline (he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder), the film finally finds a focus between Eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs. evil (though sometimes blurred, to be sure). Eastwood films the flashbacks, not to say too much about them, expertly, in a fresh, experimental style; the trademark Lalo Schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others. It almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into Eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style, which helps make the film watchable.It's a shame, though, that in the end it goes more for the expectable (or maybe not expectable) points, and until the third act Callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith...Wesson...and me' shtick. However, with Locke he gets out of her a very good performance (more subtle and touching than the one in the Gauntlet) and an exciting climax at an amusement park. In a way I do and don't agree with Ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in Eastwood's style here. I admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both, the directness, but the scenes where Eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video. It's cheesy, it's hard-edged, it's not up to par with the first two 'Harry' pictures, but hey, there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the .44.

Full disclosure The first Dirty Harry film is one of my personal favorites. I consider it a masterpiece, from every shot, line of dialogue and musical cue. And it's the musical score in Sudden Impact that first led me astray. With its tacky 80s sound, the music during the opening credits made me realize how much I missed the proto acid-jazz sounds of the first film. I was shocked to discover that it was the same man, Lalo Schifrin (who did great music for another San Francisco cop drama Bullitt), who did the music for both films. I should also add that this is the only Dirty Harry sequel that I have seen, and after watching this one, I'm in no hurry to pursue the others in an effort to keep my love for the original alive.Sudden Impact features an older and grumpier Inspector Harry Callahan still serving his swift brand of justice on the mean streets of the city by the bay. After giving an aging mobster a heart attack (a cameo from The Godfather Part II's Michael V. Gazzo), Callahan finds himself constantly in the line of fire. People have a nasty habit of getting dead around you, a superior officer tells him. To lose the heat, Eastwood is soon sent to a small coastal town to get background information on a previous homicide investigation he was working on in the city. Right as he rolls into town, Callahan proves his bosses' statement correct by driving past a robbery in progress in this sleepy little town.It was at this moment that I completely gave up on the film. It's simply filled with way too many over-the-top moments and a corny sense of humor which don't bode well with its main storyline of a rape victim taking revenge on her perpetrators years later. Because of these two opposing moods, the film feels like it takes forever to get started, derailed by one action scene too many. I wasn't surprised to learn after the fact that the film was originally conceived as a vehicle for Eastwood's then girlfriend and collaborator Sondra Locke, and was only modeled into a Dirty Harry film after Warner Brothers responded to a fan poll that expressed interest in bringing back the series. If it were cut by about twenty minutes, the movie might be considerably better.Sudden Impact's only contribution to cinema is the famous line, Go ahead ... make my day, delivered by Eastwood near the start of the film when confronting a robber holding a waitress hostage. The scene is familiar but it doesn't undermine the power of Eastwood's delivery, an iconic moment in an otherwise dull film. The line is delivered again during the film's climax to a similar effect. In fact, the whole climatic showdown and final set piece are very well done and almost redeem all that has come before it. However, the impact is tainted after wasting so much time on previous shenanigans and off the wall coincidences.

If you're familiar with those pictures, then you'll know what to expect from Sudden Impact.Eastwood is essentially a bystander, although he does have the pre-title sequence to dispatch a few nincompoops and to remind us that Harry Callahan has lost none of his zest for life in the intervening seven year itch since The Enforcer.Interesting cast appear mostly in cameos, aside from corrupt cop Pat Hingle, veterans Mara Corday, Bradford Dillman, Michael V.Gazzo, Nick Dmitri and Carmen Argenziano beef up the talent, while Albert Popwell makes it four different characters in each of the Dirty Harry films to this point.

That has always been the communiqué ducking beneath the insistent gunfire, slashing, and explosions that make up the bulk of these pictures. My problem with Sudden Impact, apart from having been mostly bored by the film, was that it left me with these two very different realizations in a Dirty Harry film, the hero should remain in San Francisco; Mr. Eastwood should remain in front of the camera.This film, the only one which Mr. Eastwood directed as well as starred in, is by far the weakest. It is truly surprising, since it does start out very well. Of course, that's when the movie is still set in San Francisco. It is here that we get the Dirty Harry material that we look for. Early on, a punk arrested by Mr. Eastwood is let off scot-free by the courts. He gives the inspector a snide remark, Dirty Harry grabs him by the collar, berates him, and slams him against the elevator wall. Classic. More so is the famous diner sequence and the movie's signature line.But shortly after this point, Dirty Harry takes a trip to San Paulo, tracking yet another serial killer&#x97;one whose M.O. is shooting her victim once in the head and once in the genitals&#x97;and the movie goes completely downhill. It is no longer exciting or very funny. Instead, Sudden Impact becomes pretentious, depressing, and extremely ponderous. It's a movie in no hurry to see itself end; I only wish I could have felt the same.A core problem is the lack of a commanding villainess. As in the original Dirty Harry from 1971, we see the murderer in a close-up at the very beginning, so there is no mystery for the audience to piece together. The difference is this the psychotic sharpshooter from the original Dirty Harry was a disgusting and utterly repulsive creep. As played by Sondra Locke in this film, the rape victim taking her revenge on the men who molested her and her now-vegetative sister, is uninteresting. And what the screenplay has to offer Miss Locke is not a whole heck of a lot better. It utilizes the tiresome gimmick of flashbacks intercut with the killer executing her victims. The shooting parts are effectively handled, but the clumsy flashbacks trivialize them. Furthermore, the movie does not set itself a mind in how to portray Miss Locke empathetic victim or scumbag. I think the movie was leaning more toward the former, but I kept on feeling disgust for her. Almost as much as I had for the snarling little twerps she was preying upon.To make matters worse, Miss Locke is really the center focus of the story. She's almost the real star of the movie. Mr. Eastwood's Dirty Harry really plays second-fiddle. The movie chugs along with some lousy moments where they confront each other, including an all-time low for the series where they share a bed for the night. At that point in the film, I threw my hands in the air, ready to give up.As the man standing behind the camera, Clint Eastwood disappoints this time around. He has demonstrated before and since Sudden Impact that he is a very capable director. The problem here is that he seems to have favored tossing out his own flair in exchange for imitating the men who directed him before. With the exception of the San Francisco scenes&#x97;yes, they are really the best part of the movie. I cannot emphasize that enough&#x97;we do not see his director's personae in the images. It does not feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it feels like a second-rate imitation of a Don Siegel film or a Ted Post film. I wish Mr. Eastwood had either trusted his instincts or allowed another director to handle the material. Maybe he did learn the lesson, as Buddy Van Horn directed the fifth (and better) entry in the series, The Dead Pool.Just as surprising as the overall boredom of the film was the insulting sting of its ending an ending that I cannot imagine the Dirty Harry Callahan of the previous three movies in the franchise would have allowed to be. Here the movie's subtle message about justice and doing the right thing contradicts itself, and it left me feeling disturbed and unclean. Sudden Impact is about as joylessly depressing and clumsy as its nighttime cinematography. Dirty Harry has surrounded himself with nobody interesting. His semi-partner in the film, Albert Popwell (finally given a good-guy role in the franchise) is underwritten, and Mr. Eastwood's most frequent companion is a flatulent bulldog. The humor is not very humorous. The action is not very exciting. The film is surprisingly dull.

Everything was fast paced, simple, and colorful.  The action scenes were essential to the exposition.  And the pistol shots had acquired a new full-throated booming sound that has since become standard.  Eastwood even tried to act -- a little.  His throw-away laugh after clicking his empty hammer at the robber after the first shoot out was the only laugh I can ever remember from Eastwood that seemed to register real amusement.  They all should have quit while they were ahead.  Sondra Locke is really quite beautiful, although obviously no longer the sensitive teenager of her earliest movies; mature, now, and dumbly fatalistic, having been ravished or ravaged by a gang of hoodlums under the boardwalk at Santa Cruz.  Most of the film is shot in Santa Cruz, called San Paulo, a curious fictive mixture of Spanish and/or Portugese and/or Italian.  Let's call it a generically Romance language name for a town, although of course it fits none of the known ones.  Its location is also curious, north of the City, making a hash of the geography, but never mind.  Harry's in trouble with the SFPD.  Yet again.  They ship him to San Paulo where he finds himself willy nilly on the trail of Sondra Locke who is assiduously knocking off all the people involved in her rape years ago.  His butting in annoys Pat Hingle, the local sherrif.  The four or five participants in the rape are still sleazebags and deserve being shot in the cojones.  Except one of them is apparently a dyke who was only an enthusiastic witness.  No matter, she gets blown away anyhow.  One of the guys, caught by Locke in a garage, seems to have become pathetically middle class.  In a weak and genuinely remorseful voice he apologizes to her and begs for mercy.  He gets it in the cojones too.  Harry has changed his pistol in this one.  He couldn't get a bigger pistol because there aren't any to speak of, short of something that would need mounting on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  So, while it's still .44 mag, it is now automatic.  So what?  Harry pops up out of garbage cans to shoot guys in the back.  Pretty funny, eh?  There's an ugly dog in it too, given to the release of intestinal gas.

I was plesently surprised that the film improved significantly on its predecessor, whilst adding something new to the franchise.Firstly Harry spends the majority of the film in some quiet coastal town investigating a series of revenge murders. I was also surprised when Clint's famous 'make me day' line cropped up in this film, I was sure it was from something more famous.Sudden Impact to me is certainly the third best Dirty Harry flick. The plot is an interesting twist for Harry to negotiate, and the 'real' bad guys are seen as three dimentional characters. The film does contain the staple set pieces seen in all the Dirty Harry films, and they don't disappoint. The scene with the mafia boss is Harry at his best/ worse depending on your politics. Harry still clashes with his superiors who refer to him as a 'dinosaur' but in this one Harry is more like a private detective and the cops don't show up at the last minute as per usual.'Sudden Impact' is a worthy addition to the Dirty Harry cannon, and Roger Moore era Bond gags aside (The comedy dog, particularly), this film spiced up Harry when I questioned the future of the franchise at the end of part three. This is not to say that they should have gone on to part five- they shouldn't have. Ideally this would have been released in the seventies, with say Cybil Shepherd or Ellyn Burnstein in the main female role, as for me Sondra Lock doesn't quite cut it. It's nice to see Albert Popwell again too, see it, just don't go any further than this 1983 Harry adventure.6/10 3/5 "},{"Title":"Between this and The Dead Pool for worst Dirty Harry movie","Date":"12 September 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" It's between this and The Dead Pool for worst Dirty Harry movie.The fourth Dirty Harry movie (of five, ultimately). A woman (played by Sondra Locke) is killing off, one by one, the men who raped her and her sister several years previously. Harry Calahan (played by Clint Eastwood, of course) is on the case, but due to his law enforcement methods, there are a few criminals after him. Eventually he is sent to a small seaside town to track down some leads on the murders...This movie really doesn't add anything to the Dirty Harry story (except that he exchanges his 44 Magnum revolver for a 44 Magnum pistol...). It feels clichéd, forced, unoriginal and predictable. Even Eastwood seems to be going through the motions.On that note, the other performances aren't anything to write home about either. Sondra Locke is weak and unconvincing as the vigilante, Pat Hindle plays stereotypical small town sheriff and the bad guys are all one-dimensional.The Dirty Harry series should have ended after three movies. "},{"Title":"A Romantic Side of Dirty Harry","Date":"23 September 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" This film Sudden Impact goes above and beyond in that we see a romantic side of Dirty Harry for a change. However, do not be fooled. This film still holds on to its integrity as an action-packed crime drama just like previous Dirty Harry films. Jennifer Spencer (played by Sandra Locke) is a 30-something-year-old woman who continues to suffer from the horrendous memories of a gang rape to which she and her teenage sister fell victim at the hands of local hooligans in a California town north of San Francisco. The rape gang that attacked her and her teenage sister 10 years earlier consisted of mostly men and one woman. A major flaw can be found in humanity rather than in the movie itself when a flashback is shown where Jennifer Spencer allows herself to be talked into taking her teenage sister to a gathering below the boardwalk at a noisy amusement park. The woman-rapist who invites her to this gathering acts so touchy and pushy with her when Jennifer Spencer almost declines the invitation that the audience questions why anyone would be naive enough even to show up to such a gathering when God only knows what kind of people will be there. Jennifer Spencer is in public when this woman-rapist extends this invitation. When anybody sees this scene, everybody probably wonders why anyone in their right mind would even entertain the idea of bringing their teenage sister to a gathering of strangers who are probably just as creepy as the woman-rapist who extended the invitation. Most of us would just not show up after promising to do so, right? Well, so we tell ourselves. Nobody is perfect and most of us have been caught in a moment of weakness in one way or another no matter how aggressive we may believe ourselves to be in dealing with all the bullies of the world. Whenever we fall into trying situations, we all hate the unwelcome remarks later on from others who have never been in such situations, telling us what we could have done differently to prevent the situation from ever coming about, because reality has it that one never knows what it is like to be a victim of any kind of atrocity unless one has been a victim of one. Moreover, if Jennifer Spencer had not shown up with her teenage sister at the gathering, there would have been no movie. Anyhow, after seeing the graphic gang rape in Jennifer Spencer's flashback, most of us come to the realization that rudeness is sometimes the best defense we have against low-lifes who deserve no courtesy whatsoever regardless of how we have been brought up.What makes this movie interesting is the psychology it promotes that both rapists and former rapists who live by the misguided faith that revenge has a statute of limitations of some kind and that violent sexual assaults become things of the past after so many years are actually living in a fool's paradise for believing so. This movie shows the reality that most rape victims do not forgive nor forget such violations upon them even after the passage of one or several decades no matter how reformed their attackers may become in the future. The anger only builds up through the years to be released at a much greater magnitude than if the revenge had occurred immediately. We all sense that rage coming from Jennifer Spencer as we see her bump off her and her sister's former attackers one by one, especially when she violently blows the woman-rapist's breasts off with a shower of bullets after the woman-rapist asks her how her slut sister is doing. Even that comment alone that the woman-rapist makes about Jennifer Spencer's sister causes the audience to feel that the woman-rapist is getting exactly what she deserves and that she is just another mole being wiped off of the backside of society.The story becomes interesting when Dirty Harry and Jennifer Spencer finally meet and hook up with one another. You can't help but to sense the chemistry that exists between both of them in the form of their similar outlook on the cruel and crime-ridden world. You always get a strong feeling that Dirty Harry will be on Jennifer Spencer's side throughout her entire ordeal no matter how her situation turns out for her and no matter which side of the law she ends up on in her vendetta against the men and the one woman who had gang raped her and her sister 10 years earlier. As in previous films, Dirty Harry fears no evil no matter how sinister and diabolical of people he must confront. Every time he says, Go ahead. Make my day, you really hope that the scumbag at the other end of his gun will do something to give him a perfectly legitimate reason to shoot them into the ground.

Even the early courthouse scenes were located here. Nothing much changed since 1983, except the elevators were upgraded and and the interior is now gray. Why would they change these historic elevators? Don't know the location of our police station, probably out of County!Many of the Santa Cruz locations are historic. October 17, 1989 at 504PM we suffered a 7.1 earthquake (three people were killed downtown)that brought down many buildings, including the red Trust Bldg (next to the bank robber shootout), the historic Cooper House (Clint and Sandra had a beer there). The Pacific Ave. Mall (senior bus chasing bike wrong way on one way street) has extensive changes. Took nearly 20 years before all falling buildings were replaced. Some Boardwalk rides have changed, but much is the same since 1983. The bandstand on the beach collapsed. The temporary stage has been here since (for the free summer Friday night rock concerts). The Giant Dipper roller coaster is still here, just as good as ever, but if you get shot on top you'll land at least 100 feet from the non-existent glass Merry-go-round roof (also there's no unicorn).Clint stayed at the La Bahia Apartments. This historic place from the 20s, owned by the Boardwalk's Seaside Company, has long been neglected, rents out to UCSC students and temporary summer amusement park workers. A out-of-town developer wants to raze and put up a monster 124 room upscale hotel (14 feet above zoning height)that many locals, especially the ones who'll lose their view, are fighting in court and at the Coastal Commission. Too bad since they could replace the 250 room Casa del Rey hotel (destroyed in the quake) and perhaps attach a water-park which is lacking in our tourist city.Our historic non-profit hostel is close by, above La Bahia at the Carmelita Cottages City Park. Clint was filmed entering (or leaving) one of the cottages, but the scene never got into the final film. In summer it's about $28 for a dorm bunk bed; a bit more for private room. In summer reservations are suggested since we are the least expensive clean, safe and friendly place to stay. We do have an 11PM curfew to placate our neighbors and are closed during mid-day. Local hotels/motels are expensive during the summer, and some are not the best. Most visitors make day trips from Silicon Valley over the hill.Stagnaro's Fish market and restaurant is still on the Municipal wharf, but Rivas has great during-the-week dinners. Our favorite is Yanflower Chinese Restaurant at the south end of Pacific Avenue (most reasonable lunches). Surfing is now even more popular at Steamer Lane (by the Lighthouse, now also a surfing museum, Jack O'Neill invented the wetsuit here - the ocean is cold). Bicycles are a popular transportation option. The San Lorenzo River levy bike path requires only one street crossing. We do have many homeless and street bums in town, partially due to a very liberal city council that supports homeless shelters, but the city is generally quite safe. Downtown has been revitalized with many students living (UCSC housing is expensive)and plenty of restaurants, drinking spots, movie houses, and entertainment.Santa Cruz lies just 70 miles south of SF. You need not drive There's Greyhound, or Caltrain connecting with Highway 17 bus. We have a pretty good local Metro Bus (unless they'll chop its budget). But the connection to Monterey and Carmel is not the best since there's no Greyhound to Monterey Peninsula and local buses require some transfers (easier during week). If you travel to Big Sur, suggest first watching Play Misty for Me (fairly scary, but great Eastwood film). Happy trails!

'Sudden Impact' again like the other additions, brings its own distinguishable style and tone, but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments (and bestowing a classic line Go ahead. Make my day)&#x85; but some of its humor has to been seen to believe. A bulldog&#x85; named meathead that pisses and farts. Oh yeah. However an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in San Francisco.The story follows that of detective Callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes. After getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood. He's ordered to take leave, but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town San Paulo, where a murder has occurred similar in vein (bullet to groin and between eyes) to his case. There he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.To be honest, I wasn't all that crash hot on Eastwood's take, but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'Magnum Force'. This well-assembled plot actually gives Eastwood another angle to work upon (even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time), quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging. It's like he's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework. His use of images is lasting, due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics. Dark tones, brooding lighting&#x85; like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure (Harry with his new .44 automag handgun) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks. It's a striking sight that builds fear! Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. It seemed to come off. A major plus with these films are the dialogues, while I wouldn't call 'Sudden Impact' first-rate, it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines&#x85; You're a legend in your own mind. Don't you just love hearing Harry sparking an amusing quip, before pulling out his piece. The beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense&#x85; the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages. Lalo Schfrin would return as composer (after 'The Enforcer had Jerry Fielding scoring) bringing a methodical funky kick, which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go. Bruce Surtees (an Eastwood regular) gets the job behind the camera (where he did a piecing job with 'Dirty Harry') and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes, but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments.Eastwood as the dinosaur Callahan still packs a punch, going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger Callahan. This going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of Harry's quest for justice&#x85; by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it. I just found it odd&#x85; a real change of heart. Across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time Sondra Locke. Her turn of traumatic torment (being senselessly raped along with her younger sister), is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity. When the anger is released, it's tactically accurate in its outcome. Paul Drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and Audrie J. Neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance. These people are truly an ugly bunch of saps. Pat Hingle is sturdy as the Chief of the small coastal town. In smaller parts are Bradford Dillman and the agreeably potent Albert Popwell (a regular in the series 1-4, but under different characters). How can you forget him in 'Dirty Harry'&#x85; yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?

A lot's changed in the meantime; not only has Eastwood aged noticeably (the iconic smirk that he carried over from his spaghetti Western days has mostly disappeared) but the times have changed. The first three films are deeply rooted in the seventies, when reaction to the liberal reforms of the sixties was at its height.The first three films are violent action flicks, but also have a certain humor that's almost entirely lacking here. The earlier films had witty dialogue and good character chemistry; SUDDEN IMPACT falls back on farting dog jokes. But mostly there's no humor; it's a very dark, brutally violent story, and while it's a well made action flick, it's not really what I'd call a fun movie. The body count is extremely high, and we get constant flashbacks to a repulsive gang rape scene. I wouldn't say it's overdone, but it's enough to make you feel slightly ill.Still, Harry rides to victory, Eastwood is as solid as ever, and there are a couple of set pieces that are ultimately worth the price of admission. Sondra Locke does well in a role that's probably not easy to play, and Bradford Dillman is once again a splendid caricature of the pencil-pushing bureaucrat.This is not one I'd want to watch too often, but it's not terrible; just somewhat depressing.

There weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. Virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society.

The performances across the board were compelling. I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films I've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. The lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end.

It's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing. There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up Make my day scene recalls the Do you feel lucky one, one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's Scorpio, an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry's partner - just to name a few.Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier. His constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice, the two things not always being compatible. This incompatibility is the underlying theme of the series. The first film posed a simple question, What about the victim's rights? - (do they outweigh those of the criminal? Vice versa? Depends?). That film's answer was controversial, prompting a sequel (the highly enjoyable Magnum Force) which set out to draw the line between Harry's brand of justice and pure, heartless vigilantism. Dirty Harry, like many of Clint's other roles, is the personification of vengeance, the protector of the the defenseless. This movie however brings it back to the victim, in this case Jennifer (portrayed by Sondra Locke), who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men (and one woman) who committed the crime.Without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie, I will say this - I mentioned earlier that Sudden Impact echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series (the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank, I believe). The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante? And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights? The exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series, one which I personally (as a fan) found quite moving. That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax to the Dirty Harry collection, the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film. (Not to knock The Dead Pool - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan, rather than a character-defining film like this one).This movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing, and the President himself frequently quoted Go ahead, make my day.

We are asked to identify with Locke's character, who is cold-bloodedly killing her rapists one-by-one, to approve of Callahan's methods and to laugh at the dumbos who disapprove of those methods.

This and the fact that there isn't as much chasing going on as in the rest of the Dirty Harry films, make this installment somewhat less exciting than the other ones. However, this film does have a bonus it's three predecessors did not have, a good editor. The few chasing scenes there are in this film, are photographed and edited in style and with ability, making the film a pretty tight package, if one looks at the directional skills involved.Now the fact, that this film isn't too exciting, does not mean that it has a low quality. It is just this episode of Dirty Harry does not focus on action and Harry bringing bad guys to justice. This film, which is not as much aimed to be a crime flick as the other four Harry films, is supposed to tell a story and is aimed at giving Harry more depth. In that it succeeds, but that doesn't make this good either. The bottom line is, that this film is watchable and that it does feature some of Harry's (or should I say Eastwood's?) famous one-liners, but that in it's core it is not a typical Dirty Harry film. For me, The Enforcer was the best in the series, with The Dead Pool and The Enforcer sharing the second place. So if I was you (which I am NOT) I'd start with those ones.

This time, Harry Callahan is sent up the coast by his superiors to investigate a series of murders that are connected to a small ocean side resort town.I reckon this may well be the third best entry in the series after the peerless first instalment and its follow-up Magnum Force (1973). Unlike the other two in the series, this one has a more interesting plot-line which involves a vigilante killer played by Eastwood regular actress Sandra Locke. She almost shares top-billing with him here such is the prominence of her role. She plays by far the most sympathetic villain in the series, one who dispatches a series of truly vile characters who assaulted her and her now comatose sister ten years previously. It's the very fact that the role has been written with a lot more depth that contributes to the audience empathising with her, while still knowing that she is committing a series of murders. This dramatic tension is underpinned by the theme of how ineffective and corrupt the justice system can be, leading to victims taking the law into their own hands.This is probably the entry in the series that most veers into psychological thriller territory and I think this change does work in its favour. However, its bread and butter is still action and it hardly falls short on that score. There is an ongoing plot thread which has Callahan continually targeted by Mob hit-men who want him dead for an earlier infraction he instigated against one of their big bosses. Not only this but he also has high adrenaline encounters with three other sets of different criminals. It could be argued, however, that in its latter stages the film went too much in the direction of having villains acting like half-wits allowing for Callahan to escape their clutches and return to defeat them, while the finale in the fun-park felt a little too simplistically cheesy. But, these small gripes aside, I thought this to be a pretty fine effort for a fourth instalment in a film series and a pretty good film in its own right overall. "},{"Title":"No Disappointments This Time Around","Date":"2 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" In the first three Dirty Harry movies, Detective Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) was seen as the maverick cop whose contempt for his superiors, the justice system and the rulebook regularly got him into trouble and in Sudden Impact nothing has really changed. He continues to survive in his job because his unorthodox methods get results but periodically, the costs of his actions in terms of expenses, physical destruction and bad publicity become so great that he temporarily has to be taken out of the firing line for the benefit of everyone involved.One of these situations arises again after the San Francisco cop shoots dead a whole group of criminals who were robbing a diner and then shortly after, confronts a local crime boss at his grand-daughter's wedding, in such a way that the old man suffers a fatal heart attack. Callahan, typically, is furious about being forced to take an unscheduled vacation but is left with no other choice.Unfortunately, when he's on vacation, Callahan gets attacked by a group of the crime boss' men and kills three of them before eliminating another group of thugs who try to kill him because he'd arrested one of their number who'd recently appeared in court but had been freed on a technicality. In the circumstances, Callahan gets assigned to a murder case which takes him to San Paulo, a nearby small town where he becomes friendly with a woman called Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) and also finds that the local police chief, Lester Jennings (Pat Hingle), is openly hostile to the presence of a big city cop and has no intention of providing any assistance or co-operation.More killings (which are all carried out in the same way) follow and Callahan discovers that ten years earlier, the victims were all involved in the brutal gang-rape of Jennifer Spencer and her younger sister who'd remained in a catatonic state ever since. Callahan's methods for bringing murderers to justice are normally very simple and straight forward but, in this case, he decides that a rather different course of action is more appropriate.Sudden Impact delivers its entertaining combination of action and humour at a brisk pace and features a punchy script which is full of witty one-liners and of course, the legendary catchphrase, Go ahead. Make my day. The quality of the acting is very effective throughout with Clint Eastwood on great form. This was the only movie in the Dirty Harry series that Eastwood also directed and his work in relation to the action sequences and those where he makes good use of light and shadows to create the desired atmosphere are top class.Every crime thriller needs an interesting villain and Jennifer Spencer certainly fits the bill because she's a tragic victim, a brutal serial killer and also an artist whose works express her anguish very powerfully. This traumatised woman with a blank expression had, for ten years, harboured her hatred of the rapists and her absolute despair for her sister's predicament and although she might have derived some short-term satisfaction from carrying out her killing spree, it definitely wouldn't have brought her any closer to a cure for her ills.Audiences know exactly what they're going to get with a Dirty Harry film and on the evidence of the huge box office receipts for Sudden Impact, no-one was disappointed this time around.

That sounds amazing which it is. The only Dirty Harry directed by Clint Eastwood himself, whiteout a question among, the finest pictures of the 80's, if is not for the best Magnum Force, one of my favorite Dirty Harry movies in the franchise ever!!! The fourth installment of Dirty Harry series is one of the most astonish best and greatest Eastwood's masterpiece! I don't care what anyone say's I love this movie to death. It has the greatest and the most finest action in the 80's from Clint Eastwood. This movie is even miles way better than The Enforcer! This movie is a bad ass! Harry's line Go ahead, make my day is one of the most memorable praise since Dirty Harry (1971). A long to discover that Dirty Harry is Batman! Why can't they make bad ass action movies like this one is? I will always watch this action flick from Clint Eastwood. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts and a lot action sequences in here with a great story.The Death Wish chapter of the Dirty Harry saga and another high point in the action genre containing an amount of masculine bad ass to make anyone grow their chest hair. Also the 475 Magnum montage had me in stitches. Sudden Impact allowed Harry to interact with someone who shares his mindset of justice. Definitely the darkest of the Dirty Harry movies. In my opinion the best in the series. The rapist got raped by a .44 Auto Mag, and then by a unicorn horn. I saw that one coming in the chase scene at the carousel. Clint Eastwood was Batman back when Batman was sipping' martinis and dancing in Studio 54. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. Great acting and a plot worthy of the title character. Great cinematography. What else can I say buy it you will not be disappointed. This has to be one of Eastwood's best movie. Okay they are all good, but this one will make your day!The Dirty Harry films were in hiatus for 7.years, since no one wanted to make a Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood made a fourth installment with a bad ass action film ever! Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) carries his Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum as his sidearm in the film. He is first seen pulling it in the coffee shop and saying what is one of the most famous movie lines in history. The S&W is used until it is kicked into a curb drain by Mick (Paul Drake). He then uses his AMC Auto Mag Pistol in .44 AMP as a replacement. This is different style of Harry using different weapon by the end of the movie. Sudden Impact is the fourth installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise and the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Clint Eastwood himself. Eastwood returns as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan, who visits a small Northern California city while on leave from the department and finds himself encountering a woman (Sondra Locke) with a vendetta against some of the town's citizens. The 1983 sequel also is the sequel where Eastwood utters the immortal line Go ahead, make my day, while holding his Smith & Wesson Model 29. Sudden Impact also made popular the use of the .44 Magnum AMP Auto Mag Model 180. This is the basic plot of the movie, it is a revenge flick about a rape victim who murderous spree of revenge puts his own ideas of justice to the test! I grew up with this movie and I still love it, even tough this flick was really dark, Sondra Locke played in it, Clint Eastwood's girlfriend at the time. They made many movies together including The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), The Gauntlet (1977), Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can. Sudden Impact (1983) was the last movie Sondra made with Clint Eastwood together. I think Clint did a terrific job of directing and producing his last and the only Dirty Harry movie. I still prefer Dirty Harry and Magnum Force as two of the best movies, but this is my third best movie of Dirty Harry and Clint Eastwood. Sudden Impact is a 1983 American action film and the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series, directed by Clint Eastwood (making it the only Dirty Harry film to be directed by Eastwood himself), and starring Eastwood and Sondra Locke.10/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Warner Bros., Malpaso Company, Starring Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke Director Clint Eastwood Producer Clint Eastwood Screenplay Joseph Stinson Story Earl E.

When things become too crazy in San Franscisco he's sent up north to do some investigating on a murder and soon more bodies begin to pile up. It turns out that a woman (Sondra Locke) is seeking vengeance for the rape against her and her sister by tracking down those responsible.SUDDEN IMPACT is a good film, to a point, but there's no question that it was the weakest in the series up to date. It's rather strange because you could argue that on a technical level this here is the best one since the first film and a lot of the credit has to go to Eastwood who not only stars in the film but also produced and directed it. This fourth film certainly has a lot more polish on it as there's much more style and it's clear that Eastwood's directing skills are as sharp as always.The biggest problem with this movie is its screenplay, which was credited to two different writers and the story itself was also credited to two people includes Charles B. Pierce, the man behind films like THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK and THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. I'm not sure what went wrong or what the original story idea was but what remains is a real mess. I say this because it really does seem as they were making stuff up as they went along because there's simply way too much stuff here and there's no doubt that some editing would have really helped. We get a ton of story at the start of the film and while the stuff with the Mafia makes for some great action scenes, in reality its story is bad. The stuff dealing with the rape/revenge is pretty straight-forward but then there's cover-ups and other things thrown in and by the time the ending comes it's just a big mess.With that said, the reason Dirty Harry is a classic is easily seen even in the weakest of the series. For starters, we've got Eastwood back, kicking butt and adding more bullets to countless scumbags. Seeing the actor with his laid back approach and sly humor works once again and there's no doubt that the actor can put a smile on your face with his one-liners. The quote Go ahead, make my day comes from this film and deserves its classic status. The action scenes are also quite brutal and it's always amazed me that the MPAA was so harsh against slasher films from this era but some of the gunshot wounds here are very violent in their own way but I'm certainly not going to complain.Locke is good in her supporting role as the rape victim and Pat Hingle is also very good in his role. Albert Popwell is fun in his supporting role and fans of PORKY'S will also be happy to see Nancy Parsons. SUDDEN IMPACT is certainly a product of its era but that's really not a bad thing. While the film is certainly watchable you can't help but notice its flaws and a little editing and a better story would have made for something more memorable. "},{"Title":"Great catch phrase","Date":"2 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" This is the fourth Dirty Harry movie. Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) loses a trial when a judge dismisses the case due to his illegal search. He continues to battle criminals in his violent ways. He gets entangled with crime boss Threlkis as his superiors ship him off to tiny San Paulo. Callahan encounters Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke). Jennifer and her sister were gang raped at a carnival years before leaving her sister catatonic. She has started killing the people responsible one at a time while Callahan investigates the new string of murders.This has the iconic scene in the diner where he tells the robber, Go ahead, make my day. This doesn't have quite the same amount of action as the earlier Dirty Harry movies. Once he's with Jennifer, this becomes more of a detective movie. Also he has no partner in this one. There are a few departures in this Dirty Harry directed by Clint Eastwood. There are also a few cinematic choices that I don't like. Jennifer killing her victims feels old fashion like a Hitchcockian homage. It's always with a closeup on her face. At least, it's a memorable serial killer. However it doesn't really have much tension. "},{"Title":"Clint Eastwood's film 'Sudden impact' does make an average impact on viewers !!!!","Date":"10 April 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" It is common knowledge that multitasking is an extremely risky proposition. For this reason, it is hard not only to act in a film but also direct it efficiently. Clint Eastwood manages to pull off an important coup by being in absolute control of his film. In 'Sudden Impact', his troubles seem to start as he is too intelligent to obey other people's orders. However, there is nobody in the police force who can stop a man who can get results come what may with unusual methods.This gives rise to a new situation wherein a clever inspector is assigned to a homicide case in a small town where some random murders start to create panic in the hearts and minds of people. It is not so often that suspense is maintained in a revenge film. This film is an exception as it is about an ordinary yet bad girl who is determined to avenge her and her sister's brutal rape by some hoodlums. As the retribution comes at regular intervals, a great deal of suspense is maintained. Director Clint Eastwood doesn't dig deeper to find out reasons for men raping hapless women. However, some hope for justice is established when a criminal realizes the wrongs which he did. This is too late a development.This has a lot to do with the fact that the hero has to win in the end. There is some twist in the story as bad guys collapse due to over confidence in their abilities. "},{"Title":"Entertaining but with little surprising events","Date":"5 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Time is flying for Dirty Harry and it shows on the screen. The action gets slightly faster, more intense and denser. Harry himself can play it slow because he is the contrasting element in the fast going picture he is the one who is bringing justice or at least some just injustice, or fair darkness if you prefer. His arrival on the last crime scene with a crime in the process of being committed is so reminiscent of so many other scenes of the type in so many films with Clint Eastwood, from spaghetti westerns to macaroni mafia films that we just stand at attention in front of the successful contrast the bull is entering the arena, the prima donna is starting her famous aria, the thundering flash of lightning of the supreme God in his heavenly palace is being cast onto the criminals . . . or the sinners.The main change here is that the central piece of the film is a woman who is reminiscing what happened to her (with pretty dark and horrifying rape flashbacks) and her sister ten years before a gangbang rape and she has decided to finally get her vengeance on the five guys who did it, one being the sheriff's son and the whole business was covered up at the time by the sheriff himself, probably to protect his son who of course when getting of age, that is passing over the 18 years of age limit, lost his mind and also his physical control. Life has a strange way to punish guilty people. One became a vegetable in a wheel chair and the others are getting killed one after another by the sister in the name of her vengeance, one bullets in the genitals and one in the head, with a little help from Dirty Harry in the name of fair justice that is not justice but is fair anyway and definitely faster and less risky as for the results. Never trust Miranda justice for real justice against real criminals who are so afraid of the cops that they always yield at the last minute when harry says Go ahead, make my day.But once again it is a systematic discourse on the police in modern America, at least in the 1980s in the film, but has it changed with profiling? One can doubt it, even if right now one of the great achievements of the New York Police Department is finding some kind of concluding episode for their arresting the Director of IMF with the trial of DSK in Lille for his not always so kosher love story or rather gangbang sexual adventures if not capers. The point with these films is that when you know the character and his logic there is no real surprise and it does not make one's day any more as it used to because it is so obvious that this or that is going to happen. One flimsy vision of the horn of a unicorn and we knew one of the gangbang rapists was going to end up impaled on it. Then the rest is only dressing up, and it is true the hot dog does not provide any surprise but the mustard may, since we can have hundreds of different mustards, and the acme of surprise would come if you put ketchup on your hot dog, which one of San Francisco's finiest does.I remember New York Central bus station one night when I ordered a hot dog at the bar or cafeteria, or whatever and the black waiter started enumerating all the possible dressings. I can tell you I did not understand half of them and took what I more or less understood. I guess it must have been mustard. Certainly not ketchup. But why not after all since Belgians have mayonnaise on top of their French fries and Poirot has crème de menthe with his cheese.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU "}{"Title":"The best of the Dirty Harry sequels","Date":"26 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" In the American popular imagination, few cops are more famous, some would say infamous, than Clint Eastwood's 'Dirty' Harry Callahan. His scowling visage, magnum revolver, and gritty one-liners are among the images most associated with the big city homicide detective. When kids play cops and robbers, he's the kind of cop they imagine themselves as. And why not? The film that introduced him remains one of the best, and certainly most iconic action thrillers of the twentieth century. And like any movie to enjoy such success, it spawned a good number of sequels. None were as good as the original, but some came fairly close, and none closer than Sudden Impact.That's not to say that Sudden Impact sticks the closest to the original formula. This is a great deal darker and more brooding than the previous entries in the series, and more violent. Not in the sense that there are more violent acts than in the earlier films; but that the acts themselves are more brutal. Besides the myriad shootings there's a part where Callahan punches a woman in the face, leaving her with a black eye and a bloody nose. There's an extended scene in which Callahan is kicked, stomped, and bludgeoned within an inch of his life. And there are multiple POV flashbacks to a gang rape that occurred years before. And the dividing line between good and bad, right and wrong, isn't nearly as clear cut this time around. Inspector Callahan has always been willing to go beyond the letter of the law to see the guilty punished, but giving an old man a heart attack at his granddaughters wedding is really something even by his standards, even if the guy was a mob boss and the main suspect in a brutal murder. It's a point where you have to stop and ask yourself, Has he gone too far this time?This same question is posed more strongly by the main storyline, which involves the victim of the aforementioned rape returning to gun down everyone involved. There's no question that what she's doing is cold blooded murder, or that it's Harry's job to stop her. But damned if she doesn't have a hell of a reason for wanting those people dead. And seeing how bitter and nasty some of them still are, it's hard not to sympathize with her. And it's inevitable that Harry will too.Although many would disagree, I also felt that the aftermath of the violence isn't handled as cleanly and flippantly as before. True, no time is lost morning the dead, and the department lets Harry off much more easily than any real PD would. Yet so much of the violence and death here is a direct result of earlier violence. Of the many attempts on Harry's life, two are because of what he did to that old man, and a third is largely the result of him losing his temper earlier. And if it hadn't been for what happened one night under a boardwalk, seven people, one of them completely innocent, would still be alive.Although the movie may not take the time to dwell on it, it seems that there's a cycle of violence underpinning the story. Every time someone kills or assaults someone, it begets further violence aimed at them, whether it's deserved or not. At the end there's finally an act of mercy and forgiveness, but even then I don't know if that was the right thing to do. I'm not sure that there was a right thing to do. And that's what I like about Sudden Impact. Though it may be composed of chases, shootouts, and one-liners, it's given me much to think about.

Well I see why they said that. Sudden Impact started off great and I loved it. But as it went on it son started to weaken. The plot is that Jennifer Spencer (Sandra Locke) is an art dealer, who was beaten along with her sister by some people in a small town outside of San Francisco. She is traumatized and goes out to seek revenge. Meanwhile Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is suspended for the normal reasons. Brutality, excessive force, the usual. Well Harry just happened to give an old crime lord a heart attack before he was suspended so now all the henchmen are coming after him. Of course he beats all of them but because the bosses have seemed to realize that Harry just can't go anywhere right now without ending up destroying something they put him on a case to that small town where Jennifer is killing off all her enemies. And if you thought that Harry got into fights in San Francisco, he did, but here every time he tries to say anything the locals get defensive. And because Harry can't do anything without making a smart remark he gets into fights with just about anyone. Sudden Impact I feel doesn't have the same qualities that were in the first 3 movies. It doesn't have a whole lot of action scenes after he leaves San Francisco. Another big problem with it is that it's just dark. I know the other films had dark bits (especially Dirty Harry) but they were still fun to watch. This just comes off as unpleasant. It's not a god-awful film and the acting here is pretty good, but I do believe that all the things about this movie being worse then the last 3 were probably right.

So getting up this morning at 500 AM to catch this one is going to go for the long haul. However watching these Dirty Harry pictures it's easy enough to figure out that they weren't really written with credibility in mind. Take the hapless hit-men out for revenge over the untimely death of their boss Threlkis (Michael V. Gazzo). Why bother trying to run Callahan (Eastwood) down with their car when they had all that heavy artillery on hand? Why not just maneuver up close and whack him on the spot with no fanfare? Seems simple enough, but no, three of the goons chase him into an alley and get blown away for being stupid, while the fourth one makes a getaway. Not to worry, he get's his later on.Or what about the three punks who throw the fireball into Harry's car? Harry manages to ride around town a few blocks with the vehicle a furnace, but a mere return lob of a similar fire bomb and the hoods drive off the pier and into the bay! Oh well, we're going back three decades now and films today that are written well generally don't offer these kinds of inconsistencies. What you have here is a classic revenge flick in which Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) and her sister were raped ten years earlier, leaving the younger sister catatonic and Jennifer out for blood. She's sort of a female Dirty Harry looking to cut through the B.S. of the court system and arrive at her own brand of justice. Pretty creatively too, those low shots are bound to hurt, at least momentarily.Interesting that Pat Hingle was the sheriff in this picture, he appeared on the side of the law in at least a couple of other Eastwood pictures - 1968's Hang 'Em High and 1977's The Gauntlet. His character here was somewhat distracting, fighting Harry at every turn instead of accepting his help. The twist with his apoplectic son Abby explained it later on, so I guess that angle made sense. Objectively speaking, Jennifer got away with murder after blowing away a handful of degenerates with Harry finding a way to make it stick.

The viewer knows who the killer is and why he/she is killing. Harry Callahan, for the most part, just mops up after the crimes.Clint Eastwood and Sandra Locke have little chemistry in this final joint effort.

But she's a female rape victim killing those who were never brought to justice for their crime against her and they're an array of utterly disgusting grotesques.In some ways this almost doesn't feel like a Dirty Harry film, he's practically a peripheral character and the action shifts from his normal hunting ground of San Francisco to a small tourist town on the coast. We also have an atypical firearm for him, dumping his venerable S&W 44. Magnum for a thudding great 44. Magnum Automag (because obviously his previous handgun just didn't hold enough bullets?).Some great stuff here, Harry's arrival as the avenging angel at the end is truly marvellous and here we get the famous 'Make my day' line which whilst synonymous with Dirty Harry/Clint Eastwood you don't normally associate with this film. Unfortunately plenty of bad stuff. The Mafia hood's constant attempts to kill Harry get tired fast and we never know why the contract is called off (funny while the wedding scene is). It beggars belief that the gang of junkies who attack Harry in his car don't have guns and the Horace and Meathead subplot really doesn't work. The ending is ambiguous, contrary to his actions in Magnum Force Harry let's the vigilante away with it in the end. Perhaps because she is acting for personal revenge rather than from ideological conviction? Do we want to hand out the death penalty for rape? Sure the police chief covered things up but do we ever know if the girls made any allegations?Still watchable but they should have left it here.

The result is slow moving, boring and about as far removed from the original Dirty Harry as possible. A dull coastal town setting, a comedic flatulent dog and Lalo Schifrin's languorous score don't exactly help matters much. In fact, the only really memorable thing about the whole film is Eastwood's catchphrase 'Go ahead punk, make my day&#x85;', which would become synonymous with the character and often mistaken as coming from the original movie. "}{"Title":"The Dirtiest Harry","Date":"18 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Insp. Dirty Harry Callahan returns in the darkest and dirtiest of the Dirty Harry's. It's amazing that the inspector's kept his job all these years&#x97;more importantly his life. By now it's not a job but a lifestyle.The fourth installment begs to stand alone with a gritty revenge story and visually dark cinematography that separates it from the rest. It is also the first in the series directed by Clint Eastwood, who also starred and produced. Eastwood's learned some things from past influencers, notably Don Siegel and Sergio Leone. With Eastwood in the director's chair he's transcended the exploitative darkness of Siegel's first film and honored Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. Simultaneously he's drawn closer than ever to his Dirty Harry character.The film is driven by two plots with two characters, Harry Callahan and Jennifer Spencer. The actors were a real life couple, which adds some underlying chemistry&#x97;if not tension&#x97;between them. The first hour follows the routine Dirty Harry outline. The loose cannon cop stumbles in and out of homicides, angers his superiors and gets sugar with his morning coffee all in a day's work. Eastwood is so confident in his direction of the character that the one-liners seem natural; permissible. The greatest is the iconic coffee shop scene; impossible not to quote so I'll go ahead, make my day. For some people this one overlapped the memorable quote from the first movie. Some even confuse the two.Callahan's reputation starts a death toll so his superiors drive him out to San Paulo to investigate a homicide lead. Unbeknownst to him, the killer is artist Jennifer Spencer, a beautiful but heavily scarred woman exacting revenge on scummy town locals who raped her and her sister ten years ago. Callahan doesn't know this while we know it, but it's compelling to watch Spencer unveil her tirade. The last twenty minutes are every woman's nightmare. Then Callahan comes along and rescues the woman from the train tracks&#x97;literally.Sudden Impact is an indelible installment so sure of its violence and characters that it almost stands on two legs. If it wasn't battered down by a franchise it might've been allowed to play it for drama rather than action. But this is a Dirty Harry film. It'll make your day. "},{"Title":"shoot em' dead Clint","Date":"30 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Sudden Impact is my favorite Dirty Harry movie. It's also my favorite Clint Eastwood movie. The movie solely relies on it's simple plot of revenge. Vengeance seeking Locke goes after a nasty bunch of San Pedro folk, including a lesbian, who raped her and her younger sister, years prior, under the boardwalk. We see this in a few short and sufficient flashbacks. Sadly her younger sister now resides in a mental facility, hence Locke's motive for blowing these scum away. Her motiss operendi is great. She blows them once in the genitals, then the head, a fitting justice, wouldn't you say. Put Harry Callahan on the case. Before arriving on the first crime scene, he shakes up a young punk in an elevator, who we all know is guilty, after this case is thrown out of caught. Not a good start for Harry. Again the guilty go free, something that doesn't digest well with Harry. Speaking of digestion, the next scene which saw the birth of that legendary line Go ahead, make my day, has Harry shooting four out of five guys who hold up this diner. If it wasn't for the waitress drowning his coffee with sugar, he would of still gone about his day. What's funny is she's almost in his face, while pouring the sugar, and he, this non sugar drinker doesn't notice it. C'mon. Then there's this old mafia guy, another example of justice sucking. Harry goes to this scumbag's daughter's wedding, to purposely induce the guy into a heart attack, even getting the reception lady to call an ambulance before he does. Surviving two more murder attempts (I don't know how you do it Harry) one, from other mafia figures, another from those scumbags at the court house who try to burn him alive in a car, for his own protection, and to lift the big headache he's giving the department, he's sent to good ol' San Paulo on the revenge case. There he butts heads with the chief. His son, now in a vegetative state, just happened to be one of the hoods, the less participating, in Locke and her sister's rape. Swamped with guilt he drove himself into a brick wall, hence his state. I didn't think he really deserved to die, the others yes. And San Paulo being such a small city, who should Clint run into? Angry artist Locke. They form a relationship, their sex scene is about non erotic as you could get. It almost ceases to exist as part of the movie. So those walls are set to close in. About the violence It's kept pretty minimum. There's just the one moderate scene, with a close up of Victim one's bloodied hands over his less bloodied, shown testicles, as he bought it in his car at a lookout point, over the bay of San Francisco. We see that one of Clint's Cronies working the crime scene, has a strong stomach, when chowing down a hot dog. The showdown with it's effective score, has the perfect setting, an amusement park, where that favorite line's uttered again. Eastwood is in fine form. A standout, is Paul Drake (what the hell happened to this actor) great as the main hood, looking and smelling of immorality. He gives his character that perfect flavor it deserves. There are another couple of goof ups in the movie, but I will just dismiss it all, for this is great entertainment where you'll be rooting for Locke, lady avenger. There's not one boring scene in Sudden Impact and the much deserved justice for all in the end, will leave you more than appeased and send hearts a cheer. And then we have Roberta Flacks song, This side and forever as a fine finish. Another is the up tempo music score at the movie's start.

Suddenly, under a blinding spotlight, a tall and thin silhouette prolonged by a gigantic gun, makes an unforgettable apparition. This is Harry Callahan, and it's only a matter of minutes, before justice is done.Clint Eastwood directed the film and it shows all through the film. No one but Eastwood could be so aware of Harry's iconic status and provide viewers such a heart-pounding confrontation with the villains. It's obvious that the climactic scene and this defining shot were designed to have that impact on the audience but no matter how deliberate the effect is, how late in the film it comes, it makes the whole movie work. Eastwood handles the material of the original movie with much more confidence than the directors of the second and third opus, because he grabs the essence of the series the plot hardly matters, it's all about the confrontation, it's all about Harry and the villains, and if we take the last sequence of the film, it's exactly the same caliber of the first film violent, dark and gripping.For example, it's obvious that Clint Eastwood didn't embarrass himself with comedy like in The Enforcer or some political statements explicitly exposed like in Magnum Force, not that they undermined the enjoyment of the other films but they were necessary to compensate the lack of charismatic and memorable villains. But Sudden Impact goes back to the roots of the series, to the very ingredients that makes it so enthralling. At the end, the only ways it indulges itself to some social commentary about the judicial system occurs in the trial scene, and the only elements of comedy are familiar to the fans, through the good old meetings with the superiors, when he can't help throwing a wisecracking comment between his clenched teeth.There is another moment rarely discussed, when he confronts a Mafia boss on the day of his daughter's wedding. Michael V. Gazzo (who played Frank Pentangeli in The Godfather Part II) plays a sort of Vito Corleone-like character, and after a brief exchange full of verbal acidity, Harry causes him to suffer from a lethal heart attack. We ought to believe that the guy was a dirty man who molested an innocent prostitute, but all we see is Harry literally killing someone with words, and it's done in a way that doesn't necessarily help us to root for him. His cruelty exceeds his good intentions and never since the first Dirty Harry, had he deserved his nickname. I insist on that scene, because it's a masterstroke of writing, it reminds of how borderline can Harry get in the name of justice, and how he's indeed one of the greatest antiheroes that ever graced the screen.And that's it, the more I feel that Sudden Impact ends in a terrific way, the more bothered I am by some little flaws that don't actually ruin the film but give it a sort of 'could have been better' flavor. And my principal issue with the film is the villain. Harry Callahan investigates a series of murders following the same modus operandi; a mysterious woman, played by Sondra Locke, shoots men in the groin and the head. The film goes on deeply on the trauma that affected Locke and her sister, they were lead by a friend, a lesbian played by a scene- stealing Audrie Neenan, to a party where they were they brutally assaulted by a bunch of thugs. Locke's character is a lesbian, although it doesn't affect the story but it emphasizes the perversity of the act. Ironically, Neenan's character, the only woman, who didn't took part to the rape strikes as the most twisted, and villainously charismatic of the bunch.Anyways, Locke's sister ended up in a catatonic state, and as we'd have expected, justice has failed because one of the rapist was 'covered'. Justice had to be done, fine. The problem with that subplot, although well-made and well-developed, but it provides some extenuating circumstances to the character who was supposed to be the villain. It's an interesting twist that for the first time, we empathize with the villain, but it weakens the kind of confrontation we expect in a Dirty Harry film. As much as I loved the climactic shootout, there's a constant feeling that the rapists became the film's last-minute antagonists, but in no way could match Harry Callahan, not the way he was magnificently played by Eastwood. The 'Callahan' of Sudden Impact needed a villain, in the same vein of psychopathy as Scorpio. Damn, would there ever be another Scorpio?Maybe the film took its inspiration from Abel Ferrara's Ms. 45, the last vigilante masterpiece, when a young woman was avenging her rape by killing every man who could be a potential rapist. It could have been better if Locke's character was more of a character blindly applying her vengeance on innocent men. But well, it could have been worse imagine a romantic subplot between Eastwood and Locke. But it was more of a philosophical affinity, for the first time he met a woman who had the same opinion about the way justice should be applied. It's not as far-fetched as William Munny who had tot kill two guys because one of them beat a whore, but I'm sure, there was a premonition of Unforgiven in Sudden Impact.Sudden Impact is the best Harry film since the original, and on its own, a great thriller. Calling it a sequel is almost belittling, seriously, which sequel could have provided an iconic line like Go ahead. Make my day? Creating a national catchphrase after three movies, this says a lot about how iconic Harry Callahan is and how damn right Eastwood was to make a fourth film.

I will say this sequels are just not as good a the original ever. In Sudden Impact Dirty Harry is back, but this time he's in San Paolo. He is forced to take a break from the SFPD, even though he hates vacations this one is a matter of keeping his job.Once in San Paolo he is still dodging looking over his shoulder do to his incident which happened in San Francisco. Once there he foils a robbery, comes in contact with a four legged buddy named Meat Head. A gift from his friend Horace. Then he meets an artist, forgive me forget her character's name; but she's played by Sandra Locke.The movie is about an artist who is out for revenge over those that raped, tormented, and brutalized her and her sister. The trauma is so bad on her sister, she is hospitalized. She visits her sister and explains what she did in San Francisco, by killing one of her attacker's. Once leaving the hospital she goes to a gallery where he work is being shown. She tells the gallery organizer she is going to take a trip down to San Paolo.Once in San Paolo Harry discovers the first victim is from there and begins to put 2 and to together. After the first killing a 2nd is soon to follow. He meets Sandra Locke and they become acquainted, at this point he doesn't know who could be killer. He talks to a officer and finds out the victims are a well acquainted with the Chief of San Paolo. Harry starts putting the puzzle together and finds out what he thought after he saw Sandra car at Ray's one night.Sandra character is out for revenge and she gets it and with Harry's help she beats the rap. If you like Dirty Harry films you will probably like this one; even though I thought it could have better. I hope this review helps in your choice.Kris L.

It's all about watching the coolest anti-hero in Hollywood dispense a succession of no-good punks with his 44 magnum, and of course deliver his trademark glares and quips. 'Sudden Impact' has plenty of action, plenty of thousand yard stares from the great man, and of course gives us some suitably bad-ass quotes which have entered popular culture.That's the long and short of it. If you like Eastwood and lots of shootouts, then you'll enjoy it. If not, then you shouldn't watch it, but you probably knew that already. 'Sudden Impact' is exactly what all films of its niche should be. Unpretentious, and aimed squarely at its fans, who want to see Clint put those punks in their place.

I think the main problem on why this wasn't as special as its first three predecessors, was it went a bit too far over the line, and the fact that I had trouble sympathizing with anyone. Sondra Locke's character is often just as despicable as the rapist's by pulling what she is, and the fact that her character is very hard to like, because of her attitude. Most of the time I enjoy revenge movies, I enjoy seeing them get it in the worst ways, but the person that was doing it, I didn't feel that same excitement because I didn't like her character. The finale is pretty exciting stuff, with Harry tracking down the rapist's, it definitely delivers on that part. While I enjoyed this movie, I didn't feel the excitement, the thrills, the suspense or that great gritty feel that I always love to see while watching this series.Performances. Clint Eastwood isn't bad, but he seems unsure on what to do here in this movie. It's not entirely his fault, it's the way they set him up in this one, and at times I didn't feel he was the main focal point. Sandra Locke is very wooden, and I couldn't stand her character. Her chemistry with Eastwood is non-existent as well. Pat Hingle known for his roles in The original Batman movies, is great in his role as a somewhat shady Chief. Bradford Dillman plays his part well as Briggs once again, bigger prick then ever!. Audrie Neenan plays a despicable b*tch to a T, very chilling stuff. Paul Drake is pretty creepy as the main rapist, you will despise him.Bottom line. Not memorable like the 1st three, and a bit too violent for its own good, but it's still an entertaining watch.

Deadpool was a bit weak in areas too, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the great line of Go ahead, make my day. This one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong. Just think Magnum Force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. Granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park. It also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in so many of his movies. She brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. Granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds? Still, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies.

Two sequels followed, the first of which, Magnum Force, tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences. The second sequel, The Enforcer was grittier again, and was promoted as the dirtiest Harry of them all. This title, however, truly belongs to the fourth film in the series, Clint Eastwood's own Sudden Impact, which is doubtlessly the grittiest, nastiest, most violent and downright dirtiest of all Harry films, and, in my humble opinion, the second-best after the masterpiece original.***Warning! SPOILERS ahead!*** In a small town near San Francisco, a mysterious sexy lady (Sondra Locke) lures men into being alone with her. What these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim, longing for bloody revenge. As fate wants it, San Francisco's toughest cop, Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan, who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors, spends his leisure time in this exact little town... Sudden Impact is the dirtiest Callahan film in several aspects. The film is extremely gritty and graphically violent. Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever. Not afraid to make use of his 44. Magnum in order to stop trouble, Harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion. Clint Eastwood is, as always, brilliant in the role of Harry Callahan. Eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy, and he did so again in the Dirty Harry films. Sudden Impact gives us the dirtiest Harry we have ever seen. Eastwood's real-life girlfriend Sondra Locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty. The great Pat Hingle, who had already worked with Eastwood in Ted Post's tough-minded Western Hang 'Em High in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town. The film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters, including a pathetic criminal played by Kevin Major Howard (best known for his role in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket) and a woman named Ray Perkins (Audrie J. Neenan), doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema. Albert Popwell, who played the bank robber in the famous Do You Feel Lucky? scene in Dirty Harry and the black militant leader in The Enforcer is also part of this one again, this time as Harry's colleague and buddy. Overall Sudden Impact is the grittiest, dirtiest and probably the most violent of all Dirty Harry films, (though The Dead Pool isn't exactly tame either), and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original. An absolute must-see for Callahan fans, and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery.

"},{"Title":"Self-Defence with Extreme Prejudice","Date":"27 November 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Sudden Impact was the fourth of the five films which starred Clint Eastwood as Inspector Harry Callahan, and the only one which he directed himself. The Dirty Harry films have always been controversial; they have been both criticised and praised for importing the Wild West ethos of revenge and vigilante justice into a modern-day urban setting. (One can see something of the Wild West ethos in other tough cop films from this period, such as Coogan's Bluff, which also starred Eastwood, and the John Wayne vehicle Brannigan).Magnum Force, the second episode in the franchise, seems to have been intended as a sort of public apology to those liberals who criticised the original Dirty Harry as advocating the use of violent and uncompromising methods of policing. Callahan the gung-ho maverick became Clean Harry, the unlikely advocate of due process and the sworn opponent of those who would take the law into their own hands, in that case a gang of renegade cops who had taken to gunning down criminals in cold blood. Sudden Impact reverses this moral position and Harry here becomes the ally rather than the opponent of vigilantism.In this case, however, the vigilante is not a cop but a young woman, Jennifer Spencer. Some years ago Jennifer and her sister Elizabeth were the victims of a brutal gang rape which left Elizabeth in a coma. The perpetrators were never brought to justice; we later learn that this is because they are being shielded by the local police chief whose son was one of those involved. Jennifer has sworn revenge on the rapists and one by one they die violent deaths at her hands.This being a Dirty Harry film, Jennifer is not the only one dealing out violent death. Inspector Callahan also gets in on the act. Much of the early part of the film is taken up with the running feud between Harry and the criminal fraternity of San Francisco, several of whose members end up being shot by him. Although all these killings could be justified legally as self-defence, Harry seems to relish putting himself in positions where he is forced to defend himself, even taunting one robber into attacking him with the words Go ahead, make my day. (This line was voted number 6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest movie quotes, although many people mistakenly attribute it to the first Dirty Harry film).Harry's taste for self-defence with extreme prejudice is not to the liking of his superiors, and he is transferred from the San Francisco force to the small town of San Paulo, which just happens to be where Jennifer is conducting her killing spree. (Incidentally, the name San Paulo is a hybrid of Spanish and Portuguese; the Spanish for St Paul would be San Pablo, which is the name of an actual town in northern California). Harry is assigned to the case, but when he finds out who the culprit is, and what her motives are, he seems strangely reluctant to arrest her.Sudden Impact is quite well-made, certainly better than the final Dirty Harry film, The Dead Pool, which veers uneasily between a straightforward cop thriller and a self-parody. The action sequences are well handled and Eastwood plays Harry with his normal cool self-assurance. Although it is not up to the standards of the first film, which asked some surprisingly deep questions about the philosophy of law enforcement, it is, seen purely as a piece of film-making, on a level with Magnum Force. Nevertheless, I was uneasy about its political stance; its apparent advocacy of vigilante justice means that it has to lose at least one star. 5/10 "}{"Title":"Full-on action","Date":"6 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline Dirty Harry is at it again. Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy. Sudden Impact retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful- tight pacing, a compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor. Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest, bloodiest, and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise.The plot is somewhat intriguing after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums, Inspector Callahan is sent on a forced vacation by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of San Paolo. He is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his (no doubt considerable) misery by a second shot to the head. Early on in the film, the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier. This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback, snippets of which recur before each new murder. As more bodies start to appear with the same M.O, it becomes clear to Harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest (guess who?) know more than they are telling. To make matters even more complicated, the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard.Sudden Impact offers relentless action from beginning to end. Clint Eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax. Sondra Locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character. That having been said, it is fair to wonder if another actress (who was not Eastwood's off-screen companion at the time) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- Theresa Russell and Cybill Shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates. Members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include Albert Popwell as Harry's partner Horace, Paul Drake as the psychopathic Mick, and the truly scene-stealing Audrie J. Neenan who portrays the vicious Ray Parkins. However the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots (the animosity between Harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums, a Mob vendetta against him) take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story. Their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels. In the first half of the film it sometimes appears that Dirty Harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom. However the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between Callahan, Spencer, and her former tormentors assumes prominence. This second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given Sudden Impact the potential to be a first-class, neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the Harry loyalists. Instead we get the film that Eastwood and Warner Bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical Eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience. This was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why. Though not the film that it could have been, this is still big, trigger-happy fun. Even after repeated viewings, it's going to make your day. "},{"Title":"Surprisingly good","Date":"7 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. Forget the Go ahead punk, make my day scene, that's iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.

Sondra Locke is stunning in her portrayal of a rape victim hellbent on revenge. Looks like Clint was able to bring out the best in her while they were together, seeing as how he directed this installment in the DIRTY HARRY series. And I loved that bulldog he had.

He is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.From what I have seen in movies in which Eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black heart, he is the crazy director, in in the Line of Fire he is the Old 'un while here is the almost jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the no non-sense movie watchers. The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. Also, there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry.

It moves along at a brisk pace with almost every scene involving Clint Eastwood thwarting some kind of crime. Sondra Locke is good as a vengeful woman whose path crosses Eastwood's. The villains are suitably creepy although a little overboard and comic bookish. This is definitely a guy's testosterone film. The formula is simple. Eastwood vs. the bad guys. That's all it is, but it works. There are some weaknesses, notably the over the top acting of the redheaded trailer trash and some of the villains are just too slimy. Not as good as the original Dirty Harry but probably the second best in the series.

Just as Magnum Force was quite different in feel and plot to Dirty Harry and attempted a few new things,Sudden Impact is the same in relation to the third film The Enforcer which,whilst good fun,was really just a rehash.It's really a film of two parts. The first part is almost a parody of all the tried and tested Dirty Harry elements-Harry's controversial police work in one scene he threatens an aging mafia don at his daughter's wedding,only for the guy to have a heart attack!,his telling off by his superiors,his threats,his seeming invincibility he seems to dispose of more baddies in the first half of this film than in all the others put together,etc. The writers are astute enough to suggest that Harry is a bit out of place-someone calls him a 'dinosaur'. The action is almost constant.Around half way the film changes and becomes a much darker and more serious work. The pace becomes a lot slower and there is a moody,almost film noir feel. The Harry films always have taken place a great deal in darkness,but this one is especially notable in that respect. Clint Eastwood is well respected as a director these days but he was a fine director before,the use of shadows and darkness in this film is very effective,as is Sandra Locke's somewhat haunted look and presence in this film. A flashback scene of a rape is also very good,lots of quick cuts and nothing too graphic,but we get an idea of the horror. We are presented with Harry's most interesting opponent,a woman who is killing off those who raped her and her now paralysed sister. The 'romance' if it can be called that between the two is interesting and oddly touching,and it looks as if Harry's attitude to violence and justice is really going to be tested.Except it isn't. The climax piles on the violence and we are treated to one of Eastwood's finest 'resurrection' bits quite a few films of his have him almost killed and than coming back almost from the grave to take revenge. However,the expected confrontation between Eastwood and Sandra Locke's character doesn't occur and the film takes the easy way out. A shame.There seems to be more borrowing from other films in this one,for instance the carousel from Strangers on a Train,the avenging rape victim from Angel of Vengeance and lots of other films,even the end scene is reminiscent of Casablanca. It's also a touch disturbing how Eastwood always seemed to have Locke for a while his wife raped and/or brutalized in his films think The Gauntlet,The Outlaw Josey Wales,Bronco Billy. Nonetheless,Sudden Impact is an intriguing if not entirely successful entry in the Dirty Harry series,and it's the one which gave the world go ahead,make my day.

The premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame. This plot would have been better for the Enforcer, which actually would have made it a good movie.

The one which is a thin parody of Harry Callahan? I'm now less convinced that McGarnagle is a parody, and more convinced that it was a discarded script of this movie which the Simpsons creators used. Sudden Impact is so stupid that its funny. Most bad action films are just boring - A Walk Among the Tombstones comes to mind. But Sudden Impact is just so cartoonish and stupid that I burst out laughing every few minutes. This film has every single cliché that I didn't think was actually a thing that ever exists. The small town cop who shouts at Callahan we don't need big city folks telling us how to do our jobs. The threats to back off or I'll have you locked up!. Mandatory vacations for cops who are too badass. The constant references to vague authority figures who are climbing up my ass says a generic slightly lower authority figure. This film's screenplay is actually hilarious. Harry goes to the beach to a crime scene, where a big deal is made of the fact that the inspector goes there himself. The inspector demands to know what happened at Harry's hotel room (Harry gunned down a would-be assassin), like Harry broke a lamp or something. It'd be funny if they hadn't just made a big deal of the fact that this is a dead body. Sudden Impact has no story arc for Harry - its just a series of scenes where nameless henchmen try to kill him and he survives with increasingly comedic implausibility. Seriously - there are like 5 attempts on his life in 30 minutes. Each time, he dispatches them and carries on his business - walking his dog (which has several sex changes throughout the movie), irritating his boss, practising his shooting, etc. Cut into these inane sequences is the story of Jennifer Spencer (an extremely dull Sondra Locke) who is seeking out and murdering all of her rapists. At one point, Eastwood (who is behind the camera as director, would you believe it) accidentally inspires the Kill Bill revenge flashes with a scene that only highlights how much better Tarantino did it 20 years later. Spencer is such a boring character - her chemistry with Eastwood is non-existent and the final struggle with Head Rapist is just motions while we wait for Harry to show up.Eastwood is one of my favourite directors but there are some dreadful shots that should never have gotten through here. An old lady yanks a sniper rifle out from the counter to threaten Harry, who is assaulting witnesses to gain testimony (seriously?) Several various people are shot in the head and noticeably still breathing as their actors incompetently go through their death scenes. And in the film's most ludicrous scene, Harry drives a burning car along the pier, looking at the flames as if they are a minor irritation, before parking, exiting, reaching back into the flames and throwing a molotov at the attackers, who are all killed.This movie would have been more plausible if Harry was revealed to be a T-1000.

It then leads to a string of crimes where Callahan is lead to investigate. And, in the middle of it all, there again are these random unrelated crimes foiled by Callahan, which showcases his strength and witty, acidic attitude and kept the film exciting; among my favorites is the coffee shop scene, where I think Callahan displays some of his funniest yet most action-packed gun totting moves. His unorthodox ways of dealing these criminals continue to be the highlight of the series.The plot elements are suspenseful and Clint Eastwood as director kept the movie's pace interesting and attention grabbing. I like the fact that the movie has more action and thrill-oriented scenes than the previous film and as more satisfying moments - you get to see more of these criminals get a taste of their own medicine. Bradford Dillman plays Callahan's superior again, but for some reason his name is Captain Briggs instead of Captain McKay as in the previous film. Either way, he's the same annoying and arrogant lieutenant who throws the rulebook at Callahan once again. But, thankfully, he's not in the film much at all.Clint Eastwood stayed true to his form as Callahan and had some good chemistry with Sandra Locke - great acting all together.

In this one, Eastwood's character meets his match by trying to solve a series of murders done by a revenge-laden woman, played by Sandra Locke, who had been raped along with her sister many years back. The sister was basically turned into an invalid and she took it upon herself to rid the world of those who did this. The first half of the movie just repeats the same old Dirty Harry character shtick(the cop not respected for his efforts but instead looked down upon for leaving dead bodies around and making messes of the city). The last half does a better job of developing the Sandra Locke character and keeps you interested. There is very little humor except for a couple scenes with his new bulldog partner affectionately called Meathead that was given to him by a buddy cop to keep him company. He carries around his typical big gun and uses a couple of canned one-liners but this doesn't make for a whole movie and Eastwood to me looked a little tired of his character in this one.

And, for the first half hour at least, Sudden Impact promises to be the best Dirty Harry movie since Don Siegel's brilliant 1971 original.We get to see Harry deliver some hilarious put-downs to a group of thugs (or punks as he hisses at them) who are taunting him in an elevator after being acquitted in court. There is finally a line of dialogue to match the Do I feel lucky? line from the first movie. It's the classic Go ahead...make my day. And Harry gets a cool, new Magnum pistol, a weapon even more powerful that his Magnum .44 (why he'd want a weapon more powerful than that is anyone's guess. Maybe it's because he's after a group of baddies this time instead of one like Scorpio or maybe Clint was getting a lot of money from the Magnum gun company for product placement.) He keeps it in a special presentation box, but, when the villains sink to new lows, Harry's eye begins twitching in the direction of his new gun and...well, you can guess what happens next! Once Harry is sent on vacation and gets mixed up in a rape revenge plot involving Sondra Locke, the film nosedives and never recovers (although Harry does acquire a charming, farting bulldog called Meathead). The gang-rape scenes are repeated over and over in flashbacks and they seem to go on forever and Eastwood really goes too far as a director with it all. He has directed much better movies than this one and I don't think Sudden Impact would be in his top ten somehow.The baddies in this film are just a bunch of leering, wild-eyed psychos with none of the complexity of the Scorpio killer from the first film. Perhaps this is to make the audience not care about them as they are castrated by bullet and then murdered. (There is a particularly grotesque foul-mouthed, butch lesbian character among the group of rapists who is like something out of a John Waters movie. It's a relief when her character isn't around).Harry has clearly changed his mind about vigilante justice from the days of Magnum Force ten years earlier. In that film, he refused to join a cabal of vigilante cops with the line I'm afraid you've misjudged me. In this film, Harry Callahan is essentially an accomplice to a vigilante killer and an accessory to murder. The film has the dodgy moral message that it's okay to be a vigilante if the crime you're avenging is bad enough. Harry is reduced to being a clone of the Charles Bronson character from the Death Wish movies, mowing down villains by the truckload. The script never questions the actions of the Sondra Locke character who is presented as a sort of feminist martyr.The rape revenge story was not a Dirty Harry script when it started out and Eastwood tried to fashion it into one and it doesn't work (perhaps Clint just wanted to make a Dirty Harry movie with Sondra Locke, God knows she was in every other film he'd made for almost ten years by that stage). The Sudden Impact script does not have the razor-sharp focus that the first film had from start to finish and it's frustrating that they came so close to matching it and gave up.The film gets increasingly ridiculous and nasty as it goes on until it just peters out. You are kind of glad when its over as its a little embarrassing for all concerned. No wonder Clint doesn't want to make anymore Dirty Harry films, he's gone as far as he can with the character of Harry Callahan.

There he uncovers a series of killings which seem to be linked to the rape of two sisters several years before.The fourth Dirty Harry movie is easily the weakest of the five (and arguably Eastwood's worst movie in general) and oddly enough the only one he directed himself. The problem is the script by Joseph Stinson, which is a pretty turgid rape-revenge drama that coats everything in blunt right-wing vigilante politics; Harry shoots ethnic minorities, Harry doesn't follow proper procedure, Harry condones revenge killings, Harry knows what's decent. In the original film, Harry's flaws (not least his sadism) are explored objectively and at the end of the story he loses his livelihood. In this movie, made at the height of Reagan republicanism, Harry is a perfect all-American hero, ridding the streets of scum without any moral questions raised. It's a very weak story, which is too long, too predictable and very unimaginative, and the characters range from clichéd to loathsome - Drake and Neenan in particular are among the most nauseating and banal people you'd never want to meet. The movie has some good points though - there is a fantastic rock-jazz score by Lalo Schifrin which almost single-handedly creates some drama and saves the film, and the photography by Robert Surtees is top-notch dark cop thriller work. Whilst none of the performances are good, there are lots of connections with other Eastwood pictures here. Locke (Eastwood's girlfriend at the time) and Hingle sort-of reprise their characters from The Gauntlet. Dillman effectively replays his role from The Enforcer and Currie went on to play the same role in The Dead Pool. Popwell has the distinction of being in all three previous Dirty Harry movies (as a bank robber, a pimp and a black activist leader), and don't miss Corday's brief role as a waitress; she was the heroine of the classic 1955 monster movie Tarantula, which also featured a very young Eastwood. Don't get me wrong, I like old Harry and his anachronistic frontier sensibility, but this movie is pitched at an intellectual level somewhere between yokel and moron, so skip it. It did give rise to one of cinema's most memorable catchphrases though, as Eastwood points his big IL' forty-four magnum at a goon and whispers, Go ahead, make my day..

Here harry is allowed to make a long expositional speech and then draw his gun while the baddies just watch him. Compare this to the vivid originality of Dirty Harry.Another poor scene is when the freed criminals come after Harry. They hurl Molotov cocktails into his car. This could have been good or even great, but is directed with all the skill of a TV movie.Then there's the comedy dog.Harry ends up going to a small town with the cliché ridden small town sheriff issuing such statements, straight off the bat, as I don't like you, Callaghan! He then runs into Sondra Locke, unlikeable as always. It does not help that Ms Locke is a feeble actress and this is among her worst performances.One objectionable point is the subtext. The Sondra Locke character is clearly psychotic, yet we are asked to identify with her. What legal steps she has taken to get justice remains vague; instead she is allowed to brutally execute her attackers. All the men are depicted as savages and it is particularly distasteful that they are all genitally destroyed before being killed. This fate does not befall the 'dyke' who is merely shot in the heart.Yet Harry seems easy with this. This is a flat contradiction of Dirty Harry's character in earlier films.

It was produced and directed by Eastwood himself. Although his directorial skill is not in question, as he had already directed numerous films, his judgement was deeply flawed. He seems to have a weird streak, and is prepared to indulge in depictions of sadistic rape scenes and the over-the-top and almost comically exaggerated ravings of psychopaths with apparent glee. The purported justification of all of this, and the underlying reason for the mass popularity of the Dirty Harry films, is that Inspector Harry Callaghan ('Dirty Harry') of the San Francisco Police is someone who will give criminals the justice that the bleeding-heart liberal judges and district attorneys will not. He shoots the bastards. And he does it continuously, never stopping, through all the Dirty Harry films, resulting in a huge body count of hoodlums and thugs. That's what the public secretly wishes someone would do, just shoot them and then we would be rid of the vermin. But using this pretext of the cop who hates crooks and wants to kill them, Eastwood then indulges in gratuitous depictions of the horrible crimes he wishes to avenge, and the horrible criminals he wishes to eliminate, which merely means that the viewers are drenched in despicable and evil images of revolting people and things, so that the films become essentially unwatchable. This is the worst and most revolting of the five Dirty Harry films. The fifth and final one, THE DEAD POOL (1988, see my review) was mercifully the last. In this film Sondra Locke plays a grim-faced murderess. This certainly did not do her career any good. She looks so convincingly grim that one does not wish to run to the cinema to see her again. What a far cry from her charming first film appearance in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER (1968) and her many other excellent performances. Maybe part of the grimness was the realization that Clint and she were becoming estranged. This film is thus from more than one point of view too painful to watch, though I sat through it, more fool me.

Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good, and it's got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good. In Diry Harry it's ..Well do ya, punk?; in Magnum Force A man's got to know his limitations ; and in this it's Go ahead. Make my day. Also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery, as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series.

However, the murderer in this movie is Clint Eastwood's annoying off-screen (and at times on-screen) girlfriend Sandra Locke.

This movie depicts a police and justice system that isn't working. Criminals are thumbing their noses at the system and Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) in particular. He has his own ideas about how to proceed against the politically-induced constraints. Oddly enough, so does Sondra Locke, who wants justice in the form of punishment for those who raped her and her sister 10 years earlier and weren't punished. Her method involves two bullets per perpetrator one below the groin and one in the head. For his boldness in shooting criminals in a holdup, Harry is banished to a small seaside jurisdiction run by Pat Hingle in which the rapists and their associated tough dyke leader (played by Audrie Neenan) reside. So, when Locke shows up, their paths cross both personally and professionally. The outcome is interesting.This story has plenty of action. Eastwood is at his best.

I didn't know much about it except that it was a crime thriller directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. The film had me glued to the screen from the very first sequence and just when you think it might be just another typical thriller it takes you to a different level. Yes, the story is that of a revenge thriller where a victim becomes a vigilante and bumps off her assailant one by one while the police are in chaos, trying to find out who this killer on the loose is. Meanwhile, for Harry, things are getting worse at work and his own life is at risk but with the help of Chief, he is determined to get to the bottom of this.Unlike the conventional Hollywood thriller which would either focus on this one has plenty of depth. Eastwood's Harry is frustrated because criminals are getting away with crimes right under his nose and he is helpless. Sondra Locke's tough Jennifer has waited all these years to avenge her rape and that of her sister while her traumatized sister remains in a catatonic state. Yet, her eye wells up when Jennifer admits to her what she had done.Clintwood's direction is solid. He certainly knows how to draw his viewers into a film. There's plenty of energy. The action sequences are very well shot. The rape scenes are disturbing to look at yet they depicted sensibly without being gratuitous or too explicit. The score, sound effects and cinematography are first rate.Clint Eastwood reprises his role as Harry and he is terrific. Sondra Locke performs with guns blazing. She is excellently restrained and simply amazing in her part. Pat Hingle is brilliant. The actors playing the villains do a good job too as I actually found myself really hating the characters.On the surface 'Sudden Impact' may look like your average thriller but don't be deceived by that because it's much better.

Gazzo causing him to have a heart attack and depart this mortal coil suddenly. It's decided to send him to the small coastal town of San Paulo on a case where some similar patterns have occurred.We know right away that it's Sondra Locke who is going around committing these homicides, including one in San Francisco that got Clint assigned to San Paulo in the first place. What we don't know is what Clint is going to do about it because her attitudes about criminals getting away with their crimes is the same as is. Only she's not a cop.Some of the same issues were faced in the second Dirty Harry film Magnum Force, but the results here are different. Believe me Locke has plenty of good reason to want these several people dead.Eastwood and Locke were involved at the time Sudden Impact was made. Normally Clint is the whole show in the Dirty Harry films, but Locke is given several good scenes by director Eastwood in Sudden Impact.As for the ending, let's say that the ending might well have been inspired by Agatha Christie's Murder On The Orient Express.

This one was not really intended to be made as Eastwood seemed to to have left the iconic cop in the 70s. But, he effectively re-vitalized the great character in this fine sequel. Generally, I think that most sequels are not very good and formulaically either copy too heavily from the original (see any of the DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON sequels!) or go in the wrong direction trying to be so different from the original that in their presentation they strip away all that made the original film so great (see ALIENS and T2!). Doesn't matter to me that most of those sequels I mentioned made tons of money, they don't appeal to me as films and are failures to me where it truly counts.Somehow, some way, SUDDEN IMPACT manages to avoid the death knell of most film sequels manages to find the right balance between containing elements of the original while still seeming like an original movie in and of itself. What's amazing about SUDDEN IMPACT is that you need not have seen any of the 3 previous Dirty Harry movies to understand Harry Callahan! After a 7-year absence from playing the iconic role (in 1976's THE ENFORCER before this), Eastwood stepped back into the fray as if he'd never left. That's quite an achievement.Harry's task this time is to find a mysterious woman Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke in a bold, dark, convincing performance) killing off a group of her college friends that gang-raped her and her sister 10 years before; Locke was an Eastwood regular back in his 70s and 80s movie-making days (and of course his live-in lover at the time). The instigator of the rape was, ironically, a female Ray Parkins (Audrie J. Neenan giving an uncompromising performance playing a very despicable character). Ray is the nominal leader of the gang, while the main guy was Mick (Paul Drake in a 100% sleazy role). The first killing occurred in Harry's backyard San Francisco as one of the gang had moved there after college, but the rest are still in the burg San Paulo, where Jennifer goes back to and Harry gets shipped off to to investigate. The San Paulo police chief Jannings (played by Pat Hingle, another Eastwood regular in these days), knows of the incident as his son was one of the rapists who has since gone into a guilt-ridden catatonic state. All of them try to keep Harry at bay.In this sequel, Eastwood's Harry shares the spotlight with Locke's Jennifer, who, like Harry, believes in justice, except she takes it to the extreme of vigilantism and revenge. It has the obligatory moment where they meet (before Harry knows who she is!) and are mutually attracted, but b/c of Jennifer's past, it's a rather cold and empty union, just 2 lonely people who think alike (mostly!) that sense a strange connection to each other.But you still get your dosage of iconic Harry moments and scenes, especially early when Harry methodically goes after criminal after criminal in that special Dirty Harry way, including the legendary make my day scene. The first 30 minutes or so serve as a complete reminder than Eastwood IS Dirty Harry and there will never be another! Film-wise, SUDDEN IMPACT obviously has that 80s pastiche, but when you've got a filmmaker as confident and assured as Eastwood that knows how to give the viewer what they want, you probably better watch it over and over again... or else Harry Callahan will Make your day!

Jennifer is out to do in those who brutally raped her and her younger sister Lisa ,Lisa Bratt, who ended up in a mental institution from the ordeal.After killing George Wilburn, one of those who rape her and her sister, in San Francisco Jennifer goes down south to San Paulo where George comes from and where the rest of his gang of rapists live. It just happens that Harry is put on the Wilburn murder case and also sent to San Paulo to check out a number of leads which in effect leads him to getting involved not only with George's friends but Jennifer as well. Jennifer doesn't waste time in knocking off another one of her rapists, Kruger, which has the same MO, mode of operation, as the Wilburn killing. It doesn't take long for Harry to piece things together and realize that there's a serial killer on the loose. Harry has no idea that the person who's doing the killings is the girl next door whom he's been getting very friendly with. A dead pan looking and unemotional Jennifer goes about in killing her and Lisa's rapists in such an effortless way that you wonder if they just want to be put out of their misery, resulting from their guilty consciences! It's that Jennifer's victims seem to make no attempt to save themselves or fight back at all! All they seem to do is just stand, or sit, in what looks like either a paralyzed or hypnotic trance when she first confronts and then blows them away!After finishing off another one of her rapists, this time a lesbian Ray Parkins, Jennifer runs into the psycho of the bunch Mick. Mick unlike Jennifer's other victims acts more normal,by at least having a sense of self-preservation, then the rest of the motley and cowardly bunch. Getting a couple of fishermen who worked for the late Kruger to help him out Mick first takes care of Harry, by now we almost forgot about him, by having the cop beaten unconscious and dumped into San Paulo Bay. Then Mick goes to the San Paulo chief of police Janning where he knows that he'll find Jennifer; The chief's son was one of those who raped her and Lisa.When Jennifer get's to the chief's place she finds that his boy is completely brain dead, from a self-induced car accident, with Chief Janning popping up with a gun pointed at her head. Instead of arresting or shooting Jennifer, which he had every reason to do, who's pointing a handgun at him Janning instead gives her a long and boring sob story about his boy's crippling condition and how sorry he was in what his all but dead, from the neck up, son did to her and Lisa. Working himself up to look like a blabbing idiot Jenning goes on to say how he was the one responsible in not only letting his son get off Scott-free but the rest of those who raped her and her sister as well. As Chief Janning is caught up, this is his big scene in the movie, with him spilling his guts out he gives crazy Mick and the fishermen all the time that they need to show up and blast this self-pitying and sorry excuse for a lawman away.You would think that Mick would kill Jeniffer who, unlike Janning, he knew was out to kill him but instead takes her hostage! For what? This leads Jennifer to escape only to get caught again and give Harry who had miraculously recovered, almost without a scratch, from the savage beating he got from Mick and the fishermen to come to her rescue. Wild final shootout at the sea-side carnival with Harry blasting away with his super howitzer-like .44 magnum that makes his old .44 cannon look like a cap-pistol. Harry puts a quick end to the fishermen and then pulverizing Mick, with Jennifer getting away just before he got it, who ends up on the carousel with one of it's horses, a unicorn, horn stuck through his body.With all the mindless killings and violence in the movie the ending of Sudden Impact did have it's share of redeeming qualities. Which had to do with Harry***SPOILERS***feeling that Jennifer did the right thing in her killing some half dozen rapists. In the end Harry not just lets Jennifer walk away but puts the blame, of those that she killed, on the dead Mick's head. Mick being close to being insane, if not there already, is blamed for the killing for no reason whats so ever all of his friends which makes no sense at all even if he did have Jennifer's gun, the murder weapon, on him.By now Clint Eastwood, at 53 years of age, looked a bit worn out from his Dirty Harry roles but still gave it his best and didn't look foolish in the many action scenes he was in but you can see that his Dirty Harry days on the screen were just about over. Eastwood still managed to squeeze out another Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool five years later in 1988 which was his swan song as the famous movie cop. Eastwood has since gone on to play more realistic parts acting his age as well as going more into directing which earned him his one and only Academy Award in the 1992 western classics The Unforgiven in which he also stared in.

That changes when he's sent uptown to search for information on a murder in San Francisco. Unknown to Callahan, the person killed in San Francisco was part of a gang that raped a young woman ( Sondra Locke, Eastwood's girl at the time), and that girl is taking the old gang out one by one.    Clint Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else, so it's fitting that he directs the definitive sequel. Although there's moments of humour, coming mostly from Meathead, the tone and look of the picture is a return to Don Siegel's classic.          Sondra Locke gives a performance that's frightning and sympathetic. Her cold eyes remind me of Andy Robinson's 'Scorpio' character in the original. Eastwood and writer Joseph C. Stinson seem to have realised that the sequels suffered due to the lack of an effective villan, so Locke fills the gap left by Robinson brilliantly.          Eastwood, although looking tired in certain places, looks meaner than ever. I have never seen such a mean stare in my life. Lalo Schifrin's score is given a welcome return, with the music having a slight resemblence to the original.               Overall, the best Dirty Harry sequel. Not only does it return to the original's tone and style, it is highly entertaining to boot.     9 out of 10''Go ahead, make my day.''

Several actually.","Date":"4 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  Whoah! First they beat him up, then they kill his best friend, then finally....THEY KICK HIS DOG! This means business. The man is righteously p***ed off! It's amazing how Eastwood got his rep as a director when so many of his films are so lazy, flaccid and lacking in pace. The first half of this film is made by numbers and has a ridiculous amount of irrelevant mayhem with mafiosa and street hoodlums climbing over each other for the privilege of being blown away by Harry. And the script has every cliche in the book What the hell are you doing, Callahan? The mayor's on the phone, the DA's crawling up my ass, you're a dinosaur etc. But at the half way mark the film changes tack and tightens up, becoming oddly compelling and watchable. Why? Probably because of Harry's observation that revenge is the oldest motivation known to mankind and although Eastwood's alleged Republican obsessions (lesbians,rapists,muggers etc) can be questioned, he is astute on this point. 'The Virgin Spring' was equally grotesque but gripping, suggesting there is something rivetingly primitive about such emotions. He pinches from Hitchcock with the fairground horses bit, but the film is saved. Just. He is good at self mythologising and the bit where he appears in silhouette on the boardwalk as a gun fighter does work cinematically, I have to admit. It must be the most violent film ever made, though.Eastwood once claimed that people's behaviour is not influenced by film violence but it has arguably affected his. He grew up watching cowboy films and then became an actor in cowboy series and films himself in which he shot people. He then went on to make some of the most callously violent films ever made. What he saw must have influenced what he ended up doing and depicting. He became part of it.The character of Dirty Harry is puzzling. He is dismissive of humanity and blows off the gratitude of a young cop whose life he saves in this film. If he can't stand people why does he bother protecting them? The laziness of the film and it's attitude to minorities was famously lampooned in a film financed by a black actor with his credit card in which black people are depicted as being so stupid as to allow time for Dirty Harry to reach slowly into his coat for a gun when they've got a gun pointed right at him. I think it was just sloppiness rather than racism on Eastwoods part, not that I much care about defending him. Another daft moment is when Harry blows away a hitman at his hotel. Now normally if a detective shoots someone he is suspended pending an investigation into whether it was legitimate, he is given a full debriefing etc. Here, all that happens is the chief of police asks him, what went on in your hotel room this morning? And Harry doesn't even ANSWER HIM! It's risible stuff, really. At the end Sondra Locke gives a and now a word from our sponsors type speech spelling out the message of defeated justice and 'lets sweep the scum off the streets'. And Harry shrugs. Okay, it's over. I'll let you off, then. Want to come back to my place? Or words to that effect. It's hilarious. The character had become so embittered and dark, a lighter (not to mention tackier) sequel was produced to public indifference.Has anyone else wondered how the punk Dirty Harry nearly shot at the beginning of the original film ended up as his friend in the police force? There is also a farting bulldog in this film.

In any case, it's far greater than The Enforcer, which lacked any depth in its villains.  Sudden Impact gives a very mysterious air to the villain, and the entire movie focuses around her.  Harry Calahan and this woman are both portrayed as realistic characters, with their own lives to deal with.  The action simply isn't enough, it's the chemistry of these two with their environments that make this movie enjoyable.  The female role is much better than the typical feeble girl (The Enforcer) or sexy vixen. But if you like the first movie, or are just looking for a solid story, go out and rent this.

It's also a kickass action movie.Opening with a liberal, female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous, Go ahead, make my day line), Sudden Impact is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's.

Sandra Locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. Locke is an 8 normally, but, with a deadly pistol in her purse, cocked for the bad guys, she climbs all the way up the scale to a 10. Having been gang-raped, along with her younger sister, some years ago, Locke, as Jennifer Spencer, has tried to block out the attack from her life, as best she can. Her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. One day, Jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in S.F.; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his Cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!! Ya gotta love this spunky lady. She's got her priorities straight. Plus, Jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas UNTIL NOW. After executing her first perp, Jennifer curiously watches Det. Insp. Harry Callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the Caddy. Then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in San Paolo, CA up the coast where the rape event took place years ago. With more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist. Not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we REMEMBER the CRIME and the SUFFERING he inflicted. Such recalled events steels Jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain. Throughout the movie, scenes of Jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, IL' Dirty Harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember Go ahead. MAKE my day.? Later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted Callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after Clint as if to say I want to have your baby. My favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when Harry threatens and frightens a murderous Mafia boss named Threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the Mark Hopkins hotel. Michael Grazzo (Pantangeli in Godfather II) does a wonderful job as the sinful Mafia Don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. However, Harry's troubles aren't over with yet! The elevator punk's gang AND Threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate Harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. Yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like Clint the Director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. But, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. The punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in S.F. Bay. Warms my heart. With so much violent intent directed at Insp. Callahan, his bosses send him to San Paolo to try to get some background on the 22 caliber vasectomy killing as Jennifer Spencer's crime is now known, but not before Harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. Love that Harry. While our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in San Paolo, two more murders happen, same M.O., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. Then Harry meets Jennifer! They find they both agree on subjects such as Law and Order, Making the Guilty Pay, etc. Could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? We're led to believe just that. Characters abound in this Real-Man meets Real-Woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named Raye Parkins who's both irritating and entertaining. Raye set up Jennifer's rape for her boyfriend years before, and she'll get hers eventually. The San Paolo Police Chief, played by reliable Eastwood co-star Pat Hingle (the Hanging Judge in 'Hang Em High'), is strangely at odds with Callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. Much like Jennifer's sister, Chief Janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. It can't end here, though. The dyke's rapist boyfriend, Mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from Vegas becuz Raye's dropped a dime on Jennifer, summoning him up to San Paolo to prevent more executions. Mick sleeps at Raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with Raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the Island of the Eternal Lesboes by a shot from Jennifer's revolver. Psycho Mick makes bail at long last, with Jennifer gunning for him. A desperate chase ensues, as Harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. It all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful Roberta Flack blues song.

I've seen all five films innumerable times. Obviously it goes without saying Don Siegel's classic original is the best and the unbeatable one of these fantastic thrillers but when it comes to the four sequels I think it's an extremely hard, nearly impossible task to create some sort of a list in order from best to worst. If I still have to walk that way then I guess Sudden impact might just be my favorite sequel.I don't know, it's just so damn terrific that's all. Sudden impact is probably one of the most underrated of Clint's works. It's the only part of the series that's directed by Eastwood himself and critics claim it's depressing, offensive, stupid, over-violent and among his worst motion pictures ever. I certainly can't say I agree. I find Sudden impact exciting, clever, ultra-cool and downright irresistible. Sure it's violent, it's definitely the most violent and cruelest part of the Dirty Harry saga.No doubt Sudden impact is a rather depressing experience too if you're a sensitive person. Sondra Locke's displeasing rape flashbacks aren't anything pretty to watch. On the other hand film has some great comic reliefs and humorous elements. Harry hijacks a retirement home's bus full of astonished old timers in order to use it in a chase - idea that could have been in James Bond movie. He also gets an ill-mannered bulldog Meathead as a gift and is forced to take it as a pet.When I watch the spectacular Sudden impact I honestly don't think Eastwood looked like he was sick and tired of playing Mr. Callahan. Maybe there was some signs of it five years later in The Dead pool but there wasn't any in this one. Hell no. He was still brisk, spirited, lively and believable supercop. Sudden impact is one of Clint Eastwood's most memorable, effective and successful police thrillers and a definite classic of the genre. I can't give it less than 10 out of 10.
