[{"Title":"Well, there are puppies... adorable puppies... gotta love puppies... you know I had to try","Date":"10 February 2004","Score":"20 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" OK, yes, I do think we are all a little sick of the Look Who's Talking sequels, even though I did enjoy Look Who's Talking Too, it was just taking a really great concept and not putting the effort into it. Look Who's Talking Now is just plain pathetic on the level that it's more for the kids vs. the adults, I think because they found that Look Who's Talking had a children's love as well as an adult's, because it was just all together a great comedy. With Look Who's Talking Now, we have a more family friendly movie with puppies that surprise, surprise talk. Not to mention that the silly plot line that they put in where it seems like the dogs more revolve around the characters instead of the characters we have grown to love.A young cross bred puppy is up for sale and we can hear him talking, he sees Mikey passing by him and begs him to take him home. Mikey however has to hurry past in tow of his mother, and two harsh looking individuals buy the puppy. The puppy manages to escape them and starts his life as a stray. James is a private air pilot working for Samantha, who we see has a crush on him and is always trying to extend the trips to spend more time with him. Mikey tells Santa that he wants a dog for Christmas, James feels the time has come to give Mikey the present he has always wished for and tells his boss Samantha about this. In the meantime, Mollie is a top accountant at her firm but because her salary is so high, she is suddenly fired in order for the firm to save money. Unable to acquire a decent job, Molly gets a job as one of the Elves for the mall Santa for the holiday season. During a visit, Mikey discovers to his horror that that Santa Claus is a fake and becomes upset with disbelief. One day though the dog gets caught by the animal rescue force and taken to a kennel, where several other dogs are kept - presumably also found on the streets. The dog is about to be put to sleep on the same day that James brings Mikey to the kennel to select a dog, overjoyed Mikey bumps into the dog he saw as a pup, and takes an instant liking to him and decides to take him home. When James, Mikey and Rocks the dog get home, they see that Samantha is at their house and has brought over her dog Daphne who is highly trained and she wants James to have it as a present from her. Molly discovers that James had gone and gotten a dog for Mikey without discussing it with them and after a brief argument, they can't take Rocks back to the kennel or he will be put to sleep, and James does not want to offend Samantha by refusing Daphne. And now realize they are stuck with two dogs. And of course these dogs talk as well to narrate the story that Mikey cannot narrate any more.Is Looking Who's Talking Now the worst movie ever? No, not really, it's certainly not terrible, but it's just pointless. It was just a different way of making money off of the franchise. I think that this is a silly movie, but it did have a couple of random laughs here and there, but for the most part it's just silly with the whole story between James and his new boss, Samantha who has a crush on him, more like an obsessive crush where she just throws herself at him, maybe she saw those Welcome Back, Kotter episodes one too many times and was in love with Vinnie Barbarino. But anyways, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to too many people, more for the really young kids who just wanna see really cute puppies, that's about it. This movie doesn't have much to offer except for&#x85; puppy love! Oh, you know I had to make a lame joke.2/10 "},{"Title":"John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are great.","Date":"8 November 1998","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and Lysette Anthony are wonderful in this funny, funny film.

I really enjoyed the first, and while watchable the second was a disappointment. Look Who's Talking Now has its good points, such as the soundtrack and the two dogs voiced wonderfully by Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton. Plus it is not too bad visually.However, the concept has been done to death but the story feels very tired this time around, and to further disadvantage there are one too many thin and predictable gags and weak lines in the script. Other than DeVito and Keaton the other acting wasn't so impressive, this time John Travolta and Kirstie Alley seem to be phoning in their performances as the bickering couple. And the ending was far too sentimental for my liking.Overall, perhaps worth the look but it is disappointing for me anyway. 3/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Not brilliant but still an underrated movie.A nice family film.","Date":"4 January 2012","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" Looks Whos Talking now isn't a brilliant film but I find it to be underrated,it still quite funny,with a nice storyline and enjoyable for the whole family,John Travolta and Kirstie Alley have great chemistry and I enjoyed how they made dogs the ones talking this time instead of doing something like,having another baby.Christmas is on the way and the Ubriacco family get two dogs,James gets a new job which involves a lot of travelling while Mollie gets fired.This time the dogs do the talking because the two kids are all grown up,Daphne (voiced by Diane Keaton) is a pampered poodle and starts to fall for the other new dog Rocks (voiced by Danny Devito).

Mollie's just lost hers and is stuck at homeAfter such a cute movie that the first produced, we were treated with a mediocre sequel, then a travesty. Who in there right mind thought this was a good idea? Pets talking didn't cut it for me, and obviously plenty of others, when this tanked miserably at the box office. I didn't laugh once during this movie. In fact I felt sorry for solid talent like Travolta and Alley for having to star in such a pathetic mess. One of the most laughable scenes for me, that obviously tried to come off as cutesy was when Travolta's daughter has a crush on Charles Barkley, and has a scene with him on the basketball court. Also, the pets. What was this, Lady and The Tramp? Performances. John Travolta tries to charm his way through this mess, but can only do so much with the terrible material. He's certainly far from bad, but he's not exactly in the position to do much with his performance. Kirstie Alley also tries her hardest, but much like Travolta, she can only do so much. The kids are OK, as are the voices.Bottom line. Did they not get the memo on the 2nd one? This was clearly unwarranted, and the results showed that. The 2nd one isn't worth it, neither is this turd.

This is certainly not the worst movie ever made. I agree it's not the best movie of the series but it's fun to watch especially around the holidays.First, the cast is great. Lot's of funny stuff and the chemistry is perfect especially between John Travolta and Kirstie Alley.The way Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton blend their voices with the on screen action of the dogs is nothing short of great. The facial expressions of the dogs, in some cases, fit the dialog perfectly.I also think this movie is great for the holidays. It expresses the importance of family and togetherness.I do find it interesting that there are two endings to this movie. The original theatrical version had a different music cue at the very end along with regular scrolling credits. The version that was released on laserdisc and VHS had a, in my opinion, better music cue at the end (Joy to the world) and then a music video with the credits. The DVD release has the original theatrical ending but thankfully the Netflix HD version has the video ending.In my humble opinion, a wonderful family film especially for the holidays. Lots of fun if you are in the mood for light comedy. Just enjoy it and don't worry about comparing it to the other films.

It seems like the movie is struggling to find something to happen to the family. I do mean struggle. It has way too many stupidity. I don't get why there's a dream sequence with Julie and Charles Barkley. It seems like filler. The dogs get sporadic screen time in the first half. I expected that the dogs would be in the home right away but the first half is wasted. Once the family unites with the dogs, it gets the expected kids with dogs mayhem. I keep thinking that there is a better story. The story is more like a sitcom. It should have been a fun family fare. I am bored with the dream sequences. This is like watching an unstable house of cards completely collapse. Then it takes a hard turn at the end that doesn't fit any of the rest of the movie.

The previous two films having done the impossible and exhausted the concept of a wisecracking baby, the unfunny internal commentary this time comes courtesy of a couple of dogs voiced by Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton. The desperate story has Travolta getting a highly paid job as a pilot and... ah, who cares. It's dull, Lysette Anthony is rubbish and it all ends in a stupid cabin-in-the-woods finale. This is crap, really, but what keeps it afloat is Travolta's performance. He acts as though this is something special rather than a one-joke threequel that's far beneath him.

Since Mikey and Julie are now talking on their own, the addition of not one, but two family dogs is the explanation of who's talking now.

Can the family adjust to life with the canines and thwart Samantha's romantic schemes?This is a funny and fresh addition to the Look Who's Talking series. Travolta and Alley exude such charm and humor that they make a terrific comedy team.  The rest of the cast is notable and the voices of DeVito and Keaton bring their doggy personalities to life in a big way.  The script is somewhat predictable but still brings a smile to any lucky viewer.  There are some scenes involving a wolf that may be scary for the youngest movie enthusiasts.  But, on the whole, this is a fine film for the entire family to chuckle over.

In that they had run out of different genders of children to give celebrity voices to, they turned to the pets. This time, they give the family two dogs, one of each gender, give them each a voice and lets the kids rest their inner voices. Why is it that infants, right from the womb(which we, again, see, because there apparently can not be an entry in this franchise without that), have the voice of people who are about middle-aged, give or take a handful of years or so? Apparently, even dogs. Oh well, at least these two actors, DeVito and Keaton, aren't too bad(not that I had a problem with Willis, at least as an actor), and the former's voice fits rather well for a canine. Take that any way you want. At least Roseanne is gone... but they make efforts to make Julie as annoying without her, having her tell knock-knock jokes so lame that even the parents would ask her to stop... she also apparently fantasizes about beating Charles Barkley, who must have liked the part, as he did the same thing again three years later, in Space Jam. Dukakis shows up again, in what can only be loyalty(in a film with dogs as main characters, how fitting). Heckerling neither wrote nor directed this... when the very *creator* of a franchise steps down, you ought to know there's something wrong. There is no trace left of any charm the series ever had(which was all found in the first). I would say that the franchise by this point just has overstayed its welcome, but it could be argued that it achieved that before the end credits of the original film. More nightmare sequences, this time being ridiculous(a first for the series; usually, they were just misplaced and more unsettling than anything a young child should watch). The main conflict is essentially rehashed from the first two, only dumbed down. Lysette Anthony shows up, her acting performance being at the same level that it was in Trilogy of Terror II(that would be poor). This film will insult the intelligence of anyone beyond the age of seven, but some of the humor remains above what they will(or should) understand, or ought to watch. The very ending was almost too much. I recommend this to people who like dogs, and men attracted to Lysette. 3/10 "},{"Title":"good movie for family","Date":"14 October 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" good family movie to watch on a Sunday evening full of goodness with talking dogs and this time the kids can talk for them selves also the wife is very paranoid about her husband so it ends up like bit of fights in her dreams Gangtok dogs bogs photogenic none flapping Sedgwick fisticuff this movie is great superb amazing fantastic outstanding dog fun for many people i would recommend this movie for a family of 3 or more so you can sit on your couch while the fire is on to enjoying a good comedy plus the mum(British term) and dad are the same actors so there cannot be any confusions an if any parents think this is bad for there child's life about finding out that Santa is a fake it shows you at the end that there is a Santa clause "},{"Title":"Well, *I* liked it.

If people want to equate cute with sappy, making it a bad thing, I respond that some movies are supposed to be an escape from reality.This said, I don't like everything about it. I never liked John Travolta's James in the first place. He (the character, I mean) is a hypermacho creep who gives men in general a bad name. His character causes Lysette Anthony's Samantha to lose ground not for her acting, but for something that is not her fault the writing that fails to answer the question, So what does she see in him anyway? Kirstie Alley's Mollie can be annoying too, with her overemotional dramatizing of everything, although the deliberately campy dream sequences redeem things just a touch. If we're going to be melodramatic, at least let's do it on purpose, right? Thank goodness for the children and the dogs to carry the movie. They are the reason for six of the seven stars I've given it. Olympia Dukakis as the now fair-minded, formerly buttinsky grandma, accounts for the seventh.The interplay between the snobby purebred and the streetwise mutt is hysterically funny. Doggy snacks to the trainers, who were able to get the dogs to behave on cue with the perfect gestures and facial expressions. More doggy snacks to Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton, the canine voices.

One night outside their building, two dogs mate and soon the female has a litter of puppies. One of them begins to speak in his mind about everything around him. Meanwhile, Mikey desparately wants a dog of his own and James was going to a job interview that day with a woman named Samantha who represented an airline company. It looked as though James would be getting the job, which was good news because Mollie lost hers; the puppy from earlier on was in a box with his brothers and sisters being sold on a street corner. Soon he was the only one left until two bikers bought him, luckily the puppy escaped them and wandered the streets by himself.       As luck would have it, Mollie found another job playing one of Santa Claus's elves for a mall Santa. Mikey and Julie went to see Santa that day. Mikey asked for a dog but Julie cried on Santa's lap. It was then that Mikey sneaked into the back and discovered the Santa was a fake so he doubted the existence of Santa Claus from then on. Meanwhile, the puppy from earlier on had grown and was wandering the streets one day when he was snagged by the dog catcher and taken to the pound. He was just minutes away from being destroyed when James and Mikey arrive. Mikey selects the puppy and they take him home. Mikey names him Rocks because that's what he left all over the back seat of James' taxi. When James and Mikey get home, they're surprised to see Samantha there. She had given the kids her French Poodle, Daphne. Rocks was unbeknownst to Mollie who soon had her doubts but agreed to put each dog on a trial basis and the one that least worked out would go. Daphne and Rocks didn't get along at all. James was always working. He would be flying to London, Paris, San Fransisco, Dallas, Spain...And with Samantha who had a secret crush on James. Why when James took Mollie and her mother Rosie to dinner at a fancy French restaurant, there was Samantha who James credited for the dinner. Mollie began to wonder if they were having an affair.       At home, Rocks, who was already getting poor marks from James and Mollie for eating garbage, drinking out of the toilet and chewing on Mollie's pumps, accidentally broke Daphne's doghouse but she got even by chewing on Mollie's shoes and aimed for Rocks to take the blame. But soon Rocks and Daphne begin to get close. They go out for a night on the town. Unfortunately, Mollie finds out about the shoes and, as expected, punished Rocks. Daphne was sorry.  Christmas Eve soon arrives and Samantha informs James that she had to attend a meeting in a cabin upstate and no other pilot would take her so James reluctantly agreed. In reality, there was no meeting. Samantha set it all up. So they soon arrive at the cabin. Samantha unplugged all the phones. James wanted to walk to town but it was snowing heavily outside. He was stuck. Much to Samantha's delight. Back at the apartment, Mollie soon finds out what's up and she gathers Mikey, Julie, Rocks and Daphne, jump in James' taxi and head to the cabin. En route, they go off road and into a snow bank. All seemed lost. Things were about to get worse when they're attacked by a pack of wolves. Luckily, Rocks saved them. Daphne found the ranger who took Mollie and the kids to his station while Rocks finds James who called it quits with Samantha. He was fired anyway and when they get to the ranger station, it's a merry Christmas after all!        A pretty good sequel to Look Who's Talking. It's Part 3 in the series! John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are back, so is Olympia Dukakis. George Sagal makes a cameo appearance as Albert. Danny DeVito voices Rocks while Diane Keaton voices Daphne. Bruce Willis doesn't voice Mikey because Mikey is now 8 years old and can talk on his own which almost diminishes the whole effect of the movie. And it seems as if the whole talking animal routine has been done to death, but this did come out before Homeward Bound, but I saw that first.

I think it was because I had gone into it expecting absolutely nothing. It's not the kind of movie that'll change your life, and you'll probably forget you had even seen it the next morning, but it's fun and lightweight, just as films in this genre should be.The last week, I've gone a movie watching spree, watching at least eleven films in seven days, and this is probably the biggest treasure out of the bunch, if only because it was so much better than I had hoped. Angela's Ashes, The Running Man, Blow, Memento, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Empire of the Sun, Paper Moon, Jacob's Ladder, Leaving Las Vegas, Along Came a Spider, The Stand, the list goes on and on, and, of all those films, this is the one that stands out... if you can believe that. Of course it had it's share of flaws, probably more than the rest of those movies combined, but hey, it just added to the fun instead of detract from it.I did see Look Who's Talking. I hated it. I hated it with a passion. That was a year ago. Why I hated it, I don't know. I just know that I didn't like it at all. The only reason I rented this movie, it's SECOND sequel, was to see how the series had deteriorated since the first film. Well, if nothing else, it's really improved. I haven't seen the second in the series, but I doubt it could even begin to match the third.One can guess that Travolta didn't want to be here. You've gotta feel sorry for the guy. Once one of Hollywood's biggest stars, through the eighties he was reduced to parts in TV movies and bland films like The Experts. He struck box office gold in 1989 with the first Look Who's Talking, and then made a few wrong moves and was right back down at the bottom of Hollywood, even appearing in both of the sequels. Well, if he was bored here, he sure didn't show it. Though his performance seemed to wane a bit towards the end, he was engaging all the way through, and obviously didn't feel as though the material was below him like many actors would've had they been in his position.Kirstie Alley, however, is entirely a different story. Never a particulary good actress, you have to wonder how she rose so high into Hollywood's elite, before plunging again after the first Look Who's Talking. Her screen presence here is non existent, and she is about as much fun to watch as this review probably is to read. Though she doesn't bring the whole film down with her, she comes pretty close at times, and for me at least, didn't garner a single laugh.As the voices of the two dogs, Rocks and Daphne, Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton fare a lot better than Alley. Given some of the best lines in the film, they add a certain flare to their characters, making us believe that dogs actually can communicate with each other as illustrated here, even if it is clearly not possible. It takes real talent to make the audience believe that. Even if it is just through voice work, chemistry between the two is clearly evident, and you wish they had been given more scenes together, or even seperately. The writers seemed to forget about the dogs for long periods of time and focusing instead of the family, even though the movie was supposed to revolve around the dogs, at least according to the advertising.Though she is third billed, Olympia Dukakis has little more than a cameo, given five or six lines at the absolute most. Rounding out the main cast was the two actors who played Travolta and Alley's kids, David Gallagher as Mikey and Tabitha Lupien as Julie. Lupien is funny at times, especially with her obsession with basketball star Charles Barkley, but it's clear that was too young to really know what was going on, and just following the orders of the director. She did have some good lines, and that wide eyed gaze she had is priceless. Gallagher, who was later cast as one of the leads on the television series 7th Heaven, is impressive here, turning in a surprisingly good performance for someone so young. Though his character was shallow and obviously wasn't drawn out much (strange considering he's on screen for most of the movie), he makes good use of the weak material given to him.Spread out through the movie were five or six dream sequences. There's only one word to describe them, downright hilarious. Wait, that's two words. Oh well, they were really funny though. I'm not going to go through describing them, you'll have to see them for yourselves, but take my word on it, it doesn't get much funnier than that folks.Well, I've spent long enough praising the movie, now to the flaws I mentioned earlier. For one, I don't know if this was the fault of the boom operator or if it was my particular cassette, but the on location audio was dreadful. The voices were muffled and hard to understand, and it weakened the impact of many of the dialogue based jokes. Any chemistry between Travolta and Alley that may have existed in the first Look Who's Talking has vanished. Though many may not agree with me, I put the majority of the blame on Alley, who probably took this role only because of the paycheck.The last third of the movie, especially the sappy happy ending, is contrived beyond belief and not the least bit funny. It's as if the producers hired a seperate writer for the ending, the style is that much different from the rest of the movie. The songs are unimaginably bad. Well, it's not so much the songs, but the obtrusive way they were edited in, with the audio levels at least 50% higher than the rest of the movie. I'm not going to drone on and on, like I already have, so I'll end this quick.Look Who's Talking Now is a surprisingly entertaining little movie, easily better than the lackluster first entry, just don't go in expecting too much (which shouldn't be too hard given the horrible reviews and low IMDb rating), because you're bound to be disappointed.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Way better than I expected        ** Partial Spoiler**","Date":"14 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" I got stuck in front of this when it was playing on TV one school holidays.

Baby Mikey is growed up now - at least to the age of seven - so there's no Bruce Willis voice over, there are no funny gags about a baby's point of view. We just get dogs. DOGS? Yes, dogs. One voiced by Danny DeVito. Sound funny? Yeah, that's what I thought. Film gets ridiculous towards the end, but then again, the entire film was ludicrous from the start. Watch the first film, avoid the sequels.0/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Well it was better than two.","Date":"6 May 2003","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  This movie is part of one of the worst set of trilogies ever made where all the movies somehow made it to the theater.  This one is quite bad, but at least it isn't part two so no Roseanne doing the voice.  Here we have Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton doing dogs voices.  Not really worth watching and there are probably lots of dog movies that are better.  This one has the family being hateful to each other again.  Let's face it Travolta and Alley have to be the worst screen couple ever, they always have problems.  All in all not worth watching, but at least it is more tolerable than part two, but I say skip the entire set movies as none of them are good.

John Travolta needed some money to buy a plane so my guess is that's why he starred in this poorly written/idea of crap. Instead of throwing this one to the dogs, they should have given these two old tykes another sibling to make their lives hell.. but of course someone just said hey, why don't we try animals.. and again these people failed... The original and it's copies should be on the 100 most lamest movies ever made and be burned! Enough Said.

In an attempt to milk the celebrity voices something that doesn't have it's own speaking voice schtick, the Look Who's Talking series wanders from babies (which they did twice) to dogs. I half-expected them to continue the series after this outing by focusing on the talking tapeworms in Kirstie Alley's stomach or some similar thing.Sure, it's cute and has its moments, but ultimately this movie's a big fluffy nothing with Danny DeVito doing some of the worst voice work of his career, and Diane Keaton doing the worst acting of her entire life, voice or not. How many awwww moments does it take to get to the sappy center of a Look Who's Talking movie? The world really doesn't need to know.

The babies are old enough now to talk on their own so a new idea had to come about. The likeable cast once again seems lost in the stupid film. A cameo by then-NBA superstar Charles Barkley and the artificial suspense generated in the film's final act are not near enough to save the movie. Not as bad as the second, but then again few films are. 2 stars out of 5.
