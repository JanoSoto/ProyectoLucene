[{"Title":"Past ignited in motel room....","Date":"16 January 2005","Score":"51 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not. When the final credits rolled, rather creatively at that, I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater, or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film. I could not decide. I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine. While it was a very interesting audio commentary, it only provided more indecisiveness. After thinking about this for two days, I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing, there has to be something spectacular about it, and there was. After two days I was able to put my finger on it. You had a very chilling story, a deeply disturbing confession, a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman, and then there was Ethan Hawke. I put him aside because it was his acting, his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection. Let me explain.This is a story, that on the surface seems small, is very large in structure. While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies, we never really know anything about him. Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single, but we never really get to know Ethan's character. This is what muddled in my mind for those two days, I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was. Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious, or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted. Who knows? I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince. We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this self-appointed villain, or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose. Instead, what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him. Here is what I could hear Ok, Ethan, your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave, do whatever it takes. Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot. Does this make sense? I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room, but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told. I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer, but this story needed a hint. It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation. I felt Ethan held us back from learning that. Someone else in the role may have done better, but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.As I said before, Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders. I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work, but his true acting ability really came forth. The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of husband and wife away while working with Ethan. I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape, but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate. The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering. I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created. Outside of Ethan, they did a great job.The story was a very tight story. I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room. I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle, but Stephen Belber (who also wrote the play) did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters. Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament. The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera. Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts. I thought this was annoying at times, and quite dizzying. It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story. That is my only critique of Linklater's direction, which was nearly flawless.Overall, this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element. It took me a while for me to realize this, and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind, but that is the nature of this film. It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends. I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed, proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material. Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene, while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired. I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role. Either way, this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100% pure acting.Grade **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Simple and Powerful","Date":"29 October 2001","Score":"35 out of 41 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Tape is not the best film of the year (in fact, it's not even director Richard Linklater's best film of the year), but it's a strong and intriguing movie experience all the same.  Just three characters, one hotel room and a whole boiling pot of backstory.  One could almost imagine Linklater, Hawke, Leonard (hey, isn't that Ethan Hawke's roommate 10 years ago in Dead Poet's Society?), and Thurman hanging out with a cool stage play and a DV camera and shooting the whole thing in one night.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing discardable or amateur about this film.  But watch how the play, a simple story of old friends confronting old wounds, is transformed by the camera.  The story is told in real time in a cramped room, but Linklater's over-cutting almost seems to extend time and space, creating a fully-realized world outside the hotel room walls without ever taking the camera outside.  The performances are dead-on and suspense builds right under your nose.  Rich and engaging.

This one, also shot on digital cameras takes place in a dingy hotel room and contains a cast of, count 'em, 1,2, THREE people, who are never seen outside of the context of the dingy motel room.  So, don't expect for the scene to change.  This film, based on a play, strives on realism, hence no orchestral score, no unnecessary settings or extra characters, just three fantastic actors dealing with issues.  One (Hawke) is a volunteer firefighter/ drug dealer who likes to, ahem, get excessively high off his own supply.  Another is his high school buddy,a budding young director whose film is being screen in the Lansing, Michigan Film festival, whose apparent maturity and superiority over his drug-binging pal and confidente is deceptive.  The final character, who arrives 2/3 of the way through the movie is a former high school crush/ associate district attorney  with significantly surrogate emotional ties to both of the men.The riveting conversations that evolve from somewhat sneeringly nostalgic to downright inhospitable fluidly move the film more actively than any number of action-packed popcorn flicks out there.  In fact, you'll have no trouble getting over the fact that you're just watching 3 people talking in a room for 2 hours (I'll admit that that was a little intimidating at first).  The film successfully lures us in with that inherent voyeurism that brought those first moviegoers into the transformed vaudeville theaters.  As a passive observer, we become immersed in exactly that which should be none of our business, just like Hawke's character pulls himself into a situation that is none of his business.  By the end, no clear resolution is reached and as compelling and intriguing as it all was, we feel guilty for looking through the peephole.

At the top we have a giddy and uncomfortable Ethan Hawke who is awaiting the arrival of his friend Robert Sean Leonard. The interaction between these two seems forced at the beginning...almost as if the two actors know they are stuck in a room for awhile and they better make it interesting. But soon enough, one comes to realize that the uncomfortability is due more to the estranged and uneveness of the two's relationship more than anything else.TAPE unfurls in an imrov-like environment (I was actually surprised this was a play in that I did think the actors imrovising)where theres overlapping, interruptions, belches and tangents...it leads you to believe you are on a banal ride of actor's without direction and slowly steers you towards and unexpected conclusion. Luckily, true to Linklater, this conclusion isn't of the gunshot variety( always the easy out when faced with the harder possibility of character epiphany of any sort)but rather of the more painful type of self-reflection and realization.Hawke bumbles, preens and flounders all over the screen as Leonard expertly evades scrutiny...but the real revelation here is Thurman. For the first time since Beautiful Girls she is just -playing-a person. Doing so, she shines right through in her most powerful role to date. She arrives completely in her own skin and then, without much of any prestidigitation, uses that same humble demeanor to lance through the boys complete murk and bulls**t. For that reason alone this film merits viewing.It's other virtue is in it's rambling force in which it arrives at an honest dissection of our own hipocrisy.

Of course, he didn't write this film, and that honour goes to Stephen Belber, whose play this film is based on. The dialogue itself is brilliant, and it's constantly fascinating to see how the characters are built up through what they say. Although we don't know anything about these characters before the film starts, by the end we know about them just through their dialogue, which shows the thought that has been put into everything the characters say. The plot is deliciously simple, which gives all of the characters room to expand and interact with each other. Basically, what we have here is two high school friends that meet up in a motel room for the first time in ten years. While there, they discuss the darker areas of their time together at school&#133; Of course, for this film to work, good actors are a definite must have; and this film definitely has them! Ethan Hawke massively impressed in Linklater's Before Sunrise, and he does so again here, albeit in a totally different way. The character he has been given here is much harder to like than his one in Linklater's masterpiece, but Hawke shows his worth as an actor by brilliantly stepping into the role, and giving his character a definite grounding in realism. His co-stars, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman give similar portrayals, and the ensemble helps to make the film what it is. What makes films like Tape great is their ambiguity. Many of the things that the characters say can be interpreted in different ways, and most people will have different ideas as to why certain characters say certain things. The story behind the immediate goings on is well orchestrated, and even though nothing that the characters are talking about is shown; it's still easy to picture it. What happens in the hotel room is also very well executed, and the playwright has made sure that his story is never boring. Linklater's use of the camera is good, with the swirling angles creating a claustrophobic feel within the small confines of the hotel room. Tape is the sort of film that can be analysed in all different ways, and that gives it infinite rewatch value and when the material is this good; rewatching can only be a pleasure.

The film takes place entirely in a hotel room in Michigan where the main character, Vince, (played by Ethan Hawke),is downing two beers at once.  He is waiting for the arrival of his old friend, John, (Robert Sean Leonard), an indie film-maker whose new film is playing at a local film-festival.Vince's motivations for seeing John have less to do with seeing his friend again and more to do with confronting him about an incident which happened when they were younger. Apparently, back in their high school days, John raped a woman named Amy, (played by Uma Thurman).  Amy was Vince's ex-girlfriend and someone whom both men are still infactuated with. However, the story is less about the somewhat ambiguous question over whether or not John raped Amy and more about these two characters and their lack of control over their lives. If any character in a Richard Linklater film can be described as a loser, it's Vince.  He drinks beer, smokes pot and snorts coke throughout  the entire movie.  He is a drug-dealer who deludes himself that he also has a legitimate job, and therefore control over his life, as a volunteer fire-fighter. John, on the other hand, seemingly has more control over his life, but that's only because he deals with his shattered ego internally while Vince deals with it externally. John has a dream job - a young up and coming film director whose movie is playing at a film-festival. And yet, he is terribly dissatisfied with his life.  He tells Vince that the film festival is only showing his film once in the afternoon and that it is only a small film-festival, anyway.  One gets the feeling that the only reason why John hangs out with a guy like Vince is to feel secure in his own existence.  He only seems relaxed wheh he tells Vince that he should get a life.Two-thirds of the way through the movie, Amy herself makes an appearance in the hotel room.  And it is then that we realize that all this time she has been merely a pawn in these mens' lives to allow them to feel they were in control of their own lives.  Whether or not John raped Amy or merely had violent concentual sex with her, that situation was all about the self-conscious John feeling that he was controling someone else since he couldn't control his own life.  And Vince's defence of Amy's honor has more to do with the fact that Amy never went all the way with him and John did. As it turns out Amy is the only one who has any control over her life. And, subsequently it is she who uses these two men as a kind of revenge at the way they have been using her. This is a very daring and extremely unconventional film which will have a hard time finding an audience.  Certainly, it will not be for everyone. Visually, it is far different from any film Linklater has made in the past.  In films like Before Sunrise and SubUrbia, Linklater's camera was brilliantly unobtrusive, enabling us to quietly observe these charcters and what makes them tick, with Linklater never drawing attention to the camera. In Tape, on the other hand, the viewer feels like a voyeur intruding on something that has nothing to do with them - the way Amy herself probably feels when watching these two men.  And the camera is constantly drawing attention to itself to the point where it's actually distracting and even infuriating.  If the sight of people talking in previous Linklater films felt inviting, this feels more like an uncomfortable situation you can't get out of.

Sure the film takes a bit getting used to, especially in the beginning when the actors have almost nothing to work with, but in the end the actors are what carries the film and they do so in a grandiose fashion.  Some part of the credit has to go to the great dialog as well though, since the words that are spoken are able to grab you by the throat and keep you interested in figuring out what truth lies behind the talk. Nothing Linklater did was too spectacular, so I am sure any director could have pulled this one, but since Linklater was the one I must give him credit (and the rest of the cast and crew) for making such a good film.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Unravelling Secrets On Tape","Date":"4 May 2008","Score":"11 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Shot on DV in one night at 'Tape' makes the viewer feel like a voyeur peeking into a motel room. It's set in a motel room where two friends reunite after 10 years (ironically Hawke and Leonard also appear together on screen more than a decade after their last film 'Dead Poet's Society') and have a private conversation that turns from the common catching up to unravelling secrets.The entire movie is pretty much a conversation but it is a layered film with layered characters. The writing is brilliant. The editing it very tight. As the events unfold with clever twists, it becomes an intense human drama and a thrilling experience for the audience. While we are provided with sufficient background information on Amy and Jon, Vince remains somewhat of a mystery. His intentions remain for the viewer to interpret as there are hints that point in different directions. The hand-held camera mostly acts as hidden camera that lures the viewer to look into a private moment of these three character's lives. The swirling camera actually acts like a person itself, who's just sitting there while no one is aware of its presence. Once Linklater builds the tension, he sustains it and keeps the viewer engaged right through the end.Being a conversational piece, it relies strongly on acting. The performances are solid. Ethan Hawke does a fine job of the (drug-induced) hyper but manipulative Vince. His character may be a bit ambiguous but he plays the part to the T. Robert Sean Leonard is adequate but in some places he seems a little lost. However, after Uma Thurman's entry, he is remarkable. Uma Thurman looks sensational with simple makeup. This is one actress who can look very plain when needed and supersexy when required. Her acting is excellent as she puts the pieces together while cleverly blindfolding the audience allowing them to figure out what happened.While some people may feel confused at the end, it is very thought-provoking movie as one would try to figure out the puzzle. On the whole, 'Tape' takes us into a different territory that only a few Hollywood films have done. It has some great performances, good direction, brilliant writing and will very likely keep you glued to the screen.

Stephen Belber's screenplay, based on his play, is magic, pure magic. Richard Linklater, with his daring direction, has done the impossible and made a totally compelling film with only three characters in a single dreary motel room. How does one do that? How would you ever get funding for such a crazy project? This is just about as extreme a cinematic risk as it is possible to take. But they more than pulled it off, they triumphed. And by 'they' I include the three spell-binding actors Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman. What a showcase of acting genius this film is! It is impossible to fault any of the three in even the slightest flicker of a facial muscle, or the slightest whisper of dialogue. One wonders whether they may possibly have rehearsed for six months and all lived together day and night to do this. Were they in fact cooped up in that motel room for the duration of the shooting? I would believe it. This film goes beyond honesty, it goes beyond revelation, it goes beyond nakedness and baring of an actor's soul, it is an X-ray film, or even a gamma-ray film, where every organ can be seen, and every pulsation or heartbeat viewed through the transparency of the shimmering and aetherial forms which they all have. One wonders whether Belber may have lived through this. Can he possibly have imagined it? Could anyone? Uma Thurman meets these two fellows for the first time in ten years, since high school. They inflict their traumas on her, and she inflicts hers on them. This is mutual laceration which is as brilliant as that found in Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', which may have inspired Belber. Thurman's character has pride, and does not wish to be dragged into the open admission of a past indignity, whereas Hawke's character is driven obsessively to expose it, ostensibly in her interests, but really in his own. Leonard's character is in a way the hapless victim of both, although he was the perpetrator and the original guilty party. The psychological dynamics of all this are as complex as a NATO war game. We are on the edge of our seats every second, or we are if we are interested in human nature. This is spectacle without concession. This is raw, seriously raw. Everything is ripped away here. This is what might happen at the Day of Judgement. There is nothing left to hide.

He is the master of them and that only makes me madder when he remakes movies like Bad News Bears. Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are beautiful films shot simply and effectively, showing that cinema can rely on words and actors without the need for cranes or effects. Tape is one that works very well with those as a darker companion. Adapted by Stephen Belber from his own play, Linklater gives us a claustrophobic account of three old friends' psyches as past pains are dug up to devastating effect. This is one intense film from all angles and very powerful, leading one to remember things they have done it the past that they may regret. But do we ever truly recall them how they actually happened, or just how we have seared the events into our minds? No one can know the real objective truth, just his own subjective outlook.Brought about by one man's insecurities on why his first girlfriend in high school would not sleep with him, yet as soon as they broke up did so with his best friend, the night starts out light and snowballs into more than he ever could have anticipated. Planning the entire evening in order to entrap his oldest buddy into admitting something that may or may not have happened, not even he could have imagined what emotions would be stirred up getting the two participants into the same room ten years later. Both Vince&#151;the orchestrator&#151;and Jon&#151;the accused&#151;are self-absorbed in a way that they can't see for themselves. One has not grown up and seems to be in the same rut he has been since graduation while the other has made something of his life, yet it appears somewhat shallowly and not as important as he may want to believe. Always in competition with each other to show how they differ while the other attempts to explain how they are the same, this night is no different. Neither of them has any stake in others and truly is only out to save themselves. Whether we are shown apologies, happiness, truth, or lies, every moment is self-serving, full of empty words spoken to assuage their guilt and not to instill regret or compassion for those they wronged.The title of the film is that of the device used as the catalyst for everything. Vince planned it all to perfection in his head, gets buzzed and sets up the motel room as though he was wasted (drink one beer, dump another down the drain, and throw both cans across the room). The room is made so that Jon feels a bit more open to talk, exactly what is wanted as the tape recorder listens to it all. A confession sounds a lot different when uttered than when heard from a tape. What is said in the heat of the moment can be a sobering experience when listened to and can make you think things that may or may not be true. Whether Jon truly did what he eventually confesses to is subject to opinion, and when the victim enters into the equation, you can throw all you thought was true out the window. Did she see the incident in the same way? Did she know exactly what she was doing? Only they know for certain, but the mind is a fickle machine, evolving over time, changing events to mirror the memory instead of the reality. One man's moral crusade, his attempt at gaining closure for himself while possibly also for his friends, finds that his selfishness not only could destroy the one relationship he truly relies on, but also the lives of the three involved.With an intense script to begin with, it all becomes more so from the setting and film style. Trapped in a small room for the duration, the stakes rise higher and higher as we are shown a slowly uncovering past. The camera begins to film more close-ups and we never get to go outside the door nor into the bathroom&#151;the room gets smaller and smaller until it is stifling with the addition of our last character. A big part also is the real life relationships between those involved. The three actors, as well as the director, have a bond that allows them to be as real as possible on screen, making it all believable. You have Ethan Hawke as Vince, his real-life wife at the time Uma Thurman as Amy, and I'm assuming friend Robert Sean Leonard (I guess this because he does so little work and co-starred with Hawke in Dead Poets Society that maybe he joined the cast as a favor to his friend), and close collaborator Linklater, whom Hawke has worked with extensively. Each is phenomenal in their execution and once the climax comes to a boil you finally see the true self of all. Maybe the victim is actually the strongest and maybe the self-righteous accuser is the weak link to the group, always running and always hiding. It is really up to the viewer to decide what is true and what isn't. Just because a confession is on tape does not mean it is truth. That is in the eye of the beholder.

It is so awful that words can barely describe its true awfulness.Two beta males, no, make that epsilon minus males -- have a completely boring conversation in which the more effeminate (therefore successful) asks prying questions about his pal's sex life. It's something that has bugged me since high school leading to questions like, are you tapping that? This pathetic bitchiness gets worse until Uma Thurman brightens the scenery.

When I saw the lukewarm reviews, I forgot about it. I'm glad I decided to finally give it a shot. A real-time drama unfolding in a motel room (it's no surprise to learn that it was based on a play), the film explores a lot of compelling ethical ground, and gripped me despite its simplicity. The moral high ground keeps shifting between the three characters and the film takes a strong premise to surprising places. I thought the performances by Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard were quite good... not great, but very good. While Hawke's character is believable, he seems to be laying it on a little thick. Not scenery-chewing exactly, just a little overboard. I also thought Linklater's decision to film the whole thing with fuzzy hand-held camera was a rather pointless choice. I can come up with all kinds of justifications for it, but ultimately it was distracting. However, the script is so strong and thought-provoking that it's not a major detriment.

Still not really my cup of tea though, I'll admit.This movie is like a filmed stage-play. It's set at only one location and the entire movie only features 3 characters in it. This of course means that the movie gets entirely driven by its characters and dialog. It's a small and independent movie, that nevertheless still had some big name actors involved with it.Movies like this, that are basically just filmed stage-plays, don't work out much normally. It's not really hard to see why. The movies are slow and they tend to drag with its overlong dialog. Besides there are very little things you can do, movie technically-wise, with a story that is set at only one location. You can tell that the director tried to make the movie more dynamic and lively by putting in some unusual camera-work that however to me only worked out annoying and distracting, as often would be the case with an independent movie that's all too aware of itself.This movie also does really start offs slow and also sort of uninteresting. At first it seems nice how these characters are talking and interacting with each other, which seems realistic at all but it also gets tiresome pretty fast, also since the dialog is basically going nowhere. I don't think I have ever heard the word 'why?' uttered so much in a movie. Nevertheless, once the movie gets over its slow point and the whole point of the movie its story starts to become more obvious, the movie itself becomes a far more interesting and also really better one to watch. The story does not disappoint, even though it of course is all being kept very small and simple. It's simply an effective movie at what it tries to be- and to achieve with it.A good movie within its sort.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Tape rules","Date":"19 May 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The first time I watched Tape, I did not know anything about it.

If you are the sort of person who, while watching the film, thinks whats going on, why is he doing that, you wouldn't ever do that in real life etc, i would steer clear, although people like that would more likely be put off by the film's set up/plot (three characters in one room shot with camcorders) than a review from me. There seemed to me to be a lot of devices to make sure the right characters were in the room at any given time, with people starting to leave the room, then not, just so they could hear the end of a sentence, change their mind and sit down again. The film is basically a situation drama, where the situation isn't very confining...the characters could have left the room any time they wanted. i think i probably would have. At times the rapid camera pans and occasional skewing effects felt a bit gimmicky, but i guess you've got to try these things. maybe this was to indicate how mixed up the characters were in themselves, but it can be distracting after being so sucked in by the whole film. yes sucked in is the phrase. the way the film is made makes you feel like you are part of it, at any given time one of the three characters (not necessarily the one with the dialogue either.) the plot takes several seemingly straight forward, if surprising, turns, eg, the way the eponymous tape is introduced. you follow the changes in motivations of each character, you are persuaded to their way of seeing things while you are watching it. i think you need to just go with it and analyse later. The film's roots as a stage play are very obvious, though the style of the shooting makes it feel almost more live and in your face. The action, what there is of it, is almost besides the point. i think the film would have worked as well if the 3 characters had been sitting round a table the whole time (sort of like The Designated Mourner.) the plot is there, but it is never full resolved. Not in a bad way, but more to ask the audience a question, or more like several questions. Its more about why people do things than what they actually do, and the difference between the two. Its about what it means to grow up, if we ever do, responsibility, how people perceive the same thing in different ways, friendship and how it changes and disappears, love, betrayal and well life in general. in the end its an ambiguous film about ambiguous people who you are made to care about by the quality of the whole production. you will probably watch the film from the point of view you identify with most, but, as i imagine the characters did, change your mind a lot afterwards.

This kept the film very personal, as it didn't really bother f**cking about with making it look glossy, or even particularly with taking in the background (which i suppose could be less important when the whole film is set in one room and is entirely character based). I thought the film was really funny at times, while also being very claustrophobic and unpleasant.

Not only that, it has a total of 3 actors, and one-third of the actors don't even come into the film until the halfway point. So what this means is that for about 45 minutes, you're watching two people talk in one room. No transition scenes or anything like that, no flashbacks, just one room, two people.Uma Thurman, Robert Sean Leonard, and in particular Ethan Hawke was so believable with the acting that that's all that's needed to make this movie work, since it has a perfect script. This is exactly how people in real life would act and talk. This movie sits at the polar opposite of Hollywood crap. That's not to say there's not certain Hollywood crap I do like, nevertheless, this movie is still positioned in the orientation I mentioned.I felt more suspense and tension watching them in that little room than I do from seeing most other movies where they're not confined to a closet. Big budget special effect movies can learn a thing or two from a movie like this and how important quality dialogue is to a film.Asking someone what they prefer between Tape or *insert random mindless summer action flick here* would be a good litmus test to determine whether that person should continue standing in front of you taking your stupid litmus test, or whether you should just shake your head at them in utter disgust. "},{"Title":"Three's a Company","Date":"27 February 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" It may not be the outright amazing masterpiece that was Richard Linklater's other, slightly better known film of the same year - the immaculate 'Waking Life', a viewing experience that still blows me away to this day - but 'Tape' is still a very unique and intriguing little flick that deserves to rank amongst the greater cinematic obscurities of recent years. Certainly, this is sweet simplicity at its most involving and best - aside from featuring a couple of well-known faces in its ultra-concise cast list, everything about this film, from the choice of camera to the single-room setting, is about as minimalist as a feature can get. Its origins as a stage play are fairly obvious throughout, and in some respects a staged play is what you might as well be watching here, but as a film it does have one significant advantage that Linklater puts to skilled use in bringing us closer into the characters' world - the use of angle changes and character close-ups, which gives it the texture of a fly-on-the-wall home movie more than anything else and which, ultimately, works in its favour. I've seen very few films quite like it, which manage to capture the look and feel of reality so effectively - in the absence of anything too artificial or elaborate, all it needs is a well-written script filled with naturalistic dialogue and strong, believable performances from all three cast members to cut right to the core. The end result is a wickedly astute drama of conflict, mistrust and uncertainty in one of the most everyday contexts imaginable, and which remains all the more lingering for it.A trio of old friends from high school, Vince, John and Amy, are enjoying a mini reunion which soon gives way to bitter confrontation when they gradually start digging up some unresolved issues they still have with one another - in particular concerning one eventful night in which something very non-kosher may or may not have taken place. All three characters have slightly different recollections of the night in question, and of the true extent of their actions past, and we the viewers are never truly enabled to see which of them is closer to the truth. And that's what I consider to be the true genius of 'Tape' - it manages to get you right on the edge simply by seeing their acidic disputes call each other's memories into doubt. It's just a 90-odd minute snapshot of these particular young adults' lives that leaves us deliberately helpless to their questionable reminiscing to fully understand what went on that night. It raises some questions but offers no real answers, and, while there is a neat sprinkling of laid-back, comical banter all through (including a priceless reference to 'Free Willy'), the overall taste is decisively sour. 'Tape' never really seeks to make you warm to it, just to sit there and listen to what it has to say, and it says it well. In the end I'm not sure if it really matters who, of the three, has the right perception or not - this is more about the ways in which our memories of an event can still affect us even years after the event itself. And, as 'Tape' demonstrates, memory can be a hugely deceitful and unreliable thing. It's a very simply-crafted film, but there's a lot to be had out of it.Grade A- "},{"Title":"surprised outcome","Date":"26 April 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I reviewed this film as part of my Literature class.I had never heard of it before and had no intention of watching it, but after my viewing I felt it was well worth it. The reviewAt first glance it would appear that you are watching a high school media project, with its lack of sound and rough transitions, the beginning of this film can be a turnoff. But don't be discouraged, because what follows is a labyrinth of deception that will keep you in your seat.We are met with Vince (Ethan Hawke) an aggressive, alcoholic, loser whose idea of a profession is drug dealing. He is in town staying at a cheap, shabby hotel to support his high school buddy John's entry into the Lansing Film Festival. John (Robert Sean Leonard) is a clean cut, hard-working man, who is concerned about Vince's lifestyle. When Vince and John get together at the hotel they begin to reminisce about their high school days and old flames, one in particular, Amy Reynolds (Uma Thurman). An interesting story is discovered about the night John and Amy got together. John confesses to date raping Amy and to his surprise Vince has taped the whole thing. In order to pursue what Vince calls a `moral crusade'. Vince's plan is to make John apologise to Amy. When Amy arrives at the hotel things get very interesting and a game of blackmail prevails.In this carefully planned, intricate script it is difficult to determine who is playing whom. This film is far from predictable and the closeness of each shot gives the audience a feeling of involvement within the plot. With this involvement you begin to sympathise with a character. Ethan Hawke's portrayal of Vince will win you over with his bluntness and sardonic style of comic relief. Hawke's talent really steals the scenes and Robert Sean Leonard is merely there to make Hawke look better. Uma Thurman plays a highly believable Amy, whose presence and emotion is felt throughout Tape. It is director Richard Linklater's vision that makes this film work so well and keep an audience captivated in such a small space. Linklater gives Tape a realistic quality. And an affinity is formed with his back and forth, conversational filming of Tape. With no soundtrack to back the characters actions and emotions Linklater relies heavily on the talent of the actors, which can be risky but the talent is clearly evident in this cast.Tape is an intriguing, funny and captivating film that pushes the boundaries of friendships and truths. One I thoroughly enjoyed watching. "},{"Title":"Talk, Talk, Talk  (I like talk)","Date":"2 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Spoilers Ahead.This movie is obviously a low budget movie.  Not low budget that it is cheap.  There are no car chase scene's, nothing blows up, no special effects.  The movie is simply two and then three people having a conversation in a hotel room.  The main character is Vince (Played by Ethan Hawke) who has come to town to see his high school best friend Jon Salter (Played by Robert Sean Leonard) who has a film showcasing in a local theatre.  This all takes place ten years after high school so we can assume all these characters are about twenty-eight years old, late twenties in any case.  The entire movie takes place in an average typical hotel room where Vince is waiting for his friend Jon to show up.  Jon has no intention of having anything but a get together regarding his movie and seeing an old friend.  Vince on the other hand has a specific reason for seeing Jon and it isn't the movie he made.  Ten years earlier in high school when Vince and Jon were best friends there was an incident that happened.  Vince had a girlfriend Amy Randall (Play by Uma Thurman) whom he had gone together with for some time but never had sexual intercourse with.  Vince and Amy broke up and some time after that break up Amy had sex with Jon, Vince's best friend. Needless to say Vince was very hurt and felt deceived even though him and Amy had broken up.  Amy really had the right to do what ever she pleased and it really wasn't any of Vince's business but given the same circumstances most guys would feel the same as Vince did and still does.  Any other guy but your best friend, please.  Vince was either told by Amy (Vince claims he was told by Amy) or just highly suspected that Jon had actually forced himself on Amy since he knew first hand that Jon was not a person who took No for an answer.  Vince really went to confront Jon first hand about what went on ten years earlier with Amy & Jon and to get a confession from Jon about the suspected forced sex or rape.  Vince isn't really respected much by Jon because Vince sells drugs for a living and works as a voluntary fireman where he sells drugs to the fire chief and other volunteer fireman.  Vince is actually an ethical person, he only sells drugs to consenting adults and has his scruples.  Jon still sees him just as a drug pusher and Vince sees Jon as a guy who has pushed and shoved and did what ever it took to further his own career in the movie business.  Vince wants to get an admission of rape from Jon and after much prodding and getting Jon high on some pot he does finally succeed in getting this verbal admission from Jon.  At this time Vince pulls out the hidden tape recorder and plays back the recorded confession of Jon.  Jon doesn't really seem to concerned about it until he finds out Vince has invited Amy to come to town and she will be there shortly.  Amy has no more intention of talking about what happened ten years earlier any more then Jon did.  Eventually Amy shows up and with the threat of her either hearing it directly from Vince and Vince playing her the taped confession or hearing it from Jon himself and an apology being offered.  Once Amy is involved with the whole ordeal she gets somewhat annoyed by the game Vince is playing and after Jon admits what he had done, Amy after some time finally says to Jon what she thinks Vince wants to hear her say.  Amy has become a District Attorney and she has gotten to the point where she has had enough games being played that she plays one of her own and this is where the movie ends.  I'll let you watch the movie to see what game she plays and how it affects both Vince & Jon.  It was kind of a rotten thing to do but then it was somewhat justified after what Vince had done.  This type of movie is not for everyone.  Like My Dinner With Andre there are points where it is slow but if one watches the whole thing before trying to judge the movie then one finds there are redeeming qualities.  I liked My Dinner With Andre better then Tape only because My Dinner With Andre had more conversation about everyday life.  Both are fine movies and if you like movies about verbal communication you should like both of these movies.

All the action occurs in a single hotel room during a single evening.  The action consists mostly of talk between characters, yet it kept my interest throughout.Though it's not one of my favorites, I did enjoy the movie.  Ethan Hawke is a fascinating actor to watch, appearing here as a very unlikeable character. Hawke's character, Vince, was unkempt and slovenly, and a Puck-ish troublemaker, yet Hawke managed to let us see glimmers of the charmer Vince once was, which helped a little in explaining why the other two characters would continue to allow themselves to be manipulated by him.  Robert Sean Leonard was, I thought, less successful in his role.  I found it hard to understand why he continued to pay any attention to Vince, why he didn't just walk away when Vince became offensive.  Uma Thurman did NOT look like an assistant district attorney -- even one off duty.  I thought she moved too quickly between emotions, without letting us in on the process.

Then John (Robert Sean Leonard), his old high-school friend, arrives. He is a filmmaker and his movie is shown on the Lansing film festival. For the next 45 minutes Vince, who is not the most pleasant person, and John talk about a couple of things. Vince is a drugs dealer and John thinks he should do more with his life. Then the subject is changed to a girl named Amy (Uma Thurman). Vince dated Amy in high school and John had sex with her not much later. Vince thinks it was not just sex. He says she was raped by John. John sort of admits and Vince reveals he taped the whole conversation, and John's confession. Then he makes sure Amy comes to the motel room as well. What follows is not to be revealed by me. May be I have said too much already, but it is hard to explain a movie like this.Although it is set in one room the movie has some humor and a lot of suspense. It is a drama movie but sometimes it feels like a thriller. Parts of that come from the fact that Vince is one of the most annoying, and therefor scary, characters I have seen. He is on drugs and alcohol so you can't really predict his next move. Earlier in the movie it has already come clear he is pretty violent as well.The acting here is great. The characters and the things that happen to them seem very real. Ethan Hawke is there the entire movie and he creates a creepy atmosphere in the room. The dialogues and the way the camera moves helps with that as well. What is especially good about the dialogue is that not all things said have anything to do with the main thing. They talk like real people would talk. Last but not least we have a fine direction from Richard Linklater.

The play was set in room and progressed from there. Tape takes on much the same approach, casting only 3 actors and setting it solely in a dingy motel room. The way Linklater uses the camera to his effect, is innovative and not unnerving, he keeps it simple and lets the actors ease into their roles. The acting from all 3 characters is highly commendable, Hawkes's role as a no-good drug dealing, beer drinking slacker is portrayed with style and wit. Each character's perosna is exaggerated, if a touch, too much, but the stylishness and minimlaistic approach to the film, makes it better than Dazed and Confused and Linklater's best yet.

And it's to the good; its very simplicity makes it a surprisingly compelling watch, more reminiscent of a stage play than a conventional film. It's not surprising, therefore, to discover that Tape is indeed a screen adaptation of a theatrical work by Stephen Belber. It's something of a coup for director Richard Linklater that two of the three actors are big, big names &#150; Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. Both these actors and Robert Sean Leonard, the third cast member, give natural, grounded, strong performances. The plot is simple (spoiler alert) Vince (Hawke) is in town to see the premier of a film made by his oldest friend, John (Leonard). John meets Vince in his hotel the evening before to go out for dinner &#150; but Vince seems to have a score to settle. In retrospective mood, drugged-up Vince manages to coax a confession from self-righteous John that in high school he raped Vince's first girlfriend, Amy &#150; who happens to live in the same town, and has been invited to the motel room by Vince.  So begins a bizarre psychological game between the three with many twists and turns that surprise and captivate the viewer. The film is minimalist and more performance-dependent than your average movie, but &#145;Tape' benefits from a high quality script with absorbing, flowing dialogue. If there is a criticism, it's only the fact that the players' motives remain unclear thoughout, resulting in a conclusion that may be understated but is still not entirely satisfactory.

It reminded me of Blair Witch Project- low budget, biting dialogue, interesting premise, great success. This movie is for those movie-goers that are sick of the pretentious, blithering, big-epic Hollywood nonsense that we see every Friday. Tape is an interesting, psychological look which is driven forth by the great, raw talent of the cast (Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman), and by the focus of the screenplay.

You'll think after viewing this film!Any Dead Poet fans will delight in what is essentially a continuation, years and hardening experiences ahead, of the roommate scenes from that film. Only a couple of questionable filming techniques that simply do not work, like the panning back and forth of the camera during contentious conversation, stop me from giving this film the very highest grade.

Quite a feat for an adapted play set in a low-budget moter inn with only two characters about 2/3 of the film.  Eating Raoul it is not.  But the pace between Hawke and Leonard, making as much a reunion from Dead Poets Society as from their characters' ten years hence high school, have great chemistry, far better than Thurman has with either.  The crescendo of tension cannot simply be blamed on great writing, it's also strong presence and skill by the actors.  However, the one fatal flaw for me was the terrible five minutes of cinematography when the camera swims between the two males as they argue a point.  If Linklater was attempting to create a dizzying cinematic effect, this choice actually very much hurts the experience of watching as a viewer.  There is enough of a dizzying effect from the actors' performances and the impeccable writing.  Though I am at times in wonder at Linklater's brilliance (suburbia, waking life, etc.), I am also chagrined at his inconsistencies.  Over all, a wonderful script and a tremendous interaction between actors, but some over-the-top aspects will likely prevent repeat viewing.

It has a great cast of energetic young talent who truly shine on the silver screen. These three actors are what adds fire and depth to a talkative, but otherwise compelling script from playwright Stephen Belber. In Tape, Ethan Hawke plays Vince, a young man who is staying at a motel in Lansing, Michigan. In the opening scene, we find Vince waiting patiently in his motel room for John (Robert Sean Leonard), his best friend from high school, to show. John thinks that Vince has come to Lansing to see the movie that he made being showcased at a film festival there in town. But Vince has reasons all his own for arranging this little reunion between the two of them. While John has learned to put the past behind and move on with life, Vince hasn't. Vince can't escape the fact that he's still jealous that John slept with his girlfriend Amy, after the two of them broke up. Even worse for Vince is the idea that John may have raped Amy and doesn't feel an ounce of regret for whatever he'd done to hurt her. He hopes that by getting him to admit what he did on tape, that it'll knock him off his high horse and make him want to apologize to Amy. The dialogue between the two male characters in the beginning of the film starts off as nothing but frivolous small-talk. But once the subject of the girl is brought up, the conservation goes from the trivial chit-chat to some riveting recrimination. The climax of the film comes when John finds out that Vince has invited Amy (Uma Thurman), now an assistant district-attorney in Lansing, to come over so that his apology to her will be the hardest thing he's ever had to face. I must say that this movie is a real treat for those who enjoy films with a lot of controversy in them.

Enter Uma to snarl her Euro face into that uppity countenance that won her acclaim.She does have THAT VAMP FACE.But the dialogue is too centered on single issue what being jilted feels like.After about 10 min. of this one trick pony storyline,I had to take much needed break and find some deserved action to counter my missed-out on blissfullness.And I'm not an action kinda guy by any means.I usually dread and never watch action-onlt movies.But with offings like this and my new Home Theatre set-up,I'm comfortably ready to overshadow my Drama lust in lieu of another one act,one set one tedious exercise in Who cares,Miss Snarly face and Ethan the beer guzzling maniac and his mealy-mouthed buddy from acting school.

Way back in the mens' pasts an event occurred between one of the men and the woman. The other man wants to find out the truth of what happened and force a confrontation between the woman and his friend and himself. There is so much more to it but that's a kind of basic sketch...being as general as I can be.This is an indie movie purist's dream come true. The movie really grabbed me and there wasn't one boring moment throughout. That's significant because of the type of movie it is. It has only three characters and it all takes place in a hotel room. Now many movies in general, even good movies, heck even GREAT films, can drag at times or have a few dull moments. And so, being that many movies can drag or have their dull moments, one might figure this little indie film, taking place in a room and consisting of..essentially words and conversation would have many.It has none. Not a one. There isn't a dull, draggy, or unimportant moment in the whole movie. It's absolutely riveting and I was taken with the whole thing. In terms of action there is little. Nobody ever leaves the hotel room. There are three characters. It's talky to the point where it could have been agonizing to watch but somehow the whole thing works. I'd strongly recommend it.And the scene stealer is...Uma Thurman. What a performance from her. She is fast becoming my favorite actress and even though she doesn't make an appearance to well into the flick she's great. So were the two males. (By the way is it me or does Ethan hawk's performance remind one of a few Sean Penn movies?) But Uma dominates the screen here.I'd give this a high 8. 5 of 10. Watch it as it's a gem.

Actually, the meeting is something that Vince seems to have been planning for ages because it's five to ten years since he seen any of his old friends. From this we can gather that there is a big trauma for him involving his two friends. As it turns out, Vince dated Amy but she wouldn't pull out and Vince broke off the relationship. His reason was obviously not because Amy was saving it for after marriage and therefore instead thought that he was unloved by Amy and so broke off a relationship that probably only served to strengthen Amy's self-esteem and nothing else. This seemed to be especially obvious, since Amy later got together with Jon, the other friend, and had sex with him. Vince did however suspect coercion from Jon's side for being able to sleep with Amy. How old that suspicion is, we do not know but we can suspect that Amy's rejection has hurt Vince deeply and now he wants to know for sure what happened.It is true, that we never clearly know why Amy did not want to have sex but just as she later claims that what Jon did was not rape (although we know that he has admitted it on tape), we can assume that she did not tell Vince that she was saving it for marriage, which he might have respected. We do not even know that Vince knew that she was a virgin and maybe she wasn't! As it all turns out and the reason for why this film is fascistic is that Vince, a loser in society, started out his voyage in life by being exploited by both Amy and Jon, without understanding it fully but vaguely suspecting it. In the end of the film, he is left after being fooled to waste all his capital in form of drugs and both Amy and Jon are comparably triumphant. To top this, Vince are supposed to feel sorry for breaking off with Amy, who just used him and obviously felt nothing for him, not then and not now, since she fools him into losing a lot of money, when it is obvious that he does not have so much of that stuff.Bottom line Two winners in society triumphs over a poor loser - just as it should be in any fascistic state.

Uma Thurman almost always pleasantly surprises me, especially in 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs.'  In fact, she was the most positive factor in this film full of negatives.  The actors gave a good effort, but the material is sadly lacking.  It was one of those movies you keep watching...HOPING that it will get better.  Unfortunately, it doesn't get better.  It doesn't do much of anything.I found this movie to be tedious, pretentious, and really quite tiresome.  It had a rather claustrophobic feel to it (most likely on purpose), and the characters didn't seem to be well developed.  Tape tried to have its share of twists, but they seemed scattered, ill-conceived, and not particularly compelling.The bouncy back-and-forth camerawork in one scene felt akin to having gone on a Tilt-a-Whirl and personally left me with a splitting headache.  Good concept, poor execution.In conclusion, there are a lot better ways to spend 86 minutes.  My advice is to find one of them instead of watching this movie.

Robert Sean Leonard is also strong who likewise turns a few corners over the course of a night of talking frankly with people from his past. Overall, this is a fairly minor work from one of America's most important directors, but it shows his capabilities to stretch beyond his comfort zone and mix it up within a rather unpopular but still important subgenre of drama.

Summary of the film in one line, though there is more to it than just three characters talking to one another for 90 minutes. Director Richard Linklater has interwoven a complex tale of intrigue and perception. The film opens up with Vince (Ethan Hunt) in his hotel room as he prepares himself for what seems like a wild night out as he chugs on beer, scrunching and throwing cans across the room. When the door knocks, enters the second of the films three characters Jon (Robert Sean Leonard-Dead Poets Society). As they reminisce about the past, things soon turn to a more serious matter of a girl they both knew.The conversation shifts to the girl Amy (played by Uma Thurman), who Vince use to date and Jon had sex with in high school. Vince pursues and pesters Jon on what happened on their eventful night. He wants details on how, why and where. As he goes on and on at Jon (who becomes more and more agitated in his line of questioning), he finally admits to coercing her into having sex with him. Vince being unhappy with his explanation continues in asking him how. With Vince's continual questioning, Jon finally admits to possibly raping her. As this is said, Vince goes to his bag where he reveals a tape recorder where he has been recording their conversation and replays Jon's confession. It becomes all too apparent that Vince has an ulterior motive for meeting up with his old high school buddy.With such a brave approach to having one setting and only three characters who interact with such verve in dialogue that is all too intellectual yet highly believable where one tries to gain a moral high ground on one another. As they argue with one another the camera goes back and forth like an audience watching a tennis match as argument is battered back and forth, it is such an involving way to participate in their personal debate. An experimental technique which works!The confines of the room may restrict the action but it's a film where the characters drive the narrative forward to what is an intriguing debate about perception about an event that happened 10 years ago. Where one person remembers an event in one way another person views it differently. Each actor is given enough to work with where each character is smart and articulate, where one can seem like the protagonist and then become an antagonist in one line of dialogue.The story adapt from a stage play shows its origins in it's one set, dialogue full narrative where it's all down to the actors to pull you in, in it's exchanges between one another as information is feed to us and where not everything is as clear as mud. When you feel one character is gaining the upper hand on the argument it suddenly turns and the other character is in fact the one who is right. It raise a lot questions which not all may be answered but is thoroughly enjoyable thought provoking debatable film.If you liked my review please visit my blog http//fsfilm.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Surprised","Date":"18 September 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" My roommate and I were just chilling one night and this movie came on, and throughout the whole movie, we could not remove our eyes from the screen.

Tape is probably one of the best examples of his craft as a director, because he did not write the script, and it involves only three characters in the same place a hotel room. For less than an hour and half, Linklater takes these people to heaven, drags them to hell; and takes them up and down for a while more.OK I might be exaggerating a little, but not too much. The tension and unusual suspense we find in a small room in Tape is comparable to the typical one we find in a whole city in The Sixth Sense. I'm talking about the unusual suspense that makes you want to bite your nails because you feel as nervous as the characters.Based on his own stage play, Stephen Belber's script narrates the encounter Vince (Linklater regular Ethan Hawke) and John (Robert Sean Leonard), two very good friends, have with Amy (Uma Thurman), about something that happened ten years before, during high school. Vince is a drug-addict/dealer, John a filmmaker and Amy a district attorney&#133;I'll leave it there.The film has a theater play look; but it is essentially a film. This is what Linklater never forgets when he is working that he is making movies. You wouldn't get his multiple shots, unpredictable close-ups that seem amateurish on purpose on a theater stage. And it is true that the magic of theater is that you don't get a second chance if you mess up but, to tell the truth; Tape looks like it was shot without pause, or at least Linklater makes us believe so.It's a delicate work by Maryse Alberti and Sandra Adair, director of photography and editor, respectively. The film changes the mood constantly and the camera is the main element present to show that, while the edition must go along with it. The way in which the characters ask daring questions and raise the tone of their voices is accurately shown in this attentive technical work.The performances are the core of the piece and, thanks to Linklater, are unquestionably top- notch. Angry and ironical, Ethan Hawke plays Vince in an over the top way that's not enough over the top to still seem real. Robert Sean Leonard, who made a decent career after his young success with Dead Poets Society (where Hawke also appears) and is now a respectable actor, constructs a restrained but distrustful portrayal about a man who always looks about to explode. Finally, Uma Thurman commits herself with a performance that combines beauty and innocence with intelligence and unpredictability in a logical way. There's something special about the performances; about the way in which the characters (especially Hawke) say common words like what or how or why, and it increases the amusement of the experience.The title Tape comes from something Ethan Hawke's character records in a cassette. You'll see what it is and how pointless it appears to be; but then you'll see how Linklater and his direction, Balber's script and their movie manage to turn it into the most important thing in the world.

By removing the complexity of film in the technical and aesthetic sense, Linklater allows you to plunge into the minds of the characters without distraction. Its also always nice to see some familiar faces in Hollywood turn their attention to grassroots film-making. Ethan Hawke's ability to use the slightest details to create a big character shines in the film. Robert Sean Leonard shows that he can play characters who aren't so warm and fuzzy (though I don't mind it when he does i.e. Dead Poet's Society, Much Ado About Nothing).

Both plays have a similar kind of construct to them where there is a premise and pull that has the characters where they are in their one-room setting (Match had a man visiting another older man seemingly unknowing at first tagging along with his girlfriend really seeking out if the man is his father or not), while always with realistic dialog. And the realism with Tape all has to do with the situation and the mind-games pulled by the most torn, fascinating character, Vincent (Ethan Hawke). He is payed a visit by filmmaker Jon (Robert Sean Leonard) in town for a film he has in a festival. Vincent, unlike Jon, is a nowhere man with his life, drug dealer and sometimes firefighter who decides the night before Jon's big movie opens to put him between a rock and a hard place; admitting to Vincent's first girlfriend Amy (Uma Thurman) that one night Jon had his way with her.It's not that Tape is completely without some conceits that might come with a play as opposed to one with a film. The last few minutes are almost too funny for the double-cross that is pulled on Vincent. But the limitations on such an indie as this- which looks so much so that one wonders if it was all filmed in less than a week- are not really to be pondered so much as what the strengths are. Belber's ear for how these character interact, in equal measures of being pushy, apologetic, uncomfortable, surprised, shocked, bemused and tense all goes hand in hand with having it set in such a small motel room in the middle of the night. Hawke has an underrated- or rather underseen due to its low-level indie appeal- performance here, as someone who decides to get loaded to assist himself in his arrogance in the situation; his physical presence early on is also of interest as before he slowly, sneakily unleashes his conversational intentions unto the adamantly nice and introspective Jon, he bounces around the room like a loon. Thurman, too, is excellent here in a restrained performance, but one where she shows so much in many a reaction shot.And these shots, from a film-making point of view, keep the material involving even in the more contrived moments. Linklater and his crew keep things going as if it's one of the best student films you've ever seen. The editing is always at a speed to keep up with the characters timing with their dialog and looks (which work best with Hawke), and there's even a Cassavetes style to the level of human drama with the proceedings of both substance and style mixed together. It's one of those cases where you really don't mind- and after a while notice too much- the hand-held quality where to add some spark to the bigger back and forth moments he whips the camera like one might if looking at them each as they speak. You get the tension and the emotion, but it's never as dull of expectable as a soap opera. And aside from the music in the end credits, it's all in real-time as its being seen. If it's not great it's maybe because Belber has to have some kind of kick in the story to set it off (i.e. the tape itself). But with Linklater's eye and a cast like this, it's hard to complain. One of the better films of 2001, definitely of the independent vein.

As their conversation progresses they go through various real subjects whose dialogue are perfectly. The acting here is terrific in showing how people aren't perfect.

It's a beautiful sight to watch as Vince manipulates his oldest friend into thinking that he did something he didn't. John is the intellectual man of principle but is flawed too, he is so interested in portraying the ideal personality but he thinks twice. As the film comes to a close Uma Thurman enters the picture and helps the viewer to better understand all of the characters. But just as any normal person might, she also confuses the situation. She has an interesting personality of her own and when she is confronted with the conversation that the men had earlier she has a conflicted reaction.Her character is just as twisted as the others but in the end she helps them all to realize how f****d up they really are. This movie presents a real conversation between two people who don't live in reality and to see that and more importantly to be able to show that is spectacular.

Ethan Hawke is the worst - he hasn't given a bad performance for several years now, but this stops that streak. Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman also overplay. This is the biggest mood killer that the film has to face, and it would have survived it, barely, if it weren't for a few more problems.Second, the film is too jokey.

The performances are all good (Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman), but the subject matter is so trivial, it barely seems worth recording on tape (or filming).  I couldn't really understand why Leonard's or Thurman's character didn't just leave the hotel room out of sheer boredom.  I know I wanted to.      Technically, the film is a hodgepodge of amateur film student technique (the persistent close-ups, the roving camera), that is supposed to distinguish it as indie (as though poor technique constitutes maverick-ism).  Does shooting an inordinate number of close-ups keep the filmmakers' costs down?  I guess the idea is to create a sense of nervous tension and uncomfortable intimacy, but we're already in a cramped hotel room, for God's sake, what more do you need?  As for the play, it has its bouts of stunted cleverness, but ultimately doesn't amount to much.  When Uma turns the tables at the end, it rings slightly hollow, since all the angst is so irrelevant in the first place.  Tape finally sounds like something David Mamet wrote, then threw away.  2** out of 4  "},{"Title":"This movie made me want to hurt people","Date":"29 March 2003","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I hate the fact that the movie I make my first comment on has to be negative.  However after watching this film one night on HBO, I feel it is my duty to let the world know how bad it is.  Never have I seen a cast this good in a film so bad.  Everything about this movie is dragging, and the thing that makes it so bad is you keep watching hoping that it will get better, but yet it doesn't and the story keeps on dragging.  By the time the film ended I thought was going to rage out on my roommates because I watched this crap!  I can not say anything good about this film except, the actors in it are good in many of their other films, but not this one.  If you stumble across this movie on tv change the channel.  If you see this movie on the shelves at your local blockbuster, go find something else, it is going to be a waste of time and money if you watch it.

Each works well enough in its own way, but it completely eludes me what the two have to do with each other. Or even if they touch. It is as if the director wanted to do something serious cheaply. The serious part is his approach to the material. The cheap part is the material.`Blair Witch 2' explored this area with more cleverness I think. (I'm not kidding!)So far, I know only one other Linklater project `Dazed and Confused' which seems like a poor copy of prior material. Looks to me that he isn't worth following. But Ethan Hawke might be. What impresses me is how an actor fills the space the director doesn't know about. His `Hamlet' was quite intelligent. He actually understood the play, unlike Mel Gibson. Here, he tries to be the bridge between the two halves I mentioned by playing a character who is playing a character that is dimly resolved, rather as if he had defined himself through tape.

After some talk Vince badgers Jon about the fact that Jon had had sex with Vince's girlfriend, Amy, just after they broke up.  He keeps forcing questions until Jon admits he raped her - a statement Vince captures on tape.  With Amy on the way to the room to meet Vince to catch up, the stage is set for old secrets and hurts to be unearthed.Having seen Dogma recently, I am weary of critics just calling things a `filmed play' because I know from that film that the media can add a lot to a play.  However here the fact that it has been filmed adds nothing of value to what is essentially a good story with good dialogue and interesting characters.  The camera zooms back and forward between people as they talk and it lies back as an observer but really it just serves to distract than add.  I will ignore the media for now though, and look at the content. The film is compelling and enjoyable and I would love to see it as a play; the basic story twists and turns with slight touches.  I didn't know where it was going and I was held by it more or less for the whole film - only a slow start hindered my enjoyment of it.The dialogue is great - it fits the characters and rarely sounds forced or contrived.  Sadly the bits that do sound forced are entirely the fault of Ethan Hawke.  As much as I feel for the problems and hurts he must now have, his performance at the start is pretty poor.  He forces his character and doesn't convince as Vince.  Happily he is carried for the majority of the film as the focus leaves him and settles on Jon and then Amy.  Leonard is really quite good and his character is convincing.  Thurman's character has to veer all over the place and she deals with it very well.  Those who believe she was `acting' in Kill Bill should see this film for an idea of what she looks like when she acts!As a film, I don't know what to say.  In a way I am glad it was a film because it brought it to my attention and I may not have seen it otherwise, but that isn't enough by itself.  I don't understand why Linklater simply filmed the play as if it occurred on a stage.  I accept that it was done on the cheap but placing it on film should have added to it - sadly it only serves to take away.  A good play can have intimacy even with a large audience; the film should have easily been intimate as it can get as close as it wants, but the spinning camera etc damage it in that regard.Overall this is well worth seeing.  The material is well written and engaging, while the cast are very good despite carrying Hawke.  I just wish that the committing to film and the direction of Linklater had added something to it.

Two high school friends who have apparently kept up with one another meet again after 10 years in a Michigan motel. Hawke is an extrovert who works as a volunteer fireman when he isn't selling drugs while Leonard is an introverted movie producer in town for a film festival. Leonard had what he thought was a one night stand with Hawke's ex-girl friend during their senior year in high school but Hawke imagined it a rape and a betrayal of their friendship. It seems he has plotted for all those years for some form of retribution and since the girl coincidentally lives in this town, his opportunity has arisen.The game he constructs becomes becomes a verbal chess match that Hawke is secretly taping. Leonard finally becomes guilt ridden in a far too literary way and confesses his sin only to learn of the tape and Thurman's unexpected, to him, arrival.What did happen that night and what the others thought and felt is what makes the interaction of the characters interesting. The ending is a little weak and Leonard is unconvincing but Thurman shows stardom and Hawke is excellent as the trapped manipulator.

The downside of this tale is that I didn't enjoy the characterizations of the three principles. Ethan Hawke's character, in particular, as a puppet master who gets caught up in his own strings, is a well acted performance, but his character's a jerk. I wouldn't want to spend 5 minutes with this guy. His male friend starts off as common sensual but then begins to enjoy the abuse being handed out by Hawke. Then, Uma Thurman enters the movie after it's half over and complicates matters greatly. No one talks in complete sentences at that point and the director doesn't help by having the cameraman swing his camera to and fro between talking heads, creating a dizzying effect that makes itself too obvious. A bit of crisp editing might've been a better choice at that point. Overall, this is a great film about people I couldn't stand to be around. It succeeds on that level and drowns on every other.

BUT.......being a big fan of Mrs.Hawke, now Miss Thurman again, since her astonishing appearance in Pulp Fiction, it is simply amazing what a difference the director makes. I mean, two years after Tape she appears again in a Tarantino hit movie and yet again a sparkling performance, but her acting in Tape really sucks, as does the plot, as does her former husband. The only thing worth seeing was Robert Sean Leonard, so if you're a fan of him only, I guess you could rent the video/DVD on a very rainy day.....Otherwise you will end up seeing this film feeling exactly the same as me, very, very, very disappointed.What a waste of talent!!!

Not the best way to start a review but hey, it was a kick arse, intelligent film. I really hadn't read about the film before going to see it other than who was in the cast and who directed it. Linklater is one impressive director. Having seen Waking Life 6 months ago I can say that he is now on my gotta watch list of film makers. Being a bit of an Ethan Hawke fan it was wonderful to see another wonderful performance from this young actor. You could see that these guys all work well together, especially seeming they film the entire picture in one small hotel room.This film was adapted from a play written by Stephen Belber which was highly evident. More films should be adapted this way, you seem to get a more dramatic and working with the audience feel to the picture. Not only was this film one of the best acted pictures I have seen for a while it was god damn funny! The dark humor had the audience constantly in a state of eagerness to laugh, some nice new original jokes and quick witty humor is a refreshing change from 'gross out' humor. Final comments What can I say, this film festival keeps getting better and better, having now seen Insomnia and The Tracker, Tape was great to get on the funny side of film. A definite must see, hope there is an interesting DVD to go with this one, the behind the scenes footage should be excellent.

Directed by Richard Linklater, who put together such screen gems as Waking Life and Dazed and Confused, the film plays out like a stage presentation.  There is one set, a low rent hotel in Detroit, and only three actors to carry a story that revolves around the two leads (Ethan and Robert Sean Leonard) meeting on the eve of the premiere of director John (Robert).  It only takes a few moments to see the contrast in the two old school chums.  Ethans character (Vince, no last name given), is still the loose, immature, drug addict/dealer that he was in 10 years ago.  John is the nerdy, yet now filmmaker ying to his yang. The title for the movie 'tape' comes from a scene when Vince secretly tape records John admiting to a possible rape of fellow schoolmate Amy years ago. Vince and John argue over the tape when a knock at the door reveals 'Amy', wonderfully and subtely played by Uma Thurman.  Heavy conversations continue to ensure and the trio never leave the room as the discuss each others state of mind, the past and the perception of the rape.   Linklater, carries the script of Stepher Belber (from his play), with such ease, that you truely believe these characters to be real.  The characters are so diverse, however, we all have a Vince, Amy and John that we used to school with. Linklater has done better work, namely Dazed and Confused, however this character study is handled with such interest, that you don't even mind that the whole movie takes place in the same room. Ethan Hawke plays his most interesting and genuine character to date. If you want a good rental of two or three individuals challenging each other in real life conversations, get Tape and thank me later.
