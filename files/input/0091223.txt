I loved it!!! I found it scary and dark and mysterious and funny and i think i've added too many 'ands' to this review already.This is about a horror writer (Roger Cobb) who is working on his next book about his experiences in the Vietnam War. His Aunt seemingly has committed suicide and has left the house to him in her will so Roger goes there to work in solitude and is bothered by ghosts and his next door neighbour. He also has to find his lost son who went missing in that house many moons ago.This is excellent, it truly is. The title is simple but effective and unlike Amityville we see the nasty things that lurk in this house. The video cover is nice too, really eye catching. Roger sets out on a mission to kick ass. Not just the evil ghosts within his house and beyond but his own personal demons. I love that scene where his ex wife turns into that fat monster thing and he blows her away and....well i don't want to spoil it for anybody but it's awesome. The eighties was by far the best for movies especially horror and sci-fi. We won't see movies like this ever again. GOD DAMN YOU Hollywood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'House' is awesome straight from the spooky beginning (did i tell ya that this movie is well spooky?) to the twisty horrible shocking end. Go watch this magnificent film straightaway! Did i say that the comedy is kick ass?

In bits and pieces, the audience discovers that Roger once lived in the house, as well, along with the aunt, Roger's wife, and their now-missing son, Jimmy. Roger believes that Jimmy is trapped somewhere in this mysterious house, which just happens to be some sort of portal between past and present dimensions...I think? Anyway, the audience becomes involved, well, at least myself and the rest of my company became involved, and you start to feel for this poor guy who has really sorry luck...in all areas. Roger, our tattered hero, has the pretty neighbor Tanya, who likes to come and swim in his pool, and who ALWAYS catches him at the worst times. Then he has the nosy neighbor Harold, played by George Wendt, who might be out to exploit him or may just be generally concerned. I don't know. Then there is the neighborhood dog who likes to dig up Roger's saplings....Overall, I find this to be a fairly underrated little horror movie. It's definitely one of Steve Miner's more innovative attempts, and the music, reminiscent of the F13 music and performed by the same man, Harry Manfredini, is thoroughly haunting. Also, most importantly, the acting is believable. Major points for that. None of this movie is hokey. It could have been...but it wasn't. 7/10 is my vote.

And I love every minute of it.  The Friday the 13th team (Steve Miner, Sean S. Cunningham, and Harry Manfredini) strikes again.  Even Kane Hodder (Jason) does some stuntwork.  The story and the script are both great thanks to Fred Dekker (The Monster Squad) and Ethan Wiley (House II).  Steve Miner succeeds in creating the atmosphere of an old house and in finding a likable cast as well.  The cast includes William Katt (Carrie) as the unlucky lead Roger Cobb, George Wendt (Normie from Cheers), and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court).  My favorite cast member is probably the house itself.  It's perfect, I think they made it just for this movie.  The effects and makeup are great for the eighties.  Skeleton Big Ben is awesome.  One standout scene is Roger and the mini-demons playing tug-a-war with the little boy Robert (Miner's own kid).  The score, by Manfredini, is highly similar to that of Friday the 13th, but I love still love it.  House is a well put together, underrated horror movie.  If you're going to buy a house this year, make it this one.

All these things start fraying at his psychological health; he's not coping well.What's haunting him most of all is the guilt he feels over an incident while he was serving in Vietnam. His buddy is wounded, and requests that William kill him, but William runs for help and his buddy is captured, to suffer torture as a POW.His ordeal at this time in his life that we watch through the movie is his final process of dealing with that guilt.Along the way, we are treated to that unique genre of horror-comedy. And, make no mistake, it is both funny and frightening.The difficult thing is the direction, which tries to suggest that what he sees (and what we, the audience see) is not what others see. These things are presented so as to fool him, and us, into thinking they are in fact real. By the time we get to the end, we see what the real deal is.It's not perfect, but it was fun.

Unfortunately, right when you've come to that conclusion, the horror comes to a screeching halt and it turns into a kooky comedy. It's as if the director set out to make a serious psychological horror, but decided it was too hard and completely shifted moods for the rest of the movie.Once you can accept this, however, it is very entertaining. Roger Cobb is quite the interesting hero--the way he deals with the demons in his house is very odd, but hey, it's nice to see someone fight back in a horror movie for once. The middle of the movie is just crazy (but fun), and the last third is very, very good. The eerie scene where he is descending by a rope into what is apparently Hell itself is a classic horror movie scene, in my opinion. And the climactic ending with the zombie commando is too awesome for words.This isn't a true Horror movie by any means, but rather silly 80s cheese--but in that sense, it is the best of its kind. 8/10 stars.

House is definatly the best film of William Katt's career(well known for his work in the Perry Mason made for TV movies) In House,  he plays a recently divorced man who is haunted by the disappearence of his son.  In order to get back on track,  he returns to the site of his son's dissapearence,  a supposedly haunted house which was left to him.  Of course,  things go arwy,  and soon he is plauged by an obnoxious neighbor(played fantasticly by George Wendt) and several strange ghosts and ghouls intent on playing with his fragile sanity.  There are some really errie moments,  but the film as a whole maintains a playful atmosphere. This is a movie that depending on your mood will either have you jumping in your seat, laughing your head off, or both.  Definately worth the hour and a half.

It adds a spooky atmosphere and then in the middle You're No Good and Dedicated to the One I Love are played. Now, that is funny. Nothing says let's bury the body parts of my gigantic, demonic, purple clad, ex-wife quite like those tunes. This movie has a fine sense of goofy humor hit home by capable actors. The scene where George Wendt's Harold meets William Katt's Roger (ha ha) is amusing in it's realistic awkwardness. I love the smile that Roger's grandmother gives the police and the scenes with the little boy are surprisingly innocuous. You get to see a flying deadite a year before Evil Dead II and a spry corpse that would have kicked Bud's rotten can. This movie reminds me of Cherry Falls in the way that it comes so close to being just another scary movie, but can't be discarded so easily. The fact that the director, Steven Miner, had directed Friday the 13th part 2 and 3 makes you respect this movie even more. Watch for Dwier Brown(Mom and Dad Save the World, House 2 The Second Story) as a soldier, Mindy Sterling(Frau Farbissina!) as an annoying fan, Steven Williams(Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday) as a cop, and Michael Ensign(Titanic, Ghostbusters, and Doctor Hackenstein!) as the realtor. Richard Moll(Bull from Night Court and Two Face from Batman The Animated Series) lends his gruff voice in a memorable turn as Big Ben, while William Katt(Carrie) is a sympathetic lead.P.S.

I truly have a soft spot for it. Yeah it's a mess, a clueless and incoherent one. However it's goofy nature, vivid visual effects and willing performances lend very well to a competent looking production&#133; yeah so what if those Vietnam flashbacks looked hokey and it's origins are cheap. This was the third film under the belt of director Steve Miner, who a couple years earlier brought us the raw, opening sequels 'Friday the 13th' Part 2 and 3'.Miner is joined by producer Sean S. Cunningham, the man behind the original 'Friday the 13th'. This time it's far from chilling (but it doesn't feel like its trying either&#133; well there are moments, lightly done though), as the angle is focused on the comedy, even if it doesn't have you constantly laughing out loud. It remains amusing nonetheless, while managing to be unpredictable in a way. We've flooded with ideas, artistic lashings and loose writing. William Katt makes for a likable victim, to his worrying state of thinking his going crazy due to the traumatic stress (war experience, missing child and marriage failure) or maybe it's the house and its dark, devious secrets preying upon his fragile mind.Roger Cobb is a Vietnam VET/ horror novelist that has tragedy on mind after the strange disappearance of his son Jimmy when visiting his aunt's house. His obsessive quest on finding him takes on a huge toll on his marriage, as his wife leaves him and now he wants to write a book about his Vietnam experience despite the growing success of his horror novels. After the death of his aunt, he heads back to the house and decides this is where he would write his new book. However he finds out there's more to this house, and maybe a chance to find his son again.Sounds like the typical haunted house shenanigans&#133; Well to a point. There are monsters (creative animation/ rubber make-up and the zombie soldier design looks awesome) stemming from portals to other universes through closet doors and bathroom mirrors. In the end I guess there just wasn't enough of it, compared to its boundless sequel 'House II The Second Story'. The psychological aspect (yes it tries) is muddled and never truly explored; because it lets the daftness and convoluted tone take control of anything of importance through its Vietnam slant. Miner keeps a steady pace, drawing some minor moments of suspense and unhinged weirdness. The direction can feel a little too staged, and planned out in its set-pieces due to its change in shifts. Although the execution comes off better than it probably should have and is fairly presentable, as just look Mac Ahlberg's polished cinematography as the camera seamlessly glides through the set-pieces and Harry Manfredini's score is elastically piercing in its perky arrangement.Like I mentioned up further, Katt brings along an honest and capable performance. Around him is a down-to-earth turn by George Wendt. Who is good fun as Cobb's interfering neighbour. The stunning Kay Lenz doesn't get a lot to do, but her warm presence doesn't look out of place and Richard Moll is imposing as Cobb's Nam buddy. The beauty of Mary Stavin engulfs the few scenes she's in. Another asset you could say, and just as part of the film's character is the house itself. A formidable setting, but it didn't entirely have the lasting impact like I would've hoped and that's why the atmosphere (quite patchy) across the board didn't always have the same effect.Loony, spontaneous comedy/horror that doesn't entirely hit the mark, but does plenty to tweak ones interest.

Sequels were obligatory and every year saw another Freddy, Jason, Pinhead or Michael Myers shocker. Among these were the House movies, which are a lot better than the genre reputation suggests.First and foremost, this is not strictly a horror film. There are some sprinklings of light comedy here and there and the monsters are so ridiculous that they don't really scare. It sure makes for a welcome change in a decade full of blood, knifings and slayings.Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a horror novelist, suffering from writers block. He can't seem to continue with his latest book, a recollection of his tour in 'Nam. The fans are eager but they want horror, not some war story. On top of all this, he is also dealing with a divorce and coping with the mysterious disappearance of his son. Depressed, he moves to his aunt's house, from where his son vanished and in which the old lady hung herself. A creepy log cabin in the mountains might be more appropriate, as Roger finds just as many distractions here.The first distraction is his neighbour Harold (George Wendt), who shows up at the worst moments to hassle Roger in the Ned Flanders style. The second distraction is a little more sinister. Monsters burst out of the closet at midnight, doors in the house lead into different dimensions and he is haunted by the memories of his best friend (Richard Moll), whom he betrayed back in 'Nam. Third, there is a sexy blonde, who bathes in his pool.One of the most appealing things about House is that Roger doesn't respond with any clichéd horror movie tactic - running away, falling flat on his face, hiding under the sink, etc. Instead, he buys a camcorder and tries to capture the monsters on film to convince Harold, and himself, that he is not crazy.He even manages to persuade Harold to help him catch a big raccoon, which hides out in a certain closet and only shows itself at midnight. Even at this, Harold gets scared, but not us. The film is only slightly dark and keeps a jovial mood for an hour and a half.Steve Miner (Halloween H20, Lake Placid) intrigues us as much as Roger as to what the hell is going on. Ethan Wiley's script is the tiniest bit loose, but is smarter than you would think and even contains a few little touches that you might miss on the first couple of viewings.It could have been beefier and longer, but if it was, it wouldn't be as irresistibly charming.

He walks up to the front door and as he knocks it opens. He calls out to the owner Mrs. Elizabeth Hooper (Susan French), he says he will leave the groceries on the table but still does not get an answer. He feels uneasy & starts to look around the house. After going upstairs he finds Elizabeth dead, seemingly having committed suicide by hanging herself. Elizabeth's nephew Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a Vietnam Vet, successful novelist who is currently struggling to write his new book about his experiences in Vietnam & is recently divorced from television actress Sandy Sinclaire (Kay Lenz) after their young son Jimmy (Erik & Mark Silver, identical twins maybe?) had disappeared without a trace while at the house. Roger decides to stay in his Aunt's old house to get away from things & concentrate on his novel. Almost immediately strange & bizarre occurrences start to happen, Roger sees the ghost of his Aunt who warns him to leave & when he opens a closet is attacked by a slimy monster. Things become worse as Roger is attacked by flying garden tools & fat ugly monsters, Roger starts to investigate the house & becomes convinced that the answer to finding his lost son lies within if he manages to survive! Directed by Steve Miner I thought House was an entertaining & modest little comedy horror. The script by Ethan Wiley based on a story by Fred Dekker mixes the horror & dark humour quite well, it keeps the film moving along at a nice pace although one or two sections dragged a little. Things aren't tied up that well though, the haunted house goings-on are not explained at all, was it just Ben using the house as revenge or is the house really haunted? And what connection does Ben have to the house in the first place? House isn't a sadistic film in terms of violence & gore but there is some here & a few fun looking monsters, I especially liked the fat female creature in her pink dress & Big Ben's (Richard Moll) rotting zombie make-up is reasonably impressive & he makes for a cool bad guy. William Katt makes for a likable hero & George Wendt's nosey neighbour Harold Gorton is very funny even though he isn't in the film that much. None of the other characters are developed that much. Technically the film is OK, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either except the Vietnam flashback sequences that were obviously shot in a cheap looking studio set. The special effects, while their a little cheesy & aren't exactly going to impress anyone too much these days are watchable enough. Overall I liked House's fun mix of horror & comedy, it's a decent enough way to pass an hour and a half & you could do a lot worse. Definitely worth a watch.

He hasn't been there long before strange things start to happen; he is attacked by a strange creature in the closet and when his ex turns up she suddenly turns into a ghoulish creature! There is certainly something peculiar about the house; it isn't just the strange creatures that appear at certain times there appear to be portals through which he can pass to somewhere entirely different; sometimes a dark, bottomless void, other times to the jungles of Vietnam where he once served. It is the latter that provides the films main antagonist; Big Ben; a fellow soldier who has returned from the dead to take his revenge on Roger for something that happened during the war. As well as dealing with the terrors in his house Roger must deal with a neighbour who keeps disturbing him and babysit a child in the house that has already taken his son.This film is a lot of fun; there are a few scares and plenty of laughs. William Katt does a decent job as protagonist Cobb and George Wendt is amusing as his annoying neighbour Harold. The effects are pretty good for what was never going to be a major film; I especially liked back-from-the-dead Ben... a character that managed to be both menacing and funny. The story is fairly basic but that doesn't matter as there is always something happening. This may seem dated to modern audiences but I liked the fact that the effects were 'real' rather than CGI and the lack of gore and anything really nasty means it can be enjoyed by younger teens... it was given a '15' certificate by the BBFC but I suspect it would only get a '12' if it were certificated today; it is certainly at the tamer end of the '15' certificate.

House is an unusual horror film, probably the best way I can describe it. There are some nicely done horror scenes, with good old stop motion and make up effects. Also, though, the movie sports many comedic elements. It's a strange story but one I really enjoy. The film reaches a balance between these two moods, while also delivering some surreal moments. Harry Manfredini's score is also pretty interesting, fun yet also keeping a sinister chime. I suppose I have an affinity for the strange and you don't see films like this now-a-days, it's a damn shame. No one takes creative risks in the horror genre anymore; everyone just follows protocol sad to say.I would love to someday see a re-make of this film, and as a future film-maker, I'd love to handle such a project.

The film opens pretty well - a grocery boy delivering some groceries to an elderly woman in a Victorian house discovers her hanging in her bedroom. Now, her nephew, Roger Cobb, a famous novelist, has inherited the old mansion, and decides to go stay there for a while to work on his Vietnam-experiences novel, after recently suffering through a divorce and the loss of his son who has gone missing.

William Katt, who played Tommy Ross in the De Palma classic, Carrie, plays Roger Cobb in this film, and doesn't give a bad performance on any terms. The entire cast really isn't bad either. The story was interesting at some moments, but I was a little disappointed there. While this film is distinctly more comic than horrific, I was expecting something that was leaning on a more gruesome side. In a sense, this film can be seen as very fun, but in my mindset, I was expecting something different. There are a few creepy moments, and the beginning scene was done pretty well with the surprise body that swings on screen. The special effects were kind of campy, and the creatures were really funny looking (I laughed quite a bit when the woman turned into the slug-looking creature). Not entirely convincing, but I wasn't expecting marvelous effects, I mean, this is an '80s horror film. I'm not really sure about this movie, it's hard for me to decide whether I lean towards liking it or not liking it, and that's a rarity for me - I usually really like a film or I just don't.Overall, House is an unconventional and interesting movie. It leans toward comedy most of the time, but mixes in some horror, and I'm just not sure the combination worked quite right. I laughed on quite a few occasions, but was rarely remotely spooked. I don't know, maybe I should have sat down and watched it and expected more humor. Not a bad movie though, and recommended for those who enjoy late '80s horror flicks like this (and who don't mind their horror with some laughs).

But the memories of the house come back to him, as this was where he lost his son and his marriage began to fall apart. And what is up with all the demons hiding in the closet? While my favorite film in the House series is part two, the entire run was respectable. We have some of the better acting for horror films of the time, and an interesting and original plot. The biggest flaw really is the poor makeup effects (especially on Big Ben). Well, that, and the Vietnam theme. I think that was played up a bit too much.Bull from Night Court appears as Big Ben, a Vietnam soldier captured by the Vietnamese. His role is very important, although the acting comes across as flat. I do not know if he is a poor actor or if the script simply did not give him much room to work, but the entire Ben subplot is a bit lacking.At the same time, we have George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) as a friendly neighbor who has no problem inviting himself in for some pizza and beer. Wendt is wonderful and really makes this film fun, just as he would do twenty years later in John Landis' Family. He also starts the trend of Cheers actors in the House series (John Ratzenberger appears in part two).The film is fun, and a good pace. Nothing very scary here, not even the closet that goes straight to what looks like Cthulhu's basement. But sometimes you do not need scares and scantily-clad women. Sometimes you need a little fun, and you will find it here (and even more in House II). I liked it. Watch it. You will like it. "},{"Title":"Is that the guy from Night Court?

Roger Cobb (William Katt) is a famous author, who returns to his childhood home after the death of his Aunt. We also find out that his son Jimmy went missing in the house a few years earlier, and that the house has some sort of portal to the other side. Throw in a goofy neighbor (George Wendt) and a really cool looking villain (Richard Night Court Moll) as Big Ben, and you have one hell of a horror romp. The comedy aspect of the film is what really drew me in, hysterical one liners and situations, the special effects are really scary and Steve Miner hammers the horror home. No CGI crap here, just classic 80's horror at it's finest and still a potent force after twenty years. Great family horror fun.

Would he rather forget that one and cling to the memories of House.Or how about Kay Lenz, she who has the most amazing jaw line, should they ever consider a revamp of Doc Savage look no further, Ms Lenz's career highlight for me was the very excellent 'Stripped To Kill' which had hot dancers, a killer soundtrack and a pretty decent storyline.George Wandt as Harold Gorton I could take or leave, his acting style has never really amounted to much for me, as for behind the camera, Steve Miner was already a seasoned professional when it came to this style of movie-making and as his mentor Sean S. Cunningham was their as his guiding light how could he fail.Of course the greatest aspect for me was the script, complete with a story by Fred Dekker, who really should try for a comeback, and a script by Gremlin puppeteer Etahn Wiley, Mr Wiley's career truly has been all over the place.No matter how many sequels that came to pass, you really can't deny that this first excursion into household terror really was the best, in fact it was priceless!....10/10 "},{"Title":"What`s next to happen in that house?","Date":"30 July 2001","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.

Not just is this film horror but also it has enough humor to also give a viewer laughs and most of all the story is well written by watching the movie the story reveals the whole plot of the movie though it takes time to develop it all comes together in the end. House is one of the better liked horror films of the 80's you can notice by the continued airings it receives on both premium and basic cable, I remember first watching House in the summer of 1988 and many times since I have viewed it when it shows on cable I even used to have a recorded copy put away. William Katt is great as a novelist(Roger Cobb) who moves into his dead aunt's house only to slowly but certainly find it is a haunted home with terror and most of all secrets. You see how the secrets brought out relate to the story so well as the connection to the abduction of the son of Roger Cobb and former Mr. Cobb war friend are made known in the end. Richard Moll was great as Big Ben and George Wendt couldn't have been better as the obnoxious and nosy neighbor of Roger Cobb. I must mention the scenes in House were great you just got a mixture of humor and suspense. I loved the scene when the dead fish comes alive and the other scenes of the closet monster along with the ugly fat monster, flying shovel and ax plus the Big Ben skeleton just made House very enjoyable. So if you haven't watched or want to watch again watch House especially when you want humor and a little suspense the cable networks both premium and basic give it many showings the acting is good so enjoy the 80's most underrated horror film.

His estranged wife Sandy, (Kay Lenz) takes this as a great sign of progress, and from her response, he decides to rent his recently-deceased aunt's mansion to get some fresh inspiration. As he starts to work on it, he begins to experience strange and ghosts inside, which he explains to his neighbor Burt Gorton, (George Wendt) who think he is going crazy. As the visions and experiences start getting stranger, he looks to other avenues to fight the supernatural within the house.The Good News This film came out in the mid-80s, when it was very fashionable to have an amount of cheese in the film that will have an appeal to others outside the horror general. This film is dripping with it. There is a nice cheesy attitude that the 80s movies captured so greatly, and it is a wonderful example of that attitude. Perhaps the most pressing part of that is the figure of Big Ben, who gets a couple of the best scares in the film towards the latter parts of the film. He has a really creepy look, while also maintaining that distinct campy feel to it. The exterior of the house is pretty creepy, and the overall design rivals the best. The design of the creatures is nice for the time-being, and the final creature is the scene stealer undoubtedly. The look is really creepy and features some impressive make-up. The latter half of the film, with the majority of the action, is pretty entertaining and moves along in a great manner.The Bad News Because the movie exists on its cheesy charms, it isn't a movie for everyone. It will be something that will be draw up against it. The tone and appearance is quite normal for the kinds of horror films of the same kind. This includes the majority of the early attempts at scares, which are just beyond cheesy that don't even scare the youngest child watching the movie. A floating series of garden implements or a fish that suddenly comes active on a wall are some of the failed gags, which should've opened this one a lot better than what it really is. In spite of the unsuccessful gags, this one still takes way too long to get going with it's story, and the only real action comes in the later parts of the film.The Final Verdict It has it's moments of cheese, but then again, most films from the a later part of the 80s, a lot did. It's not the worst haunted house film, but there are better ones out there. Take a look if it feels like you might like it, but don't be surprised if it is dangerously cheesy at times.Rated R Violence, Graphic Language and children in danger "},{"Title":"Where was the comedy?...","Date":"15 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I have seen this movie once when I was much younger, but only remember the zombie soldier of the entire movie.

That was the problem with many old 80's video nasties, there box art was much scarier and intimidating than the actual film.Anyway this franchise is classic 80's stuff with the kind of now cheesy rubber masked effects you come to expect and have seen in various other similar films. Again the idea does seem to stem from 'The Twilight Zone' or 'Tales from the Darkside' or even 'Tales from the Crypt'. Not an anthology of shorts but the plot behind the film could well be seen as an extended short from any of those films.The whole concept is the legendary haunted house idea which does work well if done correctly. In this film William Katt must fight the spirit and zombiefied remains of his former comrade who he unintentionally left to be tortured in Nam. Its basic, predictable, silly, hammy, crude and completely not scary, everything you want from an 80's horror.The great thing about this film and others of the era is the hands on special effects which are always such a riot. Full length rubber suits and prosthetics which do look great on the zombie Big Ben, large drooling cupboard monsters, winged skeleton demons in stop motion, gremlins, alternate other worlds behind the bathroom mirror etc...its all fantastic stuff which your never sure is real or imaginary.If you like films like 'Night of the Creeps' 'Return of the Living Dead' 'Fright Night' etc...then I'm sure you'll get a kick outta this.6/10 "},{"Title":"fun horror in it's entirety, House must be seen","Date":"26 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" House is such a rare and fun movie, I'm glad I caught at the cinema, when I was 15.

He moves into his Grandma's two story place, to start on a new novel about yeah.... his experiences in Vietnam. Some funny flashbacks, here I tell ya, more like done in a studio. William Katt as the novelist is ideal, who thinks he's going crazy? Is it him, or this house possessed? That's the fun of the entire movie, where we have a few bit performances from actors I like, like Alan Autry and Steven Williams as cops. George Wendt as Katt's prying neighbor was fun too. If you want a few scares, more childish ones, and be humored, House is for you. It's one, if for morbid fascination, one of a kind horror movie, original, with inventive scenes, and in it's right, one hell of a thriller, all the way through, where we have to await the verdict of Katt's sanity.

Unfortunately that happens less and less so most of the time if I want to see a good horror I have to bust out my DVD collection. One of these older classics is House. Back in its day it was one of the VHS era's big films, it's out on DVD too but it didn't sell as well. It's a hidden cult horror. It doesn't have the following of say Evil Dead, but people who like the genre probably know about it. The film was made by Steve Miner, Sean S. Cunningham and Roger Corman. The first two names should be familiar to Friday the 13th fans, as Cunningham directed the 1st part and was the producer on the 2nd making a carrier out of the House and Friday franchises. Oh he did direct Deep Star Six that was a tribute to The Abyss, more or less successfully. Miner directed the 2nd and 3rd part of Friday, so we have him to thank for Jason's hockey mask, but he's also responsible for a heap of successful horror flicks like Lake Placid, Warlock, Halloween H20 20 Years Later. So if really can be said that House was made by professionals and that's why it's one of the 80s classic horror flicks. The story Roger Cobb is a Vietnam vet whose career as a horror novelist has taken a turn for the worse when his son Jimmy mysteriously disappears while visiting his aunt's house. Roger's search for Jimmy destroys his marriage and his writing career. The sudden death of his aunt brings Roger back to the house where his nightmares began. The evil zombies in the house force Roger to endure a harrowing journey into his past. The film's big value is the undeniable 80s vibe. It's great to see monsters made for real and not out of CGI. The technical parts are cutely lame, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a part of that era of film making. The story is a little cliché, the terror in the huge house wasn't a new concept even back then. Plus even the start credits remind me of The Haunting. The directors work shows all his experience in the horror film genre, so despite the cliché of the basic story House isn't just a typical scary, ghost house story, but is closer to Sam Raimi's Evid Dead. The screaming of demonic beings, the Chaplin- esc situational comedy and the seemingly hopeless ministrations of the lonely hero all prove this. The actors work well within what we expect from the genre, but don't expect anything outstanding with the characters. William Katt was okay, but he doesn't come close to Ash's (Bruce Campbell's character in Evil Dead) genius. Mac Ahlberg the cinematographer though worked almost perfectly. His experience in horror films (Dolly, Re-Animator) showed here too. I have to also mention, that the monsters in House and the effects were outstanding, but that's not surprising considering the experience of the effects guys with films like Back to the Future 2 and The Fly. The film is a perfect example of what comes about when professionals get together to make a film in their favorite genre. When I first saw this film I didn't really know what to make of it. It was filled with humor, monsters, drama&#x85; it seemed like a cocktail of genres&#x85; watching it again now it lost this effect, so the films biggest problem is that if someone isn't watching it out of nostalgia they'll probably be quite disappointed.

No, this House is about a killer&#x85; well&#x85; house. It's a strange hybrid that might be best described as the test tube offspring of Poltergeist, Apocalypse Now and, perhaps, Evil Dead.It's about a guy named Roger Cobb. He's a horror novelist whose career has been waning since his son mysteriously disappeared while visiting Roger's aunt. His next big book just won't materialize because, among other things, Roger feels a pressing need to exorcise the demons he acquired while serving in Vietnam. Roger decides that spending some time alone in the house where his now dead aunt once lived (not to mention the residence where his son inexplicably vanished) will allow him to pen his next work. Living next door is a jovial neighbor&#x97;played by George Wendt&#x97;who likes to pop in at random, and across the street is a buxom blonde who pawns her son off on Roger so she can have a night out on the town.Soon after moving into the house, Roger experiences unexplained bumps in the night, which soon gives way to full blown monsters spilling out of closets and possessed hand tools hovering behind bedroom doors. The revelatory moment of the film sees Roger discovering that his long lost son is still alive&#x97;albeit in another dimension, a la Poltergeist&#x97;and that a man he'd served with in Vietnam has used his time in the afterlife to haunt Roger so as to get revenge on him for allowing the enemy to capture and torture him for ten weeks.All-in-all, House is a bizarre juxtaposition that's hard to label. It's both funny and wincingly lame, sporadically creepy and laughably dumb. To say it's so bad it's good is an exaggeration, and to say it's just plain bad isn't entirely fair. So, I suppose, it resides somewhere between the two extremes, a schizophrenic offering of sorts, one that'll leave you not knowing whether to laugh or cry.Still, on sheer creativity, I suppose it earns a little merit.

It was one of the first R rated horror movies I saw, and now I'm hooked on the genre.This is a great film when introducing children to harder horror. For those ready to move on from Scooby-Doo but not ready for Night of the Living Dead or The Exorcist. It's scary and suspenseful but never terrifying. Tension builds and there are plenty of jump scares, but the frights never last for long. Take the closet monster for instance. Tension builds as Roger goes to the door and there's a big scare when it comes out. But afterwards it becomes almost silly. Same with the fish and witch. It's a lot like Evil Dead 2 in that it's never too scary to not be funny and never too funny to not be scary.There's also a good story to go along with it. It follows Roger Cobb who grew up with his aunt in a haunted house. He went to war and saw horrible things. His son disappeared at the haunted house and he's separated from his wife. Obviously, all this ties together in some way when the aunt dies and he moves back into the house. None of it ever becomes hokey or clichéd. The film allows time to get to know Roger before the haunting begins so we like him and understand his plight. There's also an interesting aspect regarding whether all the hauntings are real or just caused by the stress of his life.George Wendt from Cheers plays the lovable neighbor that Roger befriends and helps. He isn't that much different than Norm but provides lots of humorous moments. The only thing I wish they did better is to make the supermodel neighbor more interesting. She's fine for some T&A and the house does something with her (which I still can never get whether that was really her or if it was just the witch), but she never really serves the story well. It's little more than a cameo just to have a model in the movie.Each of the actors do well in their parts. All are great, though Richard Moll hams it up just a little too much in his Vietnam scenes. It features William Katt, who genre fans would know as the prom date from Carrie. This film certainly shows some range for him. The film is made by the crew who did Friday the 13th, Parts 2 and 3 and has the same visual style.The special effects work very well for the story. The ghosts are practical effects using puppets, like Star Wars, which looks a lot better than stop motion. As I said before, they look scary at first but grow silly the more they're seen. The walking hand is equally disturbing and funny.The movie may not be a classic of the genre, but it's well worth checking out. It's a descent ghost story with plenty of suspense. As I said before, this is a good movie to test children before showing them something like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those used to more terrifying horror should know that this isn't the scariest thing on store shelves. It's a good, solid B-movie that won't really disappoint.Regarding the sequel, I say skip it. As light as this movie is, House II is much lighter and far campier. In fact, it's more like Weekend at Bernie's than Evil Dead. It's more of a fantasy-western than horror and never scary. If you're watching this movie and want more, go with the Bruce Campbell trilogy. "},{"Title":"A spooky, zany, funny ride, House (1986) is a quirky horror-comedy in the vain of Evil Dead II and Shaun of the Dead...  A fun 80's romp!","Date":"13 February 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" William Katt stars in the 1986 horror-comedy release House (also known in some circles as House Ding Dong, You're Dead), a fun little forgotten treasure from the creators of the Friday the 13th series. The film is very much in the vain as other horror comedies (such as Evil Dead II and Shaun of the Dead), where our hero finds himself in a serious, life-threatening situation (in this film, a haunted house with connections to a hellish realm that brings your nightmares to life), yet also is full of good, light-hearted humor, and is arguably appropriate for some families with older children, as there isn't much swearing, sexual content or gore. And in fact, what little gore there is, is often stylized and cartoonish, giving it a Looney Tunes flair. With very minimal trimming, this could have easily been a PG-13 release, and it seems much tamer than other PG-13 80's films.Directed by Steve Miner, and produced by Sean S. Cunningham, House follows famed author Roger Cobb (Katt), a man dealing with the recent disappearance of his young son and his subsequent separation from his actress wife due to the stress of his son's vanishing. All that Roger can remember is that he was visiting his Aunt's home with his wife and son, and after losing track of him for only a moment, he seemed to vanish off the face of the Earth... there is no evidence as to his whereabouts.When the movie starts, his aunt dies of an apparent suicide, and he inherits her old house, where he plans to stay and work on his memoirs of being a Vietnam vet. (Much to the anger of his publishers, who assure them that the public is tired of war stories.) However, after moving in, strange events begin to occur- things moving by themselves, the appearance of startling creatures, and other horrors, and Roger realizes that they might be connected with his son's disappearance, and that he must face these terrors to get him back.There are also some fun, supporting characters, including his oafish but good-natured neighbor Harold (George Wendt) and a good performance by Kay Lenz as his ex-wife. Katt also does a great job juggling the horror with the humorous sequences, and proves to be a great actor. Miner's direction is very good, giving us both tension and great belly-laughs, and the script is tight and works in its own way. It was a competently made film.The humor also works quite well. A lot of it has to do with the absurdity of the concept, and a lot of the creatures, though eerie, perform gags that are similar to the Three Stooges. There is also a lot of fun to be had with how Katt reacts to the situations, including a humorous scene where he makes a fool out of himself to his neighbors by strapping on all of his old army gear and wandering about like a lunatic, preparing for combat with the creatures.The film is just plain fun.However, there are some drawbacks to it. For one, the rules are not quite established properly. We get the basic idea, but never get a 100% grasp on exactly how things work, which was a little annoying. Also, some jokes do fall flat and some are a little cliché. Finally, there are points where the pacing gets a little mucky, and there are sequences that move by either too quickly or far too slowly, that interrupt the rhythm.However, the sheer fun of the film more than makes up for these downfalls, and I love this movie overall. I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to people looking for light, fun and occasionally creepy ride.

Cunningham released the wildly popular (but highly overrated) Friday the 13th in 1980, and several years after director Steve Miner helmed the film's two sequels, the pair reunited for the 1986 horror-comedy House. Still another hugely profitable outing for the team, House is a more family-friendly affair, blending some effective jolts, rubbery-looking monsters and a great deal of silliness into a tasty but middling stew. In the film, we meet a Viet Nam vet--now a best-selling author--named Roger Cobb (appealingly and effectively played by William Katt). Cobb is going through a decidedly rough patch in his life when we first encounter him. His wife (Kay Lenz) has just divorced him after the mysterious disappearance of their young son, he's having trouble with the writing of his promised war memoirs, and his Aunt Elizabeth has recently hung herself. Roger moves into his aunt's supposedly haunted house to get a little solitude to further his writing...too bad, however, that all those yucky-looking demons in the house will just NOT leave him alone....Anyway, though certainly enjoyable, House proved to be just a little too tongue in cheek for this viewer. This is a film for the Goonies and Gremlins set, and certainly not for the serious horror buff. A little less comedy and a few more scares would have rendered this film a LOT more effective. As it is, those comedic elements are practically assured by the inclusion of George Wendt (riding high at the time playing everyone's favorite beefy barfly, Norm Peterson, on TV's Cheers) as Roger's Gladys Kravitz-like nosy neighbor (essentially, he IS Norm Peterson here), and by the casting of Richard Moll (who was enjoying a similar great success at the time playing the childlike Bull on TV's Night Court) as a soldier buddy of Roger's, and whose character is seen largely in flashback. The film piles on additional bits of silliness, such as the jarring misusage of the great songs You're No Good and Dedicated to the One I Love (sadly, NOT the Linda Ronstadt and Mamas and the Papas versions), as well as an extended babysitting sequence. The picture's script never sufficiently explains away all the spectral mishegas, and many instances of illogic and plot holes remain even after the big revelation toward the film's end. House gets by on the charm of its leading man, its barely effective FX and on the energy that Miner brings to his project. The film brought to mind two other movies for this viewer 2011's Insidious, which also features a father entering a demon-haunted other dimension to search for his young son, and (of all pictures!) 1958's Monster on the Campus, which I'd just seen the day before, and which also shows us a man cutting his finger on a fish's tooth! I should add that it was nice seeing the beautiful Bond girl Mary Stavin (from Octopussy and A View to a Kill) again, here playing Roger's superhot neighbor. In all, House is an entertaining if second-rate 93 minutes at the movies; it is supposedly much better than its two sequels, however. My psychotronic guru, Rob, has called the film minor fare, but in light of the director's name, perhaps we should instead call it minor Miner fare! It is best watched with a few cold ones on one side and maybe your favorite 8-year-old on the other....

I give it as high as 7 stars because when I was 11 I would give it 9-10, and now only 4-5 stars. So 7 is a pretty good number for this movie.

It just wasn't scary enough to be a horror flick or funny enough to be entertaining like Evil Dead II. Although I have a pretty wide latitude as to what I'll sit though, I just couldn't bring myself to join the bandwagon.Believe it or not William Katt plays the starring role in this mid 1980s horror flick. The storyline had promise but misses on a few fronts. The old aunt seems to be an early key character but then really falls to the background if not totally out of the storyline. The actress wife also plays too small a role inserted here and there throughout the movie. George Wendt adds the comic relief but again as the nosy neighbor is not used to his potential. Finally is the house haunted or is it just Katt himself?The story is basically about a house which is involved in the disappearance of Katt's son years ago. After Katt's aunt commits suicide, he decides to move into her house where he had already spent much of his own childhood. He wants to pursue his passion which is writing about his experience in the Vietnam War. It is this war experience that lives at the heart of Katt's weird experiences at the house. Not soon after moving in, he starts to hear and see strange things, primarily at the stroke of midnight. Monsters and other objects (like shovels) are soon attacking him. Katt falls back on his military training to battle the house and its inhabitants. We eventually get a happy ending as he finally prevails in defeating the monsters, rescuing his son, and it appears, reuniting with his divorced spouse.Again, I know many previous writers enjoy this flick but it just wasn't up to even the low bar I often set for these type of flicks.

His mind plays him tricks and during their meeting she is suddenly turned into an abomination - i.e fat, wrinkly and aggressive - whereupon he shoots her. And the music starts, a disco anthem chanting good riddannce, now I know who you are. The body is mutilated and disposed of, and that's about it. Not a really mature way to deal with relationships and memories! The end titles are the same song, which puts this film in the very same category as for example 1408, but with a sprinkle of Vietnam and humour instead of cancer as in the latter.

This isn't your typical haunted house thriller; for one thing, it's done with tongue firmly in cheek, as if the filmmakers decided all the good serious ghost stories had been done already. For another, Roger's reactions to the weird demons that pop up in this house are not as expected, as if he knows he's inside a fright flic and this is the kind of stuff that happens once in a while in such situations. I would point out, also, that this pic probably doesn't have too many Vietnam vets as fans, as it trivializes the experience.The concept of some other dimension intruding on our so-called real world is also given a new lift here. It's not so much a ghost story as a riff on the Hellraiser and From Beyond concepts, done with humor, similar to the Evil Dead series. The sense is that we co-exist with some other, more sinister dimension, parallel with our own. A house such as this provides occasional openings to and from this alternate dimension. Towards the end, there's somewhat of a revelation about who or what is actually causing all this weird stuff, but real explanations are few - almost anything can happen, anything goes. Is Roger simply psychotic, imagining all these things? Is someone trying to drive him crazy? Or is it all truly supernatural? There's some mystery throughout the story as we go along on Roger's little self-imposed odyssey, though it's a bit too silly and inconsequential by the time it's over.

Actors do their job as well as the genre needs, but no one is spilling their hearts out, no need in this particular genre, it's not about acting.There is also this camp feel the movie has. It wants to break free from the shackles of ordinary horror comedies, but it fails, and at least I got the feeling, that this movie could have been a lot better, but the makers just ran out of resources.The start of the film plays out like a serious horror film and then suddenly there is a change of tone and the film goes almost slapstick comedy.

The fact that it's been forgotten is a probably a good thing seeing as how it is about the only film in its time that hasn't been remade or isn't currently being targeted by Michael Bay or anyone else who would do it harm. In a way, House is a cult classic that is destined to stay a cult classic forever, and there are many reasons why.The first reason lies in its plot structure. To say the film's biggest weakness lies in its sloppy story-telling would be an understatement; at times, the film flat-out makes no sense. There are no rules when it comes to the supernatural elements of the story; therefore, the film gets away with murder, so to speak.Another reason would be its quirky sense of humor, achieved by its assorted cast. William Katt plays the straight man against the nosy and over-bearing neighbor, played by George Wendt of TV's Cheers. On the other side of the coin, Richard Moll (he being of Night Court fame) plays the chief bad-guy, glorious special effects make-up job and all, disguising his usual persona all while adding to further amusement when he fails in harassing his former war buddy.Then, of course, we have the creepy yet amusing practical effects which define the film. The monsters or ghosts or whatever you'd like to refer to them as appear to be straight out of someone's nightmare, resembling nothing seen before and often achieved by something as simple as a latex mask. You'll giggle yourself silly as you watch Katt's character struggle with the skanky-looking goblin his ex-wife becomes. The laughs are derived partly because the scenario is so over-the-top and silly but also because the effects by which it is executed are just too good to be true and reminiscent of a time when horror movies had a certain authenticity to them, even when they didn't take themselves too seriously.Rather than go any further into analyzing the film and why it should remain an '80s relic, it must be said that House is simply a boat-load of good times. Director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3-D)) truly comes into his own with the film, which is both stylish and competently paced (too bad the director crapped out in the '90s). Meanwhile, William Katt carries the film on his shoulders, giving a performance that is both manic and sympathetic. Somewhere amidst the horror and the humor lies a story of redemption, and Katt somehow sells it. Although the film never quite settles on a specific tone or makes much sense throughout, it's still an enjoyable film that will deliver chuckles and jumps time and time again. It's certainly not a film for everyone, and that's the point. For those who prefer their horror off-beat and with a sense of humor, you'll found House to be worth entering.

Roger essentially spends the rest of the movie dealing with the strange goings-on in the house, which may be haunted, as well as dealing with his own personal demons and dealing with his snoop of a neighbor, played memorably by George Wendt.I am probably the only person in history who saw 'House II' before seeing the original 'House', and prefers part II to the original, but that is neither here nor there. 'House' is an extremely original story that has become somewhat of a cult classic as the years wear on. I must admit to absolutely hating the film the first time I saw it back in 1988. I rented it on a whim after scanning titles at my local video store (based mainly on my liking of part II) and remember thinking it was about as bad of a movie as I had ever seen. Several years later I was up late one night, sick with a head cold and unable to sleep, and decided to watch some TV. I happened across 'House' being shown on the local late, late movie. This was before the days of 900+ channels so my choices were limited. In fact, if I recall correctly, it was either watch 'House' or a Don Lapre making money infomercial. Needless to say I chose the movie. I couldn't believe it. Despite my earlier feelings on the movie I found myself enjoying the movie very much. The kooky weirdness and 'Evil Dead'-like tongue-in-cheek comedy is just what the doctor ordered when you are looking for an escape from the cut and dry crap that finds its way out of Hollywood nowadays.

Lovecraft-like in a surreal way, the monsters and spirits in this movie are fantastic. The film co-stars Richard Moll as a soldier who would later come back from the dead and George Wendt as a lovable but nosy neighbor, the film became a major success for New World Pictures and has gained a cult following to this day. The special effects for it's time were impressive including the demons themselves, there's a dark sense of humor and even a little gore to be shown in this terrific sleeper that is funny and scary.A must see! one of my all time favorite horror movies ever.Also recommended Poltergeist, Silent Hill, 1408, The Shining, Pet Semetary, The Frighteners, House By The Cemetery, A Nightmare on Elm Street Series, The Haunting (1963 and 1999), House on Haunted Hill (1958 and 1999), Thir13een Ghosts (2001 and 1960), Stir of Echoes, The Orphanage, Beetlejuice, Ghostbusters 1 & 2, Gremlins, Phantasm, Re-Animator, Making Contact (a.k.a.

First of all, look at the cast. You have an ensemble of television stars getting into the big screen using this film as their vehicle. George Wendt and William Katt are prime examples of this. Their acting level is below minimal standards and you can really tell that they are acting. You never really see the struggle of Cobb trying to write his manuscript for his next novel while having to deal with the demons in the house. You never really understand why Wendt is against Katt so adamantly. You never really get an answer as to why he stayed in that house and dealt with the spirits the way that he did instead of just bolting out the door after the first scream. There are several questions unanswered and plenty of cheapness to this film, but &#133; and get this &#133; that is what makes it phenomenal.Let's take a deeper look at this film. To begin it is a horror/comedy made in the 80s, which already sets the standard. The 80s were notorious for brining to light the horror/comedy genre and they made no exception here. The set and sound are not the best in this film, while the monsters are completely 80s (for lack of a better word). You can definitely see the differences between gory monsters of today, and those made yesteryears. There seems to be a focus on the absurd in the 80s, instead of the grotesque and unbelievable of today's standards. This is a cheesy film, and it was meant to be. That is definitely something I miss with today's films. I saw it briefly in Shawn of the Dead, but it still hasn't come full circle yet. I need a rebirth of this genre. Less nudity, less gore, and more undeniably 80s monsters. I believe that people would still flock to see it. I know I would be in line. The set, cinematography, and acting were all perfect for this film. When I watched this movie again with some friends, there were some that had not seen it and jumped on several occasions. That says to me that it has maintained a fright factor. You can tell if a horror film has lasted the test of time if nearly 20 years later others are still jumping.What also worked perfectly in this film was the comedy aspect. I don't know if it was trying to go for the sub-genre of parody, but there were scenes that I saw in this film that reminded me of some of the classics like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghoulies, and Evil Dead. It was a very good mix that worked exceptionally well in building that extra chuckle whenever Cobb did something you know is absurd. He is the perfect example of your uneducated hero. When he should be running outside to regroup and collect his ideas, he is instead running upstairs where the terror is greater. Whenever he attempted to write, but was constantly interrupted by ghouls, goblins, or even the neighbor, it made me smile. He was not your average hero, yet somehow I found myself cheering for him at the end.Overall, this was your average cult horror film that the 80s were notorious for. If you walk into this film expecting today's standards, you will be disappointed. If you go into it thinking of what the 80s were like, especially in the horror genre in Hollywood, I think you will be utterly surprised. I have seen this film several times, and it continues to get better each time I watch it. Katt does a superb job with the material and experience that he has, and nearly rockets himself into a Bruce Campbell clone. Well &#133; almost &#133; I don't think Campbell's status could ever be compromised! Enjoy &#133; scream &#133; and have a good time. Just watch out for when that clock hits midnight, you never know what parallel universe may be clumping around in your closet &#133; BOOOOOOOOOOO!

Cunningham will be forever remembered as the man who brought Friday the 13th to life. Although a financial success, the film did hurt his career by bottling him up into the horror genre. As most of the films he produced or directed flopped, his chances of breaking into the mainstream grew ever dimmer. Wes Craven has had a similar problem; although his films did considerably better, rarely does he have a chance to dabble into non-horror. Cunningham should not be completely dismissed, though; he also gave us the slight but amusing horror comedy House, and the equally enjoyable House II. The original was helmed by Steve Miner, director of two of the Friday the 13th films (parts 2 and 3, to be precise). Based on these movies, one wouldn't think he was capable of crafting a more lighthearted approach to the genre. But there it is; a horror film that goes for the jokes and not the gore. A tormented Vietnam vet moves into his late aunt's old house, hoping to complete his latest novel. There, he must battle various demons, not only of the supernatural type, but his own self torment and the loss of his missing son.William Katt is not a particularly accomplished actor, but he is nonetheless likable and generates a great deal of sympathy for his plight. He realizes that the key to making a good comedy is to pretend the material is serious, making everything seem more real. There are several ghoulishly silly incidents; the best gag involves a possessed severed hand, which probably inspired Evil Dead II, released the following year. The scene involving the ugly fat creature is also effective. Miner gives the film a slick look and delivers humor and suspense in equal doses. This is not the best the subgenre has to offer (that honor may go to Ghostbusters), but it is a worthy effort that makes a more than adequate serving as a party movie on Halloween night. However, it still doesn't quite have the inspiration to go a step further.The ending is interesting enough, as Katt finds a doorway into the netherworld to rescue his son--and finds opposition by an old combat partner from beyond the grave. I admit incorporating the Vietnam elements could have been distasteful, especially in light of Oliver Stone's concurrent Platoon, but it's simply impossible to take this movie too seriously for any significant length of time. This is a filmmaker's movie, and a movie for horror fans--this is probably a good way to introduce your children into the genre. The special effects are competently done, given its limited budget. George Wendt gives a good supporting performance as the nosy next-door neighbor. House is good, cheesy eighties horror, the cinematic equivalent of visiting a haunted house.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures "},{"Title":"better than Lady and the Tramp II","Date":"26 February 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  One of the few horror movies ive seen that mixes comedy and humor well Perfect song moments with This is dedicated to the one i love and you're no good just make the movie a classic.

Instead, I spent the entire time laughing as the hero goes through one hilarious misadventure after another. Although the movie has its horrific aspects, there is no denying the comedic tone that is there for the entire movie. William Katt is a delight as Cobb, the horror author / Vietnam vet on a quest for his own personal self-realisation. He ends up in one embarrassing situation after another as he wages war against the house, and his own personal ghosts.This movie also has some excellent cameos and supporting actors. George Wendt (Norm on Cheers) is excellent as the annoying next door neighbor who is always sticking his nose in Cobb's business. Also including Alan Autry as the local constabulary, Kay Lenz as Roger's estranged wife ex-Sandy, and Richard Moll as his Vietnam war buddy Big Ben, this movie has plot, talent, hilarious special effects, and some of the most excellent comedic twists I've seen in years. Whether it be Cobb beating a plastic bag to death with a shovel, or large Jabba-the-Hut type creatures jumping out at him, this movie will surely keep any viewer in stitches.If you like this movie, be sure to check out Little Monsters and High Spirits, which were written along a similar horror/comedy bent. House is like the Star Wars of the horror genre -- an innovative, thought-provoking film that will forever change the way you look at horror movies. The lack of nudity, violence, and coarse language makes this movie suitable for viewing by a much wider audience range. Without a doubt, on a scale of one to ten, this movie deserves an eleven!

It was one of these movies where after a half hour you know you should tune away for something more uplifting, like maybe to CNN to see the world coming apart, but you've already invested that half hour... and you have this perverse need to see how the main plot hook (the guy's son disappeared some time ago, causing his marriage to fail, etc.) gets resolved, so you hang in there. Don't do it. The ending is a total joke and the in between ain't any better.Maybe the movie wouldn't have been so bad if George Wendt had been given the lead. He was terrific in Cheers, but doesn't have any range at all. That would not have been a problem if he had starred here (instead of playing the buttinsky neighbor). Evidently, solid acting was not a requirement for House's casting director. More likely, the problem (aside from the director) was $ and re-shooting scenes probably not an option. Then again, maybe they thought they were doin' pretty good.OTOH, this flick might have been better if made by a bunch of teenagers in Podunk, Minnesota using their parent's video equipment. The effects could hardly have been worse (rubber monster masks and tattered garments). The attack by the closeted rod puppet monster was too much to bear.I realize this is a spoof, but it simply wasn't worth the time.

I get a kick out of how bad they are, with their low budgets and lousy special effects - it's always good for a laugh, and usually more than one. But there's a fine line between a B movie that is bad in a funny, enjoyable way and one that is so god awful, it makes you want to hunt down and kill the creators.As you may have guessed from my 1 out of 10 star rating, House is of the second variety. Where to begin...?First things first -- you'll find this film in the horror section of your video store -- wrong! House is not a horror film any more than Schindler's List is a slapstick comedy. There is nothing scary about the film, nothing creepy or even remotely macabre (other than the wardrobe and hairstyling choices, which are a whole different world of scary.) The film places itself in the horror-comedy genre, a dubious genre which has birthed far more bad movies than good. House doesn't get either part of the genre correct -- as I said, it isn't scary and the humor is so insipid, poorly written and horribly acted that it's more likely to make you angry than it is to cause even the faintest chuckle.In my opinion, there is nothing worse than unfunny comedy. It's just an embarrassment for all of humanity. The animal kingdom sees these kinds of films and mocks the human race. The comedy in House is the equivalent of what you'd get if you gave an 11 year old with attention deficit disorder a video camera for a day, along with a bottle of caffeine and a pipe full of crack. Every joke falls flat, every visual gag is poorly filmed, every bit of physical comedy is sloppily choreographed and looks unintentional at best. I'm not sure how an entire cast and crew of a film could all make something so completely unfunny. Did no- one stand up and say, hey...you know what...big goggles and army fatigues don't make this lousy film comedic.In addition, House also sports an utterly pointless, rambling plot that literally feels like it was written as the camera was rolling. Without being a spoiler, suffice it to say that any script that incorporates elderly suicide, child abduction, Vietnam flashbacks, magic doors, puppet monsters, a haunted house AND George Wendt is special. And I don't mean special like a unicorn, I mean short-bus special.It boggles the mind to think that a film that so completely fails could get made and still be around twenty years later. I guess that is a testament to the cultural deficit of the 80's and the lunatic idiocy of Hollywood producers.Don't ever watch this film. Even if it's free...even if you are offered money to watch it. Even if you are offered A LOT of money to watch it. You may be slightly richer, but you'll be left dead on the inside. This film doesn't deserve one star. This film is a collapsed star, resulting in a void in space-time with an incredible gravitational pull that sucks every ounce of happiness from your life for the 93 minutes you spend with it.

It never gets too intense while remaining somewhat imaginative and offbeat. It's written by Ethan Wiley, based on a story by Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps, The Monster Squad), and produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner respectively, the first two directors in the Friday the 13th franchise. William Katt ('The Greatest American Hero', Carrie) stars as Roger Cobb, a horror novelist who's going through a bunch of problems his son has vanished, his wife has divorced him, he's suffering from haunting Vietnam flashbacks, and his dotty old Aunt Elizabeth (Susan French) has recently hung herself. Seeking some all-important solitude, he moves into Elizabeths' Victorian home and is soon harassed by various demons. That off the wall sensibility helps to keep this movie from being purely predictable, and there are various rubber monsters that Roger will have to deal with - a closet monster which he tries to photograph, a cackling witch, and two little imps. The special effects are quite engaging in their low-tech simplicity (it's cool to see a monster that's rather reminiscent of the Deadites in Sam Raimis' Evil Dead series), and that really is one hell of a nice house to serve as the main location in this thing. It's shot from a number of angles, and there's even a pool in the back. The production design and cinematography are by the late professionals Gregg Fonseca and Mac Ahlberg, and Harry Manfredini supplies a score that occasionally sounds familiar to Friday the 13th series fans but which overall is good. The cast is fun to watch, with Katt making for a relatable hero, as he tries to come to grips with what he's seeing. The stunt casting of sitcom stars George Wendt (as the solicitous neighbour) and Richard Moll (as Rogers' flamboyant Vietnam comrade) works wonders and both actors are very amusing. There's also luscious eye candy in the form of Kay Lenz, as Rogers' concerned ex-wife, and Mary Stavin, as another neighbour, with a number of familiar faces in the character roles - Michael Ensign, Alan Autry, Steven Williams, Mindy Sterling, Steve Susskind, Dwier Brown, Stephen Nichols, and Ronn Carroll. They all help to make House pleasant if not great viewing. It might not have all viewers necessarily laughing out loud, but it's sure to make people smile. Followed by three sequels. Seven out of 10.

And I suspect that not even the writers knew it either, which is all for the better. Now, I'd say there are 2 kinds of creative writing rational or analytical, and intuitive. The best one is the intuitive one because when it at work the rational mind just shuts up and lets the subconscious mind do the job. And contrary to belief, the SM is far more encompassing, coherent, consistent and logical than the rational mind. Works of genius, of pure inspiration, usually come from it, as the SM never gets it wrong. Some elements in the script of House show hints of this genius, the marks of a true work of inspiration.Granted, this is not a great flick but one that suffers also because of something exterior to it marketing addressed to the wrong demographics--pre-teenagers--on top of which its promotion as a horror comedy, when in fact the subject couldn't be more adult--even if many adult viewers didn't get it anyway, judging from reviews here. Furthermore, as the people making it didn't seem to have understood well it themselves, they probably considered it lame, they made all possible efforts to spice it up a bit with humor and cheesiness&#x97;specially in the FX dept. (and just listen to the corny dialog in Sandy's soap!). Add to that the rather ordinary direction, the so-so acting and the cheap design sets all which may make a lot of harm to a script that is a bit short of genius. Also there is a problem with the lead. At least for 80 min. of the 92 min. of the duration we see Katt on camera (that may be a record) but he doesn't look much like a Viet veteran&#x97;come on, can you picture him in Taxi Driver?--and that goes a long way diminishing the shock effect in a quite a few scenes. On the other hand the score is superb and it carries by itself the most suspenseful sequences. The editing may seem anarchic at times, and so the cinematography&#x97;funny, random, camera angles--but it perfectly conveys the turmoil in Roger's psyche. But this is not tragedy, or even drama; not even horror comedy as many think, but psychodrama, as in Identity a good part of what we observe happening is not even real, just something happening inside the head of the protagonist. (A good clue for reality may be Cobb being uncomfortable, embarrassed, in front of other people).House's plot line is about just one thing the unbearable guilt felt by Cobb about having abandoned his dying chum in Vietnam. Everything else comes in reference to this, in a metaphorical or referential manner. For starters, he has no son--Jimmy doesn't exist--but he has, yes, a estranged wife. The house is a metaphor for his own psyche&#x97;that's the reason why we never see him terrorized, even shocked, as those monsters coming from its closets and rooms are his own, the ghouls his guilty ego brings to life to punish himself. The same for the flying picks and scissors. See also how neither the (2) kids are terrorized or shocked by the ghouls--because they are all parts of the same psyche. I could spend pages listing elements that confirm this plot line. Consider for ex. where he finds the clue to where Jimmy is in the mirror, the place where we look at ourselves! Also, see what he's doing when Jimmy disappears the same thing he was doing when committing his crime, cutting through vegetation! See that what's behind the mirror is not a tunnel but a very deep pit, clear metaphor for the SM. See the crucial role played by Tanya. She hasn't come for a sexual tryst but for something far more important she brings him a child. With this child Cobb feels at ease, there's no trauma or pain brought back by memories of the lost son, as it should be the case. That is because those 2 kids are mostly metaphors, Jimmy being his own inner child--the guy capable of feelings of love, of fully enjoying life, the one that his guilty ego abducted one day, took back to the war and put inside a tiger cage. It's the kid that Tanya brings who awakens his remaining, stupefied, ego and who gives him the strength to fight for Jimmy's retrieval, as the little guy reminds him of how joyful was life before he did succumb to the guilt. No wonder also that what finally appears in his quest is Big Ben. The last scene is incredible in its internal coherence as in the way how everything comes to fit perfectly and its climatic moment, just genius Big Ben swipes an Army knife at Cobb, he seems to have cut off his hand, but then Cobb realizes it is intact. It is then that he realizes he has arrived at the end of his quest&#x97;or his psychotherapy. With the guilt gone, ghoul Big Ben, his own creature, becomes innocuous. The Hollywood ending is not contrived at all, as Sandy's arrival on cue can be a metaphor too he lost her when he lost his soul&#x97;when the guy she loved stopped being himself&#x97;and now that he got that guy back he is ready to greet her again.Great script very focused and well rounded; great score also. Great exploration of the feeling of guilt. With better direction, more serious acting and FX this could have been a classic. 7/10.BTW, a dead giveaway comes in the initial nightmare it's Jimmy the one terrorized by Big Ben's hand coming out of his grave.

The acting was okay and they even got a teaser with Mary Stavin (Tanya), who was Miss World in 1977.

Just about every town has one house that people whisper about. Through the years countless films involving a house invaded by evil forces have been made and have experienced an interesting evolution. For years they took place in Gothic castles or mansions and eventually made it to modern day suburbia. The idea of a haunted house in what is supposed to be a safe and peaceful area is pretty scary. It was only a matter if time before someone would take a more humorous approach to the concept and 'House' is one of the finest examples. Made by some of the same people responsible for 'Friday the 13th,' the film was a hit in it's time and has since enjoyed a loyal following.Pros Excellent performances from all involved. Good and suspenseful story. Memorable and often chilling score. Beautifully photographed. Quick paced. Impressive creature effects. A few good jolts. Good sense of humor, plus a good balance between the two. Steve Miner did fine with the first couple of 'Friday' sequels, but really shines here.Cons Not even a hint or two as to why the house is haunted. Some of the effects don't measure up to the others. Ending is a bit rushed.Final thoughts Blending horror and humor is not always successful, but when it's done right it's golden. There were so many forgettable genre films being made at the time and 'House' is not one of them by a long shot. It really shows that this was a labor of love and has held up quite well. Could have been just another haunted house film, but instead is a fresh spin on the concept that's loaded with energy, imagination, and some nice surprises.My rating 4/5 "},{"Title":"* *1/2 out of 4","Date":"24 November 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Novelist Roger Cobb, (William Katt) who has a very dedicated horror fan-base who isn't very receptive about his new planned novel about the Vietnam War.

This would all make sense if the film followed a logical flow of events--but none of what happens in the house is even remotely believable. In other words, if you want logic with your horror, you won't find it here.KATT has an appealing screen presence (he's the son of Barbara Hale and Bill Williams) and looks strikingly like his father. He handles his role well, keeping a serious face throughout all the implausible situations. GEORGE WENDT (from Cheers) is his inquisitive next-door neighbor.It's moderately entertaining although it does take time for the horror aspects to take over.

OK...Well, apparently in 1986 they were just throwing money at production teams to make the next piece of crap horror movie and get it into theaters as fast as possible. This film was shoddier than a B movie with little campiness to play off of. There were horribly atrocious-looking creatures and bad guys (and a flopping blue marlin which gets possessed while hanging on the wall) which makes up any B movie, but they weren't in the least thought out or anything. Dreamquest, the leader at the time in stop-motion and trippy effects for movies, animated some of the more complex ones which leads to the problem too much money seemed to be used in the making of this B movie into a legitimate horror flick, which negates the comedy that they tried to put into the film.I don't know about you, but seeing the Great American Hero on screen doesn't mean comedy (or anything for that matter). They had George Wendt (of Cheers fame, at the time, as Norm) and Richard Moll (Bull from Night Court fame) filling in the random-actor categories. They both did an OK job of filling in the gaps between when you were getting confused as to WTF is happening and the next scene where you don't know WTF is going on.The story was lame, and I actually expected an Amityville ripoff more than anything. But basing a story around fear that this one man (whom the audience doesn't even care for, really) has to conquer is lame. The music was kind of cool in an 80's video game way. The sets that they built with added effects were OK, but IT'S A FREAKING HOUSE! JUST MOVE ALREADY!

In an effort to turn his life around, Roger decides to write a new book based on his war experiences in Vietnam, but after moving into his late Aunt's creepy old house for a bit of solitude, he discovers that his past is finally about to catch up with him.Written by Fred Dekker, produced and directed by Friday the 13th's Sean S. Cunningham and Steve Miner, scored by Harry Manfredini, and photographed by Mac Ahlberg, House is built on some sturdy horror foundations, and it's easy to understand how planning permission for this venture was initially secured.Had I been the man in charge of overseeing the project, however, construction wouldn't have gone ahead until some major flaws in the blueprints had been addressed flaws that cause the film to creak at the joints and ultimately come crashing down in a mess of unresolved plot threads, half-baked ideas, and silly slapstick comedy.The problem is not in the quality of the raw materials used, for they are the dependable components that have been tried and tested in many a spooky house movie creepy passageways, dusty rooms, spooky sounds, and mysterious happenings. No, the problem is with how these elements are assembled, with slipshod construction, lack of attention to detail, and the papering over of some pretty hefty cracks all going to make House a rather unsound development.It's a shame, because the basic premise has loads of potential and there are certain features that are very desirable (the sexy blonde neighbour in the bikini, for one!).Director Miner is no slouch when it comes to delivering chills and atmosphere, and offers a fun array of lighthearted frights and no end of creepy scenes guaranteed to keep viewers on tenterhooks. Unfortunately, it is Dekker's muddled story and the ill advised use of comedy that prove to be the film's weak points. The narrative makes very little sense, with no satisfactory explanation given for the property's supernatural occurrences and its malevolent inhabitants, and the result is a film that exists purely to deliver a series of well-executed scares.A silly ending, in which Roger's zombiefied Vietnam buddy Ben is revealed to be responsible for the disappearance of the writer's son, is poorly handled, leaving one with the sneaking suspicion that the makers didn't really care too much that the story made no sense, just so long as they managed to squeeze in a few silly monsters along the way.Reading other comments here on IMDb, I see that some people view this film as a psychological horror, with the strange events being Roger's way of subconsciously handling the horrors he experienced in Vietnam. Personally, I don't think the film is trying to be that clever, and if it is, it isn't trying hard enough.

That, however, doesn't mean it's one of the best. The film fuses horror with comedy, but in doing so; doesn't manage to spearhead either one. The film is amusing, but never hilarious; and the horror is so laughable that it's impossible to be frightened by it. The special effects fit the film in that they're jokey; but again they don't help it any when it comes to the horror side. It looks like the filmmakers couldn't really be bothered, and it that doesn't fill me with love for the film. Parts of the film are made up of Vietnam flashbacks; and if there was an award for 'worst representation of Vietnam', this film would run away with it for the ridiculous scenes here. The plot follows a Vietnam veteran turned horror writer who retreats to his dead aunt's house for some solitude while writing his new novel. However; his aunt must have hung herself for a reason, and this was also the house in which his son disappeared and his marriage broke up. Going back there might not be a wise move...This film pans out something like a less outrageous version of Evil Dead 2. Several things that Sam Raimi would utilise a year later are present in this film - from a severed hand with a mind of its own, to a moving wall ornament; but the film is nowhere near as good as the later surreal fantasy, mostly due its lack of finesse. The film is directed by Steve Miner; a man behind a couple of Friday the 13th films and the same one who will direct the Day of the Dead remake. Sean S. Cunningham, a man better known as 'that guy who directed Friday the 13th' has a producer's credit. The lead role falls to William Katt. On the whole, the acting in this film isn't too bad; but Katt isn't wholly believable as the linchpin of the movie. He's fine during the scenes where his character is being driven insane; but he just doesn't look like a Vietnam veteran, which makes it very hard to believe his character, and the film loses more credibility for that. George Wendt gets the best role, and as most of the comedy comes from him; he steals every scene he's in. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to people that love eighties horror; but as I love eighties horror myself, be warned that this isn't a film that eighties fanatics are guaranteed to love.

The horror is usually built up too much or not enough, and the scares mostly inspire laughter rather than fear or the occasional jump in your seat.

Often it looks like the camera-crew or whoever edited this mess together was asleep at the wheel. The acting is mostly uninspired and dull. The characters are paper-thin and underdeveloped. The humor is lame. The gags and jokes, or rather, the few of them that are intentional, mostly just aren't funny. We tried laughing, we really did, but we found ourselves laughing at all the stuff that was supposed to be scary and simply cringe whenever the film threw a misplaced, mistimed and poorly done joke or gag in our face. By now, the special effects are ridiculous, especially the stop-motion stuff. Now, for the positive stuff; the film is reasonably creative, and when it does get going, about thirty minutes in, it is somewhat entertaining, even if it is for all the wrong reasons. As far as 80's flicks go, it's not the worst out there. There's reasonably little unnecessary stuff in the film, most of what you see is there either to scare you or make you laugh. The fact that it usually fails to do either need not be mentioned again. Overall, a decent enough 80's horror-comedy.

Well, the 80's was an excellent decade for the genre, but this film sure doesn't belong in the list of the best. It can't compete to The Evil Dead, Re-Animator or even the Night of the Creeps (although this last film and House have the same scriptwriter. Fred Dekker proved he was able to pull it off with Night of the Creeps but not with this one). I don't know what the main problem with this film is. I think it is very slooooooooooooooow. The story never seems to develop, actually. I did start great though. A big creepy house owned by a weird old lady. She's found hung up. Looked like she couldn't handle the haunted house anymore. Then her nephew moves in. He's a writer of horror stories who lived there before, but his son strangely disappeared and that cost him both his career and his marriage. He wants 'solitude' to work on his new book now ( about his Vietnam experiences - that's a rather important detail to the movie ) and therefore he moved in to his aunt's house. Well, as you probably could have guessed, strange things happen. Ghosts are dwelling around and are trying to drive him crazy. Like I said, it started out nice. After the guy just moved in he gets to meet his neighbor. And it's NORM PETERSON ! The greatest character from the wonderful sitcom CHEERS. My first thought was  OK, if they want to make a horror-comedy, this guy is the best choice to pull it off. Well, he is the best character in the movie indeed, but his part can't save the movie completely. Neither can the part of the great looking neighbor. A standard woman from the 80's but very pretty...his ex-wife too, by the way. Final conclusion  way to slow to keep interested, the script contains many small faults ( **SPOILER** How could for example the Big Ben zombie know for sure that the guy would move in to the house **END SPOILER**) The acting is OK, I guess and so is are the make-up effects. The story is the biggest disappointment. Too bad that is the most important factor of a movie...at least in my opinion. The film got three sequels which I also bought. They were in a box for 14.99$. I already regret wasting my money ( "},{"Title":"Starts well, but after 20 minutes I gave up!","Date":"4 October 2006","Score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I normally stick with the most tedious horror films - IF there's a tiny bit element of I wonder what will happen next? In this movie, there are absolutely zero redeeming features. It's boring, predictable, and has zero plot. In effect, it's complete garbage.It starts okay with an old dotty woman hanging herself, then there are some small shivers but after 20 minutes the whole thing just gives up, and that fat guy from Cheers pops up and makes the film even worse.I whizzed through the remainder with the VCR on high speed fast forward, just to see the end.Don't waste a minute of your life on it, it's trash. One out of ten? I wish I could have given ZERO.

The film is nothing special, but there is something about this mess that makes it strangely alluring. Vietnam vet/novelist William Katt has a severe case of writer's block. The fact that Katt is grief-stricken over the disappearance of his son does not help matters either. He goes back to the house of his youth and must confront some unknown thing that has quietly haunted him since he was a youngster. Also along for the ride is the ghostly Richard Moll (a friend of Katt's who was killed in Vietnam) and silly neighbor George Wendt (of Cheers fame). House is the strangest of black comedies that sometimes plays more like a parody than a horror flick. For the most part everything is glued together with Tales From the Darkside-styled television ideas. Still, as bad as it is, it could suck you in with its ridiculousness. 2.5 out of 5. "}]
