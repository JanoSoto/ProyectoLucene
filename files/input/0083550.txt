Part one was so phony that it was even comical in parts (not to mention the over-acting). Part two contains more real life horrors such as incest, child abuse, domestic violence and mental illness. Yes, it is loosely based on the DeFeo case. However, I believe the director avoided direct links to the incident because of possible lawsuits. One disagreement I have with William C. Uchtman is when he stated in his review that Ronald DeFeo Sr. was a swell guy. Well according to City Confidential on A&E, the father was very abusive and was reported to have beaten Butch to a bloody pulp one time for simply talking back at the dinner table. Wife beatings were also reported. So, the abuse scenes are quite valid. The part when Sunny points a shotgun at his father after he punched his wife is valid too except that, in the real case, Butch pulled the trigger with no shells inside. That was the only difference. The counterculture involved is also interesting. The Montelli's are no typical American family, you see this from the start when Sunny returns from buying a pack of cigarettes and has an arguement with his father who threatens to kick his ass.Yes, Possession did copy parts of The Exorcist, but it's still a good film with more gory scenes than the original.If you like over-acted supernatural thrillers, you may enjoy the first. But if you want to see a movie based on a real murder case (though admittedly from a supernatural point of view), Possession is for you.

I have read some of the commments in here and there's are actually two people that said the exact same thing about the film. And that was that the film should have ended when the priest was looking into the house and he sees the spirit of the dead girl walking. Then the old lady comes up to him and says she has heard stories about the house. That would have been an awesome way to end it and I then would have given it a ten. As it stands I am still giving it an 8 because even though the end was contrived and straight out of The Exorcist, it is still one hell of a scary film. And if you thought you had reason in the first one to yell  Get out! then wait till you see this one.The first hour of this film is absolutely terrifying. It has so much atmosphere and chilling scenes that I couldn't understand why people hated this film so much. The room in the basement is dark, dingy and the camera work is so spooky that you can't help but get suckered into believing that something is in there. When the mom is ironing and she feels something touch her arm and then the wind, that was a perfect scene. It was frightening. But the highlight of this film is when the family minus Sonny goes to church. It is here that Sonny gets stalked by an unseen force. And I even caught myself yelling at the TV,  GET OUT!  When he goes up the stairs and then down and then back up again into his room, it bothered me and it literally gave me chills. The camera work is so creative and haphazard that you really can't tell where the demon is. Is it on the ceiling, behind him, in front of him, where? That was a brilliant sequence in the film.Some of the acting is pretty bad especially from the mom, but it makes up for that with its chills and tension. I really think that people that criticize this film are perhaps people that should watch it again. I saw it for the first time when I was about 16 and thought it was okay, but then I rented it today and it frightened me during the day. That is pretty good film making. And is it me or are Italian directors better at good horror than the average north American director? Because I've seen some pretty scary horror films that were directed by Italians and they seem to have a style all their own. Just a thought.Amityville II is a perfect film to watch before the original. It is actually a prequel and it is good to watch them back to back.

It is based on the teenage boy who brutally murdered his entire family and believed that he did so while being possessed by forces inside the house, which is a true story. It is genuinely scary and pretty realistic (for a horror movie about demonic possession). Half of the scares come from the otherworldly evil presence in the house and the other half come from the quite realistic and not so uncommon everyday evils that occur in so many dysfunctional families. And as far as dysfunctional families go...this one takes the cake! If you were raised in a Christian household, you will probably find this movie more frightening than the average person. The soundtrack is very creepy and the actors are very likable, so you really feel sorry for them when they all bite the dust. The only complaint I have about this film is that it is too long....instead of ending relatively soon after the boy murders his family, it goes on and on with the priest attempting to exorcise the teen...and although this is where most of the special effects occur, you kind of feel bored because all of the characters you were introduced to are gone. All in all, though, it is still a very good movie and much scarier than the original.

Defeo was found guilty and sent to prison, but the events that unfolded that November inspired the entire saga behind what is now known as The Amityville Horror. Technically this film is the prequel to the subsequent occupation of the house by George and Kathy Lutz depicted in the first film, and comes off quite disturbing until its uneven climax.Its a perfect example of how Hollywood exploits and the how the media can take a factually tragic event in history and completely blow it out of proportion in order to entertain and amuse the masses. The facts behind the Defeo Murders and Lutz family's claims have been a controversial subject for over 30 years now, and the mystery behind the films and books continue to entice haunted house fans and skeptics alike. Nevertheless, this movie utilizes many of the same demonic, anti-Christian symbolism and clich√©s that can be seen in The Exorcist, and some of them are quite effective. Point of view, swooping camera shots, creepy music and voices, bleeding cellar walls, and unsettling atmosphere are just to name a few as evil forces wreck havoc on an already unstable family of six fathered by closed-minded brute, Burt Young. Although the film falls painfully flat on its face after the actual murders take place, and becomes an awkward and overzealous attempt at making another Exorcist ripoff with the battle between a misunderstood priest, James Olson and the demonic entity. The final climax is convoluted and distorted, but the disturbing events leading up to it are definitely worth checking out. Followed by Amityville 3D, When will Hollywood give up?

One of the movers, Danny Aleilo III, notices a secret room in the basement of the house and when he crawls into it he's hit by this foul and nauseous odor that almost cause him to lose consciousness. What he inadvertently did was release an evil spirit that's festering under the house that was originally built back in the early 18th century on a sacred Indian burial site. By the next day this evil spirit took over the body of the Montelli's oldest son Sonny, Jack Magner, and created such havoc in the house that Mrs. Dlores Montelli, Rulanya Alda, became very religious and went to see the local Catholic Priest Father Adamsky, James Olson. Dlores wants Father Adamsky to come over and bless the house to cleanse it from the evil thats infecting it. The crude and uncouth Mr. Tony Montelli (Burt Young), who's no Robert Young in Father Knows Best, acts like a wild lunatic beating both his wife and two little kids Jan & Mark, Erika & Brent Katz, thinking that their responsible for the strange and weird things thats happening in the house. When Father Adamsky comes over to bless the house Tony acts so unfriendly towards him that he has to gracefully leave and at the same time leave the house under the spell of the evil spirit thats dwelling in it. Going back to his car Father Adamsky finds his bible ripped to shreds by something that has to do with whats happening in the Montelli home. In no time at all the evil spirit completely takes over Sonny's body as he, among other things, forces himself on his teenage sister Patricia, Diane Franklin, leaving her feeling both hurt and unclean. Patricia later goes to confession but is unable to tell Father Adamsky, who's taking confession, what happened between her and Sonny; she only tells the father that she had a tryst with a best friend. Father Adamsky realizes that it's a lot more serious, or sinful, then what Patricia is telling him but seems to be unable, or do nothing, to help her. At a birthday party for Sonny later in the week Sonny holds Patricia in such an amorous embrace that his and Pat's mom, Dolores, gets sicken by it and later tells Patricia just how depraved she and her brother are.The movie Amityville II then follows the story of what really happened at the house on 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville NY with Sonny, like Ronald Defeo who in real life murdered his entire family back on November 13, 1974,in an act of demonic insanity murders, with a shotgun like Roland DeFeo did, his Mon Deloros and dad Tony as well as his two sisters Pat and little Jan and his younger brother Mark. Father Adamsky feeling guilty over what happened at the Montelli house, by him doing nothing to stop it, goes on his own by first releasing Sonny who was arrested by the police at the crime scene from prison, under the eyes of the prison authorities. Father Adamski taking Sonny to the Montelli home to have him and the house exorcised, without the approval of the Catholic Church, doesn't exactly work out like he thought that it would and ends up costing the good Father Adamsky's soul. Much better then the original Amityville Horror with a better script and far more superior special effects, three years in FX improvement in Hollywood made a real big difference. The ending of the movie is a lot like the ending in the film The Exorcist but this time the Catholic priest Father Adamsky did it on his own unlike Father Merrin in The Exorcist, who did the exorcism with the help of Father Karras, and without the approval of the Church of Rome but got the same results as in that 1973 shocker of a film.

It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo.Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974.In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel.From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts.It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Even scarier than the first!","Date":"23 June 2002","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  AMITYVILLE 2 THE POSSESSION is one of the few horror movies sequels that is actually better than its predesessor.

I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets fun after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called goofy, but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

Just as the Montelli family have moved into their humble abode, arms start coming out of walls, blood starts gushing from the water faucets and what we can only assume is ghostly fecal matter has started to flood the basement. These are the least of the families worries, however. Regular beatings aside, the family finds their routine shaken up when the eldest Montelli child starts rebelling. It turns out he is being possessed by some sort of demon and just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they get much worse. Much worse.Amityville II The Possession is a prequel to the 1979 semi-classic Amityville Horror and is (very) loosely based on the DeFeo murders that took place in the famed house before the Lutz family moved in. The script, as penned by Tommy Lee Wallace, is about as brutal and dark as it can get. Just when you think the film won't go there, it goes there. We're talking children being treated violently, a relationship between brother and sister that goes too far and the worst offender of all the farting priest. See the DVD at exactly the 26 minute mark for evidence.The first two thirds of the film set things up beautifully. The film is stylishly shot by Damiano Damiani, giving the film a visual edge over its predecessor. While the sequel comes very close to besting the first film, it unfortunately comes crumbling down in the third act. Without giving too much away, the main business is dealt with in the first hour, leaving the last forty minutes to just sort of dangle in the wind a bit. To quote Jerry Seinfeld, that's a pretty big matzo ball hanging out there. Somehow the film becomes an odd amalgamation of the first film and The Exorcist and in doing so, does a great disservice to itself.When compared to the later installments in the series, this one at least comes out on top. In spite of its awkward ending, it's still a disturbing and thrilling ride that will take even the most jaded by surprise. Fans will get a thrill out of a story that takes things to the next level, while the average viewer will get a kick out of seeing Uncle Paulie himself, Burt Young, going off the deep end. Without a doubt, Amityville II The Possession is a film you're not likely to forget anytime soon.

It's MUCH better than its predecessor, though it still maintains a solid cheese core, especially notable near the end. But until then it is genuinely scary and intense. The main difference between this movie and the first is that this one takes the terror of the house seriously, in contrast to the sensationalistic, oh my god!! tone of the first film.The awesomely-named director Damiano Daminai, who from what I can tell never made another American film, brings an Italian horror sensibility to this film that works very well, in the same way that American movies now are importing a great deal of Japanese horror techniques. Like Dario Argento, Damiani uses long, slow, wide tracking shots and a steadily rising score on a scene in which nothing is happening, using that to suggest powerful invisible forces about to strike. Haunted house films share the challenge of making something that is often invisible interesting on a movie screen, and this one does a good job (like the original The Haunting) of including scenes in which nothing is really happening except people being scared, feeling a presence, or hearing a noise. Lalo Schifrin also contributes a great score (unlike for the first film) that is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann. For the first half at least, this thing is pretty scary! The intensity is ramped up by some out-of-control family dynamics. There are shocking scenes of child abuse in this film! What's more, there's the whole incest vibe going around the whole family that is really disturbing. The older brother (Sonny) and sister do end up getting it on, but what I found more bothersome was the intimations of attraction of the mother for Sonny, as well as the hints of the same kind of thing burgeoning between the two younger kids. The whole sordid family dynamic is shown in a much more shocking way than would ever be allowed today, with all the editorializing that current films seem to do. I also like the idea that the house would destroy the family by making them all lash out at each other.Alas, there is also a lot of bad to this film, but it never crosses the line into being a drag. Alright, it puts a toe over the line toward the end, but&#133;. The main problem of the first half is that the house is ridiculously active. At night, not a second goes by without something not subtle or gently creepy, but all-out exploding drawers, paintbrushes-painting-by-themselves kind of active. At one point Sonny is home alone and the entire wiring of the house seemingly goes out, an explosion rips open the cellar doors, etc., and yet when his parents arrive home an hour later no one notices anything amiss. In the last third the movie takes a heavy turn into Exorcist territory, with many of the components of that movie recycled here, and it was a big mistake. It removes the focus from the house and just puts it on Sonny, and the entire film, rather than being a distillation of haunted house movie tropes, becomes a cheap rip-off of just ONE movie.Here are a list of individual hootworthy elements That sister is a vixen! Look how she comes on to Sonny! Of course, later everyone unjustly blames her for the two of them sleeping together. The tawdry tramp! One of my favorite parts is when the repairman just stays in the cellar room that is dripping blood on him, making no attempt to exit (though the door is a mere 4 feet away). Finally, when the mother suggests that he come out of there (and what exactly was SHE doing prior to this?) the repairman is like Oh yeah, I guess that's a good idea! The actress who plays the mother is Rutanya Alda. She's good, but please, don't name your children after exotic vegetables.The mother says at dinner all we've been doing is fighting since we got here, but there have been no scenes of fighting up until that point.Someone on IMDb was very impressed with the tablecloth scene, saying it had been done in one take, but if you watch carefully I think there are two separate tablecloths, one that flies off the table and out of frame, another that comes in (from a different angle) and covers the crucifix.There's an Uber-80s element with Sonny wearing his big clunky walkman while in all stages of undress. I love how the demon talks to him through the headphones.One thing the movie tries to coast by on is that there is NO WAY this prim, uptight, God-fearing Christian would marry this nasty, dumb, abusive, church-hating schlub! During the birthday party for Sonny, note how the family is all alone, and then suddenly about 40 guests come piling in the door! The Birthday Bus arrived! Throughout there is much confusion about whether it is night or daytime, to the point where you wonder if this was intentional.Check out Mr. Booth with his bald head and freaky goatee! This is the same guy who played the Lion in The Wiz.The black cop ran into a possessed person before, in Puerto Rico! Travel enough, you'll see 'em.The house explodes as though there's four tons of TNT down in the basement! Watch for completely superfluous cracking open of head. It'll be hard to miss.Hey, there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find through the URL in my email address.

A seriously dysfunctional family moves into the infamous Long Island house where the resident demonic forces wreak havoc, ultimately possessing the eldest son. It eventually bogs down to the usual EXORCIST rip-off, but the first half has a frenetic energy that's unrelenting up through the hunting rifle bloodbath which is the movie's central sequence. Some outrageously over-the-top performances, flashy camera-work and genuinely frightening make-up effects keep it from ever getting boring.It was promoted as a prequel to the supposedly true story of the Lutz family, which means it is apparently based upon the actual murder of the DeFeo family in 1974. Although there are obvious similarities to the true story, the movie takes quite a bit of dramatic license. The DeFeo family consisted of five children (three boys and two girls), but there are only four in AMITYVILLE II. Ronald DeFeo, the eldest son who murdered his family, had long hair and a beard, whereas Sonny Montelli (played very well by Jack Magner) is clean-shaven and has short hair. They even show a picture of Defeo in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. If this is indeed a direct prequel, shouldn't he look the same?Although Ron DeFeo was by all accounts a genuinely disturbed sociopath, there were never reports (by him or anyone else) that he had an incestuous relationship with his eldest sister, yet that is a major plot element in AMITYVILLE II. Perhaps the biggest inconsistency is that the DeFeo family were all found murdered asleep in their beds execution-style (which has led to the theory that Ron did not act alone that night). In the movie, however, they are pursued throughout the house. I think AMITYVILLE II works best as an unofficial sequel to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (which a second poster announced during the movie's theatrical release, presumably in response to legal action), in which the Montellis are an entirely new family who have moved into the house and fall victim to the resident evil spirits, who possess the eldest son and make him reenact the events of 1974. Regardless, AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION is a great grindhouse horror movie. It's got a few decent scares and some refreshing creativity in its depictions of the haunting and possession (e.g. the demon talks to Sonny through his Walkman headphones). And although I highly doubt Ron Defeo's face ever really split open revealing a reptilian monster underneath, the make-up effects are superb.If you can get past the fact that the movie is a tasteless exploitation of a real-life tragedy which occurred less than a decade prior to its release, AMITYVILLE II is a nasty bit of fun.

While THE AMITYVILLE HORROR was a slow moving, dull, relatively action-free flick with a few macabre elements, the sequel is an all out in-your-face film with plenty of gross moments and excess gore. This time around there are lots of supernatural events happening constantly, the film basically moves from one of them to the next, with events building up to the eventual shotgunning of the entire family by the teenage son. This scene is very powerful as he even shotguns the little kids to death, and is obviously not suitable for children, and neither is the incest subplot. These elements make this a very adult film indeed.The cast range from good to not so good. Burt Young (ROCKY) is suitably bullish as the father who enjoys whipping his children, while James Magner undergoes an okay transformation into a demon, although his acting never rises above average. Diane Franklin is great as the teenage sister who becomes a victim, but the mother's acting is atrocious, she opens her eyes wide and screams in an over the top unrealistic and awful way at every available opportunity. Moses Gunn and Andrew Prine lend solid support in minor roles, and James Olson (CRESCENDO) is also good as the nervy priest who becomes convinced that the boy is possessed and tries to perform an exorcism upon him.There are a lot of fairly good special effects, especially the surprise ending where the boy rips his face off to reveal the rubbery demon underneath. This is particularly gory and grotesque and shocking, therefore effective. However the demon makeup is far too reminiscent of THE EXORCIST and indeed, in the final thirty minutes that film is copied copiously, with the priest even taking the demon into himself at the end. It's a pretty good and powerful rip off though. Although overlong and unoriginal, AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION is solid dark entertainment with plenty of unpleasantness and disturbing images for the horror fan. Good.

Bad move. The windows are nailed shut, rusty pipes run bloody water, and the house sits on a bed of fly-infested black muck. Right away, you hate this family. Abusive papa Burt Young (as Anthony Montelli) smacks the family around, and refuses to have sex with wife Rutanya Alda (as Dolores). Apparently, Ms. Alda doesn't know a blessing when she sees one. She invites priestly James Olson (as Father Adamsky) over to throw holy water around the house, and on her bed. Meanwhile, sexy sister Diane Franklin (as Patricia) disrobes for incestuous brother Jack Magner (as Sonny).He's obviously possessed, but what's her excuse? The expected Amityville Horror plot turns into something more like The Exorcist meets the monster movie, which turns out to be a good thing. By the film's last rites, you see they actually had something going; now, if they only started without the baggage of the Amityville Long Island house of horror, and simple did a monster possession movie. Director Damiano Damiani can make you dizzy, with some especially good demonic moves. Apart from Ms. Franklin and Mr. Manger, who pretty much carries the entire film on his relatively inexperienced shoulders, the family performs in Razzie award consideration territory.

George Lucas brought us the first three episodes of his 'Star Wars' series and there are now two adaptations of Thomas Harris's 'Red Dragon,' which takes place before 'The Silence of the Lambs,' and we even got a prequel that goes even further back. The question is though When is a prequel necessary? Often times all it does is show how how what went on in the first film started, which can eliminate the mystery. But this is not always a bad move, which has been proved by Lucas's 'Star Wars' prequels and hopefully the same can be said for the upcoming adaptation of 'The Hobbit.' One of the first prequels came in 1982 after the success of 'The Amityville Horror,' and would tell the story of the family who lived in the house before The Lutzes. Actually it turned out to be more of a dramatization of the story and like it's predecessor it too did well. Watching the film all these years later can one say it was worthy of the success? Pros Cast does a fine job. Lalo Schifrin returns with another excellent and chilling score. Cinematography is excellent. Fast-paced. Has a real feeling of doom about it. Some really good effects. Many creepy moments. Quite good direction.Cons Runs out of steam and becomes less interesting in the final third. Instead of slowly building to the horrific goings on like the original this one goes for the Hollywood theatrics pretty quick and is less effective. Becomes a poor man's 'The Exorcist' in the final third, even borrowing things such as words appearing on the body of the possessed person.Final thoughts The first two thirds of this prequel are quite strong and fairly compelling and so it's a shame that after the great tragedy it falls apart. They really ought to have ended the film soon after that or at least have done some serious work on the script. Had it been on par with the rest of the film this may have been the best film in the series, but as is it's still good and worth watching.

After that the boy is arrested by the police and during the last third of the movie it's basically left to the priest to secure his release from jail (totally unrealistic)and try to defeat the demon thereby saving the boy.There is no explanation as to why there is a presence of evil in the house in the first place - especially in that basement!

I don't mean that things like vampires, werewolves or demonic possession don't really exist. I mean that characters behave in totally implausible ways, and that the way the world works in so many horror flicks bears no resemblance to anything on Planet Earth. That isn't true of all horror movies, of course, but it's true of a lot of them, especially lazy, half-witted sequels like this one.The plot is barely worth discussing. Family of unpleasant people moves into creepy old house, kid gets possessed, it all goes very much pear-shaped. You know the drill. It's based (a bit) on Ronald Defeo Jr's murder of his entire family in 1974, but that's where any link with reality ends.For a start, there's obviously something nasty going on in the house. You know, your average holy-water-turning-into-blood type deal, a sea of poo being discovered under the basement, kid going slowly nuts. So what do the family do about this rather major problem? Well, nothing. If they did, there wouldn't be a movie, so they can't do anything, can they? Why does the evil kid's sister allow herself to be seduced by her own brother? No idea. Perhaps the actors were trying to show us a range of full-blooded, hitherto suppressed passion, but they ended up just looking mildly uncomfortable. I wasn't MILDLY uncomfortable watching that incest scene, I can tell you that. It's the most horrific thing in this movie, by a looooong way, and for all the wrong reasons.Then there's Father Adamsky, the world's worst priest. A guy who gets a desperate call for help from a parishioner - who, by the way, he knows is getting a porking from her brother - and he hangs up on her. Later, this hero charges into a crime scene, trampling all over the evidence, shouting 'I'm a priest!' Apparently, this is a good way to get admitted to crime scenes, since no one answers with the rather obvious 'so what, you can still stay behind the lines, fella.' Later still, the same priest springs the killer from a maximum security jail and takes him back to the crime scene. The unguarded crime scene, yet, without a cop to be seen. I guess the cops in that town really trust priests.But you don't care that the plot makes no sense at all. You don't care that some of these actors are at embarrassing levels of crapness. You probably don't even care about that icky incest scene (but you should, really you should). You just want to know if it's scary, right? No. It isn't. Not even slightly. It's just a bit rubbish, with fairly random special effects instead of any actual tension or horror. Hey, look, we can totally make this table spin around!

I'll be honest, I went into Amityville II with expectations so low they were through the floorboards and down the core of the Earth. To my shock not only is it a very well done film but it is probably one of the best haunted house movies I have ever seen. There is so much to admire about this sequel/prequel.First of all I need to get the inconsistencies out of the way. Since this is a prequel it should logically take place in 1974, but it's clearly the 80s. The Defeos are not named as such but instead called the Montellis (why exactly is not clear but I assume it is so Ronald Defeo didn't sue, though he did claim that demons made him murder his family). The interior of the house looks very different, especially the basement. The troubled teenage son doesn't look anything George Lutz either (he actually looks like a cross between Mark Wahlberg and Dennis Quaid), which was a big deal in the first film, but since that plot line made no sense and went nowhere I can forgive that. I also don't mind any of the other retconning that Amityville II does since it overrides the 1979 bore.When the Montellis move into 112 Ocean Avenue (or High Hopes as it ironically called, to this day, in real life) they immediately begin to experience supernatural phenomena (although the Defeos lived there for about a decade before the massacre) and call in a heroic priest (played by General Franklin Kirby himself) to save the day. General Kirby postpones the blessing when he witnesses family patriarch Burt Young brutalising the children in that stereotypical, old-fashioned Italian dominant father way. Older siblings Sonny and Patricia push their incestuous relationship all the way while a sinister force haunts around the family and toys with their fragility. The stage is set for a perfect psychic storm and anti-Christ director Damiano Damiani (yeah, for real) delivers absolutely everything that Stuart Rosenberg before him hopelessly failed to.The camera-work, atmosphere, tension, sound design, believable performances, and occasional hysteria make Amityville II the single shining moment in an otherwise pathetic series. Damiani brings a texture of Italian Giallo (exploitation) and knows when to restrain himself and when to simply go nuts. Lalo Shifrin also returns to score this entry with another lush orchestral effort that enhances the spooky atmosphere.I can't imagine this film inspiring anyone as it is part of a laughably awful series and isn't likely to get the respect it deserves, but the tricks, wit, and intelligence that Damiani has up his sleeve will certainly entertain. James Olsen is a strong lead and blows away Rod Steiger's utterly ludicrous ham acting from the first film.You must check it out as it is perfect brain food for horror fans and filmmakers.

The mother Dolores senses an evil presence and the father Anthony (Burt Young) gets violently paranoid. Dolores asks Father Adamsky to bless the house but Anthony's violence drives him away. The older son Sunny starts to get influenced and he has an incestuous affair with his sister Patricia (Diane Franklin). Adamsky wants to perform an exorcism but he's too late as Sunny kills his entire family.The first hour is a passable horror and family drama. The incest story is a bit too uncomfortable. It's still a fine horror up to that point but then everybody dies. After that, the tension drains out of the movie. I don't think the son's soul is that compelling as a story device. "}{"Title":"A Prequel Before Prequels Were Really In","Date":"8 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies.There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

Hot-headed family man Anthony Montelli (Young) moves his family out to Long Island where a demonic entity begins to tear his already unstable family apart. When his eldest son (Wagner) becomes a vessel for the evil presence it sets off a chain of events that would forever scar the Amityville community and sell a ungodly amount of books and movie tickets. Technical&#x85;Producer Dino De Laurentiis brought in fellow Italian and unknown director Damiano Damiani and by keeping with the tried and true Italiano tradition further amped up the rip-off nature of the production by adding an Exorcist component complete with a dramatic final exorcism. Carpenter understudy Tommy Lee Wallace provides a decent but unremarkable script that gives you the gist of the DeFeo murders but with an Exorcist twist. Composer Lalo Schifrin returns from the original to once again score the festivities with a bit of creepiness. Opinion&#x85; Regardless of your stance on the whole Amityville brouhaha I enjoyed Amityville 2 for what it was. There was an interesting camera flourish every so often and even though the final act was ripped straight from The Exorcist it still managed to be entertaining.

First, I must confess I am not all that up to date on the history of the Defeo family and their horrific end. I understand the film tries to capture some of their story whilst not being too clearly identifiable for legal reasons I assume. That explains the casting of Burt Young in a critical role as the abusive, child and wife beating husband in this film. He is a quality character actor but was surprising to see him all swarthy and unkempt as what I assumed to be the leading man. I assumed incorrectly as he and his entire family save one demon possessed son Sonny are shot to death by that same demon possessed Sonny. The main lead turns out to be vapid James Olsen as Father Adamsky. well, this movie really has two parts the first is the introduction to the house and its new residents - the second post-family with the good priest trying to battle evil on evil's turf. The first two-thirds are definitely the better part of the picture with creepy noises, flying tablecloths, dripping blood faucets, and tension gone wild with the family from loads of abuse to a sibling relationship that is way too close for Godly comfort. Enter Father Adamsky and things still sail fairly smoothly with regard to growing tension and some very eerie scenes, but after the somewhat anti-climatic murders take place, the movie moves to silliness. I found the ending to be way too forced. I am told that this is somewhat of a prequel to The Amityville Horror - a film which I did find to be much better than this. That being said, this movie has lots of atmosphere, which is good, because the acting is nothing special. Young is okay, but the gal Alda playing his wife in not wholly believable. Sonny is played by Jack Magner and is nothing special. Diane Franklin does probably the best job as his overly-friendly sister. Just how much of the story in the film relates to the history of the real house is unknown to me, but I would like to find out a bit more. I guess if a film can do that it cannot be all bad.

In the end I was glad I took a chance with 'The Possession', as while it might be your old-hat haunted house shenanigans it was still very well pulled off and surprisingly exploitive on the matter, especially the stir crazy final half-hour (which is weaker than the strongly gripping hour and feels like its from another entirely different film) that easily borrows ideas form 'The Exorcist' and goes ridiculously bombastic on the rubbery make-up FX. The big thank you could go to Lalo Schifrin's atmospherically grand score, which was right on the mark. Intrusive, creepy, shivery and downright lasting. Director Damiano Damiani's grim, confined handling is quick moving, slick and effectively projected with the screen being blanketed in dull/gloomy coloring with many ghoulishly sinister (and daring) happenings. The house cooks a constantly eerie ambiance, which the wandering camera enforcers. The no holds-barred story (which is inspired by true events, up to a point) doesn't take long to get the tension levels rising and the build-up is simply gutting. We watch the family slowly beginning to cave in and turn on each other, soon after moving in. The spirit that's behind this kayos, takes the shape of POV shots, a simple voice, gust of wind and obviously possessing the inhabitants. No aspirations are created, but the blood-curdling presence is always felt. There's a bunch of accessible performances by the likes of Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, James Olson and Moses Gunn. The young cast featuring a sprite Diane Franklin and Jack Magner (who superbly plays Sonny the unlucky pawn for the vengeful spirit) brought across the right temperament. "},{"Title":"Not nearly as bad as you've heard, and worth another look.","Date":"9 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The Amityville Horror novel is still one of the scariest books I've ever read, and most would agree that the original film did little justice to the stellar prose. This sequel (or prequel, even though this is never indicated in the film, only in the trailer) doesn't have the stigma of the original haunting it (pun completely intended), since there wasn't a best-selling book to compare it to. This certainly helps along the enjoyment of Amityville deux, although the film itself offers plenty to satisfy fans who prefer mental horror over the visceral.The subtleties here make the film, and rewatching it after several years of distance, I noted many minor elements that added new dimensions to a movie I had seen many times as a kid. The gradual change our possessee undergoes is very well realized and clips along at a natural pace, bringing about a slow-burn horror instead of a series of boo-s. The acting is very strong, and the ensemble's reactions to the happenings around them are more natural than hysterical, putting a distinct this-could-happen-to-you air on the proceedings since the characters ring true as normal people instead of horror movie archetypes. Burt Young is absolutely loathsome as the domineering father figure who rules his family with a quick-tempered fist, and his family's obvious fear of him hangs like a spectre in the air of the already-haunted abode. The dynamic between him and his soon-to-be-possessed son is perfectly essayed, and the subservience of the young man to his overbearing senior goes a long way toward explaining the weakness within him that would allow a spirit to enter and take control.While the special effects are understated, this minimalist approach serves the realism of the story, and our possessed lead's performance is so startlingly precise, he sells the demon within him even without layers of latex on his face in every scene to drive the point home. Also effective are the rare moments when we see him overcome with his own humanity, writhing in despair as the reality of his deeds overtakes him. The balance of the two, and seeing him pull the former off without complex make-up effects, really sells the realism at the core of the story.The house, itself, was the star of the original, and it doesn't lose its chilling magic upon the second visit. Perhaps it's the lore associated with the book, but the house actually looks like a place that evil spirits would run free, so simple shots of exterior windows carry an implied menace that are far more effective than the floating red eyes that served as scare tactics in the original.Of course, any review of this film would be incomplete if it didn't mention the unsettling creepiness of the incest subplot, which is unfurled in a seedy way that will test even the most acclimated horror fan. From the brother and sister duo's first scene together, they come across more as a couple than as siblings, and when this unnatural pairing is consummated, the fine acting once again steals the show. The look on sis's face when brother makes his move is a complex combination of revulsion and lust, and her nuanced countenance as she cedes to his advances conveys a string of emotions that it would take most actresses a 30-minute monologue to get across. This scene is surely the most memorable in the film, but it is so because it's played out with the malicious toying nature of a cat stalking a mouse, instead of as a look at her boobies scene.Though disturbing to watch, this subplot is given additional weight from the establishing scenes that portray these siblings as overtly flirtatious to begin with. The culmination of their sensual sparring offers the thinking viewer a great deal of context with which to further ponder the idea of possession and, indeed, evil itself. After all, since it's obvious he thought about sleeping with his sister before the big bad demon came along, did the devil really make him do it? Or did the spirit haunting him simply offer him some sort of excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway? Furthermore, what does it say about the forbidden nature of this particular act when the sister later seems to openly enjoy the scenario? Does enjoyment of sex with her brother indicate some sort of deviant evil within her, and since she's not the one possessed, does that point to an underlying theme of each of us harboring wickedness ripe for exploration? Certainly, no one in the family is truly innocent. Even the youngest children are hinted to have mischievous deeds in their past, as evidenced by Young's reaction following the incident with the paint brushes. Young himself is an aggressive alcoholic who abuses his children and wife, and his spouse allows him to do so, which fosters an environment in which these sins are accepted. Then you've got big brother boinking big sister... So, does the evil truly live within the house, or is the house merely a nexus where the evil within each of its occupants is allowed to flourish and take form? This is probably more thinking than the film-makers intended to produce (actually, I'm guessing this is definitely the case), but the cerebral response is another example of how many different levels this film works on.On the downside, the film it a bit too lengthy (like this review. Ha! Beat you to it...). The running time is about 10 minutes longer than it needs to be, and the most effective parts occur in the first act, which climaxes with the familial executions. However, this is certainly the strongest of the original trilogy of Amityville films. Writing that, I'm keenly aware that distinction is a bit like being the best film the Witchboard series, but even without the Amityville moniker, this remains an intelligent, well-realized, and well above average haunting/possession tale.

Amityville II The Possession is a fictionalized telling of the real-life DeFeo murders that occurred in the Amityville house a year before George and Kathy Lutz had moved in. This film centers around the Montelli family (which is supposed to represent the DeFeos), a dysfunctional family of six who moves into the Amityville home. The eldest son, Sonny, becomes very sick while staying at the house, and odd things begin to happen. They discover a secret passageway in the basement, strange noises occur, and blood spurts from the holy water sprinkler used by the local priest, Father Adamsky. Sonny's illness becomes worse, and it comes to the conclusion that he is possessed by demonic spirits that resulted from an ancient burial ground located and desecrated on the property. He then proceeds to murder his family with a shotgun one night, but Father Adamsky is determined to exorcise his demons.While the original The Amityville Horror may be considered a classic by some, I've always thought that it was a little uneven and not nearly as good as it's reputation, so I didn't know what this prequel would have in store, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. While nowhere near perfect, Amityville The Possession is an very good horror movie that is much more engaging than the first film. The story is based on the real DeFeo murders, and while the events in this film are fabricated and stretch the truth, it's an interesting story nonetheless. The acting was decent, if not a little overdone, but the script was very well put together and made much more sense than the first film.The special effects were also not bad for the time. By today's standards they are leaning on the cheesy side, but I've seen much worse. There are some sequences that were obviously pulled from The Exorcist involving the possession of the eldest son, and there was even some incestuous themes and parental abuse thrown into the movie that will leave you a little sickened - honestly, I'm not sure why the incest or the abuse was thrown into it, but it was a little twisted and didn't add to much to the film. There were nice touches to the movie overall, including the POV shots that go around the darkened house in the middle of the night, accompanied by strange noises and voices - tremendously spooky and very well executed.Overall, Amityville II The Possession is easily much more sophisticated and much better than the film's predecessor. It's got some creepy and inventive moments, and is much more interesting than the first movie was. If you haven't seen any of these films yet, my advice is to start by watching this film, and then watch the original - it will make more sense of it all.

Loosely based on the book Murder in Amityville which told the story of the DeFeo's, the family who lived in the dreaded house before the Lutzes of the original Amityville. Like the first installment this is nearly all fiction and strays very far from the actual (known) account of the family. The DeFeo's were all murdered by the oldest son while they were asleep and that accounts for the knocked down price of the house in The Amityville Horror. Ronnie DeFeo (called here Sonny Montenelli) was found guilty but he claimed that voices told him to do it and that he was possessed by an evil entity. Amityville II The Possession incorporates that element as Sonny becomes possessed and proceeds to kill his entire family. The local priest knows that he's possessed and tries to exercise the demon out of him.The film is stylishly directed by Damiano Damiani and the first hour is genuinely gripping and suspenseful. The sequence where Sonny eliminates his family is quite unsettling and well executed. The brooding atmosphere is well sustained and creepy and all looks set for a first rate horror movie. Then the movie goes into Exorcist territory where the local priest tries to exorcise the demon out of Sonny and it's not as effective as what preceded it. Although well handled in most respects (the makeup job is fantastic), it opens a flood of holes in the story and makes for a lacklustre ending. It looks like a rushed ending, like when a film has been rejected with a first one. Overall Amityville II is a professionally made and mostly scary horror movie which deserves more appreciation from horror fans.

Never mind that the cars look like 1982 models and Sonny Montelli is getting demonic suggestions from his Walkman (a product that came out 6 years after the murders). The DeFeos spent about 9 years at 112 Ocean but in this movie the house is determined to get rid of them before they can even unpack. I don't blame it one bit as this is one nasty hateful family.Burt Young does his Guido-ey finest Joey Buttafouco impression as the family patriarch - whopping the junior Montellis with feckless abandon - with a little goading on the part of Ultimate Evil. Diane Franklin as Trish Montelli seems to be utterly clueless when Sonny moves in for a little Ronkonkoma-badonkadonk. We know Sonny is possessed but what to explain her willingness to roll over for his Amityville Hillbilly games? As Mike and the 'bots would say Dumb as a bag of hammers.Well actually they said, Jodi? Ultimate Evil? Chief? McCloud!Sonny Montelli does a good Menendez brothers impression as a solo act and proves that killing your family is like eating potato chips - you can't just stop at one - and if that last chip falls behind the counter (or makes a frantic bid for freedom) you will not rest till the little bugger gets... in... your... belly!Well he's arrested and his lawyer tries the old not guilty by reason of demonic possession plea. Nice try Skippy, but this isn't Salem, Massachussetts so the kid is sent to the old Graybar Hotel for a stay. At least Martha Stewart left the bunk warm for him...After a few plot convolutions, he's sent to hospital (I didn't know HMOs covered demonic possession) and allowed to escape, he ends up back at 112 Ocean (be it ever so evil...) where the family priest tries an exorcism on him. He probably should've called on a Shinnecock Indian medicine man or two for backup because he's fighting on Ultimate Evil's home turf - and Ultimate Evil fights dirty. All things considered, he should've just let Satan have the boy instead of offering to sacrifice himself.Insert your shopworn joke about Catholic priests and their love for their fellow man here...

Although the family name has changed, the story follows the family whose killing spree was mentioned frequently in the first film. Of course after spending time with these people you would understand why someone would kill them.Papa (the creepy Burt Young playing his standard sleazy bastard role to perfection), Mama (a whimpering Rutanya Alda) pack up the children and move into the best real estate deal on the Island. Their unusually close older teen children (Jack Magner and Diane Franklin) and their younger siblings try to hide from Dad's wraith (he is a wife beater, child beater and if they had a cat, he would probably kick that too). Unfortunately the spirits see older boy Sonny as a excellent patsy and then try to convince him to sleep with his sister (neither one of them really seems to need much encouragement) and eventually kill his family. After Sonny kills them all he seems to have trouble convincing people that it is not really his fault. It seems no one will believe him, no one that is except for the good priest (James Olson) who breaks him out of jail so he can do battle with the spirit within.There is very little original about this film but its willingness to embrace the sleazier aspects of the story make this one the most entertaining of the series. The acting is quite good and the directer keeps it moving at a fast clip.Although widely reviled when first released this film seems to be finding its audience through home video and it definitely deserves its belated success.

Some scenes rip off the exorcist so bad it's a wonder they didn't get sued. For example The scene where we see the words save me on Sonny's arm just as we saw the words help me on Regan's chest. The way certain parts of Sonny's body pulsed and bulged just as regan's neck did. The way the father pleads with the demon to take him just as father Kerris did. I don't really see the point of the incest story line. It seems as if it's been put in just to make it that little bit more shocking than it actually is. The effects were done rather well esp the scene where Sonny's head seems to peel away as the demon leaves him.Nothing to special but a nice enjoyable film none the less.6/10 "},{"Title":"Disturbing and freaky, I love it!","Date":"6 July 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION (1982)starring James Olson, Jack Magner, Rutanya Alda, Burt Young, Diane Franklin, Andrew Prine.plot Anthony (Burt Young) and Dolores (Rutanya Alda) Montelli move into the Long Island home with their son Sonny (Jack Magner), daughter Trish (Diane Franklin) and two younger siblings.

It is very unpopular for being too disturbing. It shows a father beating his wife and kids, an incest sub-plot and a family being murdered by their own son/brother! But that does not make this film bad. It is a horror movie, and messed up happenings can be expected! Tommy Lee Wallace is obviously not afraid to write a film that shows things that most writers are too afraid to show, and I appreciated that.I also enjoyed some of the characterization. James Olson is great as the determined priest who becomes involved in a big bloody mess, Rutanya Alda is good as the Christian mother who just wants to have a happy family but married a scumbag and moved into a haunted house, Jack Magner was very creepy and Diane Franklin was very sympathetic.

Amityville 2 was not produced by AIP, as was The Amityville Horror (AIP was sold and eventually merged into Orion Pictures I believe) so MGM has not released this on DVD, but this film is certainly due for a DVD transfer.

The special effects are fantastic especially in the scene in which the priest is alone in the house with the killer. Only drawback-an unnecessary incest sequence that foreshadows the increasingly perverse nature of post 1989 Amityville films-especially Amityville 1992.

It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem&#x85; It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction&#x85; Why call the film Amityville II if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of Rocky fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him sir. His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on.The acting is, well&#x85; decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department&#x85; this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film.However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of The Exorcist without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching The Exorcist, as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice.Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well.Amityville II The Possession has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original.

Now the real name of the family from the true story was Defeo, but in this it was changed to Montelli for legal reasons I'm sure. But anyway, the film goes along and by the end, Amityville II feels like a cheap rip off off The Exorcist.There is also a very depressing tone/feeling to the movie which involves some incest, physical abuse Burt Young's character shows to his wife and children. And of course there is the slaughter of the entire family. I guess when you go to watch a movie like Amityville II, you don't expect a cheery feeling. But for a horror movie, this one really brings you down by the end of it.Burt Young (star from the Rocky series) did a decent job playing the abusive and belligerent father. Jack Magner who hasn't done anything in film or television since this was effectively creepy. But the story is all over the place and just fails to deliver many scares. The rest of the actors did a decent job, but the priest (James Olson) was no Rod Steiger from the first.There are so many sequels to the Amityville movies, this being one of the more serious one's.

Perhaps.","Date":"15 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The other night I decided to do a little research on some of the best worst movies of all time, and I was surprised to find this guy on one of the lists. And since it has been part of my DVD collection for several years now, it was right there for me to take advantage of. I wasted little time, although I was a bit skeptical as to how significant its comedic value would actually be. It didn't disappoint. I'll tell you right now, there are major spoilers to follow. Of course, after reading them, you'll more than likely have the desire to watch the movie, rather than the other way around. I'm going to focus on the comedic aspect of the film only for this review, in the interest of not writing a book.Here are just a few spectacular moments and reasons to give this a watch 1. The mother's acting...It is priceless. Her reactions never seem to fit the severity of what she's reacting to. Some of her lines are also pretty damn memorable. Early in the film, there's a part where she is describing to her kid the presence she felt in the basement, and that she felt like someone touched her. Her description was, well, genius. It felt like....Fingers on my arm. Bravo! Another 'scratch your head' type line delivered by her occurred when the priest made his first visit and she introduced him to her son. This is my first born, Sonny. He hasn't been feeling well lately. I don't know, it was just so perfectly random, considering nothing had really occurred yet. Including the big event, which I was made to believe was the official takeover of Sonny.2. The incest subplot. Is an incest subplot not enough reason to watch a horror movie? No, I'm not a creep. I just find it amusing in certain situations. This little addition led to quite possibly the single greatest moment in the film. Sonny, in all his possessed, depraved glory, begins to seduce his sister. (This all seemed to go down without the sister having any clue as to what was happening, despite the nauseating and cringe-worthy brazenness of the whole thing.) Finally, all bets are off and he asks her to take her nightgown off, just for a second. Her reply? She would be outraged I would assume. Nope, her look of confusion quickly changed to a big smile as she replied cheerfully, Well, only for a second! That turned out to be the longest second in human history, as you may have guessed. I don't think I need to inform you what went down next. Nonetheless, brilliant.3. Sonny's transformation at the very end of the film. Oh boy. Now, we've seen the physical effects possession can have in horror films. The most notable example being Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist'. Of course, that was reasonably well done, especially for that time. This started off silly enough with the hideous deformities and massive subcutaneous bumps and such. But to see him go from 'Lost Boys' vampire/Pluto from 'The Hills Have Eyes' to something from a science fiction film somehow reminiscent of 'Ghoulies' was a monumental achievement considering the whole thing is actually spiritual at its core. I am at a loss for another explanation for this scene. It was truly mesmerizing.There are countless other absurdities contained in the 104 minutes. The father (whose name escapes me at the moment) got in on the act as well, and basically the entire final 30 minutes or so was inconceivably unrealistic in every way. Lets just say freeing someone awaiting trial for murder can be easier than you think. Oh and also, the film would like you to believe that a visibly ill priest could be left in an abandoned house (that had already miraculously exploded and survived twice) unbothered by the dozens of police, media and other people surrounding the house. It was a fitting conclusion actually.I didn't read any of the reviews on here, but I did see the one on the main title page, and it's titled Better Than The First. My memory of the first is relatively vague, but I'm 99% sure that is not the case. Unless we're going on pure entertainment value, then I suppose the argument could be proposed. I can't imagine how someone could actually take this film seriously. In fact, the 4.8 is something of a mystery. If you don't try to view this seriously, it can be a pretty enjoyable experience.

Essentially turning the audience into the demons/spirits inhabiting the house and following around the characters. Great way to create a presence without using special-effects. This film, as most people know, is sort of a prequel to the original even though the family name is changed. It also has some moments when the family first moves in that is playing at the whole sequel thing, but ultimately this is somewhat based on the story of the DeFeo family who lived in the house before the Lutz family(Amityville Horror.) There is even some scenes that are giving towards a possible theory of these events where Ron DeFeo and his sister Dawn may have collaborated to commit the murders and possible incestuous relationship. Though Dawn was killed the same night with the family, there was unburned gun powder on her nightgown as though she had fired a weapon too. . . Who knows? I really think Ron was too drugged up to know what he was doing. The acting is good here and the characters are all solid. I will have to say that I was pretty annoyed at the parts in this movie that completely rip off The Exorcist with no shame at all. It was great without doing that, so I am at a loss as to why they did this, especially to rip off a film that is that well known. . . Other than that, this is a really sound horror film and was being different on a whole with their Possession tale.Also, to the idiots that keep saying that this film is set in 1974 at no point do they ever say this movie is set in '74! Yes, it is based on the DeFeo case, but they are doing it modern day/different family and as a sequel. .so having a walkman in the film is okay in 1982. That is also why the family name is not DeFeo in this movie.

However that did not stop Hollywood from doing a follow up film, nor did it stop the Lutz's either, who later commissioned author John G. Jones to write a fictional sequel called THE AMITYVILLE HORROR PART II, a book that Hollywood thankfully discarded & instead decided to adopt HANS HOLZER'S (Who's wrote several novels on the infamous house) novel MURDER IN AMITYVILLE, based more closely on the incidents that occurred to the DeFeo family.What should be noted is how different in tone & structure AMITYVILLE II is in comparison to the original movie, it takes a much more darker, sleazier, trashier approach more similarly akin to a Euro trash sleaze film than a haunted house film. Although admittedly it does at times try make a actual drama based on the actual events & even includes brief elements of a court drama with Sonny's lawyer trying to get him off on a plea of demonic possession. It's approach is radically different when compared to that of it's predecessor, which was more or less structured as a slow burning horror film, done in the style of a made for TV movie, even though it was a theatrically released feature, it was done in the style of a documentary that mainly recounted the happening to the Lutz for the twenty eight days they were living inside the infamous house & discarded any kind of real film structure. While this should have made AMITYVILLE II a disaster, the surprising fact is the change in tone does not! Not only is the film more engrossing, it's faster paced & delivers tons of weird moments as well as great monster make-up & special effects, an eerie score by returning composer LALO SCHIFRIN (Who also performed the score for THE EXORCIST, a film which this film seems to emulate, especially in the latter half). Director DAMIANO DAMIANI manages to deliver a series of cool shots & weird angles & manages to keep his viewer engrossed in the characters & situations. The script by former John Carpenter prot√©g√© TOMMY LEE WALLACE although billing itself as a prequel, actually is only partially based on a true story. While the characterization remains close to the actual DeFeo family members, for the most part their names are changed from the DeFeo's to the Montelli's, no doubt done so they wouldn't have to pay to use the real story, several things have been changed from the DeFeo story in order to make it copyright free Sonny has been turned into a possessed maniac who slaughters his family while they are awake & roaming around the house, wherein the real life case had it that they were sleeping in their beds when DeFeo killed them. The number of kids the DeFeo's parents had (five in total) has been parred down to four, therefore the film despite it's prequel status, kind of messes with the continuity of the first film, which said their were five people killed two parents & four kids & the flashback sequences where we seen DeFeo kill his family as they slept. The family here is very well written & the story very engrossing, with some interesting tid bits dropped on the family it is implied that the father may have been trying to rape his wife one evening, that & the fact that this despicable character has no problem beating his kids or slapping his wife around. Unlike the original which also was based on a true story, AMITYVILLE II surprisingly keeps the viewer in suspense, even though they know the fate of these characters & the reason being is because so much of the facts have been changed, that you're actually curious to see how the murders will be pulled off. The film touches off on many interesting & somewhat controversial topics, such as incest, as we see Sonny set to have sex with his own sister, after being taken over by the demonic entity that lived in the house (Though admittedly there is noticeably a very light implication of incest between the two oldest siblings before the possession). Leaving the viewer wondering where the film is going to go next, since no taboo seems to be off limits by the film-makers. What should be noted is how the murders occur close to an hour in, when you're expecting them to occur at the every end. Instead after the murders of the family the film shifts gears to be more in line with an EXORCIST knock off than an actually Amityville movie, as we see a priest trying to eliminate the demon from Sonny's body during an exorcism taking place inside the house. The usual haunted house shenanigans are present here, but are more cleverly conceived & executed & the atmosphere is good & eerie, there's plenty of good scary moments & the whole execution is gloriously unhinged & very compelling. Several scenes stand out, the scary demon voice that talks to Sonny while he is listening to music on his Walkman, a priest dreaming that the entire Montelli family has been murdered, only to awaken & find out it's reality, a priest receives a phone call form the Montelli's oldest daughter, telling him that Sonny may be trying to kill them, which would be fine except for the fact she's been dead a few days! Based loosely on a script by DARDANDO SACHETTI (Who also penned DEMONS) called ENTITY, who's plot about the spirit of an Ogre taunting a family was later picked up & used as the basis for the in name only sequel OGRE DEMONS 3.

They brought it upon themselves and it is hard for the audience to feel compelled to care about what happens to them. This film fictionalizes the events and distills the Defeos (Montellis)from the sensationalism of a hoax, creating a moody atmospheric film about a doomed family from either the Demon, itself, or their own ready to explode domestic violence. It was easy for this evil to take over forcing Sonny to 'rape' his sister, and kill his family, which makes the horror even more seductive and terrifying--the lack of control of his actions.This is a film I found to be extraordinarily creative with a lackluster source material, that if you take it seriously (forget the last half-hour) you will be surprised how controversial this film truly still is even today in comparisons to the moody downer of Tim Roth's the War Zone, which is about human evil.

Not more than 5 minutes after they walk into the house they start experiencing weird things. They find that the windows are nailed shut, the water faucett spills out a red gooey substance that looks a lot like BLOOD, the mother feels something touching her, a mirror shakes and falls off the wall while the family says grace before their meal and the oldest son, Sonny, starts to hear voices through his walkman headphones. Not long after that, the son gets possessed by a demon in the house and ends up murdering his whole family with a rifle. The family priest, Father Adamsky, believes that Sonny is possessed and we have a lame, climactic ending lifted straight from The Exorcist where Sonny gets exorcised and the demon ends up taking over the priest instead. The film is scarier than the original though, right up until after the family gets knocked off, then it copies the The Exorcist in any way possible. The performances are awful, the family is so terrible that the viewer is actually glad they get blasted away. If you want the complete story, watch this one first than the original.

In 1982, Italian director Damiano Damiani gave us Amityville II The Possession (1982), a prequel to the original film which tells the story of the ill-fated Montelli family, who move into the spooky building only to regret not having had a full property survey before buying (you know, one that might have picked up on the whole 'portal to hell' thing).Before you can say 'Captain Howdy', the eldest son Sonny (Jack Magner) is hearing malevolent voices through his Walkman, sporting a pulsating cranium (gotta love those bladder effects), and eyeing up his fathers rifle collection...Taking a very different approach to his Amityville predecessor, Damiani opts to pack in as much exploitative content as possible into his movie, throwing in sensationalist topics such as domestic abuse (the father, played by the excellent Burt Young, is a violent slime-ball), incest, and marital rape whilst also delivering lots of cheesy special effects, a little nudity (from the yummy Diane Franklin), some flamboyant camera-work, a touch of outrageous gore, and an Exorcist-style showdown between a Catholic priest and poor possessed Sonny.

But for what it is - a very loose version of the original serial murders that took place at 112 Ocean Avenue in November 1974 - it isn't bad.Where the original film was laughable in the extreme, this one at least has some narrative interest. Unfortunately the film is overloaded with supernatural goings on to the point of silliness. That's not to say it doesn't have effective moments, such as when Sonny puts the shotgun to his father's head during a family argument (possibly based on a real happening regarding the DeFeos). The movie also features a decent performance from James Olson in the same sort of role Rod Steiger ridiculously over-egged in the original. Mostly he's quiet dignity in the face of all the horrors, and he does it very well.Tommy Lee Wallace turns in an okay script, though the incest sub plot might jar with some viewers; and there are some nice camera tricks from director Damiano Damiani and pretty convincing make up effects. The film also has a fine music score.After the murders (which surprisingly come about 50 minutes in) it goes a little downhill - a descent into sub-Exorcist territory. But overall this ain't too bad. It might have been much better if the movie was a factual account of the actual DeFeo murders, but this probably wasn't permissible for legal reasons.

Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us?It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet).This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, IM GAY! If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison.So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck! "},{"Title":"Decent prequel for the most part.

As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands.Was never really a fan of The Amityville Horror. I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in Amityville II The Possession are based on the Defoe family.While ...The Possession is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed Halloween III Season of the Witch that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off The Exorcist. Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'.

But who can blame Mommy when Daddy happens to be Burt Young&#x85; When Daddy happens to be Burt it's a wonder she ever went to bed with him &#x96; without being dragged, kicking and screaming. Nevermind the prequel to Amityville 1, what I want to see is Burt & Violet The Early, Sex-Laden Years. She's not exactly a beauty, but how the hell did she end up marrying Burt? Were Ernest Borgnine-like butcher-type males all the rage as husband material in the 60s? Every time something eerie happens in the house Burt beats up on his wife and kids. It must be fun to have an entire family as a frustration-outlet punching bag.The priest is really, really bright he shakes the boy's hand - the result of which is that all hell breaks loose - yet the bible-hugger is more occupied with Burt's bad manners than the obvious supernatural goings-on! And I want to know who cleaned up the mess in the kitchen. I think the priest should have done that chore. It was his handshake that made the mess in the first place! Later on, he even ignores Diane Franklin's phone calls.I'm astonished at the ease with which this family goes back to their daily routine after all the insane stuff that goes. A hurricane goes through their kitchen, doors slam shut on their own, weird noises left and right, etc, and yet this family just cheerfully goes on with their chores, even celebrating Sonny's birthday.What is it with these exorcism priests and their tendency to plead for help from a God who barely even throws them a bone? Any entry from the Amityville series makes a suitable accompanying piece to any given idiotic Reality Channel documentary about things that go bump in the night.The positive side is that the movie has that early 80s feel and photography, which elevates it from similar B-movie-ish ventures from the late 80s and 90s.You've got to love that lenghty scene in which Sonny stares into the cameraman's lens, after which he undergoes a Hulk-like transformation. The less-than-incredible skinny zit-faced Hulk. And then he gets a neck tumor. But before that he is nailed to the bed by the ghost/demon. That scene confused me was he raped or merely sat upon? Is this demon a homosexual, or was he merely looking for a chair? He seems to enjoy Sonny's sister, too, so I guess he must be bi.A2 even tries to appeal to the Euro-trash artsy festival crowd by throwing in incest into the mix. How many European movies with incest have you seen NOT win awards? This movie's only sin was that it wasn't a drama, otherwise Cannes and Venice would have been knocking at its door, with a handful of awards shaped like private parts&#x85; A2 sure lays it on thick incest, vomiting, patricide, matricide, sistercide, brothercide, logiccide, neck tumours, child-beatings, Burt Young having good-looking children&#x85; DNA is a wonder. Were they all adopted then?

As such, Amityville II can be viewed entirely independently of the original film and in my opinion, manages in the process to be just as good, if not better than the original and can be viewed entirely independently of its source material.There are a number of directions the producers could have taken with all the press mythology that had already developed by the time of the prequel. While in reality, Ronald DeFeo was supposedly motivated by nothing more nor less than drug-fuelled psychosis, it was more exciting to believe he'd been possessed by the devil. This was certainly the conclusion 'The Amityville Horror' had drawn, and primed the audience - at this time still in the grips of Amityville mania - for more of the same. No doubt the influence of genre successes 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' had something to do with it - especially the former of the two. Was Ronald in need of a priest?In the film, the DeFeos are the Montellis, who already bring a great deal of emotional baggage with them before even crossing the threshold of 112 Ocean Avenue, and this is one of the film's many strengths. With familial dysfunction rampant and everyone already on a knife-edge, the lines between social discord and demonic influence are a lot more blurred, leaving you guessing in places. The father, played by Burt Young, strongly reminded me of Jack Nicholson's version of Jack Torrance in Kubrick's 'The Shining' - from the very first scene, the guy's already unstable, so how do you tell if and when any actual possession will occur? His portrayal was based on the theory that Ronald DeFeo's father must have been something of an abusive tyrant, who pushed him over the edge - something that has been strongly refuted by a family friend. Within the context of the film however, it adds to the drama. And 'The Shining' connection doesn't end there Rutanya Alda gets very Shelley Duvall as the long-suffering wife a hair's breadth from snapping at the next piece of abuse hurled her way. Jack Magner, as the son - appropriately Sonny Montelli, does a highly-creditable job of portraying teenage turbulence, menace and a sea of other emotions the script demands from him. Why we didn't get to see more of Diane Franklin (in the role of the daughter) over the years is a complete mystery. Captivatingly attractive and eminently capable, this should have been her break into greater things (no, 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' doesn't count). Rounding out the cast is James Olson, the kind of actor who IMDb will remind you that have seen several times elsewhere, but doesn't have a really defining role among his many credits. As the man of the cloth in Amityville II, he is more than capable, believably terrified at what he discovers in the house and forced to confront his fear in order to save the innocent.112 Ocean Avenue is every bit a character itself, like the Psycho house, which makes it an obvious choice for the very first shot of the film, setting the tone for those in the know. The return of Lalo Schifrin on the musical side of things provides both competence and continuity with the first Amityville - he already knows by this stage how to draw out the horror of the setting and where best to place it. I can't offhand think of any key differences in direction between Damiano Damiani here and Stuart Rosenburg's work on the original. Damiani seems particularly fond of using the camera from the point-of-view of the unseen menace replete with the 'it's behind you'-type motifs, which are well-suited to the base-under-siege genre in which many a horror film fits.However, 'The Possession' is certainly not without its faults. The finale is where the 'Exorcist' influence is especially obvious, which, given the subject matter, is not exactly out of place, nor are we deprived of a proper ending. It obviously follows the 'possession' theory to its logical conclusion. Nonetheless, it comes across as overly simplistic and therefore not especially satisfying. The other key weakness has more to do with viewer frustration at character stupidity - when you can see the danger they're in a mile off, and even within the context of the story, they shouldn't be so stupid as to walk right into it. In other words, the script trades on scares with clich√©s. Amityville II may not be alone in this regard, but that doesn't make it any less annoying when it happens.Overall, 'The Possession' is a fairly entertaining extrapolation of the source material, and indeed of the rampant speculation surrounding it. As the second entry in the Amityville franchise, it's quite a strong one, standing as it does on its own terms and executed in a more engaging way than the original.

The one thing i have against it is that i thought it was the father who killed them i never heard of the son killing them. Either way it was good it was more scary. Now i know some people say the acting was bad i say it was decent but then again what did you expect in the 80's we didn't get good actors until the mid 90's. Now this movie was good until the boy shot all of them then the movie just got dumbI think they just didn't know what to do after that. When the father goes to see him in jail Sonny shows his evil side the father ask who is in you and bamm that was cut out it was dumb editing. Then there at the funeral and then the trail and it just got dumb. The father couldn't even play a father right when he was giving the dead i guess the last rights or whatever his hand looked like it was moving wind or moving something from a table instead of the cross sign. Then the father takes him out of jail and tries to take him to church. Sonny goes back to the house and the father sees i guess what are Indian people. Oh yeah because the house was made on top of Indian sacred ground but yet they had neighbors on all sides and we are to believe that this only affected this house and that the indians spirits are in the house. As i said this movie had some scary moments but overall it just wasn't good after Sonny shot everyone. Then he turned into an alien.

The possession thematic is well portrayed in the movie but it becomes boring after a while. There are some disturbing scenes that are not called for; for example, a possessed Sonny enters his sister's bedroom and seduces her. The scene is weird but uncomfortable because it's implied that both have a sexual encounter and the scene is very explicit. Surely the scene is sexy but wasn't necessary. Anyways, Amityville II The Possession is a weak early 80's horror movie that tried too hard to create a shocking response but sadly, it's just another flick from 1000's about demonic possession. The best thing about it has to be the acting. The normal family look of these people make you feel sorry for them. The exorcism as the manner to end with the problem was very uncreative.

Unfortunately, if you have the slightest bit of interest in this picture it is mainly because you saw The Amityville Horror and probably liked it. Bless your heart. If this is you (and why would you be reading the review if you didn't have an interest in this movie) then, all during this picture, you'll be plagued with a series of questions that will, no doubt, confound and frustrate you. My frustration and hatred for this film might reasonably end there, but it actually goes deeper than that. It's one thing to sit through a frustrating film; it's another thing to sit through one that bores you into a coma. How do I hate this film? Let me count the ways1.) The title. This is a prequel to The Amityville Horror, telling the story of the events leading up to that movie. There's a II in the title leading you to believe that the events in this movie actually take place after the first picture. How difficult would it have been to simply call the picture Amityville The Possession? 2.) The timing. The original film took place in 1979, and the events that led to that movie took place in 1974. This film takes place in 1982. Since this film supposedly takes place before the original, why does everything look and sound like it came from the early 80s? When exactly does this film take place?3.) The house. Okay, it's impressive, with those half-moon windows, yet as I've worked my way through this torpid series, I can't help but admit that the windows on that house make for a better poster than a movie. Let's face it, there is only so much that you can do with creepy windows. The house, once you get inside, is pretty substandard for a haunted house movie. It rattles and clangs and bangs with rotating furniture, rattling cabinets and slamming windows (which is odd because it is established that the windows are nailed shut). To say nothing of the fact that &#x96; spoiler alert &#x96; the house blows up at the end of the movie. So what house did the characters in the original film move into? Did someone build an exact duplicate of the same house?4.) The characters. They're a family, and not a happy one. The Montelli's problems seem to begin and end with dad's bullying temper. Dad (Burt Young) smacks the kids around when he's not smacking the wife around. The family is made up of mostly generic family types. There's the put-upon wife (Rutanya Alda), the drink-your-milk white-bred daughter (Diane Franklin), the young boy and girl (Brent and Erika Katz) whose entire dialogue is made up of the two of them saying the same thing at the same time. And of course, there's the teenage son, who we know will succumb to The Possession. Here's the issue the family's drama involving dad's abuse is much more frightening than anything else in the movie. Take out the special effects and it might have actually been a better movie.5.) The facts. If you saw the original film, it opened with the murders, an unseen person with a shotgun walking around the house from room to room murdering his family in their beds. Supposedly, the same murders take place midway through this film, they don't match up. Is this a different family? Okay, here I have to give the film the benefit of the doubt, the original film was attempting to tell the story of the Amityville house, but this one fudges on the facts. The family from the original murders was named DeFeo. This family is called Montelli. So, do the events here match up to the original or not? They seem to indicate so.6.) The plagiarism. More time is spent during this movie considering the movie that this movie rips off. Let's see, we've got The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, even the rip-offs of these movies are better than this one.7.) The result. The movie stinks. It's isn't scary, nor is it of the slightest bit of interest. It's frustrating, and worst of all boring. The pacing is too slow, the story is monotonous and repetitive. The end result is that there are probably a dozen documentaries out there about the DeFeo tragedy, and the subsequent events that let to The Amityville Horror.

On the first day, tensions among Anthony and Sonny erupt at dinner time, and then just go even more out of control that night. After collecting themselves, Dolores decides to call in a local priest, Father Adamsky, (James Olson) to help out, and when Anthony gets mad at him, the rest of the family agrees to go to church, leaving Sonny alone in the house. After a series of weird events, goes to Father Adamsky for advice, who comes to bless the house. After seeing the house, he wants to have an exorcism performed on the house, but no body else believes it. After one horrific night in the house, Father Adamsky tries to get the exorcism approved on the house. he discovers that a secret room in the basement with a swarm of flies was responsible for the horrific events, and tries to stop them.The Good News I really think this one is better than the original film. The one sequence that will always force a chill is the sequence in the basement, when after an encounter with a demonic creature, a character slowly backs out of the room and through the house for several minutes, looking intently at an unseen floating in front of him. It's an insanely creepy moment that is so simply in design and gets the most out of it's execution that it really packs a punch. The other supernatural elements on display are nothing to sneeze at either, and make for some fantastic scenes as well. The early scenes, where we prowl through the house at night, are tremendously effective and the use of light and shadow is masterful. In this one, far more than in the original, the house itself seems to become a character and a sinister undercurrent when nothing much is happening is wonderfully evoked. The mid-section murder sequence is also chilling, not only in what happens but also in the mood presented. Highly suspenseful, a couple of great scares, and it sets a great mood. The saving grace is the incest theme, which gives off a disturbing quality but mostly works due to the fact that it's a disturbing quality, and in this kind of film, that's highly commendable.The Bad News I don't care if it's integral to the plot, but child and spousal abuse is not my idea of entertainment. It is just plain wrong, and having scenes with that in a film makes me morally disgusted. It is a real problem and doesn't need to be sensationalized in films. It's still a few small scenes, but any film that depicts that act isn't one that cries out repeat viewings. The only other problem with the film is that it borrows heavily and from different sources. Generally, all of them occur in the final half hour of the film, which really drags it down a lot. There are several different films that it borrows from, and no attempt is really made to disguise them as such. With them being highly noticeable, it can detract from the overall experience. These are the two biggest factors against it, however.The Final Verdict While the original may be a classic film, I think this one is better. It's creepy, violent and very imaginative. One of the better Haunted House films to boot. See this one if you like creepy ghost films or want to see a forgotten classic.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a suggested sex scene, child and spousal abuse, incest and an instance of rape "},{"Title":"Get Out!!!!","Date":"12 October 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" This Movie Offers The Story Behind The Killings Of The Montelli Family That Happened In The Infamous House In AMITYVILLE.

It's an amazing phenomena in horror, because usually the originals aren't so hot to begin with so theoretically it wouldn't be hard to top them?  Maybe a later Amityville beat out the first two . . . I'll never know.  Haunted house movies either have me really intrigued or bored to death.  Nothing in between.Best described Amityville Horror II Possession is the mediocre marriage of two concepts.  The first set belong to Amityville I (haunted house with evil eyes and freaky incidents), the second set belong to Exorcist II (the possession and eventual exorcism aspect.)  We're still good, though, because theoretically we could take the best aspects of the two films and leave behind the crap and make Amityville II what the other two should have been! Wrong!  All the flaws carry over and we get a clunky switch of gears midway through the film.I think that's the biggest fault in my mind the fact that there is a very visible midpoint where we clearly go from Amityville territory to Exorcist territory in a hackjob editing fashion instead of making a seamless transition.  Or hell, they could've left the abrupt shift of gears in and made it work by pushing the abruptness (ie, drop half the hints and get to the murders faster then spend the rest of the film dealing with 'the possession'.)  But no, we get the build up of the house's demonic power as in the first Amityville and the resolution of an Exorcist film-ride one movie going up, and the other coming down.Nothing else really stands out and makes Amity II Possession worth mentioning (for good or bad.)  Acting, cinematography, etc, that you've seen before.  There's a few nicely done scenes that every horror film has, but nothing awe-inspiring or terrifying.  The music, to my dismay, didn't stand out like the first one did (despite being done by the same composer).  Oh well . . .There's better possession films out there and better haunted house movies out there, and I dunno about you, but I'd rather watch two good movies than one mediocre one.

Turns out there was barely enough material for a feature of its own, and so screenwriter Tommy Lee Wallace (working from the non-bestseller Murder in Amityville by Hans Holzer) flails away, adding as much sordid content to the brew that he can muster. It's a grimy, embarrassing display, made even more so by the casting of Burt Young as the father. Young got an Oscar nomination for his work in Rocky but has never managed to outclass his low-life typecasting. Chomping at the other actors like an irate slacker, Young is appalling enough without the surrounding demonic forces--he's the one who needs a good exorcist.

The film opens with a shot of the house with a 'for sale' sign in the foreground as the camera pans around the outside while the credits play. Amityville II The Possession then cuts to another shot of the house, this time the sign says 'sold'. An Italian American family have brought the house & are moving in, husband & wife Anthony (Burt Young) & Dolores Montelli (Rutanya Alda) with their four children, Sonny (Jack Magner), Patricia (Diane Franklin), Jan (Erika Katz) & Mark (Brent Katz). At first glance the large house seems perfect & is beautiful, but almost immediately things start to go wrong for the family. Dolores senses a presence in the basement which she claims touched her, when they sit down for their first meal that night & try to say a prayer the mirror on the wall suddenly falls off & begins to crack. Also that night the family are disturbed by banging on their front door & obscene images are mysteriously painted on walls. Sonny starts to hear strange demonic voices on his Walkman as well. The incidents don't stop & as a result the family starts to fall apart. However Dolores still senses an evil presence & contacts their local priest, Father Frank Adamsky (James Olson) & asks him to bless their house. Meanwhile Sonny is becoming more & more withdrawn as the evil presence in the house specifically singles him out & starts to possess him, the voices on his Walkman convince Sonny to seduce & have sex with his younger sister Patricia & eventually tries to get Sonny to kill his entire family. After witnessing some of these events & doing some research Father Adamsky starts to realise what's going on & is convinced that Sonny is being possessed by evil spirits, but is it too late to save Sonny & the Montelli family?Directed by Damiano Damiani I thought Amityville II The Possession was actually a pretty good horror film & I don't usually like the haunted house sub-genre. The script by Tommy Lee Wallace based on the book 'Murder in Amityville' by Hans Holzer is well paced, entertaining, has decent characters & tries to tackle a few unexpected issues like incest, the break down of the family unit & wife/child abuse. Unfortunately some of these issues seem a little out of place & are treated in a slightly exploitative & lightweight way. But at the end of the day Amityville II The Possession is basically a horror film at heart & exploitation is what we want so I'll forgive it. It uses all the haunted house clich√©s, doors opening & closing on their own, voices, eerie noises, ghostly wind that blows things all over the place, the kind elderly believing priest & spooky hallucinations but Amityville II The Possession integrates them into the story as well as any other haunted house film. The first half of the film concentrates on these family elements while the second half is all about the possession & eventual exorcism which basically feels like The Exorcist (1973) condensed into 40 odd minutes complete with green vomit, but it moves along nicely & isn't boring. There is some brief nudity but the incest scenes aren't particularly graphic. There isn't much gore or violence, some expanding flesh, some shotgun wounds & a cool looking sequence where someone messily rips the skin off their face to reveal a monster. The acting is solid throughout by all involved but I did find Burt Young's character, the abusive Anthony very unlikeable. Technically Amityville II The Possession is a strong film, music, photography, editing, special effects & production design are all above average, very polished & better than usual from a low budget horror. Overall I like Amityville II The Possession a lot more than I thought I would, it's a good solid horror film that kept me entertained for 100 odd minutes & has a little more depth & style than usual without sacrificing the exploitation elements than us horror fans expect & love!

Amityville 2 has addressed the problem of its predecessor being dull by packing in plenty of violence and demonic horror, but it's really just lead to another load of problems as this film fails on too many levels. The film is directed by Damiano Damiani, an Italian director who cut his teeth in the seventies with a load of Polizi flicks. I wasn't surprised that it's an Italian at the helm; rip offs of The Exorcist almost became its own genre in Italy after 1973, and really that's all this film is. The plot focuses on the house that was introduced to the world in the 1979 film and we follow the first family that lived there. The Montelli family move into the house not realising the evil that dwells there. It's not long before the son, Sonny, becomes possessed by an evil demon that instructs him to shoot his family. A local priest discovers what is happening and decides to try and save the boy's soul...Damiano Damiani clearly wanted to shock his audience with this film, but he doesn't manage it because every time something shocking is about to happen, the camera cuts away! I don't know if it was his fault or the orders from the producers, but this film completely misses the point of 'less is more'. The point of it is to make the audience think they're seeing something without actually showing it; but the camera cuts here make it quite obvious that we aren't seeing the shocking things in this film, and it just kills it. Had the film been well shot, it actually would have been quite a shocking horror flick, featuring things such as incestuous sex and young children being blown away; so it's a bit of a shame. In spite of these problems, the film is fairly good, story-wise, for the first hour. After the central set-piece, however, it all becomes rather superfluous and silly. The final third of the movie almost feels like a different film packed with silly demonic voices and rubbish special effects. Clearly this is not a good example of the horror genre, but it is at least interesting as a heavily flawed example of how NOT to make a shocking horror movie.

Furniture moves around the house by itself, blood comes out of the kitchen taps and vile pictures appear on the bedroom walls all by themselves. The oldest son then gets possessed by evil spirits (through his Walkman, for Christ's sake!!) and the film becomes unimaginably ridiculous. Apparently, being possessed leads to incestuous behavior (!) and the boy eventually commits a felony so abysmal I was shocked and offended by it (merely because this kind of horror regretfully often features in the daily news). The entire last half hour is a little too obviously stolen from William Friedkin's The Exorcist, only it's gorier and without any form of tension. Burt Young is very well-cast as the loud-mouthed father but that about concludes the positive comments on this turkey. The photography is dark, yet not unsettling, and the directing is messy and very unprofessional. Damiano Damiani (cool name, though) should have sticked to filming insignificant Italian crime-movies instead of popular Hollywood horror.

This prequel to the 1979 blockbuster tries to tell what happened to the family inside the house before the Lutz family moved in. The film starts off as a new family are moving into the house and soon some unknown force takes control of the 20-year-old son. The first seventy-minutes leads up to this boy killing his family and then the final thirty-minutes has Father Adamsky (James Olson) trying to get the demon out of him. AMITYVILLE II isn't a good movie but it's certainly a step up from the first film, which was pretty much the pits. I think there's a good movie to be had here but nothing ever comes together and in the end we're left with an interesting film that simply doesn't do enough. Like many prequels I think one problem here is that we know the conclusion in regards to the family being murdered. We were told this stuff in the previous film so we're basically just walking around with these characters waiting their fate. I think the film does a decent job at telling their story but the biggest problem I had with this first portion is that the family is so hateful that you really don't care what happens to them. Both father (Burt Young) and mother (Rutanya Alda) are both people that we can't stand and especially the abusive father. The one saving grace is the sister (Diane Franklin) who eventually gets seduced by her older brother and seeks safety from the priest. The second portion of the film pretty much falls apart completely as any brains the film had working gets thrown overboard in favor of some silly special effects and a plot line that's clearly trying to rip THE EXORCIST. I thought everything dealing with the exorcism was poorly done and by this time we've seen it so many different times and ways that this movie doesn't offer us anything new. We do get one grisly special effect where a head gets split open but this here isn't enough to justify a 100-minute running time.Performances are actually the film's one strong point as Olson does a terrific job as the priest and he at least makes us feel for his character. I was also extremely impressed with Franklin who has no trouble stealing the show as the troubled sister. Both Young and Alda are good in their parts but the screenplay didn't do them much favors.Normally you could take a movie like this and say what they could have done to make it better but that's actually hard to do here because I do feel they got everything they could out of the story. I'm sure the entire second half could have been chopped off but if they had done that then they would have had to alter the first portion of the film and who knows where that would have went. Either way, AMITYVILLE II is at least a step up but it's still a film only horror hounds will need to check out. "}]
