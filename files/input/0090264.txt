Often it is labelled the weakest of the Bond entries, but I don't think this is particularly true. Personally, I don't even rate it as the poorest of Roger Moore's Bond outings, with Moonraker and The Man With the Golden Gun standing out in my memeory as less memorable escapades than this one.It's Moore's final appearance as 007, and he is trying to prevent a psychotic business magnate, Max Zorin (Walken) from destroying Silicon Valley and cornering the world electronic market all for himself. To make matters worse, Zorin is not your average adversary, since he was born as the result of a Nazi doctor's scientific tamperings resulting in him being hyper-intelligent but also uncontrollably murderous. The mission takes Bond from Zorin's French chateau, to San Francisco, and ultimately to an abandoned mine close to Silicon Valley, where Zorin plans to detonate a bomb which will trigger a cataclysmic earthquake.The set pieces are memorable, including a parachute pursuit from the Eiffel Tower, a fire engine chase around the hilly streets of San Francisco, and an airship crash on the Golden Gate bridge. Moore looks a bit old for the part, and his sexual humour bears a greater emphasis than usual of the dirty old man baggage. However, he still has an easy-going charisma and good comic timing. Walken makes for a good, supremely confident villain, and is well backed by the fearsome Grace Jones. However, Tanya Roberts might be a gorgeous looker, but her Bond girl character is whining and screaming so much in this film that she eventually wears out her welcome. The theme song from Duran Duran is rather too '80s, but the instrumental music by John Barry is stirring and dramatic.I'm not sure what all the disappointment is about. A View To A Kill is an above average Bond flick with plenty to keep you entertained.

Moore bowed out of the series, just in time (well, at least close to it...) and with a serious bang. Christopher Walken is deliciously evil and psychopathic as Mack Zorin, the Nazi engineered genius looking to take over the tech industry by destroying Silicon Valley with a major flood disaster and earthquake. He is definitely one of the best movie villains ever. Along with some of the best music scoring of all the films in the series, including the fantastic Duran Duran song which epitomizes the 80's, the final showdown between Zorin and Bond on top of the golden gate bridge is breathtakingly exciting. I get goose bumps watching the ending! Many people hate this entry in the 007 series, calling it cheezy, clich√©d, and that Moore is just too hammy and way too old. I disagree. I claim to be a true Bond-phile, having seen every film many times over, and have read every one of the most excellent (and quite different from the films) Fleming novels (btw the Fleming short story View to a Kill is actually the basis for the films Live and Let Die and For Your Eyes Only) and find that this is definitely one of my favourites. A great watch with amazing music, villains, and final action sequence.

And what an exit Moore makes, put simply A View to a Kill is on of the most exciting, stylish, well written and under-rated Bond movies of all time.The basic feel of the movie is pure electric. The series is on a role after the rousing successes that were For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy. Both these movies had represented a maturing point in the series and the shot in the arm of suspense,action and excitement that was needed. This trend is continued to the full with A View To A Kill, and in his goodbye performance Roger Moore manages to remarkably combine all the best elements of his previous Bond movies, and comes up with a perfect way to leave behind Bond and Her Majestys Secret Service.Cubby Broccoli could hardly have awarded Roger a better acolade in wich to leave the series, than to give him the opportunity to act alongside one of America's all time best character/villain actors  Christopher Walken. Walken as Zorin is the best villain in the series since Christopher Lee's Scaramanga in The Man with The Golden Gun. Walken brings a refreshing air of realism and menace combined to put him amngst the great villains of the series. Equally impressive is Grace Jones as MayDay. Jones is the epitomy of a she-hulk and is the very fore of mid 80-s femenism.She strangely manages to be beautiful and frightening in the same breath, and looks fantastic in the action and love making sequences were she lets Bond know who's on top! Then there is Patrick MacNee as Tibbet. Tibbet is a fun character and when posing as Bonds servent early on in the movie Moore takes every opportunity to ad-lib, ordering and bossing MacNee about. In truth it is very amusing to see John Steed carrying Simon Templer's Bags around. It is a petty that MacNee's character is Killed because other Bond movies would have benefited from Macnee's presence. Less succesfull on the character fronts are David Yip, whos character drifts into the movie, seemingly to make the numbers up and is then killed, and of course Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton. Sutton makes Brit Ecklands Goodnight look impressive. Roberts looks good, nd the part is well written , so perhaps it is a case of miscasting. Luckily, the beautiful Fiona Fullerton, who may have been a more impressive Stacey Sutton turns up as the tantalisingly sexy Pola Evanova.The action set pieces like in every Bond movie fire and work on all cilendars. There is a wonderfull pre-credits Ski-Chase battle set in a picturesque arctic glacier. The excitement begins in Parris were BJ Worth doubled for grace Jones and parachuted off the Eiffel Tower, and this is imediately followed by a fantastic car chase through the Parrisian locals. This later shifts to a simmilar scene in San Francisco, wich has bon Escape a burning elavator shaft and end up driving a Fire Engine or dangling from one at full speed through the city. And finally to the Golden Gate bridge via Air Balloon were Bond and Zorin battle to death. Here Walken displays all the depth of his character, giving a knowing giggle before plummiting to his death, as though he apreciates the joke is on him.A View to a Kill represents one of the finest scripts in the series, the battle for monopoly over the microchip market. Even if the climax borrows slightly from Superman the Movies flooding of St Andres Fault, or in this case Sillicon Valley. All the elements work. John Barry's Score is his best since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the title song by Duran Duran is one of the most energetic and exciting of the series and has quickly becom a standard. In all this is a most satisfying Bond movie. An adequate exit for Roger Moore and one that has stood the test of time well. Thanks Roger and goodbye.

Despite this, A View to a Kill has one of if not the best Bond bad guys ever. Chris Walken is in fine form as the evil Zorin - a psychopathic mega-lo-maniac with his eyes set on computer domination of the world by destroying silicone valley. I found his devilish laughter, especially just before he dies, one of the best moments in the film. Also his horse related exchanges with 007 are swiftly and enjoyable executed. Obviously Moore does it again with a fine portrayal as JB. The scene with the Iceberg, the fight at Miss Suttons house, the fire truck, the race course are particularly enjoyable. Grace Jones is VERY scary as May Day and certainly one of the most unusual Bond girls. Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is fine and does what all Bond girls are supposed to do - say oh James at the end of the film. With Lois Maxwell and Roger Moore leaving the series its a good swan song for them both. (Also, the title Duran Duran sequence is probably the best of the lot with its colourful 80's imagery and the punchy track from a great band!)

Christopher Walken who happened to be a product of Nazi experimentation plans to destroy silicone valley and have a monopoly on the computer chip market. This was a great story line, especially in the 1980's when computers were becoming cool.Tonya Roberts, In my humble opinion was probably the most beautiful Bond girl there was. Her sexy throaty whisper was intoxicating. May Day (Walken's strange and muscular girlfriend) added so much too the story, especially what she did at the end.Despite what people say about this being one of the worst 007 movies, it had a solid story. An amazing performance by Christopher Walken and a very sexy Tanya Roberts. This movie should at least be somewhere in the middle of your James Bond list. So please give this one a chance, it's one of my favorites. Oh, and we can't forget the theme song, which has to be the best James Bond theme ever, and you can't deny that.

I'd like to discuss a couple of points mentioned in previous comments.1) Roger's age - I know Roger was in his late 50's when this movie was made but I don't think it really affects the flow of the film. I actually think this is one of Roger's better films.2). One of the worst bond films of all time - Lot's of comments refer to this movie as being Roger's worst and possibly one of the worst Bond movies of all time. For me the movie has all the essential bond elements a sexy bond girl, a great theme song, terrific bad guy (Christopher Walken) and Roger on top form. The humour is there throughout the film and it just feels like a bond film. Compare this to 'for your eyes only' which never felt like a bond film to me.

With a supporting cast of Christopher Walken, Grace Jones, Patrick McNee, and Tanya Roberts, and locations such as Paris and San Francisco, what you have is another Bond movie with the size and scope to match any of its contemporaries.To start with the good points, Roger Moore is once again reliable and believable in the role of Bond, and although critics of this movie maintain he was told old by now, this is disputable. The script doesn't allow him as much of his custom wit and repartee, with the writers dropping his usual amiability towards the villain in favour of a disgusted and repulsed tone, which is quite a turn. For those sick of the movies where Bond and his enemies swap endless pleasantries despite efforts to kill each other, check out the Bond/Zorin scenes towards the middle and end of this film. Although not Moore's most memorable turn, he is very solid as 007.Christopher Walken as Max Zorin, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment who was artificially given both incredible intelligence and psycopathy as a side effect of his mother's treatment in the concentration camps before his birth, gives us an odd-ball but distinctive performance, and is very credible as a single-minded sociopath. Grace Jones plays MayDay, Zorin's bodyguard/girlfriend/personal trainer/hit-woman/seductress and whilst she won't go down as either one of the most beautiful Bond girls or one of his most feared villains, Jones still comes across well with some menace and formidable qualities that even Bond struggles to get to grips with (quite literally!). Both Walken and Jones were odd choices for roles in a Bond movie but both acquit themselves well and gain a respectable place in the pantheon of 007's enemies.Continuing with the positives, the regulars M, Q, Moneypenny, Frederick Gray, and General Gogol (with Lois Maxwell in her last Bond role) are dependable as ever, and are joined by David Yip as a CIA agent. As in the two previous Bond movies, Moore is joined by a fellow agent on his mission, this time Patrick McNee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a horse racing expert affiliated to MI6. In some brilliantly funny scenes, with Bond posing as an owner and Tibbett as his valet, the pair go undercover at Zorin's stables during a horse sale with both hamming it up to distract the guards from suspecting them as impostors. Moore and McNee also appeared together in Sherlock Holmes in New York as Holmes and Watson respectively, as well as The Sea Wolves, and their chemistry is a highlight of the film. Too bad really that Tibbett is assassinated in unusual but chilling fashion by MayDay before the film can make more of his obvious debonair charm.Also on the plus side, the action is handled very competently, with a Siberian (actually Iceland) ski-chase featuring some extreme-sport pursuits like snowboarding before they became more well-known, an adrenaline-fuelled horse race in which Bond comes under attack from Zorin's henchmen, and a scene in which a Russian agent is fed into a propeller after he is found spying on Zorin. There are also some great stunts, such a base-jump off the Eiffel Tower and in the aforementioned ski scene. For a Bond film the plot is actually fairly logical, although it seems to have borrowed some inspiration from its predecessors. Having said that, which Bond film didn't?However it isn't all roses. Tanya Roberts is extremely annoying and not at all believable as California's state geologist and a businesswoman whose shares Zorin is trying to buy. Every time it comes to a fight or some action she cowers and whimpers, yelling `Help me James' at the top of her shrill voice, and spends most of the time as some sort of damsel in distress for Bond to save. Apart from Mayday, the henchmen are rather boring this time, with a bunch of caricatures instead of characters a Texan oil boss, a mad scientist (plus monocle, tweed suit, wild hair, and German accent), and a tall silent type with a facial scar as his single defining feature. Lucky then that Walken is there to bail the movie out and prove, as the tagline suggests, to provide a match for James Bond.Also, the technically well-done chase sequence in Paris is ruined due to a ludicrous moment in which Bond-s care is hit by another and breaks in half! It looked cool driving on two wheels, but it would have been better in a cartoon. In keeping with some of the less attractive Bond conventions, some of the other action scenes are ruined by an overly-jokey feel - the San Francisco fire truck chase, for example, is played totally for laughs, and, like the Golden Gate Bridge scenes, features so much poor back-projection it is hard not to laugh. Plus, the pre-credits ski-chase is wrecked by an 80's cover of 'California Girls' being played over the action, and Bond's companion and vehicle at the end of this sequence. For all the problems in this paragraph, director John Glen deserves the blame, although he was hardly alone in getting things wrong during 007's 40-year history.Despite criticisms from some that this is a tired movie with a re-hashed plot and an uninspired screenplay, A View To A Kill holds up pretty well. Most diehard fans of the series don't rank this too highly amongst the others, but for the less demanding viewer there is enough of the Bond formula to appreciate, without a great deal of silliness. There are a few flaws in AVTAK but the positives outweigh the negatives, and while Roger Moore didn't make a great success of his post-Bond career, at least he had a very respectable sign-of from the series with this.Verdict 3.5/5 Well worth watching.

Some of the scenes in France drag on (the horse steroids subplot is tangential to the main story about microchips), but A View to a Kill is still more intelligent than the mindless, over-the-top-action-over-storyline Bonds of the Pierce Brosnan era.

So far the only film I haven't enjoyed in the series has been Roger Moore's Moonraker, just because of the over the top silliness and the obvious sell-out to appeal to moviegoers who had just seen Star Wars.Upon seeing 'A View to a Kill' I instantly was prepared for the worst, and let me tell you this certainly is a bad Bond film. Moore is showing his obvious age, making the relations with his leading ladies undeniably awkward, to say the least. The plot is as simple as they come, and none of the actors are really given any chance with the dialogue they have been given. Moore has very few witty comments in this movie, and most of the other characters are cardboard cut outs.One thing however manages to make this film better than Moonraker. This is the under-appreciated role of Max Zorin, played by the always wonderful Christopher Walken. I can say without a doubt in my mind that Walken is the single saving grace in this film, exhibiting everything any good Bond villain needs.Exotic locations Check! Unique henchmen/henchwoman Check! Surrounded by beautiful girls Check Cold and ruthless attitude Double check! Heartless and chilling disregard for henchmen life CHECK Walken, with a horrid script (every character in this movie is poorly written) is able to create one of the best Bond villains I've ever seen! The way he talks, the way he acts, everything he does showcases his undeniable talent. So for a movie like 'A View to a Kill' Walken's performance is like shifting through sewage and finding a large diamond ring.It is because of Walken that I recommend this movie and give it a relatively good rating. Everything else about this film is really forgettable. You'd think a super-strong female henchwoman would make for a memorable moment in the franchise, but this is so poorly handled that she winds up as one of the most forgettable characters in the series, as opposed to one of the best.Roger Moore, unfortunately, ends his career on Bond in perhaps his own worst performance, which is undeniably sad. It seems that all Bond actors seem to end their careers on the lowest of their films (Connery with 'Diamonds are Forever', Brosnan with 'Die Another Day', and though Dalton was a great Bond, I have to say 'License to Kill' was a weak film) but with those films it has always been more the scripts fault, as opposed to the actor's talent (all three tried their best with the material). Moore is just plain stiff in his last entry! The man seems to have totally lost interest in playing the character by this point.I consider 1979's 'Moonraker' Moore's worst, but like 'Diamonds are Forever', and 'Die Another Day', Moonraker was more the fault of the script writers; not the Bond actor. In 'A View to a Kill' Moore really shows that he is no longer capable of playing the part, and that is the saddest part of the film (especially seeing Moore seducing girls much younger than himself, with his developing turkey neck becoming quite obvious). Walken makes the movie an enjoyable, B-grade action movie, but as for Bond, this is where it becomes an undeniable fact that Moore has overstayed his welcome as Agent 007.Moore deserved a better ending, and the fact is that he just shouldn't have come back for this film. Octopussy may have actually been a decent departure, but Moore decided to try one last time and it really is the straw that breaks the Moore Bond's back. Enough was enough, and Moore failed to recognize when he should have cried when! I give this film a decent rating for the performance of Christopher Walken, but everything else is very low, and forgettable. Go and see it for Walken, but it is sad to see Moore's finally desperate breaths as he tries to keep the character going one last time.

It was because of that last half hour that I decided to watch all of AVtaK and more movies in the series.

We soon learn that the chip recovered from Siberia matched those made by a government contractor recently taken over by Zorin Industries. Bond is given to job of investigating Zorin; a task that takes him to France where Zorin is holding a horse sale. Bond learns that Zorin is stockpiling silicon chips but at this point he has no idea why. The only real lead he finds there is a cheque written to a Stacey Sutton, Californian woman for five million dollars. It is at this point that the viewer learns his plans... he is intending to destroy Silicon Valley to give him and his associates a monopoly in silicon chip supply. Bond heads to California where he learns that Zorin is pumping sea water into a series of oil wells. He is initially told that this is routine to test the pipes but when he finds Stacey she tells him that Zorin has been trying to force her to sell her family's oil well and that pumping water into the wells is dangerous as they are on a fault. It turns out he plans to flood both the Heywood and San Andreas Faults while simultaneously blowing up the location that prevents both of them having earthquakes at the same time... Bond and Stacey only have a limited time to prevent to flooding of Silicon Valley and the drowning of hundreds of thousands of people.As with the other Roger Moore era Bond Films this one contains many elements that are fairly silly; whether that makes them more entertaining or just annoying will depend on the viewer... a case in point is the use of the song 'California Girls' as Bond 'surfs' on a makeshift snowboard in the opening scenes; personally I thought that was rather fun but I know others disagree. Christopher Walken who played the psychotic Zorin made an entertaining if somewhat OTT villain and Grace Jones was good as his Amazonian assistant May Day; although better when doing action scenes than when talking! Roger Moore once again put in a fun performance as Bond although by now he was getting a little old for the role. It wouldn't be a Bond film without exciting stunts in impressive locations; these included having Bond chase May Day in a stolen taxi as she parachuted from the Eiffel Tower; Bond fleeing from the police in a huge stolen fire engine and finally a fight on the top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. It could be argued that the plot has been taken straight from 'Goldfinger'; right down to killing the 'investor' who decides not to proceed when he learns just what the villain is planning, while this is a fair argument I don't think it spoilt the film, even if it is not in the same league as the earlier film. Overall this was a decent final Bond film for Roger Moore although it is far from his best; still it is a fun way to pass a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon!

He announced that Roger Moore - who had declared his retirement from the role earlier that year with 'Octopussy' - had signed for a seventh movie, provisionally titled 'From A View To A Kill'. In other words, it didn't matter whether or not 'Again' was a hit, because Moore was still going to be around in the future. Loosely based on Ian Fleming's short story ( which appeared in the 'For Your Eyes Only' collection ) 'A View To A Kill' appeared two years later, again directed by John Glen. Critics who had claimed the 56-year old star too old for the role had to eat their words - in fact, he looks in better condition than Connery did in 'Again'. The plot by Michael G.Wilson and Richard Maibaum has Bond investigating the nefarious activities of millionaire 'Maz Zorin' ( Christopher Walken ). When I saw this originally, I chuckled. They've remade 'Goldfinger!, I thought. Only with microchips instead of gold bullion!. The two films are similarly structured. Instead of cheating at cards, Zorin is fixing horse races with the aid of steroids and micro-chips. Whereas Goldfinger wanted to increase the value of his gold by blowing up Fort Knox, Zorin wants to increase the value of his micro-chips by triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas Fault, California, thus destroying Silicon Valley.'Kill' is a long way from 'Goldfinger' in terms of quality, of course, but it is much better than 'Again'. The equivalent 'Oddjob' is the enigmatic 'May Day', played with gusto by singer Grace Jones. Strangely, she never gets to fight Bond, which is a pity as the posters gave the impression such a skirmish was going to the movie's highlight. The action scenes start with an impressive Siberian skiing sequence ( marred only by the use of the Beach Boys' 'California Girls' ), and go on to include May Day jumping off the Eiffel Tower, Bond losing half his car in a chase, Bond and 'Stacy Sutton' ( Tanya Roberts of 'Charlie's Angels' ) trapped in a burning lift shaft, a chase involving a runaway fire engine in San Francisco, and Bond and May Day in a flooding mine, culminating in a climax involving an airship and the Golden Gate bridge. One of the film's pleasures is seeing Moore alongside Patrick Macnee of 'The Avengers', cast as 'Sir Godfrey Tibbett', Bond's sidekick. There is an amusing scene with Bond posing as a rich man and Tibbett as his chauffeur. It is a pity Tibbett was written out so soon. More of him and less of Fiona Fullerton's arch Russian agent - 'Pola Ivanova' - would have helped the movie no end. Moore was reputedly uncomfortable with some of the more violent aspects, such as Zorin machine-gunning to death his own men. With its lively 'Duran Duran' theme song, 'A View To A Kill' was another big hit when it opened in the summer of 1985. Though it was not formally announced at the time, it was obvious that Moore was not coming back. Ditto Lois Maxwell as 'Miss Moneypenny'. His tenure as 007 - seven films across twelve years - marks him as the longest serving incumbent in the role. He might not have pleased humourless Ian Fleming fans, but there is no denying that he was massively popular with the general public. His successor, Timothy Dalton, was closer to the original Fleming character but the public chose not to endorse him. It was not until the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in 1995 that Moore was successfully replaced. The look of pleasure Moore put on the faces of cinema-goers world-wide took a long time to fade.

For me, he was my favorite, possibly still is. Part of the reasons for this is a pure nostalgia factor in that he was the Bond when I was growing up. His films were the ones that were on television and when there was a new film he was Bond. Another reason he may be my favorite is the movies themselves. His Bond films were an eclectic collection of movies that were usually fast paced and fun. Most of his films featured multiple exotic locations , lots of cool action sequences and an awesome villain. Roger Moore's Bond got to duel with Christopher Lee and in this one Christopher Walken two of the best actors to portray Bond villains. Sure, Octopussy was almost the Austin Power's of its day in that it was almost a parody, but this one reigned in the campiness a bit and while not his best work, still ended his tenure as Bond in nice fashion. Not perfect, mind you, as Timothy Dalton's 'The Living Daylights' would be better, this one is still is a good Bond film that probably did represent the 80's more so than did any other Bond film from its opening featuring a Duran Duran song and lots of neon to the inclusion of Grace Jones as villainous sidekick Mayday.The story has Bond recovering a microchip from a Russian facility that mirrors one at a plant run by Max Zorin. Meaning that somehow the Russians have gotten a hold of one of these chips. James sets out to investigate Zorin at his horse staples as Zorin seems to also have an unnatural edge in the racing of horses as well. It is not too long before Zorin tries to off Bond and show himself as the bad guy and soon Bond must go to San Francisco where he must try to figure out what Zorin's plans are as Zorin seems to be plotting something large. Bond will be assisted by a lady that Zorin has been trying to pay off and intimidate and together they will find themselves in a cave that is laden with Zorin's men as they plan to do something insane to turn the world of computers and microchips decidedly in Zorin's favor.Roger Moore was quite old by this time and it was time for him to relinquish the role of 007. That being said, he still did a great job as the one thing you can say about him is that unlike Sean Connery near the end of his run as Bond, Moore still seemed to have fun doing it. In fact, I would say had Moore started as Bond instead of Connery, he would likely have kept the role up to View To a Kill. Here his age is apparent, as he is older than Connery, so one knows that you're mainly getting stunt doubles, but they made it work. Christopher Walken is the main villain of the piece and he is crazy good. Probably one of the more psychotic Bond villains he relishes killing those who work for him and laughs as he faces death. Grace Jones is also in this film and like most of the villains henchmen, she is a formidable opponent. Patrick Mcnee also does a good job as the agent initially investigating Zorin's horses. Now for the main problem with the film, Tanya Roberts. She has the looks, but she just does not seem like a Bond girl to me. She is perhaps, my least favorite Bond girl besides Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough.So, I think this film was a nice farewell for Roger Moore as Bond. I actually thought Octopussy was good too, but this one was just a better send off as it had less comedic elements than did that film. Like I stated above, that one was nearly a parody in areas. Roger Moore's age does show, but he still carries the film well as he faces off a very nice opponent in Zorin played by Walken. I did not enjoy this one as much when I was younger, but it has grown on me, it is just nice to see so many very well down practical special effects rather than mainly CGI ones that accompany nearly every film released these days. It is also interesting that this is the film that sort of brought snowboarding into the open and made it quite big, so Roger Moore's final Bond film did start something rather big and that is rather cool. So is this film&#x85;not even Moore's best Bond movie, but a nice cool entry into the series and a nice farewell to probably the actor who enjoyed being Bond the most.

The film is the final outing of Roger Moore before he handed over the role to Timothy Dalton and I can see why as he really is looking his age. But even though he may not be as agile as he was and he may need a few more stunt doubles than is necessary, he still does a pretty stand up performance. Christopher Walken also plays an enjoyable bad guy as the psychotic Max Zorin, a Genetically Engineered Child of a Nazi Scientist who has incredible intelligence with the side effect of psychotic behaviour. He plays a really quite complex villain which can go from menacingly calm to psychotically over-the-top.The film follows the story of Bond as he tries to stop the evil Zorin from flooding Silicon Valley near San Francisco by way of causing an earthquake on both faults located in the area. A pretty reasonable story if you think about it. How can Zorin achieve the ability to control Geomorphology? How can Bond stop him? Why does he want to destroy the Valley? Only the movie holds the key.As mentioned, not over the top, quite humorous in places and apart from that, has the best Bond Theme I've heard in a long time, up there with 'You Know My Name' from Casino Royale!

Bond discovers that Zorin is planning to set off an earthquake in San Andreas that will wipe out all of Silicon Valley.There are some intense action scenes followed by a fast-paced and exciting plot by Richard Maibaum and Michael G.

Moore's continuing unique suaveness and charm as 007 kept this movie entertaining and, this being Moore's 7th and final appearance as 007, it appeared he was just having a blast for his farewell. I thought Moore added more humor and physical comedy in his acting, especially during the chase scene through a wedding party (Bond hands the wedding cake to the groom he had just accidentally smashed and says, Congratulations!). Max Zorin makes a ruthless and crafty villain, making you love to root against him.

A View to a Kill marked Roger Moore's last film as 007 (a forced exercise to him, since he was hoping that For Your Eyes Only would be his final), not much of a great exit but still a fun thing to watch. My evaluation of this film comes in light of how Bond series changed through the years, stuck with some aspects, characters, situations, his eternal drink, and why even the funniest flicks of the agent still are slightly better than the ones we're seeing now. It's a generation thing, I grew up watching those films and they were a lot of fun. I know the whole change behind the longest franchise so far (let me know if there's any other...) was to gather a new audience and maybe preserve the oldest, just like the Batman reboot started brilliantly with Christopher Nolan, and many other franchises went along. But that didn't meant quality in the Bond case. Fine, the oldest ones like A View to a Kill were ridiculously in its editing, you can clearly see the stunt double changing places with Moore or Connery, or whoever is playing Bond, and it's very funny and a little bit over-the-top but they were fun, amazing, pleasant to watch. Now, all we have is dramatic parts, a certain reluctance in acting (this never works in Bond films, take a look at George Lazenby only instance), an agent with so much feelings. I liked the movies but didn't enjoyed them so much (Q is going to return, so let's see, difficult to replace the irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn).Enough with the comparisons, let's see what A View to a Kill is all about. 007's mission is to investigate the eccentric Max Zorin (an blonde Christopher Walken) and his enigmatic Zorin Industries and the masterplan that involves the destruction of the Silicon Valley. And Bond is escorted by Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts, you all know her from That 70's Show as Donna's mom) and May Day (the diva Grace Jones), Zorin's partner and a woman of many talents. Among the action sequences, highlight to the chase at the Eiffel Tower and the fight on the blip flying over San Francisco, where it also happens a strange car chase that looks more suitable on a Police Academy movie than in a Bond movie. There's excitement and good moments overall, some forced moments and an almost empty plot when it comes to the villainy committed (just a psycho who wants to sink Silicon Valley? We could have more). Don't even get me started on how bad edited some sequences were (the car chase in Paris, it's unbelievable how close they were from the stunt double, obviously not Moore driving that half car) or even endure with Roberts sexy hoarse voice all the time calling James! (priceless!), far from being perfect. But who cares? This is so much fun, highly entertaining, it's always a pleasure to see Moore as Bond (the funniest and in a good way!) and there's the best theme song ever in a Bond movie, Duran Duran's title song (the video clip is even better, with the band members at the Eiffel tower, mixing scenes with 007 chasing the mysterious killer).You can't miss this! 10/10 "},{"Title":"Saved by Grace Jones and Bond has an unusual skill in this","Date":"18 June 2011","Score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I think anyone who flicks on ITV1 in England on a Saturday afternoon will see this about three times a year. Basically the plot is about a psychotic billionaire named Max Zorin who wants to destroy Silicon Valley in California so his corporation gains a monopoly in the computer and IT industry.However, while a decent film to round off Moore's 12 years as Bond and vastly better than Connery's sign off with the ghastly Diamonds Are Forever, what really stands out for me is Grace Jones as Mayday. Beautiful in an unconventional way and with a conditioned physique, Grace Jones really takes to the role as Zorin's lover, assassin and bodyguard. This is one lady you wouldn't mess with as she is an expert at karate and judo and an expert with all kinds of weapons. Also she redeems herself at the end by siding with Bond when she realises Zorin has tricked her and has left her to die. Now if only Grace Jones had the role as the Bond girl- maybe as a good version of Mayday- this film would get ten stars as I found Tanya Roberts dull as the Bond girl in this.Also Bond develops an unusual skill not normally associated with 007, he is an expert cook, making a quiche Gordon Ramsay would be proud of. This again is typical of Moore's portrayal of Bond, being a bit more human than Connery, and as ever the corny quips keep coming throughout the film.If you decide to watch A View To A Kill, it is quite a good film with its budget well spent and is a good way to pass two hours. However, it isn't up there with the likes of Goldfinger and Moore is starting to look old by 1985.

It's entertaining, the story is fresh and creative, and the characters are well-cast.  Firstly, Roger Moore, who was 57 at the time, was NOT too old to play 007 in this film. Can we really define too old when actors that are in their 50's such as Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone regularly star in action films today.  If Indiana Jones 4 and Terminator 3 both came out tomorrow, most of us would rush to buy tickets, thinking little about the fact that Ford and Schwarzenegger might be a little old.  I think that Christopher Walken played an excellent villain.  His character, Max Zorin has it all creepiness, unpredictability, and an appetite for death and conquest.  Some people are shocked about the segment in the mine scene when Zorin takes out a bunch of his workers with an Uzi.  To those people I say, Hello!  Max Zorin was psychotic!  This scene was an excellent demonstration of his sick mind.  Had you been paying attention to the movie you'd know that!  The bottom line is that the cast is great and the story makes perfect sense(more than I can say for The Living Daylights, which is somehow rated higher on this site).  In light of this, I don't see how anyone could hold it with such contempt.  In a way, A View to a Kill is like the New Coke which was introduced around the same time.  It's formula, while deviating from the original, offered a far superior taste.  Despite the excellent taste, it was still shunned by the public and fans of the original Coca-Cola, much like this movie is shunned by James Bond fans.

I also know that Roger Moore was in his late 50's when he did this film, but he still looks like he is in better shape than when Sean Connery did his last Bond film, Diamonds are Forever (not counting Never say Never Again). Sean Connery was just 41 in his last Bond film and he looked like he was getting fat, at least Roger Moore has tried to keep in shape and for being 58 he doesn't look too bad. As for me I think that Sean Connery was a good Bond, but still a little overrated. I do believe Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore, and even this new guy, Danial Craig, are all better than Sean Connery. Sean Connery has done even better roles than James Bond.Now back to the movie. It has every thing you want in a film. It has one of the better looking Bond girls in the series, memorable villains (Zorin and Mayday), great action sequences (The opening ski chase scene, the fight on the Eiphal Tower, the fire engine chase, and the dual on the Golden gate Bridge), great plot (Zoring trying to destroy Silicon Valley so he can take over the microchip market) and a great original song. Roger Moore still puts out a good performance as Bond, but I feel this time around that Christopher Walken was even better as the villain.

I rather enjoyed the opening theme by Duran Duran, even though I strongly disliked the visual aspect of it.Easily one of the worst Bond films in history, AVTAK accomplished the same thing that Connery and Brosnan's last films did for them.With Moore now into his late 50's, we see that he should have called it quits with Octopussy or even For Your Eyes Only. The films starts off with one of the absolute worst sequences with Bond 'snow surfing' to the song of California Girls. I would ask the producers what they were thinking when they decided to have an almost 60 year old looking Bond try to pull off stunts that most 30 year old can't pull off, but I'm sure they are thinking that already. Also, where is the classic Bond score during a scene like this??? What an abomination. I would discuss Bond's escape into a miniature submarine disguised as an iceberg, but I would rather not have you think about it.I won't go into great detail concerning the plot, because I feel like it isn't even worth mentioning. With some Bond films I can easily say that the plot was a great idea, but poorly conceived. This is not one of those times. The plot is extremely choppy, campy, and drags in almost every scene. From beginning to end I kept thinking to myself 1) Is it really getting this much worse? 2) How is it possible that they messed up a Bond movie like this after two great films back-to-back? The climax, or lack there of, was short and completely loony. Watching 57 year old Moore playing Bond in some of the most overblown stunts in the franchise's history was more than laughable. I was more than happy when the credits started to roll.Even though Christopher Walken is a great actor, he played one of the worst Bond villains. He mannerisms and overall appearance were frustrating and ill-timed. Grace Jones, while quite gritty in AVTAK, ended up falling short as well. The one thing that prevents me from watching this movie entirely anymore, is Tanya Roberts as Stacey Hutton. Again, why would the producers allow the footage that they shot of her to even enter into a theater? Her constant shrieking and crying is worse than that of a 2 year old. She played no part in Bond's mission and was a complete hindrance.2/10 "},{"Title":"Who car-jacks a snowmobile, taxi cab, fire truck, and blimp . . .","Date":"31 July 2014","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" . . . all in the same movie?

With a great title song from Duran Duran, the film has a unique if rather unspectacular plot (Christopher Walkin, with blond-dyed hair and sociopathic, cold-blooded method of conducting business, plans to use an earthquake to submerge Silicon Valley under water so he can take full control of the microchip industry). Walkin's Max Zorin is assisted by titanic model May Day (Grace Jones) who can lift people in the air, throwing them around like rag dolls, and is not afraid to kill for her man when needed. Tanya Roberts is a geologist (!!!) whose father once owned an oil plant Zorin stole from her, fighting him in the courts which has taken practically everything but her mansion. Patrick Macnee has a nice part as a field operative, Sir Godfrey Tibbett, who goes undercover as Bond's chauffeur, both trying to figure out what Zorin plans to do. With locations in Paris and San Francisco primarily, Bond will wind up trying to halt a bomb set in a cave near the San Andreas Fault, hang from a rope dangling from Zorin's blimp, and battle Zorin on the Golden Gate Bridge. Patrick Bauchau's Scarpine is Zorin's right-hand man, as psychopathic as his boss is. When Zorin floods the cave where the workers had been setting the explosives, he and Scarpine machine gun them all who attempt to escape from out of harm's way! Hell, Walken's Zorin laughs while shooting them as pleas of help spray out across the entire cave! Jones makes a sacrifice when Zorin betrays her, Bond gets plenty of action (not just from Walken's cronies, but with the girls, Roberts, Fiona Fullerton (as the foxy Russian agent Pola Ivanova), and even Jones!), and the climax is quite the bonafide stunner (the Golden Gate Bridge, quite a place for the hero and villain to duel, don't you think?). There's plenty of plot centered around the horse track (Zorin's is an aficionado of horses, and his mentor and creator, a Nazi who was performing experiments on women to see if they could perfect a genius race, is using steroids on thoroughbreds) and stuntmen are put to good use as Moore's no spring chicken by this point. I didn't have the least bit of problem with Moore, here, as Never Say Never Again will attest to, an actor can remain in a part a little too long and strain credibility as a chick magnet, particularly when you see him in scenes next to the much younger Roberts. Roberts is eye candy, but her part is similar in acceptability as Denise Richards' role was in a later Pierce Brosnan Bond vehicle. Moore's chase of Jones through Paris in a car that takes a licking and keeps ticking with just two tires left and half a torso gone once he reaches her to a boat, unable to reach her is quite a stunt sequence.

That said, amongst the humour and incredible Morecambe and Wise rapport with Patrick Macnee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett, Moore gives some weight to his performance displaying genuine concern at times. Despite his age he's clearly putting every effort into his final Bond with tension filled scenes between him and Zorin. Oscar winner Christopher Walken gives a fitting cold and intimidating performance as Max Zorin. While arguably not the best Bond villain he is one of the more interesting, being a product of Nazi experimentation during World War II given extraordinarily intelligence but is also psychopathic. As a side note, should David Bowie had been cast the antagonist instead, who knows if it would have changed the dynamics or enjoyment the film. Grace Jones plays Zorin's sidekick/lover Mayday and is menacing at times with great screen presence. There are several scenes especially Zorin's meeting with his associates that echo Bonds gone-by which makes the film feel tired rather than paying homage. The supporting cast are all adequate and by this time aged Q and Moneypenny can't put a foot wrong.

Can this madman be stopped ?This is seventh and final of Moore's outings as the suave, supercool spy 007, and whilst in my view it's one of the weakest, it's still cracking good entertainment. It's got all the classic elements; car chases, sexy women, hair-raising fights, crazy gadgets and tons of spectacular scenes like the final showdown on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. The main reason it doesn't work so well for me is because the tone varies pretty wildly; the straight ahead spy stuff is great but there are too many comedy moments like the Keystone Kops chase on a fire engine, mixed with a horribly violent scene towards the end where Zorin gratuitously massacres a mine full of construction workers. The mine sequence features an incredible set and an astonishing flood sequence but is really tacky; it's interesting that the BBFC rated this film as a PG (as all Bond films are), but if somebody like Walter Hill or John Woo had put that in their movie it would be an instant 18/R. Moore is good but perhaps a little too old (he was fifty-seven) and mismatched against a great method actor like Walken. Jones is fun in a nutty sort of way but Roberts is a bit of a wet blanket. One of the comedy scenes that does work is the hot tub sequence with sexy Fullerton; it's a bit of a shame her part isn't more substantial. The story is completely potty (even by Bond standards), complete with drugged horses, a crazed Josef Mengele character, a villainess who switches sides ten minutes from the end and a central premise lifted from Superman. As ever with this series though, it is extremely handsomely produced, with superb art direction from Peter Lamont, stunning costumes by Emma Porteous and a thrilling score by John Barry with a huge romantic main theme. It's also worth noting that this was the last appearance of the charming Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny; she was in all fourteen of the official Bond films up to this one and brightened every one of them. Look fast also for a young Dolph Lundgren (Jones' boyfriend at the time, would you believe) as a heavy in the scene where the KGB chew out Zorin.

In this one, Zorin was by far the most evil and psychotic villain. And I think Mayday was very good as his henchman (or henchwoman in this case- anybody think she couldn't kick knick nack's but??). Just who was the henchman in for your eyes only, by the way? Sure this movie didn't deal with global destruction, but millions dying in California is nothing to sneeze at either. Nobody really was going to die in Goldfinger, he was just going to have a monopoly on gold, yet everyone seems to rave about that one.And the them song by Duran Duran simply kicks but. It's a different genre of theme song from say FYEO or TSWLM, but even so, overall, it really is the best theme song. I dare say it was the only one to hit #1 on the charts.Best Moore 007 films are 1) AVTAK 2) Octopussy 3) SPy who loved me....after that it really doesn't matter since the rest are all mediocre at best.

I couldn't even leave the TV because I was amazed how the scenes were properly coordinated (and the Beach Boys' music was suitable). Roger Moore DIDNT LOOK 58 here (and that's a slam to you, critics of the best Bond) because he was very good here, when basing on his age. If Connery starred here, it would have been a disaster like his NSNA and the picture would've flopped.Next comes the scenes in Zorin's ch√¢teau in Paris. Very nice. Very elegant. And speaking of Max Zorin, he is one of the best villains in the James Bond movies. The psychotic portrayal of his character is very good, thanks largely to Christopher Walken's performance. Grace Jones as Mayday is excellent, it's refreshing to have a female henchman in the lead. Only thing annoying here is the screams of Tanya Roberts, especially in the elevator fire.

It leads right into Duran Durans now classic title song that can still be heard on 80s radio stations today. Bond is paired up with ex-Avenger Patrick Macnee who lives it up as Tibbett. They infiltrate the mysterious industrialist Max Zorin's(played with zest by Oscar winner Christopher Walken) chantilly mansion to see why his chemically induced horses keep winning. Once their, Bond meets future Indiana Jones villain Jenny Flex(the gorgeous Allison Doody) and not to mention Zorins butt kicking accomplice MayDay(She-Woman Grace Jones).  Bond has his usual first meeting with the Bond girl, Stacey Sutton,(played by stunning Charlie's Angels Tanya Roberts) which in this case turns out for the worst, has a small bed fling with MayDay and Tibbett unfortunately gets washed out. Bond soon escapes and makes it back to the states where he does a little scuba diving into Zorins intake pipes where he meets up with KGB agent Pola Ivanova with whom he had a relationship with years before. Afterwards, Bond soon encounters Stacey and they soon ally with one another to bring Zorin and his San Francisco earthquake project down once and for all. The film climaxes on top of the world on the Golden Gate Bridge in which Bond finds himself up against Zorin and his henchman while rescuing Stacey in the process. Roger Moore soon retires at the end but not before cleaning up a few details with Roberts.The film was the first Bond film I saw way back in late 1985 on video at the age of 4. It has since been my favorite of the series. For its outlandish fantasy, escapism, farce, gadgets, sexiness, Moore's witty attitude, Roberts' brave portrayal of an innocent woman in a perilous situation, Walkens usual crazed performance, and above all a hero that audiences have grown to love all these years.The soundtrack which is quite hard to find is awesome! Duran Duran's title song provides the backbone while John Barry does his terrific score. The Best 007 soundtrack of them all!Roger Moore get his hats off to me as being the great James Bond next to Connery.Christopher Walken is totally suave and cool as the blonde villain with that snickering sneer and relaxed motive of taking over the world in high style. His one liners are great Intuitive improvisation is the secret of genius.Tanya Roberts has always been my favorite Angel and biggest crush as far back as I can remember. She's a resourceful Bond girl with personal vengeance of her own.The film I believe is part of 80s pop culture along with Back to the Future, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Empire Strikes Back, Ghostbusters, Rocky IV, and The Karate Kid.A View to a Kill ranks in my Top 20 as #13**** out of **** "},{"Title":"Roger's last outing","Date":"29 January 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I remember reading a couple of poor reviews and hearing some negative feedback from friends prior to seeing this.

The Duran Duran song is good and typically stylish. In fact this film is quite an achievement in the sense that Roger Moore as James Bond is the oldest he has ever been and he still carries it off with aplomb.Christopher Walken is the main reason to watch the film -- he has two quite brilliant moments which invigorate the film. The first is his suppressed hysteria when he discovers who James St John Smythe really is and when he dispatches Stacey Sutton's boss in the most chillingly detached way.

Nobody had any idea that 'A view to a kill' would turn out to be his last film as British agent James Bond. After this film, Timothy Dalton was chosen to represent James Bond on the big screen. This is something which his loyal fans and other admirers of this series must bear in mind while watching this Bond flick where American actor Christopher Walken appears as a highly dangerous, psychopathic villain with a smile on his face who set his mind on destroying America's Silicon valley. Actor Roger Moore doesn't disappoint a bit as James Bond continues to move from one place to another in order to gather valuable information about the villain's nefarious plans. However, it is through sudden twists and turns of events that Bond achieves final victory over the villain. There are times when even a villain can also be more popular than a hero. This is depicted in Christopher Walken's performance as Zorin, a shrewd businessman with stakes in an expensive stable. Actor Christopher Walken dominates this film to a huge extent. It is his arrogance which brings his downfall. When this film was being made, there was absolutely no link between horses and a silicon valley as 1985 was too early a period to speak about the destruction of 'Silicon Valley'. However, the inventiveness of the script ensured that even such an idea was practical. This is one of the film's key strengths.

Everything we need from a Bond epic can be found here. Many people find it difficult to overlook Roger's age with this one but, for me, I find it more difficult to overlook his orange hair when he is driving the taxi through Paris. His age didn't bother me one jot. The orange hair was my only gripe with this movie. All the usual suspects are here lunatic with a domination scheme (a glorious Christopher Walken), the frightening henchwoman (a glaring Grace Jones) and the requisite dippy yet well endowed good girl (a gigantic Tanya Roberts). Added in to the mix this time we get a toe tappingly electronic theme tune by those cheeky middle class scalawags, Duran Duran ( all makeup and massive lips, you must remember them). You must. Anyhow, John Barry delivers a superb score ( something sadly missing from today's Bond efforts) which enhances the action nicely. If Mr. Barry wasn't dead I would tell him how marvelous he is but he is dead so I can't. As usual with these Roger Moore classics we get a splendidly precarious finale - in this case, a tussle on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. You know, I really miss the days when Bond films were not afraid to entertain the audience with big set pieces and huge sets. Marvelous stuff. People complain about the silliness of the Roger Moore period yet in Goldfinger we see Sean Connery with a seagull on his head. So, I guess it's just a matter of who is wearing the seagull on his head that gives the silliness validity. If Sean is dressed up as a gorilla - that's fine. If it's Roger - that's awful. So, to conclude, a superior piece of lively cinema. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Great end for Roger Moore's Bond series","Date":"20 May 2011","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" A View to a Kill (1985) is director John Glen's third James Bond movie. The title is adapted from Ian Fleming's short story From a View to a Kill but has an original plot. It's the last film to star Roger Moore as James Bond. This is also the last Bond movie featuring Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, role she had played in all the Bond films since Dr. No.The British Secret Service discovers that someone has been manufacturing microchips that can withstand electromagnetic pulses to Russians. Bond is sent to investigate Max Zorin, the owner of Zorin Industries that most likely developed the chips. Bond follows Zorin to his estate in France pretending to be interested in horse races. Bond finds that Zorin has developed chips to help him win the races, but is discovered soon after. Zorin also has something far more sinister planned in San Francisco.Like Octopussy, A View to a Kill is a highly underrated Bond movie. The things people have problems is that the plot owns a lot to Goldfinger and that Roger Moore was too old to play the part. While I admit the plot does have many similarities to Goldfinger it still manages to be very 80's instead of 60's and not seem like a complete rip-off. The movie also has a great theme song by Duran Duran and John Barry's best score since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Moore definitely is showing his age here and it was obviously time for him to quit. Yet I have to say he still manages to carry the movie with the same charm as the previous films and his age isn't really that distracting as people complain. What I find amusing is how this is the only movie showing what a great cook Bond can be in a kitchen.The rest of the cast is an unusual mix of people. Tanya Roberts plays the good girl of the film, Stacey Sutton, and while she's not great she's okay enough to not to ruin the film. This is still the part of her career when she managed to keep her clothes on. The bad girl of the movie, May Day, is played by singer Grace Jones. Definitely an unexpected choice for the role but in all honesty, Jones does really well in the part and is more interesting than Roberts.The role of the main villain of the movie, Max Zorin, was first offered to such people as David Bowie and Sting. While Bowie would have been interesting to see as Bond villain, I can't complain that they ultimately got Christopher Walken, who had recently won an Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Walken always makes a good bad guy and out of all the Bond villains Zorin has to be the most psychotic. Just watching him laugh while he shoots people with a machine gun shows how crazy he is.A View to a Kill is not amongst the best Bond films made, but it's definitely above average and a fun movie to watch. There's a lots of action like Bond driving a fire engine through the streets of San Francisco and a climactic battle at the Golden Gate Bridge. This is a fine Bond movie and a proper way for Roger Moore to end his career as 007.

The stunt work in the ski chase is awesome; the Eiffel Tower chase and subsequent pursuit through Paris is electrifying and one of the best car chases in the series; The elevator escape and fire truck chase is well-shot and a lot of fun. The vertigo-inducing Golden Gate finale is thrilling; Tanya Roberts - though admittedly a terrible actress - is extremely beautiful and her Stacey Sutton is a refreshing Bond girl because she's intelligent, independent, and while she flashes some leg on a couple of occasions doesn't lounge around in skimpy clothing or serve as mere eye candy she's Bond's equal, an invaluable asset in foiling Zorin's plans. Zorin himself is suitably psychopathic as played by Christopher Walken, May Day is a memorable Bond girl and the two make fine villains. The score is beautiful (with Snow Job being my single favourite piece of music from the entire series despite the awful title) and the title song/sequence dramatic. The mine shaft set is worthy of Ken Adam at his best and its flooding makes for a spectacular set piece. There is no over-reliance on gadgets, something all Bond fans should applaud.As for the bad? May Day raping Bond is pretty embarrassing, although the sequence is brief. By Roge's own admission it's a little pathetic that all the henchmen he beats up are over fifty to make it look plausible. The steeplechase is too over-the-top and sits ill-at-ease with the generally realistic (by Bond standards) tone. Zorin's scheme is ripped off not only from Goldfinger but Superman - released a mere seven years previously - as well. But honestly I consider all these things very minor.Overall I love it. It's a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish, and if you approach it with an open mind and ignore the fact you're supposed to hate it you might just enjoy yourself too.

This movie has it all. It has the right bond, the right title, the right cast and the right script. Not that many Bond films get the soundtrack wrong and A View To A Kill certainly continues this trend with a cool 80's anthem. This may have been Rogers' last outing as Bond at a youthful age of 55 years old but in my opinion it was his most memorable appearance as the suave Secret Agent. (Notably because Roger appears to be drunk during most of the movie)The story is simple, maybe not for Bond though. Bond is sent to recover a microchip from a fellow Agent that was killed in action. It is then discovered the microchip belongs to an industrialist tyrant in the form of Max Zorrin (Christopher Walken). Zorrin intends to destroy the microchip supply at Silicone Valley and doesn't care how many people have to die for this objective to be completed. A madman is plotting to take control of the worlds microchip supplies so don't expect Bond to simply sit back and accept it. (That would be an interesting Bond film)Expect the usual mix of British wit, cars, gadgets and girls. A View To A Kill will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat. OK, that's the boring part of the review completed. This film is absolutely hilarious. The hilarity begins with Roger in a white ski suit and his golden brown tan. It continues with the classic background screen when Roger gets thrown off his Jet Ski. I'm sure that was the best equivalent of CGI back in the 80's. Roger wearing the classic brown sunglasses that also function as x-ray vision - only Roger could pull that off. The cr√®me de la cr√®me of the film, the funniest scene in Bond history has to be where Roger is chasing the mystery assassin from the Eiffel Tower and he jumps on top of a boat but falls right through the roof onto a cake. The dummy that is used in the scene nearly bends in half. Absolutely hilarious.If you don't find this film great considering all the other elements I described, just that one scene with the cake will make up for it. This film is brilliant.

Wilson from an Ian Fleming short story titles From a View to a Kill. It stars Roger Moore, Tanya Roberts, Christopher Walken, Patrick Macnee, Grace Jones and David Yip. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Alan Hume.Bond 14 and 007 is assigned to investigate millionaire industrialist and race horse owner Max Zorin, who MI6 suspect is selling critical microchip information to the Soviets.It was touch and go if Roger Moore would carry out his intention to quit the franchise, as it happened he slotted into the tux for one last time. A mistake, for although A View to a Kill is hardly the runt of the Bond litter, it's a very lazy Bond movie, one that desperately tries to hide its laziness with production values. On the plus side is that Bond here is mostly gadget free, meaning he has to use his wits and guile to either save himself and others or further his ends. But the overt humour is all over the tired script, a script that lifts from Goldfinger, thus making a mockery of the claims in some quarters that this is a fresh and imaginative Bond! it also includes one of the worst Bond girls of all time in Roberts' Stacey Sutton. Sexy without doubt, gorgeous too, but the character is nothing but a woman in peril excuse and Roberts' delivery of techno speak laughably lacks credibility.Elsewhere there are some fine performances. I'm very much in the camp that loves Walken's take on Zorin, looking like he has just stepped out of the Aryan Brotherhood, he is maniacal and callous, but Walken knows when to underplay the role and gives the clearly psychotic loon a degree of charm that underpins Zorin's edginess. Grace Jones is one of the more original Bond girls, a villainess who is highly sexual, strong of mind and a physical threat, Jones does fine work with the role, even if a sex scene with Bond is more funny than sexy. Macnee is a welcome addition, his byplay with Moore a highlight and there's a certain thrill to observing John Steed and James Bond together, even if it as two old stagers. Lois Maxwell makes her final appearance as Moneypenny, and thankfully for a change the makers giver her something to do as she goes out in the field. Fiona Fullerton slips in as KGB agent Pola Ivanova, and leaves a very good mark by paying the role with seductive charm and no little skill, really it would have made sense to have had Fullerton in the Stacey Sutton role. Other performances, though, are either weak (Yip, Willoughby Gray) or superfluous (Patrick Bauchau).Acton wise there is plenty, though not all of it works. An exciting pre-credits sequence is ruined by the crass introduction of a ski-surf escape backed by the Beach Boys singing California Girls, a half car chase in Paris is just stupid beyond belief, while a fire engine chase/escape in Frisco serves no purpose and is blighted by crude back projection. However, film is saved by Bond's participation in a steeplechase sequence, a breath taking leap from the Eiffel Tower (B.J. Worth the stunt man), underground flood peril with a murderous Zorin going bonkers and a quite excellent finale atop of the Golden Gate Bridge, resplendent with stricken airship and hand to hand combat. Hume brings vibrancy of colour at the lovely locations and Barry provides a strong score and oversees a belter of a title song by pop sensations Duran Duran. Worldwide box office cashed in $152 million, a big success but considerably down on Octopussy's take. As with all Bond films, it does have fans, but View to a Kill was fairly well assessed by the critics and Bond purists, it is tired and Moore, as game as he was, only aids the lazy feel of the film.Moore left the franchise, however, with head held well and truly high. He thought it an honour to play James Bond and during 7 films that garnered sustainable/huge box office takings, he brought his own unique entertaining brand to the much loved secret agent. It should not be forgotten that he had to take over from Connery, a task many predicted would be too much for him, and he often had to contend with silly scripts, but with The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only on his CV, Moore proved to be a very good Bond indeed. Now the producers once again found themselves at a crossroads with the franchise, a new actor was needed for Bond, and would they go in another direction for the new era? 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Arguably the worst 007 movie to date","Date":"20 July 2009","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" This is probably the worst James Bond movie to date.

While this one still has touches of the Cold War Theme, the plot actually holds up better over time than some of the other films. In fact, this film does very well with the location shots being scenic including the Eifel Tower & Golden Gate Bridge in the same film.Even though Flemming's material is long gone by this time the plot in this film actually holds together quite well. Actually, in a way the plot borrows on the plot of Goldfinger replacing Gold with sand. This does hold the film together quite well. The biggest problem with this film is Tanya Roberts, on my list the second worst Bond girl. Trouble is there is nothing good to balance her here & since her poor performance dominates the film, we are stuck with her here.(In case your wondering, the worst Bond Girl of the entire series is Lynn-Holly Johnson. In FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Lynn proved she can't act, & couldn't even be a believable skater even though in real life she is one. Carol Bouquet balances her off because she is one of the best Bond women ever, because without her, Lynn would have killed the series off for Moore sooner.) Christopher Walken is good as the heavy in this. Grace Jones does a good turn as Mayday also. Roberts is the reason this ended Roger Moore's reign as 007. Maybe this is a good thing, but I wish they could re-shoot it with another better actress (not Johnson) because this film is good. The scenery is good, and the rest of the cast brings this off well.

However, this A View to a Kill made me realize that a fantastic main villain isn't enough in order to guarantee a great James Bond flick. Christopher Walken also depicts a terrific Bond villain in this movie, but the film as a whole nevertheless remains one of weaker and least memorable entries in the entire franchise. The plot is largely uninteresting, the supportive cast is wooden and many of the traditional James Bond ingredients are missing, like a nice variety of Q's hi-tech gadgets and obligatory quotes. That being said, A View to a Kill still provides nearly two full hours of campy entertainment and a handful of impressively staged stunt sequences, including a grotesque chase on skis at the beginning, a crazy parachute pursuit through the crowded streets of Paris and a climax high on top of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Oh, and of course this particular film also features one of the catchiest and recognizable title songs, courtesy of Duran Duran. The plot deals with microchips-technology. The deranged industrialist Max Zorin implants chips in his racing horses in order to give them electrical impulses when reaching the finish line and win the races. But that is just the least disturbing part of his fiendish activities, as he also plots to neutralize California's Silicon Valley &#x96; the heart of American technology &#x96; through an immense flood caused by a self- inflicted mining disaster. The sub plot that I personally found the most fascinating sadly isn't elaborated properly, namely that Max Zorin himself is, in fact, the psychopathic result of controversial genetic experiments on pregnant women by a Nazi-scientist during World War II. It becomes quite clear in this film that the regular players are getting pathetically too old for their roles, not just Roger Moore as Bond but also Miss Moneypenny and even Q, and this has a noticeably negative impact on the chemistry between them and the supportive cast members. For instance, there isn't any plausible chemistry between James Bond and the four women that he sleeps with in A View to a Kill and most of the time he actually just resembles a sad old playboy. The most remarkable character, next to Max Zorin, is undoubtedly his eerie and super-flexible black female accomplice May Day, depicted by the natural born frightening Grace Jones. She's as evil and relentless as her master, although I personally really didn't like the plot- twist regarding her persona at the end of the movie.

This film is highly entertaining, despite other problems other people seem to have with it.I personally don't have too much of a problem with Roger Moore's age in this film (he was 57 in this), but it's easy to understand why others would be bothered by this, as Bond is generally imagined to be a man in his late thirties/early forties. I'm actually one of those people that imagine Bond in his late thirties/early forties, and Moore may have been pushing it, it doesn't really bother me. Stacey Sutton is an out of the norm Bond girl, she's far more of a damsel-in-distress, and while this is exactly what most people dislike about her, I think it's an interesting change of pace, though I'm glad they didn't overuse the damsel-in-distress character throughout the series, as it definitely would've gotten tiring.The always-entertaining Christopher Walken is of course great as villain Max Zorin (he would again play a villain named Max in Batman Returns), and there's a lot of good action throughout.

Moore was 58 and looking like someone in his Fifties doing all these action stunts. Tanya Roberts joins the exclusive club of women who've been Bondified by some 007. She's the owner of some mining properties which Walken ruthlessly acquires for his nefarious schemes. Also in this cast is Grace Jones who functions oddly enough like Richard Kiel as Jaws in two earlier Bond films. She's certainly as deadly as Kiel and she also finds out as Kiel did just how expendable she ultimately is.Walter Gotell as Russian spymaster General Gogol returns as well in this Bond film. Gotell always provides a note of levity in the Bond films, but never more so when he tells Robert Brown as M as to why he's happy that Walken gets foiled in his plot which we all know James Bond will do in the end.So as Roger Moore rode off in his Astin-Martin car into the sunset we can thank 007 and the rest of the gang at British Intelligence that San Jose, California is not now an underwater city.

It's no Mona Lisa and it's not meant to be. And to be honest, even the Mona Lisa is not the masterpiece it's made to be. -)OK, so there are serious considerations about the film. And it's not so much that Roger Moore looks old, but rather that he *acts* old. Gone is the exuberance and youthful spirit of previous Moore Bonds. Moore seems tired and unenthusiastic, as if going through the motions, as if he doesn't care anymore. He doesn't convince.Pace-wise, there's a serious flat spot early on and it lasts for a long time. It simply is boring from the moment Bond enters the Zorin residence trying to find out about any wrongdoings and about until Tanya Roberts enters the frame. It's not helped by the plot either ex KGB agent/ specimen turned microchip businessman trying to take over the market by blowing up Silicon Valley. It could be better, much better.What literally saves the film is the two stunning action sequences in the second half. First we got Moore and Roberts' narrow escape, leading to one of the best Bond car-chases ever. In a fire-truck of all vehicles! With Moore hanging from the extending ladder!!

While it will never enjoy a spot among my own personal Top Ten list, it's far from the least of the series and I've come to think of it as, while not great, certainly underrated.The biggest problem right out of the gate is Roger Moore's age. When he made this movie, which turned out to be his final of seven films as Bond, he was well over the hill at age 57. In between making the last film, OCTOPUSSY, and this one, Sir Roger supposedly had a face lift. As a result, he looks quite bizarre at times walking around in a sparkling white suit with his eyes often bugging about wide open in a virtual look of surprise as he goes undercover and announces himself with a beaming grin as James St. John Smythe!. But much to Moore's credit, once you get past that initial impression, his commitment to the role and his own patented brand of James Bond - charming, witty, and professional - helps you forget about his advancing years to the point where you don't even think of it. Just imagine it's like Bond on his last mission, prior to retirement.Christopher Walken, reportedly a big Bond fan himself, gets to play the villainous Max Zorin. Bond goes to Walken's private mansion to investigate a shady horse racing ring when he discovers that Zorin is hoarding a tremendous stockpile of microchips. Much similar to the plot of GOLDFINGER (where Goldfinger intended to take over the world's gold supply) here Zorin hopes to destroy California's Silicon Valley and thus become the sole supplier of the world's microchip market. Walken is an interesting nemesis for Bond, with a strange and ironic origin. His dangerous and athletic henchwoman May Day is played by the bizarre-looking Grace Jones, and as a strong woman with an uncomfortably androgynous manner about her, she makes for an unusual change of pace baddie.The Bond girl this time is played by former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts, and there isn't much to say about her after you get to admire her stunning beauty. She doesn't have much to do in the part of Stacey Sutton, who is more or less just your typical damsel in distress for much of the movie once she meets up with James Bond. Patrick Macnee (of The Avengers TV series) is a welcome addition to the lineup as a mock chauffeur to Bond, and it's a lot of fun seeing Macnee and Moore together with Roger having a chance to tease him in their scenes together.The other biggest problems with A VIEW TO A KILL, if you're successfully able to go along with Roger Moore being nearly 60, are some ridiculous comical scenes here and there. The first is during the pre-title segment where Bond is surfing in the snow to the soundtrack of the Beach Boys' California Girls (!). Another horror is a fire engine chase sequence late in the film where 007 is left hanging helplessly on the truck's swinging ladder while whining and crying out like someone from out of an old Keystone Kops comedy. But in the end, these are just eye-rolling moments in an otherwise interesting and presentable James Bond adventure. This is not a film to write home about, but it's more entertaining than it's typically given credit for, and before I go I should add that the theme song as sung by the '80s group Duran Duran is one of the best in the series. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"Roger Moore's best Bond film?","Date":"26 October 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I can understand why some people don't like this film, it's cheesy at times, like all Roger Moore/Bond films, but for me, this film is 100% fun/action from beginning to end.Christopher Walken is the best Bond villain of the Moore era, he's vicious, brutal, a true Bond nemesis.

Mind you, the Bond movies neither demonized the Soviets, nor did they romanticize the Russkies. The Soviets made mistakes, but they always managed to clean up after themselves. In Octopussy, the Soviets caught up with a renegade black market General Orlov (Steven Berkoff of Beverly Hills Cop) who tried to start a nuclear war and frame the Americans. In A View to a Kill, the Soviet catch up with Zorin who had been in cahoots with them in the microchip manufacturer business but the two fell out. Indeed, like all the Roger Moore Bond's after Live and Let Die, A View to a Kill takes place with in the context of the Cold War. Furthermore, while tensions exist between East and West, there is also an air of d√©tente that characterize these Bonds. Although it proved to be Roger Moore's last mission as James Bond and it didn't surpass the box office receipt of Octopussy, A View to a Kill contains more than enough virtues, such as the snow pursuit in Siberia, Bond's careening car chase through Paris, and Zorin's sadistic massacre of his own men in a secluded mine in California. Original 007 composer John Barry provides a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the Duran Duran title tune is a knock-out! The Richard Maibaum & Michael G. Wilson screenplay contains a some imaginative twists on the Bond formula, especially with regard to the sacrificial girl convention. Essentially, the sacrificial girl in most Bonds is either an agent working with Bond as in Thunderball or the villain's girl as in The Man with the Golden Gun. Oh, yes, let's not forget Plenty O'Toole who stumbles into bad girl Tiffany Case's house and dies because the villains catch her. The difference with A View to a Kill is that Mayday (Grace Jones) is not only Zorin's main squeeze but also a villainess herself. She has to die, but her death is heroic. Alan Hume's cinematography is good and John Glen never lets the pace flag in his third outing as a Bond helmer.Director John Glen, in his three outing as a Bond helmer, stages several interesting sequences. The fistfights are rather conventional, primarily those at Zorin's laboratories and in Stacy Sutton's home, but Zorin's plan for Operation Mainstrike against Silicon Valley takes place in a zeppelin, but we don't know that until one of Zorin's associates literally takes a walk into thin air for refuses to participate in his Silicon Valley scheme. The scene opens in a conference room as Zorin explains how Mainstrike will work and we don't know until the last second that they are hundreds of feet in the air. The fire truck chase with the SFPD in pursuit is reminiscent of Diamonds Are Forever and Live and Let Die. There's a robust disaster sequence when Zorin kills a San Francisco City Hall official and traps Stacy and Bond in an elevator while setting the building ablaze. Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts of TV's Charlie's Angels) qualifies as the most annoyingly hysterical heroine of the franchise. She screams convincingly throughout the blazing city hall predicament. As seemingly lightweight as A View to a Kill is you cannot overlook Sir Godfrey Tibbett's murder by Mayday and Zorin's decision to plunge a KGB agent into a shaft with a whirling propeller at the other end. Actually, we see him thrown into the shaft by Zorin's men and he dies in a gush of water. Occasionally, Bonds contain gruesome death scenes that&#x97;owing to their PG-ratings&#x97;are left to the imagination of the spectator. Of course, it isn't as grisly as the snow plow scene in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but violence does creep into every Bond.The scenes at Zorin's equine stables and the eccentric Frenchman's ch√¢teau is scenic. The idea that Zorin and his doctor pal are tampering with horse races is no doubt inspired by the characteristically decadent Ian Fleming villain who cannot help but cheat, even when he has more money that most people. Christopher Walken with his blond hair is ideally cast as the devious Zorin. Unfortunately, to be as nefarious as Zorin is, he lets 007 off the hook too easily. Bond's escape from the sinking car is slick but far from believable and the shift from the lake to San Francisco is the film's weakest link. Furthermore, Patrick Macnee's demise is glossed over too much. Patrick Bauchan plays Zorin's right-hand man and actress Alison Doody is one of his girls. Robert Brown plays M and Lois Maxwell plays Ms. Moneypenny for the last time. Bond regular Walter Gotell reprises his role as the sympathetic KGB chief, while future B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren has a moment as a KGB henchman at a race track when the Soviets upbraid Zorin. A View to a Kill isn't as bad as some might argue. It tops Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, but it isn't as great as The Spy Who Loved Me.

Of course, John Glenn simply over-directed this one and Tania Roberts despite being believable in earlier films like The Beastmaster, was unfortunate to have been cast as a dopey and irritating dazzling blonde.The film focuses on James Bond on his usual go-alone daring missions to undermine an evil plot and prevent Silicon Valley from going under water and a baddie played by Grace Jones somehow turns to the good side of the blanket to help a rather worn out James Bond in saving the Californian landmark and then the whole device explodes on herself.Although having some good levels of action, A View to a Kill was and is in fact one of the most underrated of all the Bond films.

Not necessarily because of Roger's age, as some Moore dissenters will continue to bemoan; (Moore looks in better shape at 58 than a younger Connery did in Never Say Never), but because AVTAK doesn't really 'feel' like a Bond movie. The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, the locations are sadly lacking... I'm sure Paris and San Francisco are wonderful places, but unfortunately remain ubiquitous and uninspiring locations for film-making, presenting little opportunity for innovative, original or aesthetically pleasing capers and stunts (with the single exception of the Eiffel Tower leap). Hence we have 2 rather pedestrian car chases and a scene with a burning building... wow. Where the film makers try to inject original elements; (eg a car chase in a fire-engine) the obvious restrictions of filming in such environments severely limit the opportunity for more exaggerated, exciting stunts. Where the film makers do have opportunities to inject more adrenalin inducing capers, they miss their chance... For example1) The Paris car chase could have been far more elaborate and could have easily continued on the river Seine. 2) Another potential car Chase is lost When Pola Ivanova attempts to seduce Bond for information. 3) A fight early in the film is totally lacklustre thanks to Bond's companion being the geriatric Patrick Macnee, and takes place in a very small and not overly convincing packing room. 4) Another fight which takes place in Stacey Sutton's house is again totally devoid of thrills, partially because the setting is devoid of anything to destroy and because a load of heavies simply 'run away' from Bond who is armed with a rock salt loaded shotgun ... (presumably Bond misplaced his Walther PPK whilst cooking quiche the previous evening). All in all, the film is full of missed opportunities and overall lacks the 'ball's and excitement one comes to expect from the franchise. The film isn't 'bad' by any means, it has a more down to earth approach, Christopher Walken's Zorin is about as good a Bond Villain as you could get, even Grace Jones polishes up well as a charismatic side-kick and the story is OK. Whatever you think of Roger Moore's tenure as 007, you can't deny that he at least brought fun to the role. Disappointlingly, AVTAK lacks the colour and vibrancy of Moore's previous outings and is a disappointing swan song to his 12 year reign.

I would love to have seen a fight scene between the physically underwhelming Moore and the primal Jones. Tanya Roberts, as geologist Stacy Sutton, is gorgeous - then she opens her mouth. She is one of the less enigmatic Bond women and she alternates between ineffective action and being cluelessly docile. Her madcap chase piloting a fire truck through San Francisco would have been more effective if the actress had any comic timing. However, her elaborate geological overview of Walken's dastardly plan, seriously explained to Bond late in the film does make for unintentional comedy.The plot is strangely cluttered until it finally settles on a typical plot to destroy Silicon Valley. The locations are, for the most part, exotic and the action is fast-paced. It is also nice to see ex-Avengers star Patrick Macnee in an all-too-brief role as a Bond compatriot.

That's not to say that I cannot understand why someone would dislike it.

Fifty seven. Yes he is too old to play the part. It is incredibly obvious in the wide shots that Moore is using an altogether unconvincing stunt double. But unbelievably it is a fun Bond film that never takes itself too seriously and will always have a laugh at its own expense.Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton is not the worst Bond girl to grace the franchise. Let us not forget the girls of Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun. Roberts does resort to screaming though in several scenes and you wish that Bond would just shut her up.Still many of the classic elements of the Bond franchise are still in play and used exceedingly well. Duran Duran's song is the catchiest and most outright enjoyable of the series. John Barry is on top form here, A View to a Kill is without a doubt his best work. The action pleases on regular occasions particularly a leap from the Eiffel Tower and the climactic battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge.

Moore was not Sean Connery, but with his seven films he left his own distinctive stamp on the role. The thirteen years of Roger Moore were less violent and more lighthearted than Connery's. Many people grew up with Roger Moore as their James Bond, and his fourth film, Moonraker, tallied the highest gross until GoldenEye in 1995. His likeness appears alongside Connery and Pierce Brosnan in the imagination of every true fan.In light of Moore's age and the declining quality of the films preceding, it is no surprise that this one of the two most unpopular Bond movies (Moonraker is the other). It is nonetheless a cavernous improvement over the serpentine catastrophe Octopussy, which is easily one of the very worst. There are some refreshing changes that set it apart from most of the Moore efforts.The opener takes place in the mountains of Siberia, with Bond the expert skier running from Russian patrols after finding 003's body. It contains the best snow action in the saga outside of the authoritative mountain chases in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It is also one of the eminent openers up to that point, trailing only the classics in Thunderball and the aforementioned OHMSS. Composer John Barry makes an odd decision by inserting a Beach Boys song for part of the chase, to the chagrin of many a Bond fan. The song is unnecessary since Barry's instrumental score is even better than is usual. The trombone heavy music during the movie's four big action parts is particularly good and the overall score is one of his best.The inimitable Christopher Walken plays Max Zorin, a phenomenally intelligent psychotic thanks to steroid testing on his mother. He plans to monopolize the microchip economy by wiping Silicon Valley from the face of the Earth.The movie dawdles in reaching that point. His lecture on the operation, called Project Main Strike, which sounds better than Grand Slam, does not come until 55 minutes have passed. That time is occupied by an investigation of Zorin's cheating in horse races. Although it has little relevance to the story, some of the most creative moments are in this section, such as Bond breathing underwater using air from a tire. In the climax, he hangs onto mooring rope of Zorin's blimp after the latter's scheme has failed. It could be argued that it would have been better to omit the horse racing and let Zorin escape then be tracked down later, but it would make the Golden Gate Bridge climax impossible.While Roger Moore has the role of James down to a science by now, his age finally catches up with him. His hair is receding, his eyes look older and his face is more wrinkled, but his heart is still there. He nevertheless does not look as old as Sean Connery did in the embarrassing Diamonds Are Forever. Grace Jones is effective as Zorin's sidekick May Day, but is all fluff. She does many feats of strength, but never has the grand confrontation the character deserves.Former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts plays geologist Stacey Sutton. Sutton is possibly the dumbest Bond girl of them all. Roberts cannot act if her freedom depended on it, although she sure can scream. Her main function is to plead Oh, James! over and over. A new height is achieved on the clueless scale when Sutton fails to recognize Zorin's blimp sneaking up on her.The highest praise is reserved for Walken. Walken is probably more popular today than he was then, and his Oscar-winning pedigree is not absent. His effort lifts Zorin beyond the page, and makes him the best villain of the Moore era. His cleverest moment is when Zorin walks into a man's office and explains his next moves in the past tense, then shoots the tenant. Zorin is his most chilling when he and a cohort use several uzi magazines to ruthlessly murder their own men, and he laughs during the butchery.The innuendo level is raised a few notches, but aside from that there are no problems big enough to sink it. The closest is when Bond and Sutton use a fire truck to escape police warden who exhibits all the intelligence of the absent J.W. Pepper.Although the negatives do not destroy the movie, it is not great without them. Although A View to a Kill does not earn a recommendation, Christopher Walken does, and it may be worth seeing for the few positives it has.Note This is also the last appearance of Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny.

He is as comfortable with the humorous parts of the story as he is with the serious segments. I had a smile on my face all of the time he was at Zorin's palace in France pretending to be an aristocrat interested in horses, with Patrick McNee ( most known for his role in the TV series The Avengers) as his reluctant( and hilarious) servant. Nobody but Roger could deliver lines such as  May I escort you to the chopper ( when he is chattering with Miss Sutton) and make them sound good.As for the serious parts, Bond really shows his aversion towards the villain, instead of smiling and making ingenious remarks. Zorin is to be taken seriously; the result of a genetic experiment by a Nazi doctor, he has grown up to be an extremely intelligent, but unbalanced computer tycoon. Driven by a lust for absolute power, he will stop at nothing to make his evil plans come true...even if they mean killing thousands of people. Christopher Walken delivers an outstanding performance. Zorin is cold-blooded and deathly calm for the most part, manipulating even his girlfriend Mayday, but his mental illness is hinted at in some scenes, such as the shoot-out inside the mine, when he laughs hysterically when killing the disarmed miners.A View to a Kill is also a magnificent action spectacle. The ski chase that opens the film is stunning, but the rest of the movie features equally impressive, well edited action sequences. The real highpoint of the film is the scene where Bond confronts Zorin on the top of the Golden Gate. Though the pace is sometimes slow and the entire KGB subplot simply doesn't make sense, I think the positives clearly overcome the negatives.Bond movies are not meant to be thrillers, they are just escapist entertainment. And in that sense, most of them are excellent.The main concern many people have with A View to a Kill is the fact that it bears a strong resemblance with Goldfinger. There is no denying that the two movies are in similar lines both are concerned with a leading industrialist who has masterminded a plan which will grant him enormous profit, while at the same time damaging an strategic economic activity( gold has been replaced by microchips this time). In both movies Bond discovers the villain's plan by coincidence. There is a blonde female lead here , too. But it has to be said that every Bond movie borrows heavily from the rest, and the basic structure, style of dialogue and characters have remained (basically) the same for 40 years. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's what Bond fans like me expect from every new Bond outing.Despite the sometimes slow pace, a dull Bond girl( why the heck was Tanya Roberts cast?) and the usual plot holes every Bond movie has, A View to a Kill is a recommended viewing for Bond fans.The perfect way to spend two hours in a Saturday afternoon "}{"Title":"I know I shouldn't, but I love it.","Date":"10 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  Roger Moore is too old, Tanya Roberts is too young for him, and Christopher Walken and Grace Jones make an odd pairing, but if this films is one thing it is very enjoyable.

As a Bond film it isn't a classic, and it sure as hell it ain't one of Moore's best. It will never compare to Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Licence to Kill, The World is not Enough, The Spy Who Loved Me or The Man with the Golden Gun, what it will do is provide the audience with two hours of solid fun. If there's is anything overtly wrong with the film it's the use of the Beach Boys when Bond is snow boarding (John Glen should hang his head in shame for that one). However when you have Moore, despite looking too old for the part here, being playful as usual, a great villain in the shape of Walken who is typically in psychotic mode here, a great theme tune from Duran Duran and a wonderful score from John Barry why should we complain. Bond films are meant to be about entertainment, anybody watching these films for dialog or plot needs their head examined. While it is fun to get Bond films that put the plot and characters center staged like Licence to Kill, For Your Eyes Only and The World is Not Enough, it is also great when we get fun pieces of entertainment like this. The film is eye and ear candy. Barry's music is so much fun it clearly goes well with the film and while Tanya Roberts sure as hell ain't a great actress, she is pleasant on the eye. All in all it is great fun and while I know there are many out there that really hate this film I don't. I love it, so there.

Both Walken and Jones are excellent as villains Zorin and Mayday. The action scenes are decent as well. The finale atop the Golden Gate Bridge is short but suspenseful. Moore also makes sure to get in a few good fights before hanging up the spurs. His trademark tongue-in-cheek humor also is present. The opening scene of the movie could have been better. It's basically that of The Spy Who Loved Me without the great mountain jump. Also, Tanya Roberts is a far-from-memorable Bond girl. She is too much the damsel-in-distress. Her whiny oh, James while City Hall is burning, is quite irritating. Nevertheless, this Bond episode is good fun.

Unfortunately, this was Moore's last interpretation of Bond.This movie is filled with great action scenes, wonderful locations, and beautiful women. In other words; it's a perfect bond-movie.Christopher Walken and Grace Jones (wow, I would really like to shake the hands of the casting people for that), are the bad guys who are determined to destroy Silicon valley, well to drown it actually. I don't really remember why, but it's obviously to increase the value of Walken's own company Zorin Industries. I don't think I have to give any spoilers about the result of this attempt.Walken does a very good performance, and it's a shame that such a talented actor still is only remembered for the part he did in deer hunter. Moore is also accompanied by the not so bright but really good looking Tanya Roberts(that 70s show), and it has never been more obvious that the girl exclusively is put in the story to look good next to 007.And, since I am from Sweden, I have to point out the appearance of Dolph Lundgren in one scene. If I am not mistaking, he was dating Grace Jones at the time.I have always liked Roger Moore as Bond. He gave the character a more amusing and charming personality. I would have to say it's a tie between him and Connery.Anyway, this film is a real delight to watch. Especially the fighting finale set at the top of the Golden Gate bridge. One of the most original ideas for a fighting scene ever. You can feel it in your stomach.If you are one of those (young) people who would like to catch up with the James Bond history, I would strongly suggest that you check out the Sean Connery movies first.

The casting of Tanya Roberts was a mistake as she never looked convincing when coming out with dialogue. The plus points however are the castings of Patrick MacNee and Christopher Walken. MacNee had some humourous moments, and Walken basically is the reason to watch this film. Walken is much younger in this film, and his performance as 'Max Zorin' is menacing throughout.

Moore seemed to be the James Bond that clowned around the most, and that should be said because A View to a Kill is without question the funniest James Bond movie to date. Parts of the film are downright hilarious. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous. But I enjoyed it anyway. It was appropriate for Moore to retire from the series after this one, because by the time this movie came out, he was getting too old to play Bond. Most people agreed with this, especially the critics. Nevertheless, Moore's send-off is a pretty good one. This time Bond faces off against Academy Award winner Christopher Walken who plays the out-of-control villain Max Zorin, and rock singer Grace Jones who plays the even more out-of-control villainess May Day. These villains is what makes this movie tick. Plus, they're funny. Tanya Roberts plays Stacey Sutton, the Bond girl who teams up with Bond and tries to help him save the day. Roberts is one of the weaker Bond girls, but she's not the worst (that honor still belongs to Britt Ekland's brainless Goodnight for The Man with the Golden Gun). As for the stunts and action scenes, they're first-rate as usual. Same goes for the locations which include San Francisco (mostly) and Paris (briefly). But the best thing about A View to a Kill is that it's so funny, and Roger Moore's humor obviously contributed to that. I remember one time when I was watching this with my best friend, and he constantly kept cracking jokes during several key scenes. Every time I've watched this movie since, I keep thinking of those jokes when those scenes turn up. It's great. A View to a Kill is a delightful action comedy that turned out to be a good finale for Roger Moore. It also marks the final appearance of Lois Maxwell as the original Miss Moneypenny (she was wonderful). Plus, it has (in my opinion) the best theme song written for a 007 picture (sung by Duran Duran).

With a punch and a kick this is one of Moore's most fighting like films and I appreciated the down to basics approach that the film makers took on here, He also does all sorts of other things which is why I felt that this film was strongly kind of OK, and here below is why.The story is not the most great and awesome story Bond has ever taken on but he conducts in a manner which suggests it is a much more serious thing than what it really is in the end. Set around many luxury estates and others such places, A View to a Kill travels to some nice places and for the story this wraps around well and although parts can be more boring and seem unnecessary, the story is nevertheless entertaining. I felt it took on a darker tone for the first real times and the villain actually seemed quite hell bent on completing his massive objective.Roger Moore goes out with a movie which won't enthral everyone and although I felt here that Moore fights hand to hand more than any other, he still seems just too old and unable to do stunts well enough. Christopher Walken as the villain is not too bad and as I said the darker tones lead to him becoming one of the first if not the first villain to have very evil traits let alone his world plans. Everyone else does there job but other than Walken no one truly stands out, Grace Jones and her slightly intimidating character leave a scary imprint on your mind, the character is played superbly sinister.John Glen did a good job here and is one the saving factors for me even though people heckle this move so much. Written not so great it is still fun and with some fun stunts and nice fight scenes it makes for probably the only movie that is dark yet very humorous. I especially loved the car scene in Paris which in well I won't ruin it but let's just say that Bond really knows how to drive a cut car and then also at the same time catch up to the people he is after.The film's main criticism usually is and rightly so is the fact that Roger Moore was 57 when he did this and was just way too old to portray this Bond he was showing. I also disliked the maybe parts of the film where you have Moore being humorous or light and the villain being overly dark as the two just don't mix and you could even say that for this one, the villain actually is overshadowing the performance of Roger Moore.Bond fans will possibly like this although I think it depends on when and who is Bond because this is as I say a mix of light heartedness with darkness and sometimes fails to blend. Those who like a good crime mystery may like it as Walken's villain is kind of hard to figure out at times and what comes next is never predicted and so a mystery thriller which a good one of that ensues here. Finally those who like Moore's comedy may be disappointed as he takes a more serious turn here although he isn't completely without joke.Overall I give this a 6/10 meaning it was Strongly OK-ish, I think although this is nowhere near being good let alone OK, the film is underrated and definitely not a Bad or Poor one. Just enjoy Moore in his swansong and wave goodbye to longest serving Bond, whether you like him or dislike him he still has brought Bond to the forefront over his 12 years and made some truly memorable moments.

I belong in the latter group, the film most definitely has it's number of flaws, clich√©s, and the like for sure but this is a far better film than Diamonds are Forever and Live and Let Die.A View to a Kill is far from perfect but it manages to be entertaining nonetheless. People's (valid) criticisms seem to go like this - Moore was far too old in the role at this point, the plot was basically a rehash of Goldfinger, Stacy Sutton is one of the worst Bond girls of all time, the Beach Boys song in the pre-title sequence and the overall tired feel by cast and crew alike. While I wouldn't necessarily defend these criticisms, the film has it's good points like any Bond film. Firstly, we get a perfectly cast villain in Christopher Walken and is an awesome villain. Secondly, Barry's score is great as always when he's on board and the title song by Duran Duran is simply one of the best Bond songs of all time.Tanya Roberts is horribly miscast as the Bond girl here. She serves no real purpose in the film other than eye candy, and she brings more attention to just how old Roger Moore looked in the film and gave their relationship a very creepy side to it as she was young enough to be Moore's daughter. It just makes it harder for us to believe that younger women would fall for a man of Roger Moore's age and someone like Maud Adams would have been believable but with someone around Tanya Roberts' age, it just doesn't work.Story-wise, the film could and should have been better. By 1985, were Maibaum and Wilson really out of ideas where they *had* to recycle the plot from Goldfinger? A View to a Kill recycles many scenes from that film one way or the other. Firstly, Bond sees the villain initially when said-villain is involved in a cheating scam. While Goldfinger was cheating at a rather mundane game of cards, Zorin is introduced with a horse racing scam. Secondly, we have a similar sequence to when Goldfinger outlines his plans to the group of hoods which he ends up gassing them immediately afterwards. In A View to a Kill, Zorin outlines his plan to a group of businessmen on an airship and disposes of the lone dissenter (the Solo of this film) down some retracting steps into the cold waters of San Francisco Bay below.Despite all of this, the film manages to be entertaining throughout. However, with a much better script and with Dalton in the role, the film would rank higher in the subconscious of the public and fans alike.

Dalton certainly dropped the torch when it was handed to him, although the series recovered with Pierce. Bond is a distinguished British gentleman of high culture, he was never intended to be a brash young action hero. You can't find the kind of class Moore has in young upstarts, it takes time to attain it. I think Moore did a great job, although the story wasn't as strong as some of the other Moore films.For one thing, there was a lack of exotic locations, always a huge part of the Bond mystique. And I never understood why Grace Jones had a moment of fame in the '80s (what was her talent, exactly?). But the incomparable Christopher Walken was devilish and unrepentant as a Nazi-bred villain and some of the other staples of the Bond series were there in fine form. Tanya Roberts was utterly lacking in depth and lacked the smoldering, mysterious sex appeal a Bond girl should have, but she was certainly beautiful. In the end, Moore delivered the goods, which is why I still treasure the film. And the '80s modernism thing is captured 100% by Duran Duran's great theme song, one of the very best Bond themes ever and a huge pop hit for the band, which was at its peak around this time. It must be a great honor for British citizens to be asked to perform a Bond theme! Well anyone, but especially for Brits.

But Roger Moore isn't the only one who's planning on leaving the James Bond-series.  In A view to a kill Lois Maxwell is going to play her character Miss Moneypenny one last time.  She's the only one who's been in every single Bond-film since the very first episode Dr. No of 1962.  And therefore it's kind of sad to watch her leave.A view to a kill is often accused of being a Goldfinger re-hash, but this is just plain stupid.  There are hardly any similarities and this film is simply no match for the 1964-classic.The best thing about A view to a kill is Christopher Walken's fantastic performance as the villain Max Zorin.  One may notice that he's the first and only Oscar-winning actor ever to appear in the James Bond-series.  He's so good that you may eventually begin to root for him.  Roger Moore as 007 is good, but that's mainly because of his experience during the years.  Nine times out of ten, James Bond-films also have more than just one baddie and this time it's no different.  There's always a master-villain; usually a normal guy who's trying to carry out a flawed plan to destroy or take over the world.  And this person is more often than not backed up by an enjoyable yet almost unbreakable henchman - or should I say henchwoman.  Because throughout the many Bond-films, we've seen all kinds of imaginative baddies.  And in this film here, we're treated with the athletic character May Day; a woman so masculine that she looks like a personification of a she-Hulk.  Nevertheless, her jump from the highest platform of the Eiffeltower is truly one of the most excellent action scenes of A view to a kill.There are one or two other action scenes worth mentioning, but they all take place in the first half of the film.  Thus, what started as a great action film became soon enough your average Bond-journey.  The whole mine-sequence seems irrelevant and the climax of the film is not as thrilling as it wants to be, and as a result of that a bit disappointing.

The chip is capable of withstanding an EMP and an exact copy of a top secret chip created by Zorin Industries. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) is presumed to be an anti-communist, but he and his henchwoman May Day (Grace Jones) are up to no good. His loyalty is questioned. He's juicing his race horses, and creating an earthquake to wipe out his Silicon Valley competition. And there is the pretty Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts).It's getting cheesy with Roger Moore. It's the end of an era and just as well. His schtick is getting old, and quite frankly so is Roger. The writing is lackluster, and the action lacks intensity. It's one of the poorer Bond effort. The character of Stacy Sutton should be more prominent in the first half. The problem with the story is that it starts with a fascinating subject like microchips, but most of the beginning has Bond running around investigating race horses. What does it matter that Zorin is cheating in horse races? It's just an excuse to advance the story, but the first half of the movie is wasted on it.Even the big firetruck chase has its problems. It's more comedy than thrilling. The actors have too many scenes in front of the projection screen while on the firetruck. It's fake, and it shows. Action scenes have moved on. A Bond movie should be better. And a blimp is no evil vehicle. It lacks the power, and is much too flimsy. It just adds to the movie's cheesiness.

This might be the very first Bond film I didn't really like before the Brosnan-era.The plot is far too outlandish and all over the place. While this is very common within the franchise ('A View to a Kill' looks like a documentary in comparison to, say, 'Moonraker'), this particular entry lacks the fantasy-esque quality the series always employed. It tries to be slightly 'gritty' yet keeps the silliness of an action-fantasy (for example, the car chase); this ends up only making it lose the flash and style that makes 007's films so fun to watch.Roger Moore looks far too old, and his Bond feels tired; not only are his stunts even less believable to the point of ridiculousness, but he lacks the wit and charm he was known for. But not all fault falls on him the girls are terrible in this one, with Grace Jones being an eyesore while Tanya Roberts is lacking in charm or acting competence.The movie has its moments, true. The opening ski scene, the later dirigible confront, and above all one of the best Bond villains in the form of Christopher Walken's Max Zorin (even in his better outings Moore would be hard-pressed to match him). But that is pretty much it.'A View to a Kill' is one of the weakest entries in the Bond franchise, and easily Moore's weakest.

Max Zorin is one of my favorite Bond villains, Christopher Walken is a great actor, and I think its nice that he contributed to this film series. May Day is said to be a good Bond girl but I really can't see why, in the film she's pretty much hate-able for me. The real Bond girl, Stacy Sutton is good but her age difference to Roger Moore/James Bond, is a lot. This Bond film is one I quite like. It has a very 80s theme and its opening title song proves it. Although, Roger Moore makes the 80s vibe feel more like the 70s. Timothy Dalton, my favorite Bond actor, should have acted in this film. Roger Moore even states, acting in this film is something he regrets. The final battle scene is enjoyable but later in the film when Bond/Roger Moore is kissing with Stacy its quite weird. Roger Moore should have stopped acting Bond in Octopussy which was a better film than this. A View To A Kill is a 007 film Roger Moore would wish to forget.

In this installment, we get a truly evil, classic Bond-style villain with Max Zorin (played by a wonderfully nefarious Christopher Walken - who looks exactly like Luscious Malfoy, by the way), with a truly evil, classic master plan.The movie starts with Bond on a mission in the Soviet Union where he narrowly escapes after recovering a microchip off the snow-bound body of another British agent. There is a great ski chase in the movie's opening scene as he's pursued by the Russians, but at one point, the song California Girls comes on for about a minute and then fades out just as suddenly. I'm going to go ahead and say that this must be the most out of place piece of music in any James Bond film ever made.It seems that the microchip that he recovered is a silicon integrated unit capable of triggering a magnetic pulse and blowing out everything that uses a similar chip, which would include anything from toasters to the most advanced computers. I didn't know toasters were computerized in the mid-1980s (are they now?), but needless to say, a nuclear explosion over England would short out the entire country, destroying their national defenses and rendering the entirety of their population completely toast-less. The British have a computer chip that is impervious to all magnetic pulse damage, and Bond's mission is to find out how the Soviets have managed to get a hold of an exact copy of one.An investigation of a suspicious horse-race gambling circuit leads to Max Zorin (also the maker of the original chip), who is suspected of selling the design to the Russians. But of course, starting a war between the British and the Russians is not nearly enough, Zorin plans to create an underground earthquake in California, sink the entire Silicon Valley and corner the market on all computer manufacturing!I think it's safe to say that the plot of this particular movie is years ahead of its time. If Zorin had succeeded in his plan, no one would have known that he had created the earthquake, and he would now be the most powerful man in the universe. His sidekick, May Day, is played by Jamaican actress Grace Jones, who is best known for doing scary roles like this one. I'm not sure what the deal was with her hair in this movie, but they definitely went overboard a few times. There is one point in the film where it looks like it was sculpted to look exactly like Batman's ears. Who comes up with this stuff?Nevertheless, she is one of the better female Bond villains (and a rare example of genuine character development and change), as is Walken's Max Zorin. In order to raise money for his take-over of the computer market, he has devised a scheme where he implants devices into race-horses that time injections of horse steroids, so that they aren't detected in pre-race blood tests. Pretty clever, but it's the design of that underground earthquake that really takes the cake. It's so good that it even provided the inspiration of an episode of Ducktales!There is some depth added to the characters of Zorin and May Day near the end of the film as well when it is revealed that Zorin is ex-KGB and, if it weren't for them, he and May Day would now be nothing but walking biological experiments. We never learn exactly what is meant by this, but it doesn't matter. There is a great chase through the streets of Sa Francisco and a thrilling finale atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Love it or hate it, this is definitely vintage Bond.Note A disclaimer at the beginning of the movie informs us that Neither the name Zorin nor any other name or character in this film is meant to portray a real company or actual person.

After all, it features a geriatric 007, a vapid heroine, a dull plot and it's full of lame attempts at humour. But perhaps because of this it ends up being absurdly entertaining &#150; it's certainly a million times more fun than dirge like Die Another Day, Diamonds Are Forever and Moonraker.The first hint that A View to a Kill is going to be a rather strange Bond film is in the opening ski chase. Not only do you have an old geezer performing outrageous snowbound acrobatics via poorly disguised stunt doubles, but The Beach Boys begins playing when Bond starts snowboarding. It has you shaking your head in disgust in how jokey everything has become, but then something even stranger happens &#150; Bond escapes the damn Commies by floating off in an aquatic, iceberg-shaped loveshack with a blonde bimbo stationed inside. Suddenly you can't help but grin &#150; the idea of an aged Roger Moore boning his way back to civilisation is just too wonderful to resist.Another glorious moment of insane weirdness is when Bond sleeps with May Day. Trying to cover the fact that he's been snooping around, he appears naked in her bed. And then in a bizarre attempt to look casually alluring he leans on his elbow and asks May Day where she's been. It's a pulling technique your dad might use &#150; if I get naked and horny, poontang is a cert. But of course, this being Bond, it works. And I love the way Moore rolls his eyes like May Day is sucking out his brains as she feasts on his dentures. Oh and there's a wonderful line of dialogue between Walken and Moore the following morning. You sleep well? A little restless, but I got off eventually. God bless you Roger Moore.And god bless Christopher Walken, too, for is there a more fun Bond villain than Max Zorin? Well, maybe there are a few that are more fun, but it's undeniable that Walken is a joy to watch. Just take the scene where he shoots and drowns hundreds of miners while cackling like Hank Scorpio on crack. This is how mental Bond villains should be. And I also love the kinky relationship he has with May Day. There's one scene where they're practising martial arts. It starts off serious, but then things take a turn for the pervy &#150; Zorin tries to kiss May Day, and she tries to resist, but pretty quickly they're gearing up to a do a sweaty, bi-racial, psychotic variation of the horizontal bone dance. It's a pet theory of mine, but I stand by it &#150; all the best Bond villains are sexual deviants.But although the villains in A View to a Kill are good value, its heroine Stacey is hopeless. All she does is get in trouble and scream James! in a very annoying breathless squawk of a voice. And she doesn't bring out the best in Bond either. There's even one scene where Bond cooks her quiche. Quiche! A man who kills and shags with reckless abandon cooks some empty-headed strumpet the most gay meal a man can cook. And then later he tucks her in for bed! What is this? Bond shouldn't be tucking her in for beddie-byes; he should be nailing her rotten.And to further exemplify what a rotten human being Stacey is, there's a scene where the bland blonde bimbo gets captured by the villains in the speedy and highly agile vehicle that is a large blimp. Seriously, what kind of person would get captured by a blimp? Someone who was deaf and blind perhaps. And even someone who was wheelchair bound. But anyone who can run left or right shouldn't get captured by one of the noisiest and slowest vehicles there is.But although the ridiculous Stacey gets him into it, the final Golden Gate bridge fight is good fun. I mean, how could you not enjoy it? It has an old man with Margaret Thatcher-style helmet hair and poorly disguised wrinkles fighting with a blonde mentalist. It's one of the oddest showdowns in cinema. But while the fight itself ends on a high with Walken cackling like a madman as he takes the plunge, it descends into head-shaking banality as Stacey screams James! and Zorin's mad scientist 'father' shouts Max! Seriously, half of the dialogue must consist of the characters shouting each other's names.But while I'm talking about the Golden Gate bridge fight, I feel obliged to point out that Zorin's blimp is disguised as a Portakabin. How brilliant is that? The villain's getaway vehicle disguises itself as the depressing spectre of a million building sites.Another subject for mirth for me was a fight in Stacey's house between Bond and a bunch of Zorin's heavies. All it really consists of is unspectacular punches and kicks, but in every other shot you can see Moore's stunt doubles &#150; some of whom look nothing like him. The best example is in a shot where all Bond has to do is punch someone and protect a vase &#150; I swear the stunt double has a 'tache.Yet another example of amusing stunt work is in the poor Paris car chase. All the long shots feature stunt doubles who look nothing like our glorious Rog. And all of them have to wear Shredded Wheat hairpieces.But then again, Moore's Bond has always been less about the action and more about the pussy. That and raised eyebrows. Just watch the fire engine chase for the best raised eyebrow in cinematic history. It's so good I can finally understand why blond tarts aplenty drop their knickers when a geriatric Bond comes-a-calling.

However, by the time Moore got to View To A Kill, he was definitely looking like a tired old warhorse. He was approximately 175-years-old during the filming of AVTAK and it shows. Moore is quite happy to let his stunt double do the hard work while he occasionally performs in front of rear projection at Pinewood. Even his hot young sidekick Patrick Macnee celebrated his 200th birthday on set and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny was well into her second century. Despite a combined cast age that could could reach back to the dawn on mankind there's enough fun in this installment to balance it out, thankfully.Christopher Walken stars as Max Zorin (a role originally intended for David Bowie), a purebred Nazi baby all grown up into a psychotic capitalist madman. He plans on destroying the key geological lock underneath the San Andreas Fault, resulting in a massive flood that will drown Silicon Valley, thus allowing him to corner the chip market.Throughout the course of the story, Bond involves himself in a number of set pieces and makes the odd joke or two. There's a neat scene of a Ruskie being chucked into a big fan, a memorable firetruck chase and the showdown on Golden Gate Bridge that feels like a natural climax instead of having the landmark shoved in for some 9/11 porn like so many other movies these days. It has very little to do with Ian Fleming's story, retaining the French setting before shifting to California, where it almost becomes a completely different movie.All the Bond clich√©s are here - the practically meaningless title, the encounter with the bad guy before there are any hard feelings, the bad girl who is either tamed or a double-crosser, the shy girl who is driven wild by Bond's double entendres, though the gadgets are played-down for the most part.If you're a fan of the contemporary Bonds, it might feel a little jarring going from overrated Daniel Craig bedding the ladies, to a leathery octogenarian Moore, bedding shrieking androgynous Amazonian Grace Jones for no apparent reason. That scene has always been rather uneasy on the eye, but I can see the appeal in her.John Glen is a veteran of the world according to Ian Fleming. Nowadays, every movie is directed by someone new in order to keep a fresh perspective, but they all look the same when there are no explosions, or car chases (such scenes are directed by second unit anyway). Glen keeps a balance between the plot and the action that is believable and frequently exciting. The Panavision photography looks amazing and has many simply gorgeous wide shots. John Barry's score is naturally brilliant, but I am undecided if this or Living Daylights in his best Bond work.This Moore's last hurrah before handing over to Timothy Dalton, and, despite the hate, it was a good movie to go out on.

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this turned out to be an okay James Bond film for the most part. Although I thought that Roger Moore performed in his usual competent manner, I have to admit that Christopher Walken essentially stole the show with an exceptional performance as the main villain. Likewise, having the beautiful Tanya Roberts (as Stacey Sutton) grace the screen certainly didn't hurt either. On the other hand, I felt that the performance of Grace Jones was slightly uneven and that the movie itself seemed to drag a bit here and there.

The eighties were not a particularly good time for the Bond franchise - most of the Bonders were subpar, dominated by an aging Roger Moore and the later new guy Tim Dalton, who lacked a certain charisma. At the center of this mediocrity was this last Moore Bonder, a last gasp and formulaic to a fault. Only after seeing this again recently did I realize how derivative the teaser was, for example - a blatant copy of the ski sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me - it's one of the more exciting sequences of this film, but that's not saying much, especially as it throws in cutesy scenes and pop tunes, even as Bond takes over a deceased agent 003's mission in a rare somber moment. A lot of this is still entertaining, but in that 'shaking your head, eye rolling' reaction when watching schlock entertainment. The title song is by Duran Duran and, with its disco vibe, it seems outdated as of 20 years ago. If one had never seen a Bond film before this one, this one may seem original, but otherwise, the usual repartee between Bond, Moneypenny, M and Q, for example, seems very old, in more ways than one, virtually duplicating dialog from previous Bonders. Q's gadgets here are no more than a joke, unfortunately. This was a farewell, by the way, for actress Maxwell in the long-running Moneypenny role; appropriately, her final scene has her weeping.Bond's mission takes him to France in the 1st half and involves a lot of horse-racing scenes and getting to the bottom of a problematic microchip conspiracy (it's prescient that Bill Gates was just about to become famous around this time). There's a silly chase in Paris with Bond in a steadily-destroyed automobile and then another very silly one on horses on a rigged track. The 2nd half is in my old hometown of San Francisco, complete with a panoramic view of the Golden Gate near the climax. The main villain, Zorin, is a Bond-world version of Bill Gates, following the super-wealthy megalomaniac mold of Dr.No, Goldfinger, Stromberg and Drax. The actor Walken is well-suited for quirky psychos, but playing a larger-than-life Bond villain is a bit of a stretch for him; he's more at home as traditional gangsters or oddballs. His strange mad cackling was getting tiresome by the end, though he proves to be more intense than the older maniacs of past Bonders and his demise was oddly appropriate - we do look forward to it after he proves to be a genuine mass-murdering psychotic, not just a greedy creep. This film also continues the Soviet connection of the past couple of Bonders, as Zorin is revealed to be a renegade KGB agent (swept away by the opportunities of rampant capitalism, ah yes) and General Gogol was now becoming another regular like M & Q. There's one intriguing bit of nonsense involving Zorin's origins, related to the use of steroids in producing superior, yet crazed, children. But, this is just another sample of weird sci-fi concepts warping the series away from traditional spy stuff, like Moonraker did before.Curiously, Zorin's artificially-created superiority complex does somewhat explain his sad underestimation of Bond in a couple of scenes - rather than simply shooting him, as many diabolical geniuses fail to do, he leaves Bond to drown or burn; of course, Bond escapes (duh!). Of the other characters, May Day is also over-the-top, a super henchwoman who appears to be into the bad stuff out of love, but Grace Jones never develops beyond the fierce glare of a characterization (as a trivia note, Dolph Lundgren appears in a bit part where he stares at her with more than a passing interest - he and Jones became an item in real life). Former Charlie's Angel and Sheena actress Ms. Roberts is the latest Bond girl, complete with whiny voice and nearly non-existent acting ability. They also brought in another secret agent, former Avengers actor Macnee, to assist Bond; he brings a certain amount of class to his scenes, though some of it is played to comic effect, like much of the movie. His role in some scenes as a servant to Bond, however, is a highlight, producing genuine laughs. Zorin's overall mad plan is ludicrous, of course; I don't even know the scientific accuracy of the logistics, but - picture Bill Gates and many of his Microsoft employees, say, planning to drop the San Francisco peninsula into the sea and no one else except one CIA agent knows about it. Moore, in his late fifties here, looked a little better than he did in the previous one Octopussy, thanks to some, ah, personal tune-ups. But, enough was enough - Moore retired with this Bonder, and Bond would return as Dalton in The Living Daylights.

The Brosnan ones relied too much on high budgets, gadgetry (BMW's, etc.), and pure action/explosions.

What is perhaps most regrettable about the film is its attempt to not so finely balance camp elements (as with Bond knocking the hats of a couple of cowboys while clinging to the undercarriage of a fire truck ladder) with the more serious brevity of saving the world yet again. John Glen directs once more with his usual flair for the spectacular; and to be sure, during two of the film's action sequences (both the Eiffel Tower jumper stunt and the climactic Golden Gate Bridge battle of wills) he masterfully succeeds. And although not nearly as bad as critics ripped it apart to be in 1985, A View To A Kill does not live up to the very best of the Bond franchise.Bond is assigned to investigate the practices of Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), a leading industrialist who is using steroids to win horse races. Zorin's accomplices are a former practicing Nazi, Dr. Carl Mortner (Willoughby Gray) and, a devious woman of means and menace, MayDay (Grace Jones). What Bond discovers is that fixing races is only the tip of the iceberg. Zorin plans to flood Silicon Valley by generating a cataclysmic earthquake with the detonation of a nuclear device, thereby ensuring his own supremacy in the market share of microchip production. After finagling his way to a weekend retreat as an English lord interested in stud farming, Bond meets up with Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts), a geologist who has been paid off by Zorin. Robert's performance degenerates into shrill shrieking for help and rescue at every possible turn, and clueless moments of introspection that make her one of the most hapless of all Bond girls. In point of fact, she reminds me of Chrissy from Three's Company. As Zorin, Christopher Walken is a fairly strong villain. Perhaps then the best that can be said of A View To A Kill, is that, like Moonraker, it is a film that begs you not to take its plot or characters too seriously. On that score, then, A View To A Kill is one heck of a good thrill ride.The MGM/UA anamorphic widescreen DVD is fairly impressive. Though age related artifacts are present throughout the transfer, colors are fairly accurately balanced. Occasionally flesh tones can seem slightly more pink than one would like. Blacks are generally solid. Fine details are realized through most daytime sequences, but less so after dark. There are NO digital anomalies for an image that is generally smooth and easy on the eyes. The audio is 5.1 and, although dated, nevertheless packs a wallop. Extras include two very comprehensive documentaries, an audio commentary, some promotional junket materials and the film's original theatrical trailer.

A good score by John Barry helps as does some fairly solid set-pieces (Moore's Horse Escape, the City Hall fire etc...) but its no classic, primarily because the pace flags at times, Moore is looking a shade creaky and the tone occasionally strays into ill-advised panto - not least in the beach boys opening for which someone should be brutally punished.

Wilson, who'd rejuvenated 007 with grittier, more physical, less comedy-driven adventures (FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, OCTOPUSSY) rejected the formula in VIEW, opting instead for the overblown comic escapades of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and MOONRAKER. While this probably pleased Moore, who, at nearly 58, had always preferred comedy to action, it betrayed the good 'karma' that the recent Bonds had generated with fans.From the opening sequence, shot in Iceland and Switzerland, of Bond snowboarding to elude Russian ski troops, ultimately joining a comely lass in a motorized 'iceberg' getaway, the film feels artificial. As Moore pulls down the hood of his parka, his facial features are so stretched and mask-like that one suspects he'd had plastic surgery done between films, and the results had gone awry.The story, of genetically-'improved' madman, Max Zorin (a youthful, blond-haired Christopher Walken), with a plan to flood Silicon Valley, destroying America's 'hold' on the world's microchip technology, was already pass√© by 1985 (Japan had long since passed us), and seemed merely an excuse to bounce Bond around Paris, Ascot, and California for some flashy stunts, like a parachute leap off the Eiffel Tower, or a firetruck chase through San Francisco. Although Zorin and Bond 'size each other up', it is Zorin's mistress, May Day (Grace Jones), who appears the most formidable. The black singer/model, tall, muscular, and ferocious, is so intimidating that the aging Bond's bedding of her is patently unreal (looking fragile, Moore seems more likely for heart failure after a night with her than an orgasm!)As the film's 'sacrificial lamb', 63-year old Patrick Macnee (the legendary star of The Avengers TV series that also provided one of Bond's greatest leading ladies, Diana Rigg), is the most welcome ingredient of the film. A cousin of David Niven's, Macnee and Moore had been friends for years, and had done the TV-movie, Sherlock Holmes in New York together, in 1976 (with Moore as Holmes, and Macnee as Watson). As a trainer who suspects Zorin of using performance-enhancing substances on his horses, the 'old pros' are delightful together, in scenes often ad-libbed. Moore's reaction to his murder is both simple and profound, a rarity in this film.Then there is Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts, as Bond's love interest, geologist Stacey Sutton. Chosen by Albert Broccoli on the basis of her performance in THE BEASTMASTER (which should give you an indication that 'Shakespeare in the Park' ISN'T in her resume), the 29-year old actress is epically bad, breathlessly chanting Oh, James! and frowning and pouting to convey 'deep' emotion. Until Denise Richards' even more inept performance as 'Christmas Jones' in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Roberts would hold the title of Worst Bond Leading Lady. One almost wishes that Zorin and Bond, in their climactic fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, might have thrown HER off!In a bizarre twist, the worst Bond film would have one of the best theme songs, as Duran Duran's A View to a Kill would hit #1 on the U.S. pop charts.Despite the regret Eon Productions expressed, as Roger Moore announced this would DEFINITELY be his last Bond film, no one argued his decision, and no call would be made begging him to return again. James Bond needed a major overhaul, and a younger, tougher, more dynamic actor to pull it off...and there were, not one, but TWO candidates, waiting in the wings...

A chase up the Eiffel Tower,an escape from a burning elevator,a fire-engine chase,the climatic fight on the Golden Gate Bridge-good stuff,even if Moore's stunt double is obvious and some of the back projection is even more obvious. Some scenes are almost ruined by sudden tone changes though-the opening ski chase is very exciting until John Barry's score is replaced by the Beach Boys,an idiotic musical joke which just doesn't work. Patrick Macnee has a couple of brief scenes with Moore which are funny,but Tanya Roberts is a feeble heroine. Snooper is a particularly pointless and stupid gadget.This is only poor by Bond film standards which are high anyway and it's not quite the worst.

The actor added a degree of sophication and humour to the role and therefore the end of his tenure is marked with poignancy.  This film is thoroughly entertaining but it fails to adhere to the Bond formula in the sense that the San Francisco setting cannot be described as glamorous.  This attenuates the movie somewhat.Roger Moore puts in another consummate performance as Bond and his age does not exacerbate his portrayal of 007, which makes me wonder why he wanted to quit the role.  Those who vituperate Moore over his age should remember that the actor was 45 when he made his first appearance as Bond.  Indeed, Moore is older than Connery.  There are many high points in this film including a chase up the Eiffel Tower and through the streets of Paris and a tussle between Bond and Zorin mano y mano on the Golden Gate Bridge.The title sequence and song are impressive but the opening sequence could have been better. Mayday and Zorin are two of the best characters in the movie, although the latter is overly psychotic for my liking.  Grace Jones has a penchant for strangling people and this gives the film a violent edge.  Watch out for a piece of comical dialogue between Bond and Tibbett, as the latter acts as 007s valet.  Bond takes great pleasure in belittling Tibbett, albeit falsely.If you are not a Bond fan, I would watch some of Moore's other entries before watching this one.

Although A View To A Kill is not one of his more glowing cinematic missions as James bond, the film closed the book on the Roger Moore era. Over the course of twelve years and seven films Moore had achieved what many people thought would be impossible replacing Sean Connery in the role and embellishing Bond with his own unique and equally successful interpretation. The film unfortunately features the worst bond girl ever to appear in the series. Admittedly, Tanya Roberts is a very sexy on screen appearance, but she does little apart from dangle precariously in lift shafts and from cliffs and bridges. A View to a kill is a good film despite the aforementioned criticisms. Christopher Walken, in my opinion remains one of the more memorable bond villains. Oscar winning Walken, has made a very good career of playing odd characters and he is very good in the role and wisely chooses to underplay the part of the merciless, but undeniably charming, villain. His best scene is the realization that he is about to plummet to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge. Walken allows Zorin a brief smile and giggle as though appreciating the fact that the joke is on him. May Day also makes a superb villain, although a rather unusual one. Sir Godfrey Tibbett is a wonderful character and he is played with great charm by Patrick Macnee. He and Roger Moore enjoy genuine onscreen chemistry and the scenes in which Bond takes delight in berating his &#145;servant' are particularly enjoyable. The film is certainly enjoyable, although parts being better that the whole. Despite its weaknesses, the film is a good watch, and I strongly recommend to the people who do not like to take a second look, it's a good film and deserve and higher credibility rating.PS.

The locations throughout are spectacular and the music score is, in my view, the most haunting and appropriate for a Bond movie. Not even David Arnold's attempts in Tommorow Never Dies and TWINE come close to it.Yes, Moore is looking a bit on the crumbly biscuit side hence why the levels of romance were kept to a minimum in this film, although that does say that JB can succeed without the sex element.  Christopher Walken is, as always, fantastic and he has to be considered one of the most evil villains in the world of 007, with his phsychotic behaviour. So, to those who haven't seen this - don't be deterred by the out-of-date technology and Roger Moore as this truly is a good film. Although it would never rank in my top ten films of all time, it is definately worthy of a seven.

The plot of this movie is pretty diverse from the rest of the Bond flicks, however there seems to be a trace of Goldfinger in the plot. The plot is about a billionaire technology company owner called Max Zorin. His plan revolves around Silicion Valley. He wishes to destroy it. The ending of this film is rather long and sometimes you wish for the movie to be over. Even know the ending is mostly action, you still want the movie to end. But for the rest of the movie, the action never dulls. I would know like to discuss the characters. Roger Moore in this film is obviously worn and tired and needs to quit the role of Bond. But if you ignore it, you can't even tell. Max Zorin played by Christopher Walken,is virtually the most crazy, somewhat violent, and insane villain of all time. In one scene of the movie he shot down his loyal works and laughed while doing it. The character of May Day was mysterious and strange. She was a great henchwoman to Zorin. Sir Geoffrey Tibbet is a rather humorous character. Unfortunately it all came to an end in one of the scenes. The Bond girl in this film, Stacey Sutton is proably the most annoying Bond girl in the series. She was rather useless. All she really did was scream JAMES! Help me! Helllllp, and stuff like that. The locations in this film were excellent. Paris, France and San Fransico were the 2 major locations. The most dreaded part in this film is in the teaser, when Bond uses one of the blades from the snow mobile that happens to land right next to him in one piece, as a snowboard. And.. they played Califorina Girls by the Beach Boys. I dread this part, and most people that I have discussed this scene with have agreed with me. The Beach Boy's should never of been present in this film. BTW the original song was never used. A different Band was used. It helped reduce the cost. There was alot of humor in this film. I found the Effiel Tower jump rather humorous for some reason. The quote Wow what a view! To A Kill was rather humorous to me.

Bond is sent in to investigate, but Zorin is quite a bright man because of his unique origin, but you will have to see the movie to find out. The music is good and there are plenty of entertaining actionscenes, but old Roger seems a lot more tired and worn out than in Octopussy two years before.

Most of what i had seen of Bond had been Roger's films so natrually, he was my favourite Bond and this was one of the best Bond films. However, over time (and by having seen the rest of the movies and learning a great deal about them) i have been put off by the lukewarm reviews given to A View To A Kill by critics and other fans. So, does Roger Moore go out with a bang in this film or is he put out by a fire extinguisher?.Roger Moore's age is probably his greatest disadvantage in A View To A Kill. You could say that this time he is somewhat laughable therefore as a British Secret Service agent but as the film goes on you tend to become used to Moore's overaged (only as 007 of course)looks.  His peformance?.  Well, it doesn't match up to the excellent one he gave in the previous film, Octopussy, but was that down to him or the script?.Although most tend to give a shake of the head to A View To A Kill, Christopher Walken and Grace Jones were definetly among it's best offerings as the splendid villans, Zorin and Mayday.  As fans as said, Zorin is arguably the most psychotic to date and Walken plays him with enormous menace and although Grace Jones may not be a particulary great actress, she does indeed have a strong presence as the mysterious, almost-silent, Mayday.It seems as though everyone dislikes the character of Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts). Poorly played by the model, she remains today as the least inspired or interesting of Bond's ladies but definetly the most annoying. JAMES!, JAMES!, HELP ME, JAMES!!!. And of course, there was Patrick Macnee.  This truly wonderful actor played the role of Bond's ally, Sir Godfrey Tibbet, with a large hunk of charm and shared superb chemistry from Roger Moore (possibly because they shared the screen together before in 1976 as Holmes, played by Moore, and Watson in 'Sherlock Holmes In New York').  Tibbet was sadly executed by Mayday but remains one of 007's best allies and gave Macnee another chance to show his superior skills as quitensential English gentleman like he had done in the unbeatable, TV classic, 'The Avengers'.Although i have just quickly gone over the main characters in A View To A Kill, i will give my honest opinion of Roger Moore's 007 swansong today. When you look at it as a movie, it's quite good and works welll, if not imaginatively, with the James Bond formula.  As a James Bond film, it isn't very original and not on the same level as entrys that were recently before it and followed it.  In a nutshell then?.  Worth a look.

The movie is a must-see for Bond fans who haven't caught it yet, but is probably incomprehensible and less than entertaining for those who don't appreciate the James Bond franchise.  After this movie, although The Living Daylights was allegedly written for him, it was clearly time for Moore to bow gracefully out of the role he took under inauspicious circumstances, and made his own through sheer persistence.

It certainly doesn't do much to distinguish itself from its counterparts and borrows a tad too much from Goldfinger (the villain's obsession with gold is replaced with microchips, which is obviously a harder obsession for the viewer to identify with), but it's slick and entertaining, and also functions as a fairly good send-off for Mr. Moore. A View to a Kill somehow manages to incorporate the campy, over-the-top elements that characterizes Moore's earlier entries in the series and still take itself seriously enough to still function fairly well as an exciting action-thriller, on the level of Moore's more straightforward works, like For Your Eyes Only.Of course, the fact that Christopher Walken delivers one of the first of his many, many delightful villainous performances helps take things up a notch. Walken's portrayal of the evil Zorin was heavily criticized by Bond fans when the film first came out, but as the years have gone by, it has earned more appreciation and respect as it helped establish Walken as the best psychopath in Hollywood. The scene in which he double-crosses his own workers by machine-gunning them all is classic Walken. Grace Jones also makes a memorable villainess as the muscular May Day, though the film is heavily weakened by Tanya Roberts' truly awful portrayal of the heroine, which puts her in the Hall of Shame ranks alongside Jill St. John (Diamonds Are Forever) and Britt Ekland (The Man With the Golden Gun)as the dumbest, most poorly acted bimbos of the Bond universe. Her standout moment is near the end when she excitedly rushes to embrace Bond, and somehow fails to notice that a giant blimp is sneaking up from behind to kidnap her.But, like all Bond films, it is the technical elements that determine whether it will succeed, and View to a Kill more than passes the test. John Barry's score here is one of his best, and even though you'd think that a Duran Duran title song would become quite dated today, their theme still remains one of the most exciting in the series. While there are some rather slow stretches in the story (especially a long, rather pointless stretch near the beginning where Bond is a guest Zorin's estate), View really delivers the goods with its action setpieces. The standouts are a spectacular opening ski sequence, a fun chase through Paris, and a wonderfully over-the-top finale in which Bond and Zorin have a fight to the death on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. However, the fire truck chase sequence that takes place two-thirds of the way through, involving a bunch of dumb cops who mistakenly think Bond is the bad guy, is more suited to a Smokey and the Bandit sequel and does as much to advance the plot as Sheriff Pepper's role in Live and Let Die. It seems to be in the movie for the express purpose of stretching it out to its 130-minute running length (this is from the period when all Bond films had to run EXACTLY that long). But all flaws asides, View to a Kill still functions as one of the better entries of the Moore era and is arguably the most unfairly criticized of all the Bonds. After all, we don't exactly WANT 007 to deliver anything earth-shattering, do we?

Moore can't be compared in that sense. But.. as James Bond, I really think Roger Moore is the better one. The larger part of Moore's movies are better than Connery's (not including masterpieces From Russia with Love and Goldfinger). Moore's worst is The Man with the Golden Gun and his bestis his last one... A View to a Kill.There we have another different opinion. Almost everybody think A View to a Kill is the worst Bondmovie.

I have since seen every Bond film at a cinema as well as many times on TV. When I walked out of the theater after seeing VTAK in 1985 I was very discouraged and was concerned this could have been the end of my favorite film series. Roger Moore looking good at 56-57 was still far too old to play Bond and it was very obvious that a double was doing most of the action. I also had never cared for Moore as Bond. His films bordered on spoofs rather than thrillers and he never convinced me he was a real womanizer. In VTAK this shortcoming was magnified with his age and made his romantic scenes all the More implausible. Not only was Moore too old but much of the cast looked like a bunch of old fogies Patrick McCnee, Jeffrey Keen, Walter Gottell, Lois Maxwell ETC. The film also seemed to be a jumbled mess of other Bond films rehashed as well as Superman. There were no elaborate sets or exotic locales and nothing memorable or exciting about any of the action. The pre credit sequence was quite good until the nonsense with the Beach Boy's music plays while Bond surfs across the snow and ice . The chopped car and fire truck chase were both embarrassing and represented the absolute low points for the entire series. There were a few positives - John Barry's score and Duran Duran's title song along with Binder's credits were excellent. I did like Christopher Walken and Grace Jones even though Walken was a little over the top he was a fun villain and better than most in Moore Bond's. Tanya Roberts knocked Barbara Bach off as the worst actress to play a Bond Girl however. I was sad Roger's last Bond outing was this bad.. Fortunately the Bond series did survive and the 4 films since are all much better.  With all this said somehow over the years this film has grown on me. It has become a guilty pleasure and already having established in my mind that it was a bad film I've found some new things about it I enjoy. The climax of the film with the flooding of the mine is quite spectacular and I'm amused by Zorin's execution of all his men. I also enjoy the fight on Golden Gate Bridge. Roger Moore even display's a rare very brief bit of acting when he is enraged by Zorin's execution of Tracy's old boss. The scene with Bond breathing underwater via a tire stem reminds me of the type of resolve Bond exhibited more in the novels than on film which gave a little credibility to his predicament rather than the usual handy gadget saving his life. So now that time has passed I still regard this as one of the worst James Bond films and yet I still find it entertaining and fun more so than when I originally saw it.

So this movie seemed more like a fantasy movie for 60 year olds and above than a movie that teens or people in there 20's or even 30's would think of as a cool watch. Plus Roger Moore clearly did eye lifts that made him look creepy. Men who are still womanizers in there 60's just isn't a good look for a guy. So it takes away the charm and suave of the Bond character. Sure, it's not Roger Moore's fault for aging, but they needed a new Bond.

Even the male characters Bond interacts with are either old or older than him to make Bond look more attractive from the bunch. Going as far as the make the villains a bunch of grandpas so Bond wouldn't have as much trouble taking them on. So it just came off a bit uncomfortable than sexy when he made his move on the Bond girls. As for the plot, it takes a bit of the plot from Goldfinger. Tanya Roberts as Stacey is one of the Bond girls with very glamorous eyes in the franchise so far. Christopher Walken is a good actor and could have been a great villain for Bond. But they dropped the ball on that one as well by giving him lame mannerisms and character. His motives weren't at least understandable and lacked the strong villainous presence that was needed to make this a memorable Bond film.

I'll go for a while without watching it and then, one day, I'll be mulling over which 007 movie I feel like revisiting. Inevitably, A VIEW TO A KILL will come to mind and I'll think back and remember how much cheesy fun it is. On the chance I settle on the movie, I'll watch it and, not even halfway through, discover I've been conned yet again. I can't bring myself to call it a horrible movie (though I might see how others could accuse it of such) because I'm a major 007 fan. I've got a bias and I still believe that the worst of the films are still better than most other garbage out there. I can always find something to love about the movies and that includes this one. So, if you're looking for an outsider's unbiased perspective on A VIEW TO A KILL, this probably isn't the place. Roger Moore's final outing as the legendary British secret agent tries to jump on, what was at the time, at modern adventure about the technology industry. It starts with an investigation into industry mogul Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and some potential funny business in the world of horse breeding. It's soon revealed that Zorin, a powerful man in the world of microchip production, has a plan to eliminate his competition by literally wiping Silicon Valley off the map.We'll ignore the fact that the destruction of Silicon Valley is the exact opposite of how Zorin would accomplish his goal and would, actually, ruin his business this way. Plot holes and poor research are expected often in these movies. So what are my problems with A VIEW TO A KILL? For starters, poor Roger Moore is just too old to be globe-trotting and fighting evil at this point. Just one look at the man tells you he is well past the point of successfully portraying this iconic character. I give him props for doing his best but, come on, his stunt doubles are the most blatant in this movie than in any other. It's almost distracting. Anything that isn't the most basic of movement for Moore is a stand-in. The film wastes no time in flaunting this with an opening sequence in Siberia where Bond must escape some Russians on skis. At no point is it believably Moore. And don't get me started on the use of the Beach Boys tune to the scene of Bond snowboarding to escape. It's just not right. Moving on, the film is just too long. Well, length isn't the problem. I've got no problem with a 007 movie being over two hours; my problem is that it feels it because there's so little going on to care about. The first act at Zorin's estate with the horse-breeding (which, keep in mind, has little to do with the big-picture plot of the film) lasts something like half the movie. So the movie is somewhere around half over when the microchip stuff and Silicon Valley stuff come into play. And then there's Tanya Roberts as the movie's Bond woman, Stacy Sutton. Roberts is only slightly more believable as a geologist than Denise Richards was as a nuclear physicist in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, and she spends most of her screen time screaming James! and failing to stay out of danger.So what worked? Well, Roger Moore has always been one of my top 007 actors because of the charm and humor he brings to the character. His body might be showing his age but his personality is intact and makes some of the cheesier dialogue a little easier to stomach. And then there's the fact that he's facing off in this movie against Christopher Walken. Let me repeat that Christopher Walken. In a 007 movie. That's awesome enough. I do wish his character had been built up more. Zorin is really underdeveloped and his history is a little shady. Apparently he was genetically modified since birth by the KGB (in the same manner as his horses, I guess) and he's supposed to be a near-perfect human vastly intelligent and above-average physical prowess. He doesn't display it much here. I mean, his plan makes little sense and he's bested by an aged Roger Moore in physical combat. He just goes the route of the psychopath. That's his one real character trait. His main henchman and the film's femme fatale is Grace Jones as May Day. Really, if Zorin wanted to win, all he had to do was send May Day after 007. She's an imposing woman. Her character also gets the most character development (I know I'm using a lot of quotes here but I want to be clear I'm using a lot of these terms loosely) in the film. She's Zorin's most trusted associate and we find she views him as more than that, culminating in a proper send-off for her character in the final act. Let's see&#x85;I loved the use of San Francisco as a location. When I think of Bond, I think of exotic locations so the juxtaposition of putting him in 80's era California still entertains me. And I would be stupid not to mention the film's title song, performed by Duran Duran. I love this song and it rates as probably my favorite title song of the entire series. When I have the urge to watch this movie, I think it's just my brain trying to tell me I need to go listen to this track.Would I recommend A VIEW TO A KILL? To the average viewer, probably not. To a 007 fan, you've probably already seen it. The real question is can we bring Walken back for another new 007 movie or have we wasted our chance?

Zorin, as it turns out, intends to wipe out Silicone Valley by flooding it and only one man can stop him. Okay, so the set up is fairly standard. The pre-title sequence explains Bond's involvement and provides a pleasant piece of action set in Alaska (almost ruined by a stupid and notable unfunny bit of 'surfing', complete with a cheesy Beach Boys cue).Sadly, Roger Moore looks more like he should be waiting in line at the post office than facing off against bad guys. He's pushing 60 years old here, and it really shows. If you can get past that, there are some fantastic action sequences, including a nail-biting escape from a huge fire in San Franciso's City Hall, a tremendous fire engine chase and a fierce punch-up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.Patrick Macnee appears here for a bit of an in-joke, playing Bond's undercover ally, and some amusing dialogue ensues between them. The Bond-girl is sadly forgettable, especially when you place her next to Grace Jones as a highly original henchman. The real winner here is Christopher Walken, who literally chews the film to pieces and has some of the best bad-guy lines ever. Intuitive improvisation is the secret of genius, he sniggers malevolently.The obligatory inclusion of Q proved a tad too much here, as he appears only to introduce his latest creation - a radio controlled cat, designed for surveillance, which serves no purpose in the movie other than to try and extract a cheap giggle from the audience.Alas, it's easy to forgive the few minor gripes as this movie is largely a winner.

I see no problem with Moore's age at all.Overall, this was a great, very entertaining and funny Bond film.7/10 "},{"Title":"Bond 14 Moore's to pity...","Date":"11 June 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Lame jokes aside, you know by the title (and most reviews) that this Bond film is - to be polite and give it the benefit of doubt - not very popular.Microchip guru Max Zorin (Crhistopher Walken) seems to be playing both sides of the cold war, as well as fixing horse races and planing a sinister plot against his rivals in Syllicone Valley. Bond investigates, disguised as a horse enthusiast (taming Grace Jones in the process to appear more credible). Double-crosses, assassination attempts and zeppelin madness quickly follow.View To a Kill starts off strong with a mostly competent ski/snowboard chase (undone by ridiculous use of a Beach Boys song) and an enjoyable theme song by Duran-Duran. It then proceeds with one of the most plodding plots in 007 history. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the end of the Moore bond era. Unconvincing in fight scenes, Moore is actually at his worse with ladies, at a used up 59 years old. The cruelest jibe was given by Empire reviewers, who deemed that he had aged so horribly that he could check himself in as his own luggage. Not quite the suave secret agent we all hope for, is it? The only way to make matters worse was to pair him with Patrick McNee, which the film-makers did! The rest is barely worth mentioning. John Barry's rousing score and Grace Jones's wild fury aside, this film has little to offer, beyond the ability to waste Christopher Walken.The king is dead (in agony). Long live Timothy Dalton!

Perhaps they learned from this one to make the infinitely superior follow-up 'Octopussy'.Grace Jones is one of the sharpest evil henchwomen in the whole of the Eon collection. Unfortunately Tanya Roberts is one of the blandest of all the Bond girls. It's not entirely the actresses fault, either. Her part is written bland and helpless.There's an unfortunate tendency to go for broad comedy rather than sly wit. It's one thing having Sean Connery slip the corpse of a woman into a chair and say that she's 'just dead', quite another to hang Roger Moore from the ladder of a speeding fire truck, like something out of a Harold Lloyd movie. The sequence in the opening scenes where Bond snowboards to the tune of 'California Girls' is pitiful.And why on earth, when Bond escapes in a submarine camouflaged as an iceberg at the end of the same pre-title sequence, does it have to be such a dirty grey. I know it's a convention for bad guys to be stupid in action movies, but the dimmest Russian soldier would notice a suspiciously dark iceberg speeding into the sunset.

There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how A VIEW TO A KILL rates on a scale of 1 to 10 Title A VIEW TO A KILL; Probably -- no, definitely -- the worse title for a Bond movie. Oddly poetic, I suppose, but also vaguely meaningless. 3 points. Pre-credits teaser Another ski chase across a snowy landscape, another exploding helicopter and another disguised submarine tiresomely unoriginal, but acceptable. But pumping up The Beach Boys on the soundtrack as Bond snowboards down the mountain is just plain desperation. The Tarzan yell in OCTOPUSSY was enough to make you roll your eyes, but this just makes you cringe. 3 points.Opening credits Poor Maurice Binder is obviously running out of inspiration. Really, naked skiers and neon pistols that shoot lasers (or are they squirt guns shooting paint?). Gaudy and just plain ugly, the use of black light and infrared colors was bad enough in Wham! videos, but are beneath the dignity of a Bond film. 1 point.Theme song Recorded by Duran Duran during their brief moment as pop stars, the song can generously be described as nonsensical. The music itself is catchy enough, I suppose, but the lyrics about dancing into the fire has nothing to do with Binder's ice and snow motif and even less to do with the impending earthquake of the actual story. Maybe it is in reference to the coming fire engine chase. Lines like To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain / A chance to find a phoenix for the flame Not good, not good at all. 2 points.Bond, James Bond It is Roger Moore's swansong as Bond and he does nothing to disgrace himself. Though he does look a bit ill at ease in the love scene with Grace Jones -- but who wouldn't? And let's face it, that is obviously not Moore doing those stunts. Still, he deserves 7 points just for plugging along like a good soldier.Bond Babes For sheer contrast it is hard to beat Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones as costars. Roberts' Stacey Sutton is certainly whiny and more than a bit annoying. Yet she isn't an agent, but a civilian who gets sucked into the convoluted adventure and provides a few laughs as the comic relief. But with her squeaky clean sexiness she is certainly overshadowed by Jones' May Day, whose exotic appearance alone is a major asset/distraction. Strangely frightening as both a love interest and a villainess, she almost blows it all with one line of dialogue (He said he loved me!). But she is undeniably unforgettable. And let's toss in an extra point for Fiona Fullerton's hot tub cameo as an easily seduced Russia agent. 9 points.Bond Villain As many creepy, wacky, weirdo, psycho nutcases as he has played, you'd think Christopher Walken would be a natural as a Bond villain. Alas, that is not the case; as Max Zorin, he seems vaguely uninterested in even being in the movie. Perhaps playing a maniacal, mass-murderer just didn't offer him much of a challenge. Rates 6 points simply because he seems to get off on firing a machine gun at innocent people.Bond Baddies With Jones doing double duty as a love interest and a femme fatale, Patrick Bauchau and Willoughby Gray hardly make an impression as Zorin's underlings. 4 points.Sinister Plot Walken's Zorin is supposedly a criminal mastermind, though his most daring crime it seems is ripping off the sinister plot from SUPERMAN THE MOVIE. Like Lex Luthor before him, Zorin hopes to set off a series of earthquakes designed to sink large portions of California, allowing him to cash in on the aftermath. Evil, undoubtedly; but far-fetched even for Bond's universe. Still, it seems to be a dependable plot. (Note to the Bond producers Get Gene Hackman to play your next evil archenemy. He knows how to do it well.) 7 points. Production values Just when you are all set to give up on the movie as being a major disappointment, they trot out a couple of Bond's all time best action sequences a fire engine chase through San Francisco and an ending with a shootout involving a blimp on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. Cool, and outrageously improbable. 9 points.Bonus Points The Bond people slapped around Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman in GOLDFINGER), assassinated Emma Peel (Diana Rigg in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) and now, as if to complete their vendetta against The Avengers, they knock off John Steed. Kudos to the producers for bringing on board the wonderful Patrick Macnee as Bond's latest doomed sidekick, but raspberries to them for both killing him and doing it in such a inglorious manner. Minus 5 points.Summary There is a certain irony to the title, as watching A VIEW TO A KILL isn't so much like watching a death as the end of an era. Moore bows out of the series with grace; and though he has been criticized heavily for giving the Bond films a more comical slant, it is easy to look back at his bemused approach to the character with a certain affection. At least Moore would risk showing some sort of emotion beyond grim determination, which can't be said for his successors. It is however sad that with the lackluster A VIEW TO A KILL he exits the role with more of a whimper than a bang.Bond-o-meter Rating 46 points out of 100.

However, Moore still does a good job, and it is a good film with some fantastic performances, and the usual good mix of stunts, action and humour. In other words, it's a good old-fashioned Bond film. Though clearly a product of the eighties, it is not bogged down too much by the era's annoyances. The theme tune by Duran Duran is one of the best, the cars and gadgets are cool, and the hair and clothes aren't too bad.Bond is chasing the wonderfully evil Max Zorin, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken, who plans to destroy Silicon Valley. When i was younger I didn't think this was much of a diabolical scheme, but I didn't really know what Silicon Valley was. However, I knew that Zorin guy had to be stopped- letting people slide out of his Zeppelin to their deaths, and trapping people in tubes with giant spinning fans at the bottom- the guy is the devil. Zorin would become the world leader in computer chips if he destroyed the Valley, killing millions as he did it. Bond, with the 'help' of Stacey tries to stop Zorin and his crew, including the deadly Mayday, played perfectly by Grace Jones. Zorin's sinister actions lead to a number of deaths, including friend's of Bond's, and Bond eventually finds himself trying to detonate Zorin's bomb. Soon the two are fighting hundreds of feet in the air, and it looks like Bond may not win.Walken and Jones are what stand out here. They seem to be equally devoted to each other, and equally insane, although Zorin proves to have no remorse for his actions. He shows little grief at Mayday's downfall. He is clearly a sociopath and must be stopped. The fights are good, although Moore cannot really handle the stunts anymore, Roberts is quite annoying but that suits her character who doesn't do anything. It was time for someone else to take over, but this was a good conclusion to Moore's time as Bond.7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"One movie too many for Roger Moore","Date":"6 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  A View to a Kill (1985) - James Bond (Roger Moore) tangles with ruthless industrialist Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) with plans to blow up Silicon Valley.

The theme music is the best of all the bond films. People should give Duran Duran credit for the job they did. There is a chase through Paris that is also very cool to watch even though you can clearly see that it's a stuntman and not Sir Roger driving the car. The film doesn't pick up the action again until Bond goes to San Fransisco, where there is a firetruck chase, mine shaft explosions, and the finale on top of the golden gate bridge.This is a good farewell to the Roger Moore Bond, and this movie is certainly better the failed comedy Moonraker. Tanya Roberts sucks it up as a Bond girl, but she is so stupid that I tend to laugh at her when she starts whining. I think that young people can respect a film for being entertaining even if there acting is not great by one person. I think that most of the Connery Bonds are dated and not as fun to watch as the late 80's and 90's bond films. This film was the first film to be primarily made just for younger people, and thats why teenagers liked it more than those that grew up with Connery in the 60's and 70's. Face it, movies are commonly made for teenagers nowadays so maybe this movie started the trend.A View to a Kill is a good movie with a somewhat confusing plot that is like Goldfinger, but if you watch it a couple of times you should appreciate it.

Does it run a bit too long, even by Bond standards? Yes. Does Bond look silly sleeping with butch new-wave singer Grace Jones? Yes. Does Christopher Walken's hair illicit laughs? Of course. Are the Bond girls in 'A View To A Kill' some of the worst ever? Not as bad as the ones following it (minus 'Goldenye'), but yeah, they're pretty uninteresting. 'A View To A Kill' however, is one of the better Roger Moore films, and definitely the most underrated. Siskel & Ebert once called it (unfairly) the worst Bond film EVER. Not the atrocious 'Man With The Golden Gun' or the rather boring 'For Your Eyes Only' (totally OVER-rated), or the universally hated 'Living Daylights', or even Sean Connery's less than stellar attempts at getting his groove back ('Diamonds Are Forever' and 'Never Say Never Again', anyone?).To Mr. Moores credit, he rocks this film to the very last minute...and he's 60 years old, something that (yes, even Him) the 'great' Sean Connery could never do. Being old never looked better, because simply put, Roger Moore doesn't LOOK like he is old; whereas Sir Sean's hair looked like it was always on a holiday as he battled villains at age 50.'A View to a Kill' also has a rocking soundtrack, thanks to Duran Duran's masterful new-wave title song, and John Barry's always incredible music. Not to mention the eye- catching action sequences, that include fights on both the Eiffel Tower (and the subsequent car chase, VERY memorable), and the Golden Gate Bridge. Thanks to these sequences and more, 'View' is guaranteed to be remembered fondly in your memory for years to come.Additionally, Christopher Walken is one of the best villains in the history of Bondage, PERIOD. Whereas the string of Blofelds never lived up to the 'arch-enemy' reputation except for the immortal Donald Pleasence (no offense, but C'MON, Charles 'Rocky Horror' Gray?!? And Telly Savalas was fine, but since when is Blofeld a pimp?), Walken 'chews scenery' with his outlandish wardrobe and hair, owning the character seamlessly, but he always connects with the lines like no one has done since Gert Forbe. He IS Goldfinger, boyish arrogance and all. The makers of 'Casino Royale' should take note when they make the character of Le Chiffre. Bond villains are not SUPPOSED to be humble or wise, but reckless and as immature as all hell . They are 'characters', and because Walken is the best character actor of our time, he is perfect for the series.The movie has its weaknesses it is overlong, the Bond girls suck, there are too many locations for the senses to handle at one time (a major weakness of ALL Bond films except for Live and Let Die and possibly this one), and Grace Jones is just terrible (have you ever noticed that despite their noble attempts, Bond didn't have an attractive black girlfriend until Halle Berry?), but Christopher Walken saves what might normally be just a mediocre Bond outing and makes it a GREAT one. Enjoyable and entertaining throughout. Walken again, like he did with Batman Returns, carries an O.K. franchise film and makes it something memorable...and he does it both times with nothing but talent, a ridiculous wardrobe, and even more flamboyant hair.

Max Zorin is actually the victim of a Nazi/communist testing that has resulted in him turning psychotic. His new grand psychotic plan is to cause an earth quake that will consume silicon valley and turn Zorin enterprises into the market leader (Didn't we see something like this in Superman The Motion Picture?) This is the worst of all the Bond films with Roger Moore seeming to perform the entire film on back projection in his Swiss chalet. The fight scenes are terrible and one in particular at Zorin's stables has Roger Moore hit someone and they then lie down on a conveyor belt, no, not get knocked onto the conveyor belt, they lie down! Every action sequence is an anticlimax as Bond seems positively easy to beat as Rodge can barely move without having a blue screen behind him, with the fight in Stacey's house being particularly embarrassing. As you may have gathered from the above comment the direction in this film is extremely poor as they were clearly attempting a number of tricks to make Roger Moore look like he could still hold his own in a fight scene which, sadly, he couldn't. The amazing thing about all of this is that the beginning 5 minute sequence to The Living Daylights is better and more exciting than this entire film! The script is a mish-mash of previous Bond films with a key ingredient from Superman added, the cast is terrible with Roger on autopilot and Grace Jones being simply awful, this film reeks of cash-in.

Patrick Macnee was also far too old - and paunchy - as Bond's sidekick and the fight scenes are just embarrassing. Christopher Walken and Grace Jones were no threat at all and Tanya Roberts must be the worst Bond girl of all, especially with her horrid cigarette voice. Moore should have retired after Moonaker, since he was already over fifty then. Finally in an interview last year he acknowledged, I was only about four hundred years too old for the part. As if all this were not enough, the film has the least glamorous locations for any Bond movie. Setting much of it in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS epidemic was a colossal mistake.0/10.

Wilson and is the fourteenth film in the franchise. In this film, besides the central cast inherited from the previous films and the ending of Roger Moore in the role of 007, we have a good cast of artists Tanya Roberts plays the Bond-girl Stacey Sutton, Patrick Macnee gives life to Sir Godfrey Tibbett, Grace Jones gives life to May Day and Christopher Walken gave body and soul to mad Max Zorin. For the last time, Lois Maxwell played Miss Moneypenny, after fourteen movies giving life to M's secretary.In this film, James Bond investigates a fraud in the world of horse racing involving Max Zorin, a powerful businessman. However, the British agent will quickly find a much more dangerous and malevolent conspiracy behind it.This is the last film in which Roger Moore embodies the secret agent. Despite the undoubted talent, the actor was already too old for the role and it was time to pass the baton to a new generation. Nevertheless, Moore stood firm until the end, always maintained a correct posture and took his Bond until the end, with the dignity of a true British. The script could be much more convincing it's a bit strange that Bond, an agent who already got used to save the world, was investigating such a common fraud as doping in equestrian races to, quite naturally, tripping over a global conspiracy against the mecca of technology production. And even if that were to happen, there would certainly simpler ways to achieve that than the way, contrived and complicated, chose by the villain. In any case, the film is good enough, even if not extraordinary it entertains the audience, allows a good time and not disappoint Bond fans. Some scenes are noteworthy, especially the sequence filmed on the Golden Gate Bridge, not only by the performance of the actors but also the spectacular site itself. The opening theme, sung by Duran Duran, also deserves to be heard attentively and appreciated.

Investigating further, Bond is led to Max Zorin, the head of Zorin Industries. Soon 007 faces off against the villainous Zorin and his tough Amazonian bodyguard, May Day, who are scheming to cause massive destruction that will eliminate the competition.........Yes, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (Zorin Wants to destroy Silicon Valley, because of competition, the Valley only manufactures micro-chips, it doesn't sell them, and the sub-plot about horses has nothing whatsoever to do with the film), but it's still enjoyable as a guilty pleasure.And if like me, your a Bond fanatic, it has one of the best scores Barry has done, and Walken is a wonderful Bond Villain.But then there are the negatives, Moore is far too old to play Bond, he even states this in several interviews, location wise it's the least glamorous, and Grace Jones, well, she. Should have just kept her mouth shut and be a silent hench-person, she's stunning and scary to look at, but as soon as she speaks, it takes you away from the film.Walken, as I be said before, is brilliant, psychotic and clever, a literal experiment with nothing to lose, could he be Bonds Joker? There are certainly times when he has Joker- esque tendencies, especially his laugh before he takes his final drop.It's just a shame that the middle of the film is just so saggy, Tanya Roberts is okay as a Bond girl, but she screams way too much, and its almost as if you can leave the film once May-Day jumps off the Eiffel Tower, and return just after Zorin has massacred his crew.The final battle is pretty breathtaking, but it's over too quickly, which is a shame, because the cinematography is stunning.So all in all, it's not Moore's poorest effort, that lies with Octopussy, the Duran Duran Theme is the best Bond song ever, and there is a strange sound effect where Moore goes 'oooooooooohhhhhh!!' And it's used at least six times.It's better than you remember....

The big action sequences in his previous feels really helped you believe it was in fact Roger Moore character in danger. In this film, there are so many blatant attempts of a stunt double used, that when Bond moves, such as rolling over, you really hard to take it seriously. Moore just doesn't look like who would be able to perform it.His style of Bond also seems to wear thin in this film. Although us the audience know that jokey nature of this Bond, its easy to feel as if we've already heard it before. The other characters are a mixed bag, The are some real gems such as Max Zorin and Sir Godfrey Tibbett, and some real annoying characters such as Stacy Sutton with her annoying girl-next-door character and May Day, who most of the time looks as if she can bend in any possible way.John Barry has really seemed to have lost his imagination in the film. The main title theme sung by Duran Duran isn't fantastic and often loses its impact by the end of the film. During the film, it really seems like there's only two pieces of music present. An action piece of music and an instrumental version of the theme. There's bound to be other pieces of music, but i only remember these 2.AVTAK isn't a complete disaster.

But with age comes a familiarity with the Bond back catalogue and an understanding of what makes a good film or not. And with every viewing AVTAK sinks further, to the near-bottom of the stack. Like many poor Bond films, the first 30 to 60 minutes are fine, only to deteriorate when the film's action moves to its final or penultimate setting. (Spoilers ahead.) The San Francisco scenes are simply dreadful, not only because of the ubiquity therein of the worst Bond girl ever, Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton, but because the film feels so tired and uninspired. We see Bond bake quiche, we see Bond fall asleep in a chair. Wow. Living on the edge there. The fire at the City Hall scene is terrible from start to finish; Bond's rescue and the over-dramatically heroic music that accompanies it are cringe-making, as is the fire engine escape. I don't generally like it when Bond films are set in America, because, in a world when most major films are set and produced in the United States, Bond films' glamorous locations provide new scenery that make them stand out from the rest. But when they're set in America they somehow feel more mundane and less interesting. And that's what makes me think the whole San Francisco scenes have the production values of a TV movie. That and Tanya Roberts' appalling acting and interminable wailing. On the plus side, the vast majority of John Barry's score is superb, possibly his best ever, and Duran Duran's punchy, dynamic title track attempted to take the Bond theme tune in a new direction, admirably succeeding in a way that Madonna quite clearly didn't. Together with the inclusion of Grace Jones in the cast, the film is lent a contemporary mid-1980s air that it would otherwise lack. Christopher Walken is a suitably demented villain, but his cabal is fairly humdrum. Roger Moore, despite the advancing years, acts with a measured seriousness, and, combined with a facelift, just about pulls it off. But this 007 yarn is dull and naff, and screaming for a regime change.

It's ridiculous and uninteresting and the resolution to the Silicon Valley plot is resolved with such a cop-out that it was almost not worth writing!The film opens with a ski-chase sequence which while not as cool as the skiing scenes from On her Majesty's Secret Service or The Spy who Loved Me, is still pretty cool, so why they decided to ruin it by playing California Girls I will never know.The first character death of the film is absolutely ridiculous. A French detective who Bond is talking to is kill by May Day who stands at the end of a large room, and uses a fly casting rod, with a hook attacked, and stabs it into his cheek, um, no! Not only do I find the concept of someone being killed by a hook in the cheek absolutely ridiculous, but for me to believe that someone could actually stab someone with a fly casting rod, is too much even for me!Following this is a chase up the Eiffel Tower, where Bond is nearly lifted over the Eiffel Tower with said rod (tut), and this leads to the killer jumping off the Eiffel Tower which was for some reason done is a slow motion cheesy way, that takes all the awesomeness out of the scene.Bond returns to the ground and steals a taxi, this leads to a kinder cool car scene until the roof of the car is completely ripped off by a barrier (whatever), and later in the scene, another car hits the taxi at an angle ripping in in half (seriously?), and then Bond with only the front of the car carries on moving for about two minutes before the thing eventually stops (!!!).I bring up that particular action scene because it's the most ridiculous action scene in the entire film, but later on we still have a pathetically directed fire scene, a daft fire engine chase, a crappy scuffle on the Golden Gate Bridge, and one of the most pathetic Bond girls in the entire series.But first things first, Roger Moore is back for the last time, and just like before he's really cool, but the only problem is that he was 57!!!, when he recorded this film, and considering most of the girls that he somehow falls into bed with in this film are in their mid 20s, it makes for some very awkward scenes. Stacy Sutton played by Tanya Roberts is absolutely pathetic, all she does is scream and get saved by Bond, and at the end of the film, she is captured by Zorin who chases her in a blimp, Seriously? How slow do you have to be running to be court by a flipping blimp. There's no chemistry between her and Bond, nothing to explain why they end up in the shower at the end of the film. Positively Shocking!The only good bit of casting is Christopher Walken, who always make everything 100x better, I don't mind Grace Jones either but I think the casting is a little odd.Overall, I hate this film, it's badly directed, badly written, badly casted, everything just fell flat on it's face in this film, and even Roger Moore and Christopher Walken can't save the pure crappiness here.

Has drumming redolent of The Power Station...that band featured some members of Duran Duran. In fact, The Power Station had their first hit before this movie was released...maybe some cross over influence here?

Jenny Flex...get it?Sexism/misogyny - Bond is patronising at times...or maybe he's being avuncular? Wine fetish - Bond orders Bollinger '75. This brand is mentioned in the end credits.

Hmm...seem to remember reading somewhere that actual wine buffs think that the movie Bond has less than connoisseur taste! Q -He's back. The usual guy...Connery's last turn as Bond a few years previously (in Never say never again) had a new character with that moniker.

Ah, those Hyphenated-Names! * the facial equivalent of incontinence by Moore...he seems to have lost all control of his expressions in this movie! He smirks creepily at times in this movie...like when told of the price of a horse for sale...doesn't really come across as very upper class here!* May Day making Bond look frail in the castle. May Day actually has an interesting arc as a character in this movie...which is another good thing about this movie. May Day looks like she could suggest to Bond that she was going to use a dildo on him and there's not a damn thing he can do about it! Yes, Moore looks his age here. It took one more movie for this to happen than it did Lois Maxwell (as Moneypenny).* Chuck Lee, C.I.A...what on Earth is his accent? * I missed him, but Dolph Lundgren has a role in this movie as Venz.* microchips...in horses! * Bond gets Order Of Lenin from Gogol. Not sure if this is the last time that Gogol appears in this franchise.* James Bond's cover identity...James Stock, London Financial Times. See what he did there? Notes to self - Surete means? - Pola Ivanova...has she appeared in previous Bond movies? - hmm...not sure about the plausibility of the evil scheme at the heart of this movie. Not sure if the notion of double earthquakes seals the issue or not!Conclusion Christopher Walken plays a different kind of Bond villain...more willing to do the dirty work himself, up close. He's interesting. Grace Jones as May Day ends up having an interesting story arc. But these pluses aren't enough to lift this movie above mediocre. Roger Moore started his reign as Bond in a dull way (Live and let die) and his final turn has symmetry as far as dullness goes.

What a shame.  I love James Bond movies, and own almost all of them.Why is it the worst?  (Golden Gun is a close 2nd.)  Because it's just dull and tired.  Roger Moore was way too old to play JB by this time (I'm sure this is the movie's most common complaint--I'm sorry if it's a cliche by now!)  Moore made some excellent Bond films, but he was probably too old to play JB four years earlier, in For Your Eyes Only.  He still did a great job with that film, and with Octopussy, but he really over-stayed his welcome with this one.I am far from stating that RM deserves all the blame; the movie has very little action or memorable scenes.  Zorin's betrayal of his workers is a violent and disturbing sequence, and it goes on far too long.  Patrick Macnee's presence is wasted, and so is Christopher Walken as a mediocre villain.  Then there are the women... Grace Jones is just... outrageous.  She makes a good assassain, but not a good conquest for JB.  Tanya Roberts plays quite a bimbo.Nevertheless, we must not forget that this IS a BOND film, and it is not without its good qualities!  The horse jumping sequence is probably one of the tenser moments in the movie.  The hydrogen blimp climax was pretty good, too.  I mentioned that Patrick Macnee and Christopher Walken's talents were wasted, but they are still in the movie.  Anyone else want to drop out? is Walken's most memorable line.

Since For Your Eyes only he had been contracted movie by movie. While the production team couldn't solve the problem of refreshing the casting, in half a decade, they played it safe and fell back on Roger Moore for a total of three times. But it's Moore's own less favorite, and mine also. To me, it's just too mid 80's. Too mid 80's....Why involve such people as amazing Grace miss Jones? A mediocre 80's pop-artist who just wanted to strengthen her media limelight power by appearing in a Bond movie. Such failure from the production team. (Bet her record company pumped in a lot of money to assure her appearance.) And the theme song? Artificial, plastic and stone dead music from one of the most overrated pop-bands ever. I rather listen to the hairdryer from one of the fashion boys in Duran Duran than this tune. This song marks the all time bottom of James Bond Soundtracks. (Even WHAM! would have done it better by this time...a sophisticated ballad from George Michael could have saved much.)The villain story itself, about computer meltdown for the U.S by drowning Silicon Valley, is just a modern version of old Blofeld stuff. (But I think Christopher Walken portraits the mentally disturbed industrialist quite well. A defector from cold Russia and KGB, who's current independence and plans discomforts his former employers.)Tanya Roberts (former angel from the fifth and last season of TV-show Charlie's Angels, for instance) is easily forgotten every sometime I revisit this movie. Actor skills enough for being a sexy cut-out doll in heavy makeup, hairspray, and tight designer jeans. Not 007 material.Roger Moore was at 57 of age, and well aware of the slight silliness of him trying to appear on the screen as a lethal weapon. And by his own admission, he did not get along with any of the leading women, neither Roberts nor Jones. (Jones was occasionally really obnoxious, crew members testified in interviews later.) I don't want to criticize Roger at all for his work in this movie, but I bet he was quite relieved once the shooting finished, and the scene door closed behind him.

Why cast Tanya Roberts anyway when she was fresh from a Razzie nomination for Sheena, Queen of the Jungle? She repaid the producers by getting one for this film too! Why set the opening scene in the gorgeous setting of Iceland, then use the Beach Boys' California girls as the music? Talking of music, who authorised Duran Duran to sing the title track? It has dated worse than any other Bond theme song. Am I right in thinking that the only high-tech gadget here is a pair of Polarizing sunglasses? Is the first love interest before the title sequence played by Alison Doody? She was 19 at the time. Moore could have been her grandad. Of all the women Bond beds in this film, Ivanova (Fiona Fullerton) seems the most convincing.I'm not against using older actors appropriately. For instance, Patrick Macnee works well with Moore as Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Makes you wonder why he wasn't considered earlier.Grace Jones (May Day) is just bizarre in every scene, though her jump from the Eiffel Tower is spectacular, as is Bond's driving, or rather the stunt-double-who-looks-nothing-like-Bond's driving.Christopher Walkden is oddly restrained, and who told Alison Doody and Patrick Bauchau to deliver their lines in a nasal monotone? Tanya Roberts delivers her lines as if she is unfamiliar with the meaning of any word of more than two syllables, and we're supposed to believe she is the State Geologist, which is totally ridiculous.

It's hard to choose between this and Moonraker, but at least you can actually remember what happens in Moonraker. This time, Bond is investigating computer chips, horses and eventually comes face to face with Christopher Walken (on excellent form) as he battles to stop a horrifying (and hugely unrealistic) cataclysm. AVTAK is enjoyable at times when you're in the right mood thanks to its humour and like with every Bond film it's always cool to see the Bond formula but this is weighed down by an elderly Bond, a complete lack of gadgets, lame action and arguably the Worst Bond Girl of all time. This veers into near comedy too often and although it can work it doesn't feel serious enough and often just doesn't feel like a Bond film. Grace Jones makes an interesting henchwoman and Christopher Walken is a genuinely fine villain, but Tanya Roberts is atrocious and Roger Moore gives his worst performance as Bond. The fact that he looks ancient compared to the other Bond actors in this doesn't help.The Paris action sequence is good and the Golden Gate Bridge finale is sometimes palm sweating but it's all flatly filmed throughout and John Glen doesn't inject any passion or glamour into the film. They decided to play the Beach Boys during the opening action scene which rips off The Spy Who Loved Me and there's a terrible sequence involving a fire engine which just isn't thrilling and has Bond acting extremely foolishly. The lack of energy is noticeable and very off putting, while the plot lacks charisma, originality and escapism. It's not as absurd as certain other instalments but there's a very good reason why this is lowest ranked on Rotten Tomatoes out of the 50 year old franchise. So- if you're in the right mood this might be bearable at times. If you're not, you will slightly hate it. This does go into enjoyably bad territory so it's not unwatchable but there's just no heart and no care put into this creaking Bond entry. The thing to compare it to is that car crash in Casino Royale.

Well, for whatever reason unbeknowest to me this didn't happen for Dalton until Living Daylights. Regardless, View To a Kill is a definite disappointment to the 007 series and I disliked it as much as I did Thunderball but that is an entirely different review altogether. Moving on, I have heard it said that Tanya Roberts who played the bond girl in this film couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Well, I seriously have to agree. She was one of the worst bond girls in the entire series of 007. In fairness to Tanya she is (or was) very good looking at the time. As for the other female lead, Grace Jones was labeled by a lot of viewers as being too masculine for her role and I also must agree with that. As for the villain, Christopher Walkin is one of my favorite actors of all time but not even his character could do much to save this film from ultimately being a stinker. Overall, the story is weak and so is the acting even on Roger Moore's part. Seriously.. it looked as if Moore was ready to throw in the towel before completion of this movie. Very seldomly do I agree with so-called professional critics but in the case of View To a Kill I have to make an exception. To be a bit fair, this might entertain viewers on the first watch yet I am very positive most will not want to see it a second time. I've sat through this movie three times and it was twice too many. While it would have been interesting to see what Timothy Dalton might have brought to View To a Kill in terms of Bond's character, I doubt very highly it would have made much difference to the overall production. One positive comment I will make is that View To a Kill has a good theme song by one of the great euro bands of the 80's Duran Duran.

Cubby Broccoli, however, persuaded him to stay on to make A View to a Kill, which thus became Moore's seventh Bond film, and also his last. Sadly, AVTAK is far from being a great farewell for the man who has starred in more official Bond movies than anyone else, as it is a dull film, devoid of real inspiration and unable to rouse itself from torpor.Funnily enough, in spite of his age Moore's performance is one of the better things about the film, as he plays it fairly straight and does not just sleepwalk his way through, as he had been guilty of in some of his earlier outings. However, by now there was no hiding the fact that Moore was simply too old to still be playing James Bond; he had got away with it in For Your Eyes Only and (just) in Octopussy, but in AVTAK you can see the wrinkles clearly, and the credibility of the film is thus undermined from the start. It does not help matters that we see him in intimate scenes with a number of (much younger) women, most distressingly in bed with the Amazonian Grace Jones, a sight that is not for the faint-hearted. A jacuzzi scene with Fiona Fullerton also gives us ample opportunity to survey Moore's ageing body, and it does leave you wishing he had quit before this film.Many others in the cast of AVTAK are of advancing years, including Willoughby Gray as an evil German scientist, Patrick Macnee as Bond's ally Tibbett, and Lois Maxwell, making her fourteenth and final appearance as a by now distinctly matronly Moneypenny. All of them give good performances, but the preponderance of ageing stars certainly helps to rob the film of real dynamism, and little in the way of sexual frisson can be generated between a Bond and a Moneypenny who are both a short way off collecting their bus passes. At least there is good nostalgia value in seeing Moore and Macnee, the Saint and the Avenger, working together and clearly enjoying doing so, and Macnee is very enjoyable in his role.In fairness, the age of the cast wouldn't matter so much if the film was exciting, but sadly the pace is pedestrian and the story never takes off. From a deeply unimaginative pre-title sequence, which sees OO7 involved in yet another ski chase, AVTAK is quite happy to be Bond-by-numbers, and John Glen directs with less spark than in his other Bond films. The action scenes are uninspired and, in the case of a fire engine chase through San Francisco, pretty stupid, with only the final showdown on the Golden Gate Bridge generating any real excitement. There is also some horrendous back projection, which is quite incredible for a film made in the mid-80s, and just adds to its creaky feel. The villains, sadly, don't really give a lift to proceedings, even though Christopher Walken plays the psychotic industrialist Max Zorin, Bond's main opponent. Walken tries his best with the character, certainly making him nutty and disturbed, but the limitations of the script prevent him from making Zorin a convincing villain, and it is ultimately an unsuccessful performance. Grace Jones is more effective as May Day, mainly because she is such an imposing and intimidating figure, but the effect is rather spoiled when she is finally allowed to open her mouth towards the end. Someone else who opens her mouth far too much is the irritating Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton, who we are supposed to believe is a geologist but does little more than scream a lot. Undoubtedly, she is one of the worst Bond girls ever.AVTAK is without question the worst Bond film of the 80s, and certainly one of the weaker entries in the franchise. Its only real saving graces are a handful of good performances and Duran Duran's dynamic title song, the last truly classic Bond theme. It is a pity Moore had to go out in this way; he may not have been the best Bond, but he turned in some effective performances during his reign, and ensured the continuation of the series. Some new blood and a new direction were, however, now needed urgently, and thankfully they would arrive in the next chapter of the Bond saga.

During the filming of A view to a Kill, Roger Moore had turned 57 years old. The character James Bond, is not 57 years old, nor is he even in his 50's for that matter. Ian Fleming pictured the character James Bond to be in his mid to late 30's and maybe his early to mid 40's. Definitely NOT his 50's! Now don't get me wrong, bless Roger Moore for being a great James Bond, for I did enjoy all his Bond films, but I think it's pretty fair to say that Roger went one bond film too far. I always felt his final Bond should have been For Your Eyes Only, or obviously his previous Bond, Octopussy. If Moore had back out of the role then, we would have gotten to see a lot more of Timothy Datlon who I thought was the perfect James Bond who was dark, and portrayed the character just like Ian Fleming pictured Bond in the novels. I mean Roger was still physical enough for the role, but his age just ruined the film which is why it is one of my least favorite Bond films. It was a good Bond film, but Roger and his age just stuck around too long which made it look VERY awkward that he was making love to college-age women.

AVTAK has a pretty bad opening sequence with Moore trying to retrieve a necklace. Almost every Bond movie has a standout scene that instantly comes to kind when I think of the movie AVTAK has none. Then we have Roger Moore who was approaching his 60's looked much too old and therefore unconvincing as Bond. It's not just Moore who was looking worn out, the movie itself looked very tired compared to the other Bond flicks of the 80's. AVTAK basically consists of one uninteresting scene after another. God bless those producers who realised their mistake and replaced Moore with Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylight which was a much better Bond movie. The action sequences looked rather uninspired which is another major flaw. Max Zorin's scheme to raid Silicon Valley seems rather feeble compared to other Bond meglomaniacs like Stromberg, Blofeld etc. I read a review on Youtube which said AVTAK plot resembles that of Goldfinger's and now that I have thought about it I think AVTAK is kind of modelled on Goldfinger. Goldfinger planned to raid Fort Knox whilst in AVTAK it's Silicon Valley. Zorin had a female accomplice in the form of Mayday who suddenly turns good towards the end, Goldfinger had Pussy Galore. To its credit it has a pretty good theme tune and also has Christopher Walken's performance as Max Zorin(woefully underrated in my opinion). If only Roger Moore had realised he was far too old for Bond then us Bond fans wouldn't have had to endure this ludricous misfire.

Originally since when do they repeat the opening sequences in movies used to excel at making matchless intros ?!! The plot was formulaic, so I hated that most of the events felt recycled from another Bond movies, some of them were for (Moore) himself ! And talking about hate; Bond's cover here was discovered in a very idiot way. This undoubtedly was the script's lowest point and shameful insult to the supposedly high profile 007 ! (Moore) seemed so old and weary to do action or seduce babies. He was 58 year old at the time, but strangely enough he looked older. At the action sequences he wasn't believable, especially with a very visible stunt for him all the time. And at a hot moment like the end of the opening sequence, while he was going to have a good time with a young girl, you must veto starkly How you'll gonna do it grandpa ?!! As you see, whatever the kind of Action he was involved in, (Moore) lost the persuasion !This is the only movie for Bond which required from him having a homosexual experience, since I don't consider (Grace Jones) as a woman in the first place ! Casting her as an evil Bond girl was historical fatal mistake, one of the stupidest decisions I've ever witnessed, and a lousy try to attract the pervert audience.Well, for me Bond movies used to be a chance to watch some beautiful voluptuous girls. But since the 1970s, it became a chance to watch some beautiful girls only. And since the 1980s it became a chance to watch some girls anyway ! However this time, OH MY GOD, (Jones) is not a girl or even close ! She seemed, with those creepy costumes and that awful haircut, more like The Bogeywoman ! Honestly I've had some time till I became convinced of her as not a MAN. She's not the most dreadful woman I've ever seen in the whole series; she's rather the ugliest creature I've ever seen in my life ! (Lois Maxwell) as (Moneypenny) was 58 year old, so any sexual innuendo was near to bad tasting. Even (Tanya Roberts) was frigid and not sexy, or at least not sexy enough to make us forget about (Grace Jones)'s scary presence !(John Barry)'s music was surely the movie's best. The title's song was superb but maybe too young for that Bond! The action sequences were very good. The thing is they leaned to feeling exhausted and fake.

And (Christopher Walken) was one talented factor as maybe the craziest evil man appeared in a Bond movie, though it was lost performance at a movie that wasn't forgettable inasmuch as being better forgotten ! So, with old plot, old Bond, ugly cold Bond girls, and fake action, you have to know why (A View to a Kill) is nasty ! Generally it is run-down, at the list of the worst bonds, and some clever jinx which succeeded at cursing all the series, shutting it down for years after (in the next 10 years just 2 movies would be made). Despite any talking about the controversy of owning the rights as the actual reason; don't you ever believe it; it's (Grace Jones) and her view which killed us violently.

I was born the year after Dr. No was released, so I've kind of grown up with the series. As a kid in the 70s, some of my fondest movie related memories are of those Sunday nights that ABC would air a Bond movie. I couldn't wait to see the car chases, the gadgets, the fight scenes, and the over-the-top villains. It was a great time. That's why it pains me to rate A View to a Kill as low as I do. While there are a few James Bond movies that I have problems with, this is really the only one in the entire series that I would call a bad movie. In fact, I can't think of a single positive thing to write. Watching A View to a Kill last night was akin to nails on a chalk board. Everything about the movie scrapes the proverbial bottom of the James Bond barrel &#x95; Roger Moore &#x96; I'm not a Roger Moore hater, but by the time he made A View to a Kill, he was way too old to pull it off. He looks absolutely ridiculous romancing the young hotties. And that dye job &#x96; it's the worst.&#x95; The Bond Girls &#x96; Some Bond girls are better than others, but there are none as bad as the two in A View to a Kill. Grace Jones &#x96; she's got to be the most unattractive female to ever appear in a Bond movie. Who in the world ever thought she was sexy? If I saw anymore of her backside, I think I might have ripped my eyes out. Tanya Roberts &#x96; she probably the worst actress to ever appear in a Bond movie. Imagining her as a geologist is about as silly as picturing Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist (oh wait, she did play a nuclear scientist in a Bond movie). And if Tanya had whined the world James one more time, I think I might have ripped my ears off.&#x95; Christopher Walken &#x96; Don't misunderstand, I like Christopher Walken. But could he have looked any more foolish than he does with blond hair? Why did they have to do that? &#x95; The Plot &#x96; I've got two problems with the film's plot. First, the whole idea of flooding Silicon Valley is beyond stupid. I don't see how it would have accomplished much of anything. Wouldn't companies have just gone elsewhere to produce their computer chips? Second, can someone please explain to me what the steroid injected horses in the first half of the movie have to do with the flooding Silicon Valley plot of the second half of the movie? It's like the entire first hour of the movie was little more than padding.I could go on and on (Duran Duran's crappy title song, the use of rear projection anytime Roger Moore is supposed to be doing anything physical, the all too obvious stunt doubles, the groan inducing quips, the fire truck chase, the film's title being forced into the dialogue, Q as a peeping tom, etc.), but I'll stop there. You get the idea &#x96; I don't like A View to a Kill. In fact, with each successive viewing, I like it less and less. I'm at the point now where I pretty much hate it and doubt I'll ever give it another chance. It's just bad.

Desperately in need of Dalton's harder realism, this self-parodying Bond format looks tired, dated and repetitive. Written so relentlessly by the numbers, it's an identikit of any other Bond movie, with only the schoolboyish puns altered.Right from the opening, the extended skiing sequence has a `seen it all before' feel, while the Beach Boys number is just plain silly. The neon titles, probably the height of fashion in the mid-80s, haven't aged well to say the least. Some of the stunts must have taken great time and money to achieve, yet they're so formulaic that you don't even notice them. Others are just plain nonsensical, such as the Lloydesque fire ladder routine that eats up over five minutes of screentime. And the exotic locales, such as the Eiffel Tower, are made virtually obsolete by John Glen's indifferent direction.Many of the guest cast misfire Patrick MacNee is a leading man, not comedy support, while Fiona Fullerton's plank-like diction renders innuendoes like `I love an early morning ride' redundant. Crucially though, the masterful Christopher Walken just doesn't work in this childish nonsense. He's as good as always, though maybe that's the problem &#150; he's too good for the material.A roll call of racial stereotypes pass the screen, building up a flimsy plot of horses, earthquakes and microchip technology. The plot illogic here isn't really worth bothering with &#150; this is a James Bond movie after all &#150; though what stable owner, even a psychotic one, would go to the trouble to build steeplechase booby traps? The use of mild bad language and even dumber than usual humour also makes this a particularly U.S-aimed Bond. Though as Stallone and Schwarzenegger were flavour of the month then what would Americans want with an old granny who's practically ginger?It's cruel to remark on the star's age, yet in a bedroom scene with Grace Jones, we see a hard, toned, muscular body slide under the sheets&#133; and yes, it's Grace's. Even after six movies Roger is still the least convincing Bond for fights, while one of the villains is Big Ron from Eastenders. When Zorin's computer lists Roger as `extremely dangerous' you can't believe it's talking about the same man. His stunt double, maybe. Incidentally, check out the rubbish continuity that sees May Day's sunglasses transmigrate from her face to her hand when she ejects the businessman from the airship. Cheesiest line award has to go to the corny crowbarring in of the nonsensical title with `what a view' `to a kill'.For Moore's final outing then this is a curiously nondescript entry and lacks the kind of climatic spectacle that characterised Licence to Kill or You Only Live Twice. And in a film that has probably the worst screen backdrops of the last fifty years then it's only fitting that the (admittedly fairly exciting) finale sees him crudely dubbed onto Golden Gate Bridge. Sadly, though perhaps aptly, Roger's last line spoken as 007 is a Carry On style `ooooh'.Possibly the weakest of all official Bonds, A View To A Kill is certainly the weakest Moore vehicle. I couldn't help wondering if a person who'd never seen a Bond movie before would be drawn to the series if this was their first experience of it. In all honesty, I think the answer is no. 4/10.

Anyway, cut to the theme song, which I have to admit I like. Then horses and some other stuff for an hour. Did I mention Christopher Walken?

What a waste of a talented actor. Who would expect him to bother trying given the quality of this script?With a lot of Bond films the plot serves as an excuse for several action scenes, and as a contrivance for a beautiful woman to show up barely clothed. In A View to a Kill the plot is even weaker than many of the other weak entries in the series, and what's even worse is that 70% of the movie actually revolves around it, and Christ, is it boring. If you're going to make a Bond film where there's not a single action scene which is inventive or interesting or different in any way (granted the first big action scene is entertaining), at least make the screenplay interesting. John Glen offering up some of the laziest direction in the series is only another aspect of this movie which makes it such a totally flat, boring failure.

In fact, it's one of the weaker ones. It's unfortunate because this film ends Roger Moore's long 15 year run as everyone's favorite British Secret Service agent. Films have come along way since he began in 1973, but the quality has varied in this franchise. Bond films attempt to go bigger and bigger with every release, but A View to a Kill fails at bringing a more mainstream approach to the series. It's also unfortunate that we have a wasted performance from Christopher Walken, who very well could have been an all time great villain.The action definitely feels bigger, and there are a few notable action scenes that I can see myself re-watching. But the film is poorly paced with an incredibly slow first half. It doesn't help that the first action scene we see is before the opening credits and it's yet another ski chase. Only that this time Bond gets away on a snowboard, how original. Speaking of the opening credits, this film contains one of the better credits songs and the score for the entire film is great. So it's not all bad. Walken plays a horse breeder, yes Bond goes after a horse breeder. The twist on his character was welcomed and it definitely made more sense as to why 007 would be assigned to this case. The problem is, this happens half way through the film, so the first hour or so just seems like an entirely different film. On the other hand, at least they attempted to change up the villain formula from past installments, but Walken's performance never takes off.A strong point for the series often includes strong supporting characters. Unfortunately, none of the women or even men that Bond gets help from prove to be of any relevance. In other words, not enough care is given to them in the script to make us feel sympathy for them when everything hits the fan. So in all, A View to a Kill is another missed opportunity to have a classic film with a classic villain. Once again, there's some entertainment to be had, particularly in the climax, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster first half.+Opening credits theme+John Barry's adjusted score-Wasted role for Walken-Don't care about the supporting characters-slow slow start4.8/10 "},{"Title":"Had potential...","Date":"20 July 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" A VIEW TO A KILL, the last time we saw Roger Moore play James Bond, had a lot of promise but eventually succumbed to a badly developed storyline. Max Zorin is an eccentric millionaire who enjoys racing and breeding horses and has many companies. He is the baddie in this installment of the franchise. One of his companies makes computer chips which he believes will rule the world. In order for him to rule the market, he has to erase the competition, who in this case is Silicon Valley itself in Northern California. The premise is great and if, done with a bit more care, it would've been among the best Bond films in a while. There's a subplot of genetic engineered horses and a hint that Max Zorin himself is also part of this engineering, but it's dropped like hot potatoes and never addressed in the movie's climatic finale. The movie looks extremely dated, even more so than earlier movies like THE SPY WHO LOVED ME or FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. As much as I enjoy DURAN DURAN, I think it was an ill advised choice to have them sing the title song. It's not a bad song per se, it's just NOT a James Bond movie song. As for Roger Moore, besides his decidedly old age appearance, he emits an air of disinterest and seems to just walk through the movie. There in no chemistry between him and Tanya Roberts, as hot as she was back then. She looks like she could easily be her daughter.The movie's pace picks up considerably (as with almost ALL Bond films) at the end giving us some grand views of San Francisco's Bay Area. It's no wonder Moore himself disliked the movie and although it's always fun to watch Christopher Walken, his role could've been performed by anyone (Rutger Hauer would've been a wonderful choice). Grace Jones looks weird as usual but she had the most menacing presence during the movie.A VIEW TO A KILL isn't the absolute worst as some here might say. It has its moments. It definitely isn't anything to rave home about either. It had the potential to be a real good Bond movie, but somethings just didn't gel...

By the end of his run as 007, Connery was clearly in it for the money, with so/so films like 'You Only Live Twice', 'Diamonds Are Forever', and then the unspeakably bad 'Never Say Never Again' later in his career. What set Roger Moore apart was the fact that he seemed to continuously play 007 for the love of the character and of the series, he was in many ways the 'True Bond'. But that somewhat changed in 1985 when 'A View To A Kill' was released.In many ways, 'AVTAK' was not Moore's fault, in fact the movie had a few things going for it, the villain, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) was smart and intriguing, the plot was in a few ways realistic, and the locations, even though there were just 2, were good. The reason this film did not work was mainly because of Moore's age. Most of us thought he was too old to be playing Bond in 'Octopussy' but by the time 'AVTAK' rolled around he seemed to have been spent. Moore was leathery, old, tired, and didn't move with the finesse we were all used to, basically he should have retired years ago. The unfortunate thing is that no matter how good Moore did in the film he was old and no one could see past that. That is one of the main reasons why this film will never work.It was an unfortunate farewell to quite possibly the greatest Bond of all time, Roger Moore.

Moneypenny looks ancient and although I love Lois Maxwell in the part, I must say I'm glad they let her go after this. Her scenes with Roger Moore were never as good as they were with Connery or Lazenby. As for Q, after his great, deserved role in Octopussy, he makes two cameos at the beginning and end of the film. That was alright in OHMSS; that was a down-to-Earth Bond with no gadgets, but this film is LOADED with RIDICULOUS gadgets, so Q should've had a bigger part.

Born of Hugh Hefner's Playboy philosophy of the 1950s -- how to choose an expensive pipe, the most stylish watches, the sveltest babes -- it seems monstrously dated, eclipsed by its own imitators, all the action-by-the-numbers movies of the 1980s. It's descendants offered more gore and violence, though the wisecracks and double entendres remain at about the same level.Roger Moore as James Bond, to a beautiful young woman I see you've been in the saddle. Woman Yes, I like a good morning ride. Bond I'm an early riser myself. They all must be really expensive and, with a few exceptions, they're hard to differentiate. Oh, some star Sean Connery, some Roger Moore, and some Pearse Brosnan -- but what's the difference really? Some of the difference is in the kinds of chases, in the sense of what kind of vehicle is pursuing what other kind of vehicle. I can't remember them all, but I do recall half a dozen speedboats in the coves of Florida. This one features Moore in the driver's seat of an out-of-control fire engine pursued by the Keystone Cops, bouncing over the streets of San Francisco. (See Bullit for the original.) Then there are the glamorous women themselves. This one features Tanya Roberts as Bond's good companion. Grace Jones is the villainess, and she's startling. Her body is that of a sinewy leptosome, and her physiognomy and even her hair style are suggestive of a Tutsi warrior. Her eyes seem unable to simply look at something. They glare. And her teeth, generally exposed, are always clenched. She can't act but neither can good girl Tanya Roberts so it evens out.Yes -- the story. Moore, as Bond, foils a plot by a mad man (Christopher Walken) to blow up the reservoirs above the San Andreas fault and flood silicon valley, cornering the market for computer chips.Aside from some nicely choreographed action scenes, Walken may be the best thing about the movie. I can only think of one film in which he's given a performance so poor that it becomes ludicrous -- something to do with Anne Heche being gang banged by the police. One of the most hilarious scenes in any movie ever made HAS to be Walken's brief appearance in Pulp Fiction, a story delivered dead pan, a sentimental tale, about Walken's being a prisoner of war in Vietnam and walking around with another man's watch in his anus.I keep waiting for the series to develop Cheyne-Stokes breathing, shudder, gasp that it was once a big shot, and expire, but it never does. The last two entries feature Daniel Craig as a serious Bond, an attempt to resuscitate, I suppose.Will there be another remake? Does a bear sit in the Vatican?

Sadly, like Sean Connery, whose last official Bond film was 1971's Diamonds Are Forever, Moore's stint ended with one of the disappointing installments in the franchise. Not only was this his final outing as Bond, it was also the end for Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, and she had been playing that role since the franchise began with Connery in 1962, so her 23 years of appearing in Bond films didn't end so well, either.Bond returns to England with a microchip from the USSR, one which turns out to be identical to the ones manufactured by Zorin Industries! The secret agent is sent to investigate this company and its owner, Max Zorin. During his mission, the secret agent discovers that Max Zorin is drilling near the San Andreas Fault in California! The owner of Zorin Industries has a sinister plan to cause an earthquake there and destroy Silicon Valley! On this mission, as usual, Bond finds himself in a some deadly situations, and will not only have to face the evil and insane Max Zorin in different places, but also his very strong lover and henchwoman, May Day! Eventually joining agent 007 on the mission is a geologist named Stacey Sutton.I know I'm not the first to point this out, but Christopher Walken doesn't put on a very good performance as the main villain in this movie. In fact, the character may get pretty absurd at times, especially towards the end! Also, Grace Jones doesn't play May Day convincingly, and Tanya Roberts' performance as Stacey Sutton is average at best, certainly no match for many other actresses who have played Bond sidekicks. In addition to problems with certain cast members, A View to a Kill also has similar problems as Octopussy, the last film that came before it, such as lack of excitement for the most part (I did find it exciting towards the end, but not very much before that at all), and it may be tiresome enough to seem longer than it actually is. Most of the action in this film didn't seem to grab me. Instead, it usually bored me, and perhaps sometimes got on my nerves a bit.I know Octopussy is more popular than this film, but I'm not sure which one I think is worse. However, A View to a Kill just MIGHT be a bit worse in my book. I may have rated it 4/10 if it weren't for the excitement I found towards the end, after so much dullness, and I've never rated a Bond film lower than 5/10 before! Now that I've seen all seven of the films in the franchise starring Roger Moore, I can say I think his first two (Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun) are decent, his third (The Spy Who Loved Me) is better, but it all went downhill from there with Moonraker, and never improved much after that, only slightly with For Your Eyes Only, and then went back down to average at best with his last two, Octopussy and A View to a Kill. So, while I don't think Moore was bad as James Bond, and would say he definitely was in some decent films in the franchise, he unfortunately starred in a string of disappointing ones before finally leaving in the mid-eighties.

I remember seeing this at the cinema when I was a child and I enjoyed it at the time. However, age and the passing of time has completely changed my opinion of this film. I watched it again on DVD recently and I felt very underwhelmed by it, in every way. I could now see the film's faults more obviously than before and with a more mature outlook. One of the main problems is its star, Roger Moore. He was always too old to play Bond, even in Live And Let Die, but his age was a lot more apparent in this film. He was 57 when he made this and he does look his age a lot more than in the previous Octopussy a couple of years earlier. I just could not believe that he was supposed to be James Bond, doing all of those stunts and romancing women, most of whom were young enough to be his daughter. I found that very creepy. There was also much more obvious usage of stunt doubles in this film, particularly in the Paris scenes, which made Moore look even less convincing. I also didn't like Grace Jones, who has to be the most unattractive Bond girl to ever appear in one of these films. I thought that Tanya Roberts was pretty, though and she looked the part, but she simply couldn't act. Christopher Walken was manic enough to be the villain and I quite enjoyed his performance, though. The title song by Duran Duran was also very good and, at the time, the most successful Bond theme in the UK singles chart. I also thought that the action scenes were a bit naff too, with some very bad editing, particularly in the fight under Zorin's stables. I also hated the very unnecessary inclusion of a Beach Boys song during the pre-credits sequence, which made me cringe and the chase with the fire engine was like something from a Keystone Kops movie from the 1920s. To sum up, I enjoyed this more when I watched it as a child, but now I dislike it immensely and find it very embarrassing and childish. I regard it as Roger Moore's second worst Bond film and one of the worst of the entire series. Thank God that Timothy Dalton took over for the far superior The Living Daylights. He took out a lot of the juvenile humour and put back some believability and dignity into the Bond films. I would only recommend A View To A Kill to Bond completists or fans of Moore's Bond films. Anyone else will be very disappointed, so should stay clear. I never liked Roger Moore's Bond very much, but it is a shame that his tenure had to end like this. A disappointing swansong.

This is another excellent opening sequence with some fantastic stunt work and it also manages to balance out a sense of enjoyment with some intensity. The only issue is that 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys is randomly thrown in and it doesn't fit at all. Theme Song Pop band Duran Duran provide one of the series catchiest themes. It might sound a little too dance driven to be in Bond, but it has memorable lyrics that combine with a great rhythm and a lot of energy that make it standout.Plot The microchip Bond recovered is identical to a British prototype and Bond is sent to investigate the company behind it. He finds out that industrialist Max Zorin is planning on destroying Silicon Valley via earthquake so he can exploit the microchip market. The story is very weak. It just isn't set up well which makes it not remotely interesting and Zorin's plan does make much sense even for a Bond villain. The film is trying to look at a more unique way of world domination in fairness, but for not one moment is any of it believable or engaging which is the issue.James Bond Roger Moore definitely looks too old by this point, I mean he could be playing Bond's dad here. He's still likable and amusingly witty, but he'd clearly aged since Octopussy and he is no longer believable in the role. It's so obviously not him in the action, he looks out of place doing spy work and most of the seductive scenes are really awkward which just isn't Bond.Bond Girls Tanya Roberts is absolutely awful as Stacey. The character is basically an idiot which doesn't help, but Roberts delivers her lines with so little emotion and her shrieks of ''James!'' are ear scraping. Plus she has no chemistry whatsoever with Moore. Sure she's good-looking, but the role has no depth and Roberts is painfully wooden.Villains Christopher Walken should have been a great villain, but he is wasted horribly. Zorin is just such a dull villain. He has no lines that are even slightly memorable, his only trait is that he's a bit of a psychopath and Walken looks bored out of his mind throughout. Grace Jones is okay as May Day. She is at least impressive due to her unique look, but all she does is stand around looking mean and her switch to Bond's ally feels forced. Not to mention the scene where Bond seducers her is cringe-worthy. Support Patrick Macnee, known for The Avengers, is enjoyable as Bond's ally Sir Godfrey. Macnee has a warm screen presence and he has a real chemistry with Moore that is used effectively. Robert Brown is solid once again as M.Action The action is decent, but on the whole it's very forgettable. We get some cool action in the Eiffel Tower which is a unique location and then the usual Moore car chase which is silly fun. Another chase in a fire truck round San Francisco is again unique, but it's played for laughs a bit too much. We get some decent fist fights and assassinations littered throughout, but nothing special. The climax is dreadful. The set-up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge is again interesting, but Zorin is overpowered with ease and Bond's moves like an acrobat which takes away any tension.Score John Barry's score is excellent and probably the best thing here. He adds even more energy and tension here, which results in some really excellent compositions. It is used well to give scenes some added punch, but it deserves to be in a better film.Production Values John Glen keeps his low-key style, but with no good storyline or character development everything is just looks flat or dreary. The writing is really weak. It's like the film doesn't know whether it wants to be more serious or more comical which results in a very unbalanced film. Zorin is treated seriously but is extremely boring, whilst outlandish events continue to happen and they are excruciatingly bad. The pacing isn't great here either, with the story taking forever to get going as we see Bond messing around at Zorin's stables for an age. The stunt work is very good, but it is so clearly not Moore and they don't even try to hide it which ruins most of the action scenes. The locations are good as usual, with San Francisco making a great backdrop to the events taking place.Conclusion Roger Moore's last outing as Bond is easily one of the series weakest. For a start the plot is terrible and the more you think about it the less logical it becomes. Moore looks ancient and as a result most of the charm he had has dried up. Tanya Roberts makes an awful Bond girl and the waste of someone as enjoyable as Christopher Walken is unforgivable too. Apart from Barry's score and the locations there is nothing above average here. Everything feels like it was done lazily, there is no energy or interest in the film and that makes it such a poor effort. It was so clear that Bond needed a fresh injection and it's a shame Moore bowed out on a low.

How about push him into yet another formulaic thriller undercut by bad comedy and lousy female leads? A View To A Kill didn't kill 007, but it didn't miss by much.A common theme of many comments on this thread is that Roger Moore was too old at 57 to play James Bond. To be fair, Moore is in good physical shape, and could pass for a guy in his 40s. The problem this time is how emotionally disengaged he is from the story and the characters around him. For once he seems miserable at tossing off one of those token Moore-isms of his, like there's a fly in your soup when a contact of his is murdered by a poisoned butterfly.A self-conscious Roger Moore is not a good start for a Bond film, and it gets worse. The plot, something to do with a microchip maker's plan to destroy his competition by flooding Silicon Valley, gets out of hand early with a goofy horse-doping subplot that disappears an hour in. The direction by John Glen is ugly and uninspired, presenting an overall texture that strives to be both gritty and goofy and winds up a mess. Even John Barry's theme music sounds at times like a hollow On Her Majesty's Secret Service retread.Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones are fine physical specimens who can't act a lick between them. We're not sure about her is the first line about Jones' exotic May Day character, and after 22 years, I can't say I'm farther along than that. Roberts' Stacey Sutton screams and wears tight clothing, obviously not concerned for a moment about being mistaken for a serious actress.Christopher Walken unlocks the puzzle of how to succeed in such a bad movie by treating it as a total joke. His Max Zorin, the bad guy, is such a psychopath he kills his underlings for pure kicks and even tells the KGB where to get off. Walken wasn't known in the mid-'80s for his gonzo comedy stylings, so maybe this was a coming-out party for the cowbell side of his nature. Flip, smirking, he seems to enjoy himself whether he's winning or losing.May Day will provide you with a drink, he tells one unfortunate before his girl tosses him into the Pacific. Anyone else want to drop out?Most of the action setpieces are undercut by bad comedy, like an unfortunate fistfight in a factory where assailants are dumped on conveyor lines and turned into boxes. A fight in Stacey's house does manage to amuse and capture some of the old Bond spirit, and the finale on a blimp atop the Golden Gate Bridge is actually rather terrific.Patrick Macnee is even on hand as a 007 helper, alas not long enough. The problem though is more about overstaying one's welcome. Moore looks bored and jaded, while Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny, in her 14th and last Bond film, appears more matronly than ever dressed in an Easter bonnet to see Zorin at the Ascot horse races. Always good when MI6 has the secretaries helping with the field work.There are fun moments amid the stupidity and chaos of View To A Kill. It's not as terrible as Die Another Day, anyway.

The plot and script were chaotic and pretentious, and the acting by most main characters was just sad. Christopher Walken plays... well, Christopher Walken. Another top-ranked actor who always seems to be the same in every movie- not much acting required, apparently. Grace Jones plays the same character she plays in Conan the Destroyer. Moore's face-lifts are more noticeable and even the expected Bond Girls are less glamorous (though Tanya Roberts is cute enough) and less talented acting-wise. The expected chase scenes, explosions, mad-man's plot for massive destruction are all there, and all so tired and empty this time around. Some may enjoy the cookie-cutter formulaic stuff, but it just all seems so lost here. This is the one movie that should have been recalled/delayed/changed... etc. The plot involves microchip guru Max Zorin (Walken) who is actually the product of Nazi genetic experimentation to make a super-human. Zorin's microchip deals come into question when Bond, in the pre-titles sequence, discovers a Zorin microchip in Siberia. This microchip is impervious to electro-magnetic pulses (like after Atomic Bombs), unlike regular microchips. Bond's investigations into Zorin's activities find that he is an ex-KGB agent and out to corner the Microchip world by destroying Silicon Valley. It also steals some plot devices from the first Superman movie- done even more sadly here. The fact that the plot deals with microchip technology (in 1985) lends some to say how topical it is, or even ahead of its time, but at the time it seemed predictable and dry,and has only worsened over the years.

Given that Geologists aren't exactly millionaires and often work unknown and unnoticed, you wonder how many would turn down a five million dollar cheque.The film is a sprawling mess. Max Zorin (nice turn by Walken) wants to destroy Silicon Valley to push his own computer agenda, but he's part of a German super-soldier program and heralding a horse steroid program while being tracked by a Russian spy (Zorin is Russian?) and May Day is his amazon in the bodyguard role. Jenni Flex gets a passing giggle as a horse trainer and so do a few other things, but overall the film never has the staying power of other Bond titles. You feel Bond is too old to be cavorting with Roberts and that this is a swan song of sorts.Now, A View to a Kill has its moments. May Day dispatching a reluctant investor from the blimp is great, as is the final showdown over the Golden Gate Bridge. Walken's slimy psychosis is passable. Overall though this is a stale Bond movie, showing itself badly in need of a reboot with some fresh ideas and actors. See this to complete your James Bond collection, but don't put it at the front of the list.

When this film was made, Moore was 57 years old, making him by far the oldest actor to have ever played the role. Moore was simply too old for the action scenes &#x96; I think that he was only seen during the close-ups! &#x96; and looked rather like a dirty old man in the romantic scenes. However, he was still as relentlessly charming as ever. I'd have perhaps been able to overlook the problems as regards Moore's age if it had been a good film. While it had a few nice moments in its first half, particularly at Zorin's estate, it turned out to be the worst film since The Man with the Golden Gun, providing a very poor final outing for a very, very good Bond. Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is simply the worst Bond girl to date. Her delivery of dialogue is simply terrible, never more so than when she has to use technical geological terms. The character is almost like a parody of a Bond girl, given that she has little to no personality and seems to do nothing but hang from things, say Oh, James! and screech at the top of her lungs. The fact that Roberts was only 29 didn't do Moore any favours either. Reportedly, he decided to leave the role when he learned that her mother was younger than him! Much like Christopher Lee in The Man with the Golden Gun, Christopher Walken delivers a highly entertaining, charismatic performance in a poor film. In spite of that film's many and obvious failings, Francisco Scaramanga was a classic Bond villain and Max Zorin would have been, had his character not been a rather generic psychopath commonly seen in American films of the era. His backstory as the child of a woman in a concentration camp who developed superior abilities due to the experiments performed on her by a Nazi scientist is akin to something that you'd find in a comic book or The X-Files rather than a Bond film. Not to mention the fact that it's in rather poor taste. His horse racing scheme was actually rather clever but, in spite of the fact that it would have involved killing hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, his plot to destroy Silicon Valley and most of San Francisco with it isn't very exciting. The scene in which he sprays bullets at dozens of his employees for fun didn't really fit into the Bond universe very well. Grace Jones is very good as May Day but she is wasted in a role which had so much potential. I hated May Day's switching sides towards the end of the film. I'd have thought that they'd have learned their lesson about that with Jaws in Moonraker, though at least it was nowhere near that cheesy.In his second appearance as M, Robert Brown is still too soft and too nice. In her fourteenth and final appearance as Miss Moneypenny, Lois is as charming as ever and I liked the fact that we got to see Moneypenny on a rare field assignment, though admittedly a fairly sedate one. Although the customary Bond-Moneypenny banter was absent for much of the Roger Moore era, Lois Maxwell was never anything less than highly entertaining in all fourteen films and I will sorely miss her presence in future Bond films. Desmond Llewelyn has less screen time as Q than in Octopussy but he is nevertheless wonderful as the character that he had been playing for 22 years by this point. Geoffrey Keen and Walter Gotell are as good as ever as the increasingly inept Sir Frederick Gray and the still as sharp as ever General Gogol respectively. Among the other supporting actors, the only one who really stands out is Patrick Macnee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a great character played wonderfully by a highly skilled actor. He has great chemistry with Moore and his (rather implausible) death is a shame as I'd have liked to have seen him in future Bond films. Patrick Bauchau gets nothing interesting to do as Scarpine, who has no distinguishing characteristics whatsoever. Willoughby Gray is horribly, horribly over the top as Dr. Carl Mortner, the most clich√©d character imaginable a German mad scientist with a silly accent and a monocle. He belongs in a sitcom, not a Bond film. It was nice to see David Yip and Daniel Benzali but they don't have much to do, only appearing in the film in order to be murdered. Fiona Fullerton makes a very good impression as Pola Ivanova, whom I wish had been given more screen time. At 18, Alison Doody is the youngest ever Bond girl and likewise makes a strong impression in spite of the fact that she has hardly any dialogue in the film.Except for a few moments in the climax with the blimp and the Golden Gate Bridge, the action scenes were oddly uninvolving and at times quite boring. Paris and San Francisco are both lovely cities but they lack the exotic nature of most Bond locations such as Japan, India, the Alps, etc. They're rather low key settings in comparison, much like Las Vegas in Diamonds are Forever. The Duran Duran title song was quite good on its own merits but I don't think that it was really a Bond film song. None of the rest of the music made any impact on me, I'm afraid.Overall, this is a deeply mediocre and disappointing end to Roger Moore's generally very impressive and enjoyable tenure as Bond. He deserved better and so did we. This is a very poor, listless and uninspired film but I didn't hate it. I merely strongly disliked it. It was extremely...meh with some truly awful moments but I still think that The Man with the Golden Gun was much worse.

A View to a Kill is a very lame excuse for a Bond film because it doesn't modify to fit Moore's age. It still treats him like a young and macho boy when he should be reading a bedtime story to Tanya Roberts.Well the story is at least interesting this time. We have an 80s version of Goldfinger, where microchip tycoon Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken of all actors; for me this is good) seeks to destroy California's Silicon Valley and create a monopoly on his chips. Oh did I mention he's a wackjob created in a test tube by a Nazi scientist and trained by the KGB. This guy is completely gone, but he's so damn interesting we have to believe this can happen.In an interesting change of scenery (I am biased because I live in the latter) the major scenes and climax happen in and around both Paris and San Francisco. S.F. leads to a great car chase through the city with a fire truck and eventually the final battle between Zorin and Bond on the wires of the Golden Gate Bridge.Well onto the parts that make me cringe and want to cover my ears in pain. I have mentioned Roger Moore so what else is there. May Day (played by the ugly as I'll ever get out Grace Jones) is just wrong. Really, she's... just... wrong. Tanya Roberts is another girl who as stuck in to look pretty and fawn over James, even she is not good looking. She's also like 30 years younger than Moore so that comes off as awful and creepy. And some of the story, like many since OHMSS, contains quite a lot of filler as I guess they realized their stories and characters were becoming less and less interesting.I can watch A View to a Kill, but only slightly, as this is one of the few times I have viewed it in my life to tell you all about this. Be afraid my readers, be very very afraid.So Roger Moore goes off on the biggest whimper of the series, and is replaced by Timothy Dalton for the next adventure, The Living Daylights.

"},{"Title":"Moore's last film is far from his best (SPOILERS)","Date":"1 January 2005","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Seemingly from the start of production, the 14th James Bond adventure, A View To A Kill, was destined to fail. Roger Moore, playing Bond for the seventh time, was almost in his sixties; the script was a poor rehash of Goldfinger; and during filming, the infamous 007 Stage burned to the ground. Ever since it's theatrical release, AVTAK has been slammed mercilessly by most Bond fans, being seen as one of the worst examples of Ian Fleming's secret agent. In reality, while the cons outweigh the pros, there are some individual aspects that work on their own and nearly keep the film afloat. The single worst thing about the movie is that's it's boring. This can be contributed to John Glen's workmanlike direction, which doesn't show any signs of enthusiasm. The flow is sluggish and the poor screenplay moves forward only to take up the 130 minute running length. And it's not only Glen who's disinterested; nearly the whole crew seems to be suffering from burnout, from Peter Lamont's lackluster set design, to weak cinematography, to a cast that looks like it should be collecting its pension. Like most of the Bond films of the 1980's, A View To A Kill took it's name from a short story by Ian Fleming. Unlike others, however, that's all that was kept and Fleming's plot about ambushed dispatch drivers was ditched in favour for a more modern storyline. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) has come up with a scheme to monopolize the world's microchips by detonating a bomb on the San Andreas Fault line, which would flood Silicon Valley, the chief exporter of computer chips. Bond is sent in to stop him at all costs. That's it. Pretty under-whelming, huh? Not only is this boring, but it blatantly copies the plots of Goldfinger, and 1978's Superman. On top of that, the reasoning for the plan doesn't make a lot of sense. Destroying Silicon Valley wouldn't wipe out microchips for good; Zorin would definitely prosper from the chaos, but that would be short-lived. To get to this point, however, you would have to endure a plodding pace that doesn't seem to ever get anywhere. Add at least two useless sub-plots (horses on steroids and something about polluting San Francisco Bay) and you got yourself a guaranteed snoozer.The cast is unremarkable and as I mentioned earlier, way too old. The only two who have any spark are Walken and Patrick Macnee as Bond's ally, Tibbett. Macnee plays the role with sufficient humor and his fate is one of the better-handled aspects of the film while Walken infuses Zorin with an energy that's absent from the rest of the film. The scene where he guns down a group of miners while laughingly hysterically immediately puts him in the top-tier of Bond villains and, of course, the usual Walken ticks are present (except he doesn't sing or dance). The only problem I have with Zorin is that he comes up with what could be described as the dumbest ways to try to kill Bond, but that's the fault of the screenwriters, not Walken. Then we have a trio of actors who are possibly the worst leads in a Bond film Sir Roger, Tanya Roberts as Stacy Sutton, and Grace Jones as May Day. Moore, having seen better days with For Your Eyes Only is completely unbelievable as a secret agent. While he's still a bit too old in Octopussy, at least in that film he puts some effort into the role and his recasting spared us James Brolin. Meanwhile, Stacy Sutton is a shrill and frankly dumb character (case in point a blimp sneaks up on her) and Roberts does the character no service by putting in a performance that doesn't once convince us that she's a geologist. Finally, Grace Jones isn't exactly an attractive woman and the fact that she sleeps with Bond is enough to give anyone a chill down their spine. AVTAK would also be Lois Maxwell's last film as Miss Monneypenny and it proves that a 57-year-old Bond shouldn't be flirting with a 58-year-old secretary!The film is also almost completely deficient in any decent action sequences. Most of the film is spent developing the plot and when the action does come, Glen is unable to make it work. The worst offender in the fire truck chase; it contains pathetic gags similar to Moonraker, obvious shots of stunt men, and a stupid sheriff in the vein of J. W. Pepper, yet it's still boring. There's also an uninspired opening ski chase that tries to replicate The Spy Who Loved Me with little success. That sequence is topped off with the absolute worst use of a song in the Bond franchise. About the only scene worth mentioning is the finale, not because the movie's coming to an end, but because it's inspired and looks real.With the overall blandness of the film, it's surprising to see some positives pop up once in a while. John Barry's great score is easily the best thing about the whole movie. Barry comes up with a rich variety of cues and uses Duran Duran's lively song to fantastic effect. There's also a refreshing attempt at some realism (perhaps that's why the locations are fairly dull) and the stunts are up to usual Bond standard.Unfortunately, the final verdict on AVTAK is that it's a completely misguided Bond film. Veering from forced seriousness to slapstick, it put doubt in most people's minds if James Bond was even necessary anymore. If Moore had stopped after Octopussy, I feel it would've been the only time in the series when history wouldn't have been drastically altered (in terms of actor changes) and Timothy Dalton probably would've gotten a longer tenure. Tolerable if you're in the right mood, but the negatives eventually sink the production and prevent it from regaining the little momentum that it had in the first place. 4.5/10 "},{"Title":"A bit feeble","Date":"18 June 2011","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Roger Moore's final outing as James Bond provides compelling evidence of why his Bond was the weakest of all of them - he is simply never convincing as a deadly opponent he offers a threatening warning, and it's like being threatened by a bunny (by which I mean a widdle wabbit, not one of the girls who workd at the Playboy Club).Christopher Walken, normally so reliable as a villain, whether cold and sinister or giggly and psychotic, does no more than phone it in.

Going into this film I had heard many call it the worst of Moore's Bond films but I think that's a tad bit strong as this is no where near as bad as MOONRAKER for example. I do think the film is a disappointment because it could have been so much better but as it stands it's a decent entry in the series. I also can't say I agree with those who said Moore was too old in the role. I think he played the part just fine, although you could tell at times that the fight sequences seemed to be scaled back. I'm not sure if this was done because of the actor's age or if they were just poorly shot. I think they could have been poorly shot because the film does feature some pretty questionable directorial choices. One strange thing happens during a pretty good opening sequence and that's The Beach Boys song being played over it. I'm really not sure what they were thinking with this thing and it gets somewhat worse later in the picture when a dimwitted cop keeps getting screen time. I also don't understand the casting of Tanya Roberts as she turns out to be the worst Bond girl to date. Grace Jones is, strange, to say the least. The real disappointment is that they didn't do more with Walken. He's somewhat fun in the film but as a villain his character is one of the weakest in the series. It's too bad they didn't let the actor go all out. As for Moore, again, I think he's just fine here. The action scenes are all very hit and miss and there's no question that the film goes on way too long.

There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't even be subtle when trashing it. There were rumours of severe budget cuts throughout the production of A View to a Kill, and after seeing the movie I would have to guess that the rumours were absolutely correct. We see a camera reflected on the rear of a fire truck and on the windshield of a car pushed into a lake and the 'May Day' who explodes with the bomb is very obviously a dummy. This is the sort of botched stunt we would expect to see in the early 60s, not in the mid 80s! The action is snail paced and totally uninteresting, the chase scene on the fire truck seemed horribly out of place, as did the inclusion of a Beach Boys song during a snowmobile chase (this was funny for all the wrong reasons) and the love plot is completely screwed up thanks to Tanya Rogers. Why oh why would they cast her? There are many other pretty actresses who can at least PRETEND to act. Rogers squeals like a stuck pig throughout the movie, and spends the rest of the time being enormously clumsy. She proves to be easily the least convincing Bond woman next to Britt Eckland, who I can never forgive for messing up The Man with the Golden Gun. Scriptwise, all the writing is pathetic, to say the least, with the exception of a couple of good lines given to Zorin. Bond's 'Bond-isms' seem to be a last minute rewrite, and they come off as glaringly obvious, and just plain stupid. To add insult to injury, Q spends the entire movie playing with a ridiculous little robotic dog thing, which is apparently supposed to be a surveillance device, despite the fact that it is large, loud and conspicuous. Honestly guys! Don't drag Q into the stupidity!Speaking of budget cuts, the quality of this movie is so poor that they don't even seem to be able to afford an original plot. The one used is an obscenely obvious remake of Goldfinger, with billionaire Tycoon Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) trying to rule the world's supply of microchips by destroying Silicon Valley. Sound familiar? Now why would that be? Oh yes! It's because it's exactly what Auric Goldfinger did in his namesake film, except using gold instead of microchips, and Fort Knox in the place of Silicon Valley. While Goldfinger's plan to turn all the gold in Fort Knox radioactive sounded almost possible, Zorin's flooding of Silicon Valley comes off sounding rather lame and ludicrous.Continuing my 'Obvious Goldfinger takeoffs', I note that there is still a tycoon who will 'have no part' in the mastermind's plan, a psychotic and downright scary henchman, (this time it's Grace Jones instead of a 300 pound Korean wrestler, the difference being she has no razor tipped bowler hat) the villain double-crosses all his lackeys and kills them all, and...what? You've lost interest? OK, then I'll move on.It was nice to see Patrick Macnee as Bond's temporary assistant, even if he was denied the screen time he deserves, the Duran Duran title song was nothing less than excellent, and Roger Moore proves yet again that no one can be more suave than him. Grace Jones was very scary and memorable as May Day, there's no denying that, and Christopher Walken is finally given the chance to do what he does best and go totally homicidal with a machine gun, and later a fire axe. Sadly, he falls to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge and ends any semblance of quality in the movie. It's just a shame that before the end fight scene he's given pretty much nothing to do, and seems to be fervently wishing he was somewhere else. (understandable he could see how the movie was going to turn out) What irked me about his character was that he was supposed to be a French industrialist, yet he had a very openly American accent. That isn't too bothersome, though, considering all the other problems with the movie. What a shame. I can't even say that the movie had the potential to be great, because I would feel that I was lying. Much like Zorin's blimp, this movie was doomed from when it was first revealed, and not even including Christopher Walken and Patrick Macnee could save it. It's a shame Moore had to leave the series on such a bad note.-3.5/10  "}{"Title":"This is the worst Bond film to date.

The real tragedy here is that this could and should have been a classy film to add to the Bond franchise. This could have been the best of Moore's entries, if only it hadn't handled the plot so clumsily. As plots go, this had a brilliant basic plot in industrial espionage, that descends into a total joke because of the obsession of with turning some scenes into so called 'light-hearted' entertainment. We start in Siberia, where Bond has been sent to recover a stolen microchip. After an impressive chase (ruined by the adding of 'Beach Boys' at the most crucial moment), Bond finds himself on the trail of industrialist Max Zorin, who is a billionaire tycoon, financed by the KGB. However, Zorin has gone rogue, and has a plan on his own to detonate a nuclear bomb on the San Andreas fault, causing a massive earthquake that would wipe out Silicone Valley and leave him in control of the microchip market. It's a dreadful shame that this film throws away a brilliant plot in favour of a totally cartoonish production. Mircroships were the big thing when this film came out, and had the film focused more on the industrial espionage angle between the capitalist west and the communist east, this would have made for a stronger film throughout. However, they tried to give Zorin a more super-villain feel (even though he didn't need it), and the plot loses it when we learn that Zorin wants to destroy Silicone Valley. It's just not remotely believable, and handled poorly. We also have to put up with the worst Bond girl in Tanya Roberts Stacey Sutton, who spends all her time screaming and getting in the way. A pointless character, not acted well, not written well, adds nothing to the film. In its defence, A View to a Kill has some stunning actions sequences. The Eiffel Tower scene is brilliant, the scenes at Zorin's house are brilliant, and the finale on the Golden Gate Bridge is the best finale in a Moore film, and one of the best in any Bond film. But these aren't't enough to off-set the damage done by the Beach Boys song, the cartoonish car chase, and the massacre scene in which Zorin manages to kill hundreds of miners with one Uzi, and one clip. Even Christopher Walken, who I think makes a cracking Bond villain in Max Zorin, can't make haul this up further than average. Average at 5/10. Good in points, bad in points.

What bothers me most is its constantly dopey attitude always after the cheap gag or bad punchline, it thankfully stops just short of implementing a rimshot or laugh track. It's not like puns and cracks are strangers to the franchise - in fact, that's always been a part of their charm - but there's a point in the middle of Moore's run where the balance tipped and Bond's audience-aimed winks became more important than his spy work and lady-wrangling. View to a Kill also suffers from a distinct shortage of gadgetry, which makes it feel more generic and even less like a Bond adventure. Moore looks positively ancient in many scenes - a 57-year-old man nailing stunts and ladies that would stretch the imagination for a star half his age - and Walken is an appropriately maniacal if not particularly imaginative foil. A drizzling farewell that left me wishing the franchise had moved on to greener pastures much earlier.

Roger Moore, now in his mid-50s, had tied with noted predecessor Sean Connery in doing six Bond films for EON productions. Moore though would do a seventh, and film, Bond film at the age of 56, 1985's A View To A Kill. In fact, it's thankful that it was him and not a new actor playing the role. If that had been the case, Bond might well have come to an end in the mid-1980s thanks to the worst film of the series.Looking at the film, it's clear that Moore was well past his prime in this film. Moore would seem to have aged quite a bit in the couple of years between making Octopussy and this film. He looks much older and not in a good way like when Connery returned to the role in Never Say Never Again. Moore looks laughably out of place as Bond be it in the action scenes (where he isn't clearly being doubled that is) but especially in scenes with his much younger female costars. It also doesn't help that Moore's performance is little more than the actor effectively sleep walking through the film, with little or no emotion present throughout. This is Moore at his worst as Bond.The film's cast doesn't improve from there sadly. After a series of stronger female characters, Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is nothing short of a letdown. The character is a damsel in distress, who can do little more than scream and shout James! every so often. The character is poorly written and the performance of Tanya Roberts does the character no favors either as she goes for over the top every chance she gets. What we're left with is another worst worst Bond girl of the series.Over the top doesn't begin to describe the film's villain Max Zorin played by Christopher Walken. Walken doesn't seem to take the role seriously at all from the moment he appears on the screen to the moment he thankfully exits the film. Walken plays Zorin with zero menace and instead plays up the insanity of the character by laughing manically almost every time he appears on screen. This was presumably for dramatic effect but instead makes the character utterly laughable and ridiculous. The result is a villain who is never threatening and a waste of an actor's talents.The supporting cast is mixed as well. Grace Jones as henchwoman May Day is even more over the top than Walken's Zorin with the result of being more annoying than threatening. The character is further ruined by a plot twist late in the film stolen out of an earlier Bond film (more on that later). Other villainous characters such as Patrick Bauchau's Scarpine and Willoughby Gray as a former Nazi scientist are little more than clich√©s on legs throughout. Other members of the supporting cast fare better though. Patrick Macnee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett gives what is perhaps the best performance in the entire film even though his character is all too often played for laughs. Also of mention is Lois Maxwell who plays Miss Moneypenny for the last time. Maxwell, like Moore, is well past her prime in the role but her exit from the series does little to mark her more than two decade long contribution to the series. The supporting cast is mixed though it does serve the film well in places.Moving into the production values, the film's other faults come into focus. The film's action sequences are played for laughs such as the snowbound teaser sequence (ruined by the use of a Beach Boys song) to the car chasing parachutist in Paris (further ruined by very, very obvious doubling of Moore) and most obviously in the fire truck chase through San Francisco. Other action sequences come across as uninspired, especially in the fight scenes at the Sutton house and the climatic fight on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. There is also increasingly obvious doubling of Moore in every single one of these sequences which detracts from the film itself and believability in its star. That isn't where the film is hurt the most however.Nothing lets the film down more than its script. The script does little more than rip off previous Bond films in a vain attempt to create something original. In particular, Goldfinger is effectively pillaged. There are horses, there's a plan to destroy a sizable chunk of the economic wealth (Fort Knox's gold in the previous film, Silicon Valley and its microchips here) to make the villains stockpile of said material all the more profitable, a last minute change of heart by a woman connected to the villain which derails the plan and an underwhelming final climatic fight between Bond and the main villain. For that matter, there are scenes in the film which seem ripped out of Goldfinger with a few changes to dialogue. The film's plot also unfolds with too much coincidence and ease and the dialogue is cringe worthy throughout. The result is the worst Bond script yet written.There is only one word to describe A View To A Kill. That word is uninspired. Worse than being uninspired though, is another fact about the film that is the worst of the series. From an over the hill 007 to poor casting, a returned emphasis on humor and a script that did little more than rip-off the previous triumphs of the series, the film feels like a parody of the series rather than being a proper film. If not a self- parody then perhaps it is a film that steals from the past to create a film that merely goes through the motions of a formula. The result is a disaster and a clear mandate for a new Bond to take charge.

The basic plot is essentially the same as the one previously used in Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me and¬†Moonraker, the one about the megalomaniac business tycoon with ambitions of world domination. (This plot was later to be recycled in two Bonds from the Pierce Brosnan era, Tomorrow Never Dies and¬†Die Another Day). The villain in this case is the billionaire industrialist Max Zorin, who plans to destroy California's¬†Silicon Valley by setting off a gigantic earthquake. (His motive is that this would give his European-based company a virtual monopoly of the world microchip¬†market). The film is often regarded as one of the¬†weakest of the James Bond series. Even its star Roger Moore is said to have disliked it, which is ironic given that it was Moore's own performance which has been the source of much of the criticism. Ian Fleming seems to have envisaged Bond as being in his mid-thirties, but Moore (46 when he took over the role in 1973) was 58 in this film, and seems far too old to be playing an active MI6¬†field agent. He always played Bond in a rather lighter, more humorous way than his predecessor Sean Connery, but here he finally topples over into self-parody, putting very little effort into his acting and relying entirely upon his standard repertoire of witty quips and raised eyebrows as his sole means of conveying emotion. Moore's acting, however, is not the only bad thing about the film. Indeed, it is probably not even the worst thing. The structure of the film is deficient; too much of it (indeed, the entire first half, set in France) is taken up with a horse-racing sub-plot in which it appears that Zorin's main crime is doping his horses. It is only when the action moves to California that we discover what the villain's real design is. It is normally a bad sign when Bond producers feel the need to confer some academic qualification upon the main female character in order to make her seem less of a bimbo; think of Lois Chiles's boring astrophysicist Holly Goodhead (aka Airhead) in Moonraker, or the inept Denise Richards's performance as the oddly named scientist Christmas Jones in The World is Not Enough. Here we are supposed to accept that Tanya Roberts's character Stacey Sutton is a qualified geologist, but whenever she has to say something on the subject of geology it is all too obvious that she has little idea what she is talking about. Not that she is any more convincing talking about anything else. Tanya was always an actress who relied more on looks than on talent, as she showed in her contributions to the Charlie's Angels series, and while she is not quite as awesomely bad here as she had been the previous year in Sheena Queen of the Jungle, she certainly deserved her second Worst Actress Razzie nomination in as many years. So is Tanya the worst ever Bond Girl? There is plenty of competition for that particular title, but¬†actually she is not even the worst Bond Girl in A View to a Kill. Grace Jones, in my book probably the strongest contender for the worst ever title, gives a singularly wooden performance as Zorin's bodyguard¬†and sidekick May Day, and unlike Roberts, Chiles, Richards, Barbara Bach and other below-par Bond Girls she does not even have looks to rely on. Christopher Walken can be good when playing unsympathetic characters, so it was a disappointment that his Zorin makes such a bloodless villain. All Bond villains are evil, but at least with the likes of Gert Froebe's Goldfinger, Donald Pleasence's Blofeld, Christopher Lee's Scaramanga or Michael Lonsdale's Drax we get a good idea of the passions which motivate their villainy. With Zorin we get nothing but a cold-blooded psychopathy. Zorin and May Day are supposed to be lovers as well as partners in crime- indeed, she turns on him after discovering that he has betrayed her- so it is a pity that there is so little chemistry between the two actors. It is also a pity that a larger role could not have been found for the lovely Fiona Fullerton. The previously obscure actor Robert Brown¬†never really made the role of M his own in the way that his predecessor Bernard Lee did, but there are good contributions from two other regular faces, Lois Maxwell¬†in her last appearance as¬†Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn¬†as¬†Q. Other positive features include Duran Duran's¬†theme song and a couple of good suspense sequences, that car chase through the streets of San Francisco with Bond and Stacey in a fire engine and the final cliff-hanger aboard the airship and on the¬†Golden Gate Bridge. Overall, however, I would agree with those who regard this as a sub- standard contribution to the series. Indeed, when it first came out I would have rated it as the worst Bond since George Lazenby's disastrous contribution in OHMSS. (Since 1985 Licence to Kill¬†and¬†Quantum of Solace have joined them as possible candidates for the title worst ever Bond). A View to a Kill was certainly the weakest entry during the Moore era. After it came out there could be no denying that it was time for a change. Whether Timothy Dalton was a change in the right direction is another matter. 5/10 "}{"Title":"The worst of the Bond series","Date":"13 November 2002","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  This is the worst of the Bond series making Moonraker look like From Russia with Love.

Bond does so, as is expected, and upon finding it hidden in a pendulum the guy wore around his neck, tosses aside the picture of his wife and child for the real reason Roger Moore's hero is even there. Such an action epitomises this edition, the film that signalled the end of Moore's seven film tenure and around about the peak period of Glen's tenure at the helm appears as a whole lot more interested in casually placing to the side the heartfelt and humane characteristics of the predicament for business as usual, business encapsulated by that chip. Following this, there is a brief skirmish during which Bond manages to find his way back to an Allied rendez-vous point through snow and ice, via canted angles out of the sun that come complete with lens flare as he snowboards over ridges to The Beach Boys, before getting out of dodge in the company of one of MI6's more luscious-looking Navy employees.The opening encapsulates the fact that the film is a bit of a cartoon, a weak comic book adventure with the odd glowing moment. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't some fun to be had out of some of the film's second unit work - the often pumping Barry score, which combines old fashioned orchestral bursts with then-contemporary discharges of electric guitar, is often good value and the narrative is a lot easier to keep up when compared to some of Moore's previous entries. It is, however, mostly disappointing &#x96; the moment the film arrives in San Fransisco and laments upon us the J.W. Pepper of The Sunshine State in Joe Flood's SFPD police Captain, plus badly executed comedic cop car chase, the moment it shoots its bolt and misses.Things kick off in earnest when Bond makes it back to London following the opening only to be greeted by some laborious exposition on the situation. Following this, everybody darts off to the races - a sequence allowing a certain Max Zorin (Walken) to be introduced via another avalanche of exposition and firmly reiterating we're not anywhere near the domains of something like 1976's Marathon Man, which took time and effort in creating a character behind Olivier's villain through its props and setting and such. It is revealed Zorin is heavier into the world of horse racing than most; a billionaire businessman, and after some brief romping around on the Continent, Bond heads to his remote agricultural domain of well dressed patrons and racing studs in order to infiltrate and deduce whilst under the guise of a wealthy Englishman (complete with indelible alias) to investigate.Armed with a side-kick named Tibbett (Macnee), Bond uncovers a sordid plot to do with the scientific experimentation on horses that allows them to win most races they enter; if we didn't already feel those throngs of mistrust and menace about Walken's character, the fact he abuses animals ought to be enough to pine to a side of the audience which sways them into somewhat despising him. At the festivities, and as Bond's guise of cover begins to come under threat, we observe separate fight scenes instigated by both Moore's character, which he wins easily, and that of his adversary Zorin whose aggressive girlfriend May Day (Jones) is beaten in man-to-man combat alluding to a common, equal combative link. As is often the case, something Bond investigates, which is seemingly small and features an eccentric tycoon up to no good, expands into something a lot larger. Here, Zorin's plan is dealt out to cohorts and the audience alike in a fashion akin to the villain of Goldfinger in the film entitled as such as a room full of business partners get the low down away from one lone individual's request to be cut adrift, a lone individual who is expansively eliminated. The plan is more broadly linked to flooding a stretch of Earth which he believes will eliminate cooperate opposition.Mixed in is a reasonably fun sub-plot to do with Zorin having turned his back on the KGB, of whom created him and nurtured him out of certain sordid scientific backgrounds echoing that of what he does to his race horses. Their own war that they wage on him offers some meek support to Bond fumbling through the motions and this plot reaches a bit of a crescendo when our hero steals some vital information on the case from a Russian agent equivalent of whom he recognises from some years back, but we are not even granted the trivial thrill of it being someone along the lines of Barbara Bach's Soviet agent from The Spy Who Love Me, which it could so easily and realistically been. Popping up is Tanya Roberts' Stacey Sutton and her subplot revolving around Zorin, a Californian native playing Bond's screaming blonde damsel to Zorin's dominatrix May Day; a woman who's strong and independent in the male dominated working zones of America's West Coast but struggles in the department of hard bodiedness when faced with taking Zorin down physically - a character desperately needing some of the vitality expressed by For Your Eyes Only's Melina Havelock. The film is not without its fair share of engagement but lacks an overall sense of competence; it is interesting, in hindsight and having seen Moore's Bond films afresh, that those which focused on Cold War elements are the better ones, with excursions off to stop cooperate billionaires and outcasts making a nuisance of things al√° Moonraker or The Man With the Golden Gun falling a little flat. Here is another, a flakey and flimsy adventure rounding off a sporadically successful stretch for Moore and the series as a whole.

But it also makes for one of the weakest Bond films ever (especially after the dynamic goings-on in 1983's Octopussy).  The story itself is no great shakes; bad guy Zorin (Walken) wants to wipe out Silicon Valley and make himself the worldwide supplier of computer micro-chips (I think; if nothing else, the screenplay is a mess of information that makes 1040 forms look relatively simple).

Moore is rather embarrassing in this one, looking like someone's grandfather, not the debonair hero he started out to be. He tries, though; but he isn't aided by a script produced via committee and a very weak female lead in Tanya Roberts.The plot is rather convoluted and silly. A product of eugenics is trying to destroy Silicon Valley to drive up the value of his own microchips.

I think we could have come up with a better motivation for our psycho to play to Walken's strengths. Grace Jones would have been fine if she hadn't been given lines. A female bodyguard/henchperson is a nice idea, but she can't deliver a single line without sounding like she's in a bad high school production. Tanya Roberts is another who just isn't up to the level that Bond should require. Poor Patrick McNee is wasted in little more than a cameo, when he could have done so much more. If you are going to have John Steed with James Bond, take advantage of it! The stunts descend into further silliness, though at least we don't have any Tarzan yells, and the battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge is pretty good. Really, the problems, aside from the aging lead and miscast ladies, is a mediocre script.This just feels like a bunch of ideas were thrown into a pot and then drawn out and pasted into a script, whether it made sense or not. Part of the problem was that the filmmakers had run out of ideas for villains and situation that would require a James Bond to handle. Zorin would have made a more interesting assassin or a nihilist, out to create chaos and destruction. Walken certainly seems to enjoy playing his imbalanced side, so run with that. As it stands, he is the only thing that keeps you interested in the plot. The romantic angle falls flat, between bad acting from Roberts and the age difference. Bond looks like an old lech here, not a sophisticated ladies man. It was probably time to turn the franchise over back with Octopussy, but it definitely was here.In the end, it's not the worst film (Die Another Day has a firm lock on that, in my book) but it's definitely in the bottom few.
