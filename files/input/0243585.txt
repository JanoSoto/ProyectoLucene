[{"Title":"A Truly Nice Film","Date":"2 February 2006","Score":"20 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I liked this better than the original, and that''s a high compliment because I thought highly of the original film Stuart Little. As good as that was, I just thought this was even better.All the voice-overs are excellent with Nathan Lane having the best lines as Snowball, the cat. He was simply hilarious, line after line.The film once again features great colors, a virtual rainbow of them, especially with some of the inventive rooms in the Little house. The parents, once again, are super nice. It's a treat to watch Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie play an old- fashioned Leave It To Beaver-type couple. The film has no objectionable material and leaves you with a nice feeling. There are animated films or animated/real life combinations like this, that advertise family-friendly viewing but don't really deliver, instead sneaking in sexual innuendos and the like.Not here. This one is pure, morals-wise, except for one scene near the end when the mom (Geena Davis) tells Stuart and their son she's still proud of them even though they just got caught in a big lie. (Inferring that the lie was okay since everything turned out okay.) Other than that, nothing but good messages were heard and seen all around and this is a funny movie, to boot. Highly recommended for the family, and that's no clich√©.

Not that the actual plot of this followup to the original charmer is hard to take in itself (Stuart is starting to feel a bit left out, and when Margalo the wren literally drops into his life he gets a new dimension).In terms of technical levels it's only slightly easier to fault (Margalo looks a bit too cartoonish to be real, unlike Stuart Little himself and the falcon that's the movie's villain - but then again, Melanie Griffith the voice of Margalo always seems like a cartoon anyway), but the story by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and the movie's producer Douglas Wick is what makes this ultimately inferior to its predecessor; what helped drive Stuart Little was our hero's wish to be accepted by his human brother and by the cat - sneer all you want, but the family message was hard to ignore. For the sequel it's more standard - the friend who's acting out of ulterior motives at first but then turns out to be a real friend, etc. Stuart isn't so much the protagonist this time, and it hurts a little.So the freshness is reduced, but this still isn't stale - the charm and humour of the first movie remains, Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell (This better be important. Margalo is missing. I'd better be more specific - I meant important to ME.), and the human Littles remain just right - loving but not without making you want to slit your own throats. HBO Family has recently aired an animated version with all the principals except Hugh Laurie absent - it'll have to go a long way to live up to the two movies. (In-joke for score fans Alan Silvestri slips in a quote from his Back to the Future theme in the climax.)But I can see why this didn't do as well at the box-office as it should have - having a soccer match plus including Gilbert O'Sullivan AND Celine Dion on the soundtrack was asking for trouble...

I enjoyed it *that* much.","Date":"8 May 2010","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" As of present (May 2010), I have never read the E.B. White classic Stuart Little, however I have had the delightful privilege to see the two films based loosely upon its content. The first Stuart Little, released in 1999, was a very sweet and charming little family picture that I enjoyed immensely as a kid and still do to this day. I remember I also enjoyed the sequel, Stuart Little 2 when I was younger, but now having re-watched the film for the first time in a long time, I discover that a rare instance has occurred I enjoy the movie more now as an adult than I did when I was eleven. Perhaps it's because I now understand the adult humor and Snowbell's hilarious lines better, but overall, Stuart Little 2 is a very good picture.In the sequel, Stuart Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox) now has a quintessential relationship to his family. His human brother George has accepted him as a sibling and the cat Snowbell is now his pal instead of his enemy. However, poor Stuart feels a little left-out in the world because of his small size and his lack of real friends. That is until a little bird named Margolo (voiced by Melanie Griffith) literally drops into his life (from the sky), pursued by a vicious falcon. When they are clear of the evil bird's talons, Stuart and Margolo develop a very strong, very heart-warming friendship while teaching to the younger audience members very important lessons about life and friendship.Those messages were communicated to be very well when I was younger and they still are today. I'm not exactly sure why I like Stuart Little 2 more as an adult than I did as a kid, but maybe it's because I can understand the full extent of it. The filmmakers made the right choice to film it as a family picture, incorporating elements that children can understand but leaving in great moments of comedy to keep the adults interested. More so than in the first one, the picture is kept upbeat by the hilarious presence of Snowbell the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane, who has one terrific one-liner after another. A favorite moment of mine is when Snowbell is serving as a tool so Stuart can speak into a payphone. Their time runs out and he asks Snowbell for more change. The cat looks at the mouse standing on his head and cackles out What do I look like? A fanny pack? Stuart Little 2 is a real treat to look at with some gorgeous cinematography and a deliberately over-painted New York City with everybody in the movie wearing extravagant outfits. The special effects used for Stuart, Margolo, Snowbell, the falcon, and the other animated characters in the film is very good, best exemplified by the eyes of Stuart and Margolo. Their eyes are solid black with no visible pupils, but the animators carefully manipulate the characters' expressions to mirror every emotion that could be asked for from a real-life performer.Perhaps the best element of Stuart Little 2 is the change of point-of-view from the first one. In the original film, most of the plot involved the Littles' difficulties in adopting a talking mouse as a child and a great portion of the film was people looking down upon little Stuart. Here, the story takes place on Stuart's level, from his point-of-view, and we come to associate and identify more with him this time around. I also really like Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis, and Jonathan Lipnicki as Stuart's adoptive family, who do a really good job at maintaining the illusion that they are communicating to a two-inch mouse adopted as their son and treating him with loving affection.But the best scenes are the scenes of Margolo and Stuart, particularly a little scene where they are on a date at a makeshift drive-in movie theater sitting in Stuart's model car in front of a television, watching Alfred Hitchcock's marvelous 1958 film Vertigo which we later learn is a poignant choice as there are some parallels in the relationship between Stuart and his avian companion.Stuart Little 2 is a wonderful family film. Some may question my judgment and wonder if I exaggerate just a little in shelling out my highest rating for this film. You may ask maybe it's good, but is it *that* good? Well, maybe not on some critical scales. But the way I review movies, dissecting and analyzing but more or less reporting how I personally responded, than no, not in the least. I enjoyed Stuart Little 2 so much, every little second of it was a gem for me, and I more than enthusiastically award it ten stars.

I thought those kinds of films only existed with the name Pixar stamped on them or the occasional Dreamworks. The film largely compiles odds and ends from the first film to try and lift the sequel off its feet but its sweet, good-natured charisma and kinetic warmth make the seventy-eight minute endeavor worth it.The Little family are still happy, vibrant, and warm in their quest to give their new mouse sibling, Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) a home he can be proud of. Yet the mother (Geena Davis) still worries that Stuart's small stature gives him the unfair advantage in sports and life itself, while the father (Hugh Laurie) is more of an optimist and feels that if a Little applies himself, he can be quite the character.The main themes Stuart Little 2 tries to explore, however, are not about doing anything you want to do and proving that being small isn't a limitation but a welcomed challenge, like the first film, but more about siblings that drift away from each other. Stuart's older brother, George (Jonathan Lipnicki) is beginning to spend more time with his friends rather than Stuart, and while this is a natural part of life, it is nonetheless heartbreaking to the mouse himself, who begins to view himself as just a pest (no pun intended).Stuart begins to befriend a small yellow canary named Margalo (Melanie Griffith), who he rescued after seeing her being pursued by an ominous falcon in the sky. It turns out, Margalo is in cahoots with the falcon to steal valuables from homes all across New York City, but little Margalo keeps that secret away from Stuart when she discovers how kind and gentle he really is.Stuart Little 2 isn't particularly compelling or a very life-affirming film, but it's a genial, warm picture, with great computer effects, wonderful yet subtle themes on sibling relationships, and a plethora of jokes that kids and adults will find pleasing and joyful.Starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki. Voiced by Michael J. Fox, Melanie Griffith, and Nathan Lane. Directed by Rob Minkoff.

The first movie succeeded in being sweet and charming without being the least bit sugary.  Alas, the sequel doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall (that little high, little low business is just a little gagging). Also, the plot is too predictable, although that probably won't matter much to children, who are, after all, the film's target audience.These are really minor quibbles, though.  Stuart 2 is a fine movie, both for kids and adults.  The special effects are well-done, all the actors do a good job in their roles, and the dialogue has some real gems.  Particularly noteworthy is Snowbell, the cat (voiced to hilarious perfection by Nathan Lane).  He gets all the best lines, and steals every scene he's in--he even upstages Stuart himself!

Of course the family Little (with Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and son George played by Jonathan Lipnicki) is looking for Stuart.A movie like this is allowed to be predictable. You know it will end happy and that is the way it should end. A movie like this needs some charming, sweet and funny moments and 'Stuart Little 2' has those moments. Every moment between Margalo the bird and Stuart is sweet and charming and especially the moments with the real characters are sometimes very funny. Another nice thing is the creation of the mouse and bird itself. Since Stuart or Margalo is in almost every scene in the movie there is always something nice to look at. This is a perfect movie for the whole family.

George has a new friend Will. Stuart tries to fix George's model plane, he gets an unintentional ride and wrecks it. George is not happy with Stuart and they grow apart. Then canary Margalo (Melanie Griffith) falls from the sky into Stuart's car. A falcon (James Woods) is chasing them. Margalo is hurt and she stays with the Littles. It turns out that Margalo and the falcon are in it together to rob the Littles. The falcon pushes Margalo to steal mother Little's ring and she flies away. Stuart and Snowbell (Nathan Lane) set off into the scarier parts of NYC to find her while George covers for them.This doesn't have the fun of discovery of this charming world where a little mouse is treated as any other boy. This starts off with a strained brotherhood between George and Stuart. That could have been a good subject to explore. Instead they introduce a cute canary and sets Stuart off on a different adventure. So instead of a deeper character relationship story, it's another children's adventure story. It's still good for the kids, but not much for everybody else. The short running time also points to the thin material they're working with in this one.

This film, in my opinion, took a steady improvement from the prequel. There's more action, excitement and wonder to it which is fantastic! The characters were all brilliant. Stuart and the bird are so adorable! Snowball the cat, well, from wanting to eat Stuart in the 1st movie, to being best friends in this sequel, I have to say it's all good. Also, I think the chemistry between them is really sweet because they embark on the adventure together, with no one else but them and there's a lot of friendship going on. Also it's great to see that Snowball always has Stuart's back like when the other cat in the restaurant wanted to eat him, he just stuck up for him.Stuart's personality has widened. He's not only the sweet and adorable mouse but in this movie, it shows his heroic instincts. This mainly approaches at the end of the movie, where re-fixes his old aeroplane and flies around New York to stop the Falcon and save Margalo. Which purifies his bravery and cleverness.In terms of animation-wise, it was good. Stuart and the bird looked believably realistic. However, my only negative point is The Falcon, who could have looked more in-this-world, it looked so computer-animated that it somewhat gave away it's evil instincts.Like I said, this sequel took a good improvement from the prequel. In this movie, there's a lot more plot and excitement to it, which scores on the fun factor. Stuart embarks on a mission to save his bird friend, Margalo meeting adventure along the way, I mean that's the sort of genre that keeps me on the edge of my seat.Overall, I would love to watch this movie again.

Children will love it because of its fantastical premise, while adults are drawn in by the innocence and charm of  Stuart Little and his adopted family and their pet cat. What's more, there is not one word of bad language uttered in the movie. The storyline is rather simplistic with Stuart Little, voiced by Back to the Future star Michael J. Fox, setting off across New York to rescue a bird friend Margalo (Melanie Griffith) from the clutches of the dreaded Falcon (Steve Zahn). Along for the ride is the Little's pet cat Snowbell (Nathan Lane) who, ironically, steals the show without even trying. It's also heartening that Michael J. Fox is still involved in movies despite being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease last decade. Director Rob Minkoff faultlessly mixes the actors playing the Little family with the animation bringing a real-life feel to the story, which is fun the whole way. MENSA queen Geena Davis plays Mrs Little while former Blackadder star Hugh Laurie wrangles an American accent as Mr Little. Stuart's older brother, George, is played by Jerry Maguire star Jonathan Lipnicki, whose fickleness gets Stuart into trouble. There are plenty of comic moments in the film, particularly those involving Stuart's radio controlled car, which he drives to school each day. His handling of George's remote controlled bi-plane is also a priceless scene with plenty of action and drama.

Because Stuart Little raked in buckets o' cash, the makers just had to forge ahead with a crappy sequel. My summary says it all the jokes are flat (my kids weren't even laughing; I didn't even crack a smile the entire 70-odd minutes) and the plot is hackneyed. The only character who is remotely interesting is James Woods as Falcon. Stuart Little 2 is very forgettable. Even though my kids conned me into buying the DVD, I'm hoping they let me sell it for them on ebay when they grow tired of it --- which I am sure will be very soon.

For some people it's spiders, but in my case, mice and rats scare the proverbial out of me.  That was until two years ago when a mouse by the name of Stuart made the biggest impact of any disease carrying animal since Mickey.  He stole a place in the heart of the masses.  Well, the little fella's back, and this time going through a bit of a teenage crisis.  Boys will be boys, and I suppose mice, mice - so there comes a time when impressing the fairer sex seems all important.  So when a mouse, brought up by humans, falls in love with a bird it should make for an interesting tale.  Unfortunately it doesn't.  Sure, Stuart is still incredibly cute, his love interest, Margalo, does have a certain nubile air about her and the villain, Falcon, is suitably evil, but the script gives them very little to work with.  The theatre packed full of youngsters (the best test of a family movie) were a good indication that Stuart Little 2 lacked the x factor that the first movie had.  While they didn't make endless journeys to the little boy's & girl's room, they didn't laugh that much either.  There were no ooohs and ahhhs of amazement.  As they left, there was no excited chatter.  Perhaps the biggest problem is that Stuart Little 2 is too cutesy pie, even for the littlies in the audience.  The jokes, which are far and few between, fall flat.   The first Stuart Little had more of an edge to it (thanks to a script by M. Night Shyalaman), and with kids growing up so fast these days needed it.  In its attempt to be an uplifting family movie, Stuart Little 2 has become over sanitised with the end result being a lack lustre sterile movie.  Now I have to say the computer generated characters are so life like it is hard to tell where reality begins and ends.  Every hair on Stuart's ears is a work of art, and he still has (thanks to Michael J Fox's voicing) a charmingly mischievous side to him.  Problem is, Stuart Little 2 is a little hi, little ho-hum.

They liked Spy Kids II better.  I liked this one better.The movie has a lot of suspense, but relatively little violence, which is good, from my point of view.  Very small children are going to find it too scary, but it was not at all too scary for kids the age of mine.The CG characters are fairly well-developed, as are the kids, but the human adults are somewhat cartoonish -- sort of an interesting turnabout. The mother is an especially intriguing caricature.  She is a traditional '50's type mother -- except that she wears incredibly tight clothes and swings her hips rather dramatically when she walks.  There is one bedroom scene, where the parents are fairly demurely dressed in pajamas, except that there is one -- again rather dramatic -- profile shot of the mother showing that her nightie is skin tight and that she has an exceptional, Playboy type figure.  I guess they have to put these things in so that fathers who bring their kids to movies won't complain too much.  This mom is an odd juxtaposition, saying all these staid, stay-at-home mom type things, but her body language and clothing are sending very slutty messages.  It was strange seeing this in a children's movie.By contrast, the Dad is a cartoonish, nerd, though a good father.The little boy is much more normal seeming, except that he acts older than his body looks.Basically, the human actors are just props, and the real action revolves around the CG characters Stuart, Margolo, and the hawk -- and the cat, who is possibly not CG, but at least has a CG mouth.  They seem real, while the people seem fake.The movie, despite the slightly odd mother, promotes traditional family values of love and acceptance.  I thought the best line in the movie was that of the little bird, that the Littles don't seem to have very much, just each other.  Of course, actually they have an exceptionally nice townhouse; but never mind the point is that they love and support each other and by acting together they can accomplish what none of them can accomplish separately and material possessions are not too important. The movie is very short.  You don't really feel like you've seen a whole movie.  Still it was nice.  I'm glad I went.

Maybe I liked ('Sixth Sense','Sign' director) M.Night Shamalyn's screenplay better than Bruce Joel Rubin.(No offense.)For the first half part, this movie was pretty disappointing. It was far from family any longer. It was all about Hollywood action-packed adventure movie. I kept yawning and whispering 'hey..this is gonna be bad~' Moreover, I don't like the way they used POP SONGs in here!! Why didn't they just use Alan Silvestri's scores? That'd be real moving; but Mandy Moore? Celine Dion? Hey I like those gals but please! Even the great song 'Alone again' sounded pretty lame for me.But after Stuart left for Margalow with Snowbell, then the fun began. You can't think of anything from there. It's really fun,funny,thrilling and touching also. (I won't give out any spoilers here.)Most of the credits and kudos to Michael J. Fox(Mom! Dad! I'm goin' in! & Save yourself!), James Woods(very scary,let me tell you! My cousine couldn't look at this hawk straight in the eye. Maybe too scary for the kids.), unbelievable Melanie Griffith! I never thought she would make that kinda job. Pretty satisfactory compared to her previous works.Lastly-Mr.Nathan Lane!! He's the man here. I strongly insist the producers should make 'Snowbell Little' out of this flick. Nathan Lane rocks! He inspires this little white cat into a human being! I will never forget his acting here. He is so~ natural. Of course, Steve Zahn also the greatest. Never let me down both of those guys.Trivia- I like that little Afro-American boy called Will(George's friend) as well.

Well as a matter of fact he didn't know what was waiting around the corner, let me rephrase that, falling from the sky. Yep a friend in waiting. Only that's what Stuart initially thought. What he didn't know was his new friend, a lady bird named Margalo, was sent by her accomplice Falcon who wanted to infiltrate the Little home, and acquire information on their goods and belongings. Only it was evident to Margalo that this was more than a house, it was a home. After reluctantly embezzling Mrs. Little's precious wedding ring, Stuart endangers himself trying to find it in the sink. Margalo soon realizes she is doing damage to this prim and perfect family and decides to quietly depart. Stuart feels Margalo may have been kidnapped and engages in a full-fledged bird hunt along with the self-serving household Cat, Snowball.I definitely enjoyed this movie, it was humorous, harmless, preached family togetherness.

But the movie is really really short, the storyline dumber than a Carrot Top Commercial, and Genna Davis very annoying.(WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) In the movie, she plays a mother who is over-protective of Stuart and wants to protect him at all costs, which leaves Stuart somewhat frustrated. Whenever Stuart gets into some kind of danger, she blatantly disregards the safety of her 2 year old baby girl to rush to the rescue of Stuart. I am ready to buy the premise of a talking mouse as a member of the family, but I don't think it excuses the things Genna Davis character exposes her newborn to. For example, when Stuart crashes George toy plane in Central Park, the whole family runs out of the house seeking for him. Where is the baby? We don't know... But the front door is left open and there is no nanny in the house.And at the end, when they are all in the back of a taxi cab rushing through traffic going backwards no less to find Stuart, the baby is in an unattached portable child seat held by Genna Davis.

But also to me the movie should of been a little more realistic like when The Falcon ramed into the plane it should of gotten a little more beat up or maybe even killed. Also I think Snowbell should have been a little more braver against the falcon, not just jump and get stuck in a paint can.

Based on the characters from the E.B. White novel, Stuart is a mouse who lives as part of the Little family. In this second movie, Stuart rescues a fallen bird, Margalo, and hopes she'll decide to stay with him and become his friend. What our poor hero doesn't know is that Margalo is on a secret mission and works for an evil falcon. Filled with action, humor, tenderness and a great soundtrack, this is a splendid movie for the entire family and not to be missed!

If you can't make a 'simple' film well, how do you expect to make a more 'ambitious, complex' one look good?The acting was generally cartoonish.. the script is simple, but executed well enough that in the end, it doesn't really matter.. it'll fall into the 'cute' catagory for many people, so for those of you who have a thing against cute, you're probably better off to stray elsewhere, but then, if you've seen the trailer or the first film, you already know that, or should..There are some general cartoon physics spread loosely throughout.. Live action cartoon, as I said before..Some good sayings within, even if a couple of them are quite common and often overused, they fit the context of the film..Now, the animation.. this is where the film is on high marks.. Stuart and the Falcon, the animation for these two characters are just wonderfully done.. I mean, watching either or on screen is worth the admission price alone.. the bird, however, is pretty good, but not nearly as the two aformentioned..Voice Talents; Micheal J. Fox as Stuart Little, I'm glad to see him working here and there, quite regularly.. with what he's gone through, he's an insperation to just keep going like he does, even when his voice appears in the less than grand adventure Atlantis (but then, he had the chance to be in Titan A.E., whom was replaced by Matt Damon, which I thought fit better).. he gives Stuart the necessary innocence and constantly looking to the stars approach, as he did in the first movie.. Nathan Lane as Snowball, great voice talent who was in Titan A.E. as well, giving the cat a sense of cowardice and complimenting the opposite of Stuart Little.. James Woods as Falcon, he's certainly got an interesting voice, and it plays out well here (unlike the cold 'doll-like faces' of Final Fantasy), his best role to date would still have to be Videodrome, even though he often brings something interesting to each part he takes on.. Melanie Griffith.. as the bird, Margalo, she does an adequite job here.. not really familiar with her work - though I have heard of her in the past.. There's also Steve Zahn, but his part is small, merely to return from the first film but also to add a couple moments to this one and guide our hero along to his destination..The actors, very cartoonish, including Geena Davis as the overprotective parent, and that Hugh guy as the father, a cartoon version of like the 'perfect' farther.. the son, Jonathon Lipnicki, played by the 'cute' kid from Jerry Maguire, who goes through his usual measures here as the brother branching out to new friends while leaving little Stuart behind.. as well as the friend, who is just there for the sake of taking care of a few plot points..What this film reminded me of was a weekly animated series.. except, this weekly animated series is taking years to produce a new episode, and costing a hell of a lot more.. but that's what kind of feeling/vibe I got from it..I enjoyed the film for what it is.. not great, but entertaining.. and I hope my sometimes awkward review helped on some level..also, a great little spoiler quote from the film..Giving up is fun, and look at all the time you save!

He is now completely settled into his lifestyle with the Little family, and has a great set up in the top bunk of his brother George's bed.  In a world where TV's are drive in movie's and a toy car is your ride to school, having a mouse for a brother seems cool.Although no one seems to notice or mind when they see a little red corvette with a well dressed mouse inside, zipping along the sidewalk along the streets of New York.  They don't even stand on chairs and screaming mouse! mouse! when they see Stuart enter into a room, as the most common comedic reaction is portrayed.But don't think that this movie doesn't have its own share of funny moments, the best one liners I've heard in a while are delivered by Snowball, the sarcastic family cat.  When Stuart's new friend Margalo (perfectly voiced by Melanie Griffith) goes missing, Stuart enlists in the help of Snowball to track down her whereabouts.  Snowball's declaration that his paint can dangling hundred's of feet over the city has just become a litter box, and other such comments help balance the constant cheeriness of the movie.The sickeningly sweet Little lifestyle, includes their own greetings Little hi, little low, little hey, little ho! and Mrs. Little's overdone attempts to get the newest edition of the family, Martha, to speak her first words.  This gets old very quickly but through a child's eyes, I suspect this would all be perfectly normal. Another element that would slide right over a youngster's head, is that it also makes obvious uses of the colours yellow and red through out the film. It is never more obvious during the film than the final scene.  When Stuart soars high above everyone's heads in his brother's model plane, everyone in the park below gawks, and runs to look.  Most the extra's in the scene are wearing red, while the Littles stand out perfectly in their bright sunny yellow.  How quaint.  I wonder if they were trying to bring out attention to the Little family?Desite these oversights, the movie is enjoyable, and probably even more so with a youngster along.  Although there is no specific underlying theme in the movie, there is a strong sense of family, and a taste of adventure as Stuart sets out to rescue Margalo - his first big adventure.  Children will love this installment because it has plenty of the things they love, slap stick antics, adventure, friendship and a basic plot line.  If you can overlook the Little's lifestyle, and the colour scheme throughout the movie, then you just might like this movie too.

You probably know what to expect. A two inch high mouse fully integrated into a loving family who accept his presence as readily as the anonymous New Yorkers between whose feet the little guy speeds in his toy car.  This time, the moviemakers focus almost entirely on the non-human characters. But the movie doesn't suffer for it, as the furry and feathery characters lead lives as complex and interesting as the humans (who still provide strong supporting roles).  The concept is outlandish, the moviemakers know it, and they're glad to let us laugh at the absurdity of it.  But while they do so they're still building important details into the movie.  An early scene where Stuart's mom graphically illustrates her squeamishness to the father about letting Stuart play soccer becomes important to a central theme of the movie later on.Stuart's challenge is a bit more mature this time, as he is forced to sift through his feelings on friendship and facing what look like insurmountable setbacks when a small yellow bird literally falls into his life.  All is not as it appears, however, as his new friend has ties to a con artist in the form of a falcon voiced menacingly by James Wood.  Michael J. Fox (again pitch perfect as the plucky mouse's voice) lends a voice to Stuart that leaves no doubt he will rise to whatever challenge he faces.  And Nathan Lane once again is the perfect voice for the more cynical of the two adopted Littles as Snowbell the cat.  The parents do wonderful jobs as well,  making clear within the same scene the dilemma of wanting to protect their tiny son while giving him room to grow.  Stuart's human brother behaves exactly as you'd expect a caring older brother to.  At times frustrated with the smaller sibling's needs and wanting his own space, but still willing to take risks for a little brother.The subject matter is more mature and at times borders on dark, but its still a wonderful story for children.  The movie is unafraid to put its characters in genuinely dangerous situations or tinge a scene with sadness. Yet in the end the movie is all about overcoming obstacles and finding the brighter side when things look gloomy, without ever resorting to cliches or preachiness.This movie is beautiful to look at.  Bright colors abound but never clash or overwhelm the action.  The effects and animation are good enough that I was never jarred out of my suspension of disbelief.  The scenes where Stuart takes to the sky in a sporty yellow biplane are a joy to watch for the freedom they embody (what child never dreamed of flying a toy plane through their home), yet remain an integral part of the movie. After a bit of retrospection, I'd say the sequel is better to me than the original.  The story is better this time, and its mastery of techniques both traditional and relatively new makes for an enjoyable experience.

Stuart's ways make children grin.  So yes, it is lovable and joyful. And yes, it is predictable but funny.  The digital-animation, a key to why I liked the movie, is cartoony but with a chance of possibility that birds and mice can live with humans.  Kids probably think that the creatures are real, because the cartoons they watch, but the computer animation makes a comfortable border between the real and animation.

But Stuart Little 2 was almost nothing like the first film. It was not as funny, there was enough sentimental trash to choke a small horse and there were just too many American values in it. The bird friend was just ridiculous and made you want to chuck your birdwatching binoculars away and buy a shotgun. Snowbell the cat was probably supposed to be the comic relief amidst all the sentimental mayhem but was a massive failure. The falcon just went into the same category as the friendly undersized budgie shotgun fodder. I felt sorry for my little brother who had to go through this rather unenjoyable pastiche. Things I learned from this movie -Falcons are nasty, vicious, bloodthirsty pickpockets -cats are afraid of having their house burgled by strange, undersized budgies -Sentimentality in films is like syrup. Thick and sticky -little spectacled brats(eg George Little)belong to some strange subspecies of overgrown garden gnomes with an affection for lab rats (eg Stuart Little).

As for the story, it was more of a kid's movie. I didn't find it too interesting. It's just too silly to see a couple referring to a mouse as their son.  It was cute when the little boy, George, gets his friend to tell a story about Stuart being at the friend's house. George's mom is looking for Stuart, and getting the run around from the friend because they don't know where Stuart is either.

Birds are tough to do in animation and they are done exceptionally well in this particular kids film.The story is the usual Stuart Little for those who might remember the stories from childhood.  Kids will like it and adult viewers who lack the excuse of taking the kids will not suffer too much for it.  In this story, Stuart Little finds himself a little lonely until a female canary falls out of the sky into his company complaining of an injured wing and a pursuing hawk.  Stuart is smitten, of course, but it turns out the canary's past has some unfortunate complications.The cast is just fantastic.  Nathan Hale shows up as the white Angora cat -- again -- reprising his role in Cats and Dogs.  There is also some excellent musical pieces that anyone should enjoy.  Best of all the animation is very nearly perfect.  The colors seem a little intense, but this is in character with the style of the book which is a very poised fantasy.

It is a good family movie too, perfect for kids that believe in mice that are suited for the real world, tackling real life issues. Now not that I would not be concerned at any child that thinks with such an imagination, but that's what the target audience is for. Margalo is a nice addition for the movie, not just acting through the motions. You soon forget that talking mice, cats and birds are not part of real life.Lonely Stuart feels the need for a friend suitable for his size. One literally falls from the sky right into the passenger seat of his car.You know, for a movie with a large supporting cast, everyone gets their due and fair share of dialogue and screen time. Nothing is wasted in a movie that is only 75 minutes long!

They live in an anachronistic single-family dwelling in the heart of New York City -- fixed in a time warp of an unknown, enchanting era.  The appliances and furnishings in their charmingly out-of-date dwelling are perfect for that time-out-of-space feeling that is necessary to appreciate this film.The entire score is perfectly suited to the action on screen -- always enhancing the story and the exploits that are occurring.Nathan Lane is back as the voice of Snowbell, the cat and a new addition is James Woods as the Falcon. Melanie Griffith is adequate as the little-bird-lost &#145;Margalo.'There are times in this version when Stuart looks somewhat more like a rodent than in the past -- not something that is particularly agreeable in a character that the audience is supposed to feel a connection to; however, the overall look of the computer generated image/puppet will evoke the warm fuzzies in most everyone.There is some adult humour and quite a bit of slapstick -- so this film should appeal to everyone in the audience.The chase scene between Falcon and Stewart when he is in his airplane is somewhat reminiscent of the Steve McQueen film `Bullitt' -- though, of course, on a much lighter level.This really is an enjoyable summer film -- pure escapism and a lot of fun.

It is a little predictable at times, but that's my only real complaint of this movie. Stuart makes friends with Margalo, voiced with real innocence by Melanie Griffith, and it is this that makes the film so charming. Little does he know she is in league with a falcon, voiced with seedy villainy by James Woods, very like Hades in Hercules. Michael J.Fox still delights as the voice of Stuart, but it is Nathan Lane as Snowbell who has the best lines, they were that funny. Other funny lines were those such as Flying in the House? as the look on Hugh Laurie's face was priceless. The film is sprinkled with lovely messages, that never preaches and kids take to them like a pinch of salt. The script is more subdued than its predecessor but still delivers as effectively. The chase scenes are memorable and never slow the film down. All in all, an exceedingly charming sequel, with an 8/10. Bethany Cox.

White. Basically adopted mouse Stuart (Michael J. Fox) has settled into the Little family very nicely, but mother Eleanor (Geena Davis) is very protective of him, seeing how he's very small, and his father Fredrick (Hugh Laurie) thinks he should be able to do things without worry or fuss. Oh, and Stuart's brother George (Jonathan Lipnicki) has made a new friend, Will (Marc John Jefferies), so he is feeling lonely. That is until he meets and rescues canary Margalo (Melanie Griffith) from a Falcon (James Woods), and she soon moves in, but no-one knows she is helping con-artist Falcon. But Margalo does obviously grow to like Stuart and the family for real, and its up to Stuart and Snowbell the cat (Nathan Lane) to save her. This may not have the same charm and wit of the previous film, but there is still some fun to be had. It was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Okay!

Well, `Stuart Little,' based on the good children's book by E.B. White, was unfortunately nothing good or great &#150; at all. M. Night Shyamalan, who brought us `The Sixth Sense' and `Signs,' surprisingly wrote it; needless to say `Stuart Little' was his worst film. Now, a few months back, in 2002, `Stuart Little 2' came out, and I caught it at a free theater. It deals with the continuation of the Little family and their `son' Stuart (a little white mouse), who is voiced by Michael J. Fox. Hugh Laurie plays Stuart's father, Gena Davis his mother, and a REALLY annoying kid plays his brother (he's whiny).Along with the voice cast is Nathan Lane as Snowbell the cat &#150; Stuart's nemesis-turned-friend from the first film &#150; Jennifer Tilly as a bird, and James Woods as a killer hawk.`Stuart Little 2' is better than the first mainly because it is more fun. However, it is still not a great film by any standards. First, I'll point out some things I didn't like about the firstNo one seems to think it is odd that Stuart is a mouse &#150; I know it's a children's film and it's supposed to be like that, but a BIT of credibility would have been nice.The whole thing with him being a mouse &#150; it was trying to give us a preachy message that looks don't count and what's on the inside does. This is true, but the film preaches it the whole way through and it gets old.Now, `II' carries a lot of those traits, but not as much. It is more of an adventure, not a sappy film with an underlying message. That is why I enjoyed it more.I think it's a bit sad that Michael J. Fox has not been in a single live-action film since his leave from `Spin City' (save a cameo in an independent film). I feel sorry for him because I have always enjoyed his performances &#150; he was perfect for `Back to the Future,' and he even made horrible films like `Teen Wolf' fun to watch. That is why I am sad that the only thing I can hear from him nowadays is his voice coming out of the mouth of a mouse. Not only that, but all the animated films he's been in are AWFUL (`Atlantis' was one of the worst of 2001).Nathan Lane is an enjoyable actor, and he fits Snowbell quite well. I think that he was definitely the perfect choice for the fluffy cat.And as for James Woods&#133;he was great. I have always enjoyed his performances in film as well, and seeing him as a hawk was a bit more than odd; but at the same time it was refreshingly fun.Overall, `Stuart Little 2' is better than the original; I'll give it 3/5 stars &#150;John Ulmer "}]
